                    applied by the early Christians to the places set apart for the burial of their
                    dead. These were generally extra-mural and unconnected with churches, the
                    practice of interment in churches or churchyards being unknown in the first
                    centuries of the Christian era. The term cemetery has, therefore, been <pb

                    burial grounds, generally extra-mural, which have been substituted for the
                    overcrowded churchyards of populous parishes both urban and rural.</p>
                <p>From 1840 to 1855, attention was repeatedly called to the condition of the London
                    churchyards by correspondence in the press and by the reports of Parliamentary
                    committees, the first of which, that of Mr Chadwick, appeared in 1843. The
                    vaults under the pavement of the churches, and the small spaces of open ground
                    surrounding them, were literally crammed with coffins. In many of the buildings
                    the air was so tainted with the products of corruption as to be a direct and
                    palpable source of disease and death to those who frequented them. In the
                    churchyards coffins were placed tier above tier in the graves until they were
                    within a few feet (or sometimes even a few inches) of the surface, and the level
                    of the ground was often raised to that of the lower windows of the church. To
                    make room for fresh interments the sextons had recourse to the surreptitious
                    removal of bones and partially-decayed remains, and in some cases the contents
                    of the graves were systematically transferred to pits adjacent to the site, the
                    grave-diggers appropriating the coffin-plates, handles, and nails to be sold as
                    waste metal. The daily papers of thirty years ago contain numerous records of
                    scandals of this kind; while from the official reports it appears that the
                    neighbourhood of the churchyards was always unhealthy, the air being vitiated by
                    the gaseous emanations from the graves, and the water, wherever it was obtained
                    from wells, containing organic matter, the source of which could not be
                    mistaken. The vaults of many of the London churches are still crowded with
                    coffins deposited in them during this period of intra-mural interments. In the
                    vault of Bow Church, Cheapside, the leaden coffins form a huge mass 30 feet
                    high, covered with fungi and cobwebs. In all the other large towns the evil
                    prevailed in a greater or less degree, but in London, on account of the immense
                    population and the consequent mortality, it forced itself more readily upon
                    public attention, and after more than one partial measure of relief had been
                    passed the churchyards were, with a few exceptions, finally closed by the Act of
                    1855, and the cemeteries which now occupy a large extent of ground to the north,
                    south, east, and west, became henceforth the burial places of the metropolis.
                    Several of them had been already established by private enterprize before the
                    passing of the Burial Act of 1855 (Kensal Green Cemetery dates from 1832), but
                    that enactment forms the epoch from which the general development of cemeteries
                    in Great Britain and Ireland began. Burial within the limits of cities and towns
                    is now almost everywhere abolished, and where it is still in use it is
                    surrounded by such safeguards as make it practically innocuous. At a large
                    expenditure of money London and most of our chief provincial cities and towns
                    have been provided with spacious and well-situated cemeteries, which are under
                    the supervision of the Local Burial Boards and of the inspectors appointed by
                    Government, and anything like a recurrence to the scandalous state of things
                    which existed as late as twenty-five years ago is now impossible.</p>
                <p>But though there need be no fear of retrogression there may be a change in
                    another direction. Our present system of burial has been made the subject of
                    very severe strictures on the part of Sir Henry Thompson and others, and it has
                    been proposed that we should abandon inhumation altogether and return to the
                    ancient practice of cremation. We shall not discuss this proposal here, as the
                    importance of the subject requires a separate treatment, but we must briefly
                    refer to the criticisms upon our cemeteries to which it gave rise. The practice
                    of burial has been very ably defended by Mr Holland, M.R.C.S., who as Medical
                    Inspector of Burials for England and Wales has perhaps a greater practical
                    knowledge of the subject than any other man living, and on the same side were
                    found Dr Richardson and Mr Seymour Haden, who proposed, however, some important
                    modifications of the system with a view to its improvement. Amongst the
                    objections urged against the present practice, it is alleged that in three ways
                    our cemeteries are a source of danger to the health of the living, viz. :—(1) by
                    the gases rising from the surface of the soil causing air-pollution <hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">(2)</hi> by their drainage introducing
                    noxious matter into wells used for drinking purposes; (3) by the possibility
                    that the reopening of ground in which persons who have died of an infectious
                    disease are interred might sometimes be the means of reproducing an epidemic.
                    Now there is really no evidence in support of these serious allegations; on the
                    contrary there is much concurrent testimony which tends to completely discredit
                    them. Of course it is not for a moment contended that cemeteries may not be
                    mismanaged so as to become a source of danger. But this is beside and beyond the
                    question, for in a matter of this kind we cannot argue from individual cases of
                    abuse against the general use, and under the existing system of inspection and
                    superintendence, with local authorities in every district specially charged with
                    the care of the public health, it is difficult to see how any dangerous case of
                    mismanagement could be allowed to develop itself without becoming the subject of
                    immediate investigation and reform. Only very ordinary precautions are required
                    to render a cemetery perfectly safe. “If,” says Mr Holland, “no more dead be
                    buried in the soil than the free oxygen contained in rain and dew carried
                    through it will decompose, and if such soil be left undisturbed until the
                    process of decay is completed, and if, as is almost certain to be the case, the
                    use of such ground for burial be discontinued at latest when it becomes full of
                    the remains that do not decay, and probably long before, such places will be
                    neither harmful while they are used for burial, nor anything but beneficial when
                    such use of them is discontinued, as then they will become large decorative
                    gardens or small parks—reservoirs of fresh air.” With regard to the alleged
                    peril from air-pollution, it may be replied that there can be no danger so long
                    as the dead are laid in a sufficient space of properly planted ground, and at a
                    moderate distance from any considerable number of houses, and for this purpose a
                    mile is quite sufficient. The gases evolved are to a great extent absorbed by
                    the vegetable produce of the soil, and what little does filter upwards and
                    escape from the surface of the ground cannot accumulate to any pernicious
                    extent, and must necessarily be dispersed and diluted in the air. Who ever
                    perceives any unpleasant odour in a well-kept cemetery l Yet if danger were
                    present the sense of smell would give unmistakable warning of it. As to the
                    question of water-pollution, especial care is always taken to study the drainage
                    of our cemeteries with reference to the neighbouring sources of water supply.
                    Shallow surface wells near a cemetery are open to suspicion, as the water may be
                    tainted by organic matter filtering through the soil, but suspected wells can le
                    closed by the authorities, and it must be remembered that shallow wells are
                    nearly always dangerous whether they are near cemeteries or not. Deep wells are
                    almost invariably safe even near a cemetery, and in most places the water is
                    brought from a distance in mains in such a way that pollution from cemeteries is
                    impossible. As to the danger of infection, if it existed anywhere, assuredly we
                    should have some practical evidence of it from the great cemeteries of the
                    metropolis. Yet there is not a particle of such evidence forthcoming. On the
                    contrary, it is now very generally conceded that there need be little if any <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n341/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0341-0330"/> fear of infection from a dead body. Undertakers
                    and their assistants who are continually at work among the dead are notoriously
                    free from contagious disease, and, <hi rend="italic">a fortiori,</hi> there· can
                    be no danger once the body is laid in the earth. It is only in very exceptional
                    cases that it can be disturbed until many years have elapsed, and then all cause
                    for apprehension is gone. Many of the plague-pits in the London churchyards have
                    been reopened in places where the plague-stricken dead once lay piled in layers,
                    and scarcely any human remains have been found, and these in such a condition
                    that it would be impossible to imagine any infection or contagion from them.</p>
                <p>The changes in our cemetery system which have been suggested by Mr Seymour Haden
                    and others have all the one common object of increasing the security of safety
                    to the public health, by facilitating and rendering perfect the decay of the
                    buried dead, and it is proposed to accomplish this less by the use of any direct
                    agency for accelerating the natural process, than by removing the obstacles that
                    are at present placed in its way. Mr Seymour Haden tells us that a well-made
                    wooden coffin is practically indestructible, and though it cannot prevent
                    decomposition, yet it arrests it, and keeps the process Jong incomplete, thus
                    considerably increasing the aggregate of decaying matter at any one time present
                    in a cemetery, and preventing the return of “earth to earth.” As a remedy he
                    proposes that we should use wicker coffins, of the present shape, made of white
                    or stained (but unvarnished) osiers, with large open meshes. The contents of
                    such a receptacle could be concealed during the funeral by a graceful covering
                    of ferns and flowers, and in cases of infectious disease, or where decomposition
                    might commence immediately after death, the coffin could be made double with a
                    space of two or three inches beween the inner and outer basket to bï filled with
                    charcoal or some other disinfectant. Models of such coffins were exhibited by Mr
                    Seymour Haden at Stafford House, London, the town residence of the duke
                    of'Sutherland in June 1875, and there is no doubt that if they were generally
                    employed, the natural process of decay in our cemeteries would take place in a
                    way that would leave even less room than at present for any evil resulting from
                    carelessness or mismanagement on the part of the authorities charged with their
                    superintendence, and the number of bodies actually decaying in any given
                    cemetery would be comparatively few, so surely and effectually would the process
                    be completed in a great majority of cases. The abandonment of the practice of
                    burial in vaults, brick graves, aud catacombs, such as those which are to be
                    seen in many of the London cemeteries, is of course a corollary of this
                    proposal; and whether Mr Seymour Haden’s plan is adopted or not, it is quite
                    certain that our cemeteries would be greatly improved by no more brick graves
                    being made in them, and by the open catacombs being closed wherever they exist.
                    Such places are very difficult to ventilate, and must frequently be the source
                    of malarious exhalations.</p>
                <p>Amongst other proposals which have been made it has been suggested, that when a
                    good natural soil containing carbon does not exist the site of the proposed
                    cemetery should be excavated to the depth of about 12 feet, and then filled up
                    with an artificial soil composed of carbon, lime, and sand. The existence of
                    carbon in the soil would remove any danger of water pollution through filtration
                    from the cemetery, while the lime would tend to accelerate the resolution of the
                    decaying matter into its original elements. This is Dr Richardson’s proposal,
                    and he further adds that the cemetery should be planted with quick-growing
                    shrubs and ornamental grasses, the trees being confined to an encircling belt of
                    wood, and a series of memorial tablets in an adjacent edifice being substituted
                    for tombstones and monuments. He further points out thatwith such a method the
                    cemetery might be renovated after a certain number of years by substituting
                    freshly-prepared soil for the old. But there does not seem to be any advantage
                    in this. There must always be open spaces in and around our cities for the sake
                    of fresh air, and a cemetery in which interments have ceased for some years, and
                    in which the ornamental plantations were kept in good order, would form a useful
                    park or garden. In the disposal of our dead feeling must always be allowed to be
                    a considerable factor in the arguments for the adoption of any given plan, and
                    it appears that in Great Britain and Ireland there would be an amount of dislike
                    to any method which did not assign to our dead something like a lasting place of
                    interment. This feeling does not by any means exist in some of the countries of
                    the Continent. In one of the cemeteries of Naples numerous burials take place in
                    a series of 365 pits. One pit is opened each day, the dead are laid in it, aud
                    it is filled with an earth containing a large quantity of lime. A year after the
                    pit is reopened, the earth with its contents, now almost entirely decayed, is
                    removed, fresh earth is placed in its stead, and the pit is again ready for new
                    interments.</p>
                <p>The chief cemeteries of London are Kensal Green Cemetery on the Harrow Road,
                    about 2½ miles from Paddington, which has an area of 18 acres and already
                    contains the remains of 70,000 dead; Highgate Cemetery, which occupies a
                    considerable portion of the slope of Highgate Hill, and commands one of the best
                    views of London; the cemetery at Abney Park (once the residence of Dr Watts),
                    which is adorned with very fine plantations of old growth; the Norwood and
                    Nunhead cemeteries to the south of London; the West London Cemetery at Brompton;
                    the cemeteries at Ilford and Leytonstone in Essex; the Victoria Cemetery and the
                    Tower Hamlets Cemetery in East London; and at a still greater distance, and
                    generally accessible only by railway, the great cemetery at Woking near
                    Guildford in Surrey, and the cemetery at Colney Hatch. The general plan of all
                    these cemeteries is the same, a park with broad paths either laid out in curved
                    lines as at Kensal Green and Highgate, or crossing each at right angles as in
                    the case of the West London Cemetery. The ground on each side of these paths is
                    marked off into grave spaces, and trees and shrubs are planted in the intervals
                    between them. The buildings consist of a curator’s residence and one or more
                    chapels, and usually there is also a range of catacombs, massive structures
                    containing in their corridors recesses for the reception of coffins, generally
                    closed only by an iron grating. The provincial cemeteries in the main features
                    of their arrangements resemble those of the metropolis. One of the most
                    remarkable is St James’s Cemetery at Liverpool, which occupies a deserted
                    quarry. The face of the eastern side of the quarry is traversed by ascending
                    gradients off which open catacombs <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n342/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0342-0331"/> formed in the living rock,—a soft sandstone; the
                    ground below is planted with trees, amongst which stand hundreds of gravestones.
                    The main approach on the north side is through a tunnel, above which, on a
                    projecting rock, stands the cemetery chapel, built in the form of a small Doric
                    temple with tetrastyle porticoes. Its situation, though very picturesque, is an
                    objectionable one, for no cemetery should ever be constructed in a deep hollow.
                    Many of the cities of America possess very fine cemeteries. One of the largest
                    is that of Mount Auburn near Boston, which occupies upwards of 110 acres of
                    undulating ground on the bank of the Charles River. It is formed out of an old
                    and well-wooded estate, and consequently, unlike most modern cemeteries, its
                    plantations consist of large well-grown trees.</p>
                <p>The chief cemetery of Paris is that of Père la Chaise, the prototype of the
                    garden cemeteries of Western Europe. It takes its name from the celebrated
                    confessor of Louis XIV., to whom as rector of the Jesuits of Paris it once
                    belonged. It was laid out as a cemetery in 1804. It has an area of about 200
                    acres, and contains 16,000 monuments, including those of all the great men of
                    France of the present century—marshals, generals, ministers, poets, painters,
                    men of science and letters, actors, and musicians. Twice the cemetery and the
                    adjacent heights have been the scene of a desperate struggle; in 1814 they were
                    stormed by a Russian column during the attack on Paris by the allies, and in
                    1871 the Communists made their last stand among the tombs of Père la Chaise; 900
                    of them fell in the defence of the cemetery or were shot there after its
                    capture, and 200 of them were buried in quicklime in one huge grave, and 700 in
                    another. There are other cemeteries at Mont Parnasse and Montmartre, besides the
                    minor burying-grounds at Auteuil, Batignolles, Passy, La Villette, &amp;c. In
                    consequence of all these cemeteries being more or less crowded, a great cemetery
                    was laid out in 1874 on the plateau of Mèry sur Oise, 16 miles to the north of
                    Paris, with which it is connected by a railway line. It includes within its
                    circuit fully two square miles of ground. The French cemetery system differs in
                    many respects from the English. Every city and town is required by law to
                    provide a burial-ground beyond its barriers, properly laid out and planted, and
                    situated if possible on a rising ground. Each interment must take place in a
                    separate grave. This, however, does not apply to Paris, where the dead are
                    buried, forty or fifty at a time, in the <hi rend="italic">fosses communes,</hi>
                    the poor being interred gratuitously, and a charge of 20 francs being made in
                    all other cases. The <hi rend="italic">fosse</hi> is filled and left undisturbed
                    for five years, then all crosses and other memorials are removed, the level of
                    the ground is raised 4 or 5 feet by fresh earth and interments begin again. For
                    a fee of 50 francs a <hi rend="italic">concession</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >temporaire</hi> for ten years can be obtained, but where it is desired to erect
                    a permanent monument the ground must be bought by the executors of the deceased.
                    In Paris the undertakers’ trade is the monopoly of a company, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Société des pompes funèbres,</hi> which in return for its
                    privileges is required to give a free burial to the poor.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Leichenhaüser,</hi> or dead-houses, of Frankfort and Munich
                    form a remarkable feature of the cemeteries of these cities. The object of their
                    founders was twofold,—(1) to obviate even the remotest danger of premature
                    interment, and (2) to offer a respectable place for the reception of the dead,
                    in order to remove the corpse from the confined dwellings of the survivors. At
                    Frankfort the dead-house (fig. 2) occupies one of the wings of the propylaeum.
                    which forms the main entrance to the cemetery. It consists of the warder’s room
                    B, where an attendant is always on duty, on each side of which there are five
                    rooms A, A, well ventilated, kept at an even temperature, and each provided with
                    a bier on which a corpse can be laid. On one of the fingers is placed a ring
                    connected by a light cord with a bell which hangs outside in the warder’s room.
                    The use of the dead-house is voluntary. The bodies deposited there are inspected
                    at regular intervals by a medical officer, and the warder is always on the watch
                    for the ringing of the warning belt One revival, that of a child, has taken
                    place at Frankfort. The Leichenhaus of Munich is situated in the southern
                    cemetery outside the Sendling Gate. At one end of the cemetery there is a
                    semi-circular building with an open colonnade in front and a projection behind,
                    which contains three large rooms for the reception of the dead. At both
                    Frankfort and Munich great care is taken that the attendants receive the dead
                    confided to them with respect, and no interment is permitted until the first
                    signs of decomposition appear; the relatives then assemble in one of the halls
                    adjoining the Leichenhaus, and the funeral takes place. In any case there is,
                    with ordinary care, little fear of premature interment, but in another way such
                    places of deposit for the dead are of great use in large towns, as they prevent
                    the evil effects which result from the prolonged retention of the dead among the
                    living. Mortuaries for this purpose are now established in many places in
                    England.</p>
                <p>Of the cemeteries still in use in Southern Europe the catacombs of Sicily are the
                    most curious. There is one of these under the old Capuchin monastery of Ziza
                    near Palermo, where in four large airy subterranean corridors 2000 corpses are
                    ranged in niches in the wall, many of them shrunk up into the most grotesque
                    attitudes, or hanging with pendent limbs and head from their places. As a
                    preparation for the niche, the body is desiccated in a kind of oven, and then
                    dressed as in life and raised into its place in the wall. At the end of the
                    principal corridor at Ziza there is an altar strangely ornamented with a kind of
                    mosaic of human skulls and bones.</p>
                <p>Cemeteries have been in use among many Eastern nations from time immemorial. In
                    China, the high grounds near Canton and Macao are crowded with tombs, many of
                    them being in the form of small tumuli, with a low encircling wall, forcibly
                    recalling the ringed barrows of Western Europe. But the most picturesque
                    cemeteries in the world are those of the Turks. From them it was, perhaps, that
                    the first idea of the modern cemetery, with its ornamental plantations, was
                    derived. Around Constantinople the cemeteries form vast tracts of cypress woods,
                    under whose branches stand thousands of tombstones. A grave is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n343/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0343-0332"/> never reopened; a new resting-place is formed for
                    every one, and so the dead now occupy a wider territory than that which is
                    covered by the homes of the living. The Turks believe that till the body is
                    buried the soul is in a state of discomfort, and the funeral, therefore, takes
                    place as soon as possible after death. No coffin is used, the body is laid in
                    the grave, a few boards are arranged round it, and then the earth is shovelled
                    in, care being taken to leave a small opening extending from the head of the
                    corpse to the surface of the ground, an opening not unfrequently enlarged by
                    dogs and other beasts which plunder the grave. A tombstone of white marble is
                    then erected, surmounted by a carved turban in the case of a man, and ornamented
                    by a palm branch in low relief if the grave is that of a woman. The turban by
                    its varying form indicates not only the rank of the sleeper below, but also the
                    period of his death, for the fashion of the Turkish head-dress is always
                    changing. A cypress is usually planted beside the grave, its odour being
                    supposed to neutralize any noxious exhalations from the ground, and thus every
                    cemetery is a forest, where by day hundreds of turtle doves are on the wing or
                    perching on the trees, and where bats and owls swarm undisturbed at night.
                    Especially for the Turkish women the cemeteries are a favourite resort, and some
                    of them are always to be seen praying beside the narrow openings that lead down
                    into a parent’s, a husband’s, or a brother’s grave. Some of the other cemeteries
                    of Constantinople contrast rather unfavourably with the simple dignity of those
                    which belong to the Turks. That of the Armenians abounds with bas-reliefs which
                    show the manner of the death of whoever is buried below, and on these singular
                    tombstones there are frequent representations of men being decapitated or
                    hanging on the gallows.</p>
