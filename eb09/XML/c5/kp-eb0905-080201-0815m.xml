                    estuary of the Shannon, S.E. and N.E. by Limerick, Tipperary, Lough Dearg, and
                    Galway, having an area of 1293 square miles, or 827,994 acres.</p>
                <p>Although the surface of the county is hilly, and in some parts even mountainous,
                    it nowhere rises to a great elevation. Much of the western baronies of Moyarta
                    and Ibrickan is composed of bog land. Bogs are frequent also in the mountainous
                    districts elsewhere, except in the limestone barony of Burren, the inhabitants
                    of some parts of which supply themselves with turf from the opposite shores of
                    Connemara. Generally speaking, the eastern parts of the county are mountainous,
                    with tracts of rich pasture land interspersed; the west abounds with bog; and
                    the north is rocky and best adapted for grazing sheep. In the southern part,
                    along the banks of the Fergus and Shannon, are the bands of rich low grounds
                    called corcasses, of various breadth, indenting the land in a great variety of
                    shapes. They are composed of deep rich loam, and are distinguished as the black
                    corcasses, adapted for tillage, and the blue, used more advantageously as meadow
                    land.</p>
                <p>The coast is in general rocky, and occasionally bold and precipitous in the
                    extreme, as may be observed at the picturesque cliffs of Moher within a few
                    miles of Ennistymon and Lisdoonvarna, which rise perpendicularly at O’Brien’s
                    tower to an elevation of 580 feet. The coast of Clare is indented with several
                    bays, the chief of which are Ballyvaghan, Liscannor, and Malbay; but from Black
                    Head to Loop Head, that is, along the entire western boundary of the county
                    formed by the Atlantic, there is no safe harbour except Liscannor Bay. The
                    county possesses only one large river, the Fergus; but nearly 100 miles of its
                    boundary-line are washed by the River Shannon, which, after almost dividing
                    Ireland from north to south, and dispensing its bounties to the adjoining
                    counties of Roscommon, Leitrim, Longford, Westmeath, Galway, King’s County,
                    Kerry, Tipperary, and Limerick, enters the Atlantic Ocean between this county
                    and Kerry. The numerous bays and creeks on both sides of this noble river render
                    its navigation safe in every wind; but the passage to and from Limerick is often
                    tedious, and the port of KiΓrush has from that cause gained in importance. The
                    River Fergus is navigable from the Shannon to the town of Clare, which is the
                    terminating point of its natural navigation, and the port of all the central
                    districts of the county. A railway traverses Clare county <hi rend="italic"
                    >via</hi> Ennis, connecting Limerick with Athenry and Galway.</p>
                <p>There are upwards of one hundred lakes and tarns in the county, of which the
                    largest are Loughs O’Grady, Graneg, Tedane, Inchiquin, Inniscronan, and Clonlea;
                    but they are more remarkable for picturesque beauty than size or utility, with
                    the exception of the extensive and navigable Lough Derg, formed by the River
                    Shannon between this county and Tipperary.</p>
                <p>Although metals and minerals have been found in many places throughout the
                    county, they do not often show themselves in sufficient abundance to induce the
                    application of capital for their extraction. The principal metals are lead,
                    iron, and manganese. Lead mines were recently worked at Kilbricken in the barony
                    of Bunratty (about six miles from Ennis), and at Annaglough. The Milltown lead
                    mine in the barony of Tulia is probably one of the oldest mines in Ireland, and
                    at one time, if the extent of the ancient excavations may be taken as a guide,
                    there must have been a very rich deposit. The richest lead mine worked in recent
                    times is that of Ballyhickey, about two miles from Kilbricken. Copper pyrites
                    occurs in several parts of Burren, but in small quantity. Coal exists at
                    Labasheeda on the right bank of the Shannon, but the seams are thin. Limestone
                    occupies all the central and northern parts of the county in a tract bounded on
                    the S. by the Shannon, on the E. by a line running parallel with the Ougarnee
                    River to Scariff Bay, on the N. by the mountain of Talla and the confines of
                    Galway, on the W. by Galway Bay and aline including Kilfenora, Corofin, and
                    Ennis, and meeting the Shannon at the mouth of the Fergus. Within half a mile of
                    the Μ ill town lead mine are immense natural vaulted passages of limestone,
                    through which the River Ardsullas winds a singular course. The lower limestone
                    of the eastern portion of the county has been found to contain several very
                    large deposits of argentiferous galena. Flags, easily quarried, are procured
                    near Kilrush, and thinner flags near Ennistymon. Slates are quarried in several
                    places, the best being those of Broadford and Killaloe, which are nearly equal
                    to the finest procured in Wales. A species of very fine black marble is obtained
                    near Ennis; it takes a high polish, and is free from the white spots with which
                    the black Kilkenny marble is marked.</p>
                <p>The mineral springs, which are found in many places, are chiefly chalybeate. That
                    of Lisdoonvarna, about eight miles from Ennistymon, has long been celebrated for
                    its medicinal qualities. There are chalybeate springs of less note at Scool,
                    Colneen, Käkishen, Burren, Kilcoran, Broadford, Lahinch, Kilkee, Kilrush,
                    Killadysart, and Cas· sino, near Miltown Malbay. Springs called by the people
                    “holy” or “blessed” wells, generally mineral waters, are common; but the belief
                    in their power of performing cures in inveterate maladies is nearly extinct.</p>
                <p>The Atlantic Ocean and the estuary of the Shannon afford many situations
                    admirably adapted for summer bathing-places. Among the best frequented of these
                    localities are Burren, Miltown Malbay, with one of the best beaches on the
                    western coast, Lahinch, about two miles from Ennistymon, and near the
                    interesting cliffs of Moher, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n816/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0816-0803"/> which has a magnificent beach, on Liscannor Bay,
                    and forms a delightful summer residence, Kilkee, perhaps the most fashionable
                    watering-place on the western coast of Ireland, and Kilrush on the Shannon
                    estuary.</p>
                <p>The soil and surface of the county is in general better adapted for grazing than
                    for tillage. Agriculture is in a backward state, there not being a fifth part of
                    its area under cultivation. In 1870 the acreage of the county under crops
                    amounted to 147,662 acres, and in 1875 little advance had been made. The number
                    of acres under the principal crops in these two years stood as follows :—</p>

                <p>As regards the property in the county, the land in 1874 was divided among 1025
                    separate owners, of whom 243 possessed less than one acre, and 782 one acre and
                    upwards. Twelve proprietors owned more than 10,000 acres each, the most
                    extensive demesnes being in the hands of Lord Leconfield, with 37,292 acres; the
                    marquis of Conyngham, with 27,613; E. P. Westby, 25,779; Lord Inchiquin, 20,321;
                    Colonel Vandeleur, 19,790; and the Hon. C. W. White, 18,266. The value of the
                    land was at the same date rated at an average of 8s. 3d. per acre, while that of
                    all Munster was 11s. 2d.</p>
                <p>There are no extensive manufactures in the county of Clare, although flannels and
                    friezes are made for home use, and hosiery of various kinds, chiefly coarse and
                    strong, is made around Corofin, Ennistymon, and other places. The Shannon, west
                    of Scattery Island, and the sea along the coasts, are good fishing stations,
                    abounding with cod, haddock, ling, sole, turbot, ray, mackerel, and other fish,
                    but the rugged nature of the coast and the tempestuous sea greatly hinder the
                    operations of the fishermen. Near Pooldoody is the great Burren oyster bed
                    called the Red Bank, where a large establishment is maintained, and from which a
                    constant supply of the excellent Red Bank oysters is furnished to the Dublin and
                    other large markets. Crabs and lobsters are caught on the shores of the Bay of
                    Galway in every creek from Blackhead to Ardfry. The salmon fishery of the
                    Shannon is very considerable, and eels, which abound in every rivulet, form an
                    important article of consumption.</p>
                <p>The population of the county shows a remarkable decrease within the 30 years
                    between 1841 and 1871, although, after all, this is exceeded by the neighbouring
                    counties of Cork, Limerick, and Tipperary. In 1841 the inhabitants numbered
                    286,394; in 1851, 212,440; in 1861, 166,305; and in 1871, 147,864. Of these
                    144,440 were Roman Catholics, 8027 Episcopalians, 220 Presbyterians, and 177 of
                    other denominations. In 1874 there were 8709 persons who had obtained parochial
                    relief throughout the year, while during the twenty-four years ending 1875 there
                    had emigrated from the county 90,154 persons. At the date of the last census
                    (1871) 64,566 persons could read and write, and 15,972 could read but could not
                    write; and 4432 were returned as speaking Erse only. There were 12 superior and
                    253 primary schools in the county. The principal towns in Clare are Ennis,
                    population (1871) 6503; Kilrush, 4424; and Kilkee, 1600. The county returns
                    three members to the Imperial</p>
                <p>Parliament,—two for the county and one for the borough of Ennis.</p>
                <p>The county of Clare, which is divided into 11 baronies, contains 80 parishes, and
                    includes the diocese of Kilfenora, the greater part of Killaloe, and a very
                    small portion of the diocese of Limerick. It is within the military district of
                    Cork, with barracks for infantry at Clare Castle, Ennis, Killaloe, and Kilrush,
                    and for artillery in the forts at Scattery Island, Donnaha, Kilcredano,
                    Blackwater, and Kilkerrin. The assizes are held at Ennis, where the county
                    prison, the county infirmary, and the district lunatic asylum are situated.
                    There are eight poor-law unions.</p>
                <p>This county, together with some of the neighbouring district, was anciently
                    called Thomond or Tuadmuin, that is, North Munster, and formed part of the
                    monarchy of the celebrated Brian Boroihme, who held his court at Kincora near
                    Killaloe, where his palace was situated on the banks of the Shannon. The site is
                    still distinguished by extensive earthern ramparts. Settlements were effected by
                    the Danes, and in the 13th century by the Anglo-Normans, but without permanently
                    affecting the possession of the district by its native proprietors. In 1543
                    Murrogh O’Brien, after dispossessing his nephew, and vainly attempting a
                    rebellion against the English rule, proceeded to England, and submitted to Henry
                    VIII., resigning his name and possessions. He soon received them back by an
                    English tenure, together with the title of earl of Thomond, on condition of
                    adopting the English dress, manners, and customs, and maintaining no kerns or
                    gallowglasses. In 1565 this part of Thomond (sometimes called O’Brien’s country)
                    was added to Connaught, and made one of the six new counties into which that
                    province was divided by Sir Henry Sidney under the Act 11 Eliz. c. 9. It was
                    then named Clare, probably from the name of an English adventurer, Thomas de
                    Clare, who obtained a grant from Henry III. of all the lands he should conquer
                    from the Irish, and whose family for some time maintained a precarious position
                    in the district. In 1602 the county was re-annexed to Munster. The O’Briens and
                    other native chieftains had many fierce contests to preserve their independence
                    against the Anglo-Norman and English adventurers, and generally succeeded in
                    maintaining their position as native kings and chieftains of Thomond. From some
                    cause or other the comparative immunity of Clare in ancient times from foreign
                    rule and settlement, and from absenteeism, has proved of doubtful advantage to
                    its modern condition. The chief ancient families of note in the district were
                    the O’Briens, now represented by Lord Inchiquin of Dromoland, the Macnamaras,
                    and the O’Loghlens.</p>
                <p>The county abounds with remains of antiquities, both military and ecclesiastical.
                    There still exist above a hundred fortified castles, several of which are
                    inhabited. They are mostly of small extent, a large portion being fortified
                    dwellings. The chief of them is Bunvatty Castle, built in 1277. Raths or Danish
                    forts are to be found in every part. They are generally circular, composed
                    either of large stones without mortar, or of earth thrown up and surrounded by
                    one or more ditches. The list of abbeys and other religious houses formerly
                    flourishing here (some now only known by name, but many of them surviving in
                    ruins) comprehends upwards of twenty. The most remarkable are •—Quin, considered
                    one of the finest and most perfect specimens of ancient monastic architecture in
                    Ireland; Corcomroe; Ennis, in which is a very fine window of uncommonly elegant
                    workmanship; and those on Inniscattery, or Scattery Island, in the Shannon, said
                    to have been founded by St Senanus. On the same island there is a round tower,
                    and also the ruins of what are called the seven churches. It is called Holy
                    Island, and is still one of the most popular burial-places in the county. Four

                    preservation— at I)rumcliffe, Dysert, Kilnby, aud Inniscaltra. The cathedral of
                    the diocese of Killaloe, at the town of that name, is a plain massive building
                    originally erected in 1160; aud uear it are the ruins of the mausoleum of Brian
                    Boroihme. Cromlechs are found, chiefly in the limestone rocky district of
                    Burren, though there are some in other baronies. That at Ballygannor is formed
                    of a stone 40 feet long and 10 broad. The celebrated tomb of Conan, on Mount
                    Callan, is still extant.</p>
