                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Burleigh</hi></label> (1520- 1598), an English statesman,
                    born in 1520, was the son of Richard Cecil, Master of the Robes to Henry VIII.
                    After distinguishing himself at Cambridge, he entered Gray’s Inn at twenty-one,
                    and soon after obtained the reversion of the office of <hi rend="italic">custos
                    brevium</hi> at the Court of Common Pleas. He increased his political influence
                    by marriage, first with the sister of Sir John Cheke, and then with the daughter
                    of Sir Anthony Cook; and, at length, through friendship with the protector,
                    Somerset, he became Secretary of State in 1548. After sharing the imprisonment
                    of Somerset, his prudence and sagacity enabled him to regain his office under
                    Northumberland. Yet, when Edward died, he contrived to escape the danger which
                    threatened him on every side. He signed the instrument making over the crown to
                    Lady Jane Grey, but only as a witness; and he kept clear of religious
                    difficulties by displaying no dislike to Catholicism. Indeed it is probable that
                    he really felt little or none. He confessed, attended mass, took a priest into
                    his house; he escorted Cardinal Pole from Brussels, and cultivated his
                    friendship. And, though he opposed the court party in parliament, and thus kept
                    up his connection with his old friends, his opposition was so moderate as to be
                    perfectly safe. He maintained a constant correspondence with the Princess
                    Elizabeth, and on the death of her sister at once prepared a proclamation
                    declaring her queen. He was immediately appointed Secretary of State, and member
                    of the Privy Council; and from this time he was the foremost minister of the
                    Crown. Foreign ambassadors often regarded him as the possessor of unbounded
                    power, and as practically head of the Government and ruler of the queen, but, in
                    fact, his influence was not so supreme, nor his favour with Elizabeth so
                    uniform. No man, indeed, could always guide that strong-willed monarch; and
                    Cecil had no ambition to be a mere favourite and tool. Though not an enthusiast,
                    and though he never fought for a hopeless cause, he had far nobler aims than
                    personal advancement. Though his statesmanship lay not so much in a power of
                    deep and rapid insight as in the possession of a mind patient to take account of
                    the minutest points, and able to weigh all considerations impartially, he was
                    capable of independent thought and firm decision, and his plans often conflicted
                    with the inconstant intrigues of the queen. On such occasions he did not shrink
                    from telling her that she was wrong; he rebuked her stinginess and treachery,
                    and he several times braved her passionate resentment. From her accession he was
                    Secretary of State, and from 1572 he was Lord High Treasurer; but his services
                    brought him pecuniary loss, and he received no honours but the Mastership of the
                    Court of Wards, the order of the Garter, and the barony conferred upon him in
                    1571, after thirteen years of service. He was absolutely incorruptible. He
                    refused to use or to sell the office of Royal Exchanger, though it would have
                    brought him several hundred thousand pounds. Mendoza in vain tried to bribe him;
                    to Catherine of Medici’s splendid offers he replied that he served none but his
                    God, his mistress, and his country; and he refused to share in the gold of which
                    Drake had robbed the Spaniards. Into the deeper passions of his time he did not
                    enter, It is true that as his life advanced he grew more and more attached to
                    the Protestant cause. He saw that his country had identified herself with that
                    cause, and he was, besides, firmly opposed on political grounds to the
                    pretensions of the Papacy. He appears, however, to have had no special devotion
                    to any form of doctrine; and he opposed the persecution of loyal Puritans and of
                    loyal Catholics. When, indeed, either Catholic or Puritan became disloyal or
                    otherwise dangerous he lost all compunction. He hated and persecuted the Jesuits
                    because they placed the Pope above the laws, but he twice took the trouble to
                    explain to the world that this was the sole reason. He was affected with no
                    inconvenient weakness of sympathy; he could ruthlessly crush any one who seemed
                    dangerous to the state. Essentially honest as he was, he scrupled at no
                    espionage or treachery to gain the secrets of his enemies. His emissaries were
                    everywhere. He kept Herle in the Marshalsea, examined him before the council,
                    and threatened him with torture that the Catholic prisoners might believe him to
                    be a martyr to their cause, and might intrust him with their plans; and he made
                    Bishop Parker appear in the guise of the Catholic Dr Story to take the
                    confessions of a prisoner whom torture could not move. When his policy was
                    opposed to Spain he did not scruple to get up demonstrations against the Spanish
                    ambassador, and to cast into prison all the Spanish merchants in London. Plots
                    against his own life never deprived him of his calmness; he watched De Quadra’s
                    conspirators quietly, day after day, though every day he knew they might attempt
                    to murder him, and let them alone till he had gained all the information to be
                    got. Day after day Norfolk and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n295/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0295-0284"/> Arundel came to the council intending to arrest
                    him; and day after day his cool sagacity defeated them. Yet when occasion
                    required he knew how to act with prompt and vigorous decision. He was always
                    struggling against the queen’s variability. Being eager that she should marry,
                    he urged her again and again to decide at once; and a paper is extant which he
                    presented to the queen when the last marriage proposal was finally cast aside.
                    In it he sketches a great and able policy. Preparations were to be made for war
                    by land and sea; honours and wealth were to be applied to attach the hearts of
                    the foremost men of the nation, and no longer wasted on useless favourites;
                    Ireland was to be ruled with attentive care and in a conciliatory spirit; and,
                    lastly, there was to be a grand alliance of all Protestants—of England, Sweden,
                    Denmark, Scotland, and the Protestants in Germany, France, and Flanders. With
                    regard to the Queen of Scots he pressed for the most vigorous action. Undeterred
                    by the anger which Elizabeth showed in striking his name from the list of
                    lords-lieutenant, he appeared at Mary’s trial to meet her denial of the charges
                    made against her with a stern contradiction. When, at last, Elizabeth signed the
                    warrant, he ventured to oppose her express wish by calling the council to his
                    own house to discuss the matter; and he dared to intercede for Davison when, in
                    a torrent of passion, she sent him to the Tower. The result was that he was
                    fiercely ordered out of her presence, and for two months the queen refused to
                    see him.</p>
                <p>In the industry of the country Cecil took the greatest interest. He entertained
                    the serious apprehensions which were commonly felt on account of the increase of
                    importation, the exportation of gold, and the falling off of agriculture; and he
                    protested against the growing use of wine, silk, and other foreign commodities.
                    To make up for the loss to the shipping which the downfall of Catholicism had
                    caused by diminishing the demand for fish, he obtained the passing of a curious
                    law which made the eating of flesh on Friday and Saturday, and on Wednesday
                    unless fish dishes were also placed on the table, a misdemeanour. In short,
                    Cecil devoted himself to the service of his country with the most painstaking
                    and disinterested laboriousness. From the peculiarity of his method of working
                    we have more complete information concerning the details of his career than is
                    usually the case with statesmen; for it was his practice not only to draw up
                    papers of advice to the queen, but also before deciding on any question to set
                    out on paper all the considerations on both sides; and many of these documents,
                    together with many of the letters which he either received or wrote, can still
                    be consulted (see <hi rend="italic">Scrinia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ceciliana,</hi> 1663, the state papers published in 1740 and 1759, and Tytler’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Ancient Letters,</hi> 1839). Cecil died in office in August
                    1598.</p>

                    (1581 and 1583; Latin version, 1584). The latter is a defence of the queen’s
                    commissioners appointed to examine Papists, with special reference to the use of
                    torture, and a declaration that purely religious belief was never the cause of
                    punishment. An interesting paper of advice to the Queen (1583) is to be found in
