                    (1760-1846), was born on the 28th March 1760, at Wisbeach, in Cambridgeshire,
                    where his father was head-master of the free grammar school. He was educated at
                    St Paul’s School and at St John’s College, Cambridge. Having taken the first
                    place among the middle bachelors as Latin essayist, he succeeded in 1785 in
                    gaining a similar honour among the senior bachelors. The subject appointed by
                    the vice-chancellor, Dr Peckhard, was one in which he was himself deeply
                    interested— <hi rend="italic">Anne</hi><hi rend="italic">liceat invitos</hi><hi

                    ì</hi> (Is it right to make men slaves against their will?) In preparing for
                    this essay Clarkson consulted a number of works on African slavery, of which the
                    chief was Benezet’s <hi rend="italic">Historical Survey of New Guinea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and the atrocities of which he read affected him so deeply
                    that he determined to devote all his energies to effect the abolition of the
                    slave trade, and gave up his intention of entering the church. His first measure
                    was to publish, with additions, an English translation of his prizeessay (June
                    1786). He then commenced to search in all quarters for information concerning
                    slavery. He soon discovered that the cause had already been taken up to some
                    extent by others, most of whom belonged to the Society of Friends, and among the
                    chief of whom were William Dillwyn, Joseph Wood, and Granville Sharp. With the
                    aid of these gentlemen, a committee of twelve was formed in May 1787 to do all
                    that was possible to effect the abolition of the slave trade. Meanwhile Clarkson
                    had also gained the sympathy of Wilberforce, Whitbread, Sturge, and several
                    other men of influence. Travelling from port to port, he now commenced to
                    collect a large mass of evidence; and much of it was embodied in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Summary View of the Slave Trade, and the Probable Consequences of
                    its Abolition,</hi> which, with a number of other anti-slavery tracts, was
                    published by the committee. Pitt, Grenville, Fox, and Burke looked favourably on
                    the movement; in May 1788 Pitt introduced a parliamentary discussion on the
                    subject, and Sir W. Dolben brought forward a bill providing that the number of
                    slaves carried in a vessel should be proportional to its tonnage. A number of
                    Liverpool and Bristol merchants obtained permission from the House to be heard
                    by council against the bill, but on the 18th June it passed the Commons. Soon
                    after Clarkson published an <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Impolicy of the Slave
                    Trade;</hi> and for two months he was continuously engaged in travelling that he
                    might meet men who were personally acquainted with the facts of the trade. From
                    their lips he collected a considerable amount of evidence; but only nine could
                    be prevailed upon to promise to appear before the privy council. Meanwhile other
                    witnesses had been obtained by Wilberforce and the committee, and on the 12th
                    May 1789 the former led a debate on the subject in the House of Commons, in
                    which he was seconded by Burke and supported by Pitt and Fox. It was now the
                    beginning of the French Revolution, and in the hope that he might arouse the
                    French to sweep away slavery with other abuses, Clarkson crossed to Paris, where
                    he remained six months. He found Necker head of the Government, and obtained
                    from him some sympathy but little help. Mirabeau, however, with his assistance,
                    prepared a speech against slavery, to be delivered before the National Assembly,
                    and the Marquis de la Fayette entered enthusiastically into his views. During
                    this visit Clarkson also met a deputation of negroes from St Domingo, who had
                    come to France to present a petition to the National Assembly, desiring to be
                    placed on an equal footing with the whites; but the storm of the Revolution
                    permitted no substantial success to be achieved. Soon after his return home he
                    engaged in a search, the apparent hopelessness of which finely displays his
                    unshrinking laboriousness and his passionate enthusiasm. He desired to find some
                    one who had himself witnessed the capture of the negroes in Africa; and a friend
                    having met by chance a man-of-war’s-man who had done so, Clarkson, though
                    ignorant both of the name and of the residence of the sailor, at once set out in
                    search of him, and after many disappointments actually discovered him. His last
                    tour was undertaken in order to form anti-slavery committees in all the
                    principal towns. At length, in the autumn of 1794, his health, which had long
                    been impaired by his uninterrupted exertions, gave way, and he was obliged to
                    cease active work. He did not, however, entirely give up the cause. At the
                    suggestion of Wilberforce and others, he occupied his time in writing a <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Abolition of the Slave Trade,</hi> which appeared
                    in 1808. In 1818 he had an interview at Paris with the emperor of Russia, to
                    whom he presented an address against the negro slave trade. He again visited the
                    emperor during the conference of the European monarchs which was held at
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, and, through him, the address was also presented to the emperor
                    of Austria and the king of Prussia. In 1823, the slave trade having been
                    abolished in 1807, the Anti-Slavery Society was formed, and Clarkson was one of
                    its vice-presidents. He was for some time blind from cataract; but several years
                    before his death his sight was restored. He died at the age of eighty-six, at
                    his patrimonial house, Playford Hall, Suffolk.</p>
