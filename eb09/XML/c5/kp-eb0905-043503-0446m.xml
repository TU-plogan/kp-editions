                    career of arms towards 1443, and devoted himself to the service of that prince,

                    verse, published by him in 1455, had nearly compromised his safety, as it was
                    held to contain reflections injurious to the honour of the king and nobility of
                    F rance; Chastelain, however, extricated himself from the difficulty by issuing
                    a sort of reply (in prose) to his own libel. About this time, too, at the
                    request of Philip, he began his most important work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grande Chronique.</hi> Philip’s son, Charles the Bold, continued to confide in
                    and favour Chastelain as his father had done, and conferred on him the order of
                    the Golden Fleece, with the title of <hi rend="italic">Indiciaire—</hi> a
                    designation intended as descriptive of one who “démonstroit par escripture
                    authentique lee admirables gestes des chevaliers et confrères de l’ordre.” At
                    the beginning of the new reign, however, Chastelain retired to Valenciennes,
                    where he busied himself till his death in the production of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronique</hi> (in which he was assisted by Jean Molinet, his
                    disciple and continuator) and of other works, imaginative aud historical.</p>
                <p>Among his contemporaries, Georges Chastelain acquired by his verses the style and
                    title of a second Homer; but posterity, in relegating his poetry to eternal
                    oblivion, has been careful of his memory. As an historian, Chastelain is
                    deserving of more attention. He was a soldier and traveller, who had yet been
                    trained to letters, the favourite of a splendid prince, and personally
                    acquainted with most of the actors in the great scenes which his position
                    enabled him to study on the very theatre of their action. His method of writing
                    history, to judge by a declaration of his own yet extant, was not such as would
                    have occurred to the mere compiler or writer from dictation. The vast mass of
                    material collected during his long and busy life was intended to be fused and
                    shaped as his own conclusions, his own great experience of men and years, should
                    determine, and not altogether according to the requirements of party and feudal
                    feeling. Impartiality, however, must not be considered one of his virtues. A
                    brilliant satirist, and at the same time, a master of eulogy, it was his
                    interest to use all his gift in his master’s service, and he did so use it.</p>
                <p>Only three fragments of the <hi rend="italic">Chronique,</hi> which was to have
                    filled six volumes, in folio are known to exist—the first extending from 1419 to
                    1422, and the second, withlarge breaks in the text, from 14G1 to 1474. A third
                    mutilated fragment is understood to refer to the period uncovered by the larger
                    chapters, but it neither tells a connected story nor fills the great gap between
                    the other two</p>
