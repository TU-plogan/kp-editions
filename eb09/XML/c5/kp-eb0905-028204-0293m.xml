                    mediaeval encyclopaedist and poet,—Cecco being the diminutive of Francesco, and
                    Ascoli, in the marshes of Ancona, the place of the philosopher’s birth. He
                    devoted himself to the study of mathematics and astrology, and in 1322 was made
                    professor of the latter science at the university of Bologna. It is alleged that
                    he entered the service of Pope John XXII. at Avignon, and that he cultivated the
                    acquaint* ance of Dante Alighieri, only to quarrel with the great poet
                    afterwards; but of this there is no evidence. It is certain, however, that,
                    having published a commentary on the sphere of John de Sacrobosco, in which he
                    propounded audacious theories concerning the employment and agency of demons, he
                    got into difficulties with the clerical party, and was condemned in 1324 to
                    certain fasts and prayers, and to the payment of a fine of seventy crowns. To
                    elude this sentence he betook himself to Florence, where he was attached to the
                    household of Carlo di Calabria. But his freethinking and plain-speaking had got
                    him many enemies; he had attacked the <hi rend="italic">Commedia</hi> of Dante,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Canzone d’</hi><hi rend="italic">Amore</hi> of Guido
                    Cavalcanti; and his fate was sealed. Dino di Garbo, the physician, was
                    indefatigable in pursuit of him; and the old accusation of impiety being
                    renewed, Cecco was again tried and sentenced, this time to the stake. He was
                    burned at Florence the day after sentence, in the seventieth year of his
                    age.</p>
                <p>Cecco d’Ascoli left many works in manuscript, most of which have never been given
                    to the world. The book by which he achieved his renown and which led to his
                    death was the <hi rend="italic">Acerba</hi> (from <hi rend="italic"
                    >acervus),</hi> an encyclopaedic poem, of which in 1546, the date of the last
                    reprint, more than twenty editions had been issued. It is unfinished, and
                    consists of four books in <hi rend="italic">sesta rima.</hi> The first book
                    treats of astronomy and meteorology; the second of stellar influences, of
                    physiognomy, and of the vices and virtues; the third of minerals and of the love
                    of animals; while the fourth propounds and solves a number of moral and physical
                    problems. Of a fifth book, on theology, the initial chapter alone was completed.
                    A man of immense erudition and of great and varied abilities, Cecco, whose
                    knowledge was based on experiment and observation (a fact that of itself is
                    enough to distinguish him from the crowd of savants of that age), had
                    outstripped his contemporaries in many things. He knew of metallic aerolites and
                    shooting-stars; the mystery of the dew was plain to him; fossil plants were
                    accounted for by him through terrene revolutions which had resulted in the
                    formation of mountains; he is even said to have divined the circulation of the
                    blood. Altogether a remarkable man, he may be described as one of the many
                    Cassandras of the Middle Ages—one of the many prophets who spoke of coming
                    light, and were listened to but to have their words cast back at them in
                    accusations of impiety and sentences of death.</p>
                <p>The least faulty of the many editions of the <hi rend="italic">Acerba</hi> is
                    that of Venice, dated 1510. The earliest known, which has become excessively
                    rare, is that of Brescia, which has no date, but is ascribed to 1473 or
                    thereabouts.</p>
