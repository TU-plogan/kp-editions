                    office, or <hi rend="italic">bishop s stool,</hi> as our Saxon forefathers
                    termed it, is thus well expressed by Hooker <hi rend="italic">(Eccl.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Polit.,</hi> vii. 8, 3), “To note a difference of that one
                    church where the bishop hath his seat, and the rest which depend upon it, that
                    one hath been usually termed <hi rend="italic">cathedral,</hi> according to the
                    same sense wherein Ignatius, speaking of the Church of Antioch, termeth it his
                    throne; and Cyprian, making mention of Evaristus, who had been bishop and was
                    now deposed, termeth him <hi rend="italic">cathedroe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >extorrem,</hi> one that was thrust besides his chair. The church where the
                    bishop is set with his college of presbyters about him we call a <hi

                        rend="italic">diocese.</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi> A bishop’s <hi
                        rend="italic">see</hi> is, strictly speaking, a bishop’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >seat</hi><hi rend="italic">(sedes,</hi><hi rend="italic">siège),</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">cathedra,</hi> and is only in a secondary sense applied to
                    the church in which that seat is placed, and the city in which that church
                    stands. From this it follows that a church may lose its cathedral rank by the
                    transference of the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n238/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0238-0227"/> bishop’s see to another church, which by that
                    transference at once assumes the dignity lost by the other. Thus the Oxfordshire
                    Dorchester was the cathedral of the vast East Mercian diocese, until in 1072
                    Remigius removed the <hi rend="italic">cathedra</hi> to Lincoln, while the West
                    Mercian prelates at one time had their see at Chester before it was finally
                    fixed in its earlier habitation at Lichfield. Thus also in 1088 the abbey church
                    of Bath became the cathedral of Somersetshire, which for nearly two centuries
                    had been at Wells, where after a brief sojourn at Glastonbury the bishop’s
                    throne was again permanently set up in 1206. Towards the close of the 12th
                    century the cathedral of Canterbury was in some danger of losing its rank, the
                    contumacy of the monks having caused Archbishop Baldwin to conceive the idea of
                    transferring his official seat to the church of Hackington, which would in that
                    event have become the cathedral of the Kentish diocese, and the metropolitan
                    church of England. Such a plan was actually carried out when, early in the 13th
                    century (1220), Bishop Poore deserted the cathedral of Old Sarum, and founded
                    the existing cathedral of Salisbury. The period of the Reformation saw the abbey
                    churches of Bristol, Chester, Gloucester, Oxford, and Peterborough, and for a
                    short space Westminster, elevated to cathedral rank by being made the seat of a
                    bishop, a change which has been witnessed in the present century by the
                    establishment of the sees of Ripon and Manchester. While we are writing, the
                    church of Cumbrae has become the cathedral of the Scottish diocese of Argyll and
                    the Isles, and the abbey church of St Albans is only waiting for the completion
                    of preliminary necessary arrangements to be constituted the cathedral for the
                    counties of Hertfordshire and Essex.</p>
                <p>By very early canons it was decreed that cathedrals should only be established in
                    chief cities. The Council of Laodicea (361), following the legislation of the
                    Council of Sardica (347), prohibited the appointment of bishops in villages or
                    country places. Throughout the Roman empire, where the ecclesiastical coincided
                    with the civil divisions, the seats of religious authority were fixed in the
                    same spots as the seats of temporal authority, the bishop placing his <hi
                        rend="italic">cathedra</hi> in the city where the temporal governor had
                    planted his curule chair. In Britain, however, where, in the early days when the
                    church first developed her power, cities were but few and insignificant, the
                    case was different. The bishop was rather the bishop of a district or of a tribe
                    than of a city. The position of his cathedral was dictated by motives of
                    convenience and security rather than by the dignity and populousness of the
                    site. Not unfrequently the <hi rend="italic">cathedra</hi> was migratory. This
                    state of things drew to an end with the conclusion of the 10th century, when the
                    country became more settled, and the Roman system was finally ratified by the
                    Council of London (1075), which ordered that episcopal sees should be removed
                    from unwalled villages to walled cities. In obedience to this decree the
                    cathedrals of Salisbury, Chichester, and Chester (the last only temporarily)
                    were created,—succeeding to the episcopal dignity of those of Sherborne, Selsey,
                    and Lichfield (Freeman, <hi rend="italic">Hist, of Forman Conquest,</hi> vol.
                    iv. pp. 414-420). Other transferences of only slightly later date were those
                    already mentioned from Dorchester to Lincoln, and from Wells to Bath, as well as
                    that of the East Anglian see from Elmham to Thetford and thence to Norwich.</p>
                <p>Wherever established, the cathedral church was regarded as being, what it usually
                    was in fact, the mother-church of the district dependent upon it. This district
                    was for the first three centuries designated the <hi rend="italic"
                        >parochia</hi><hi rend="italic">(παροικία)</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    bishop. Gradually the term <hi rend="italic">diocese (διoiκησις),</hi>
                    originally signifying a civil province of the lesser sort, came to be
                    transferred to ecclesiastical divisions, to the exclusion of the earlier name,
                    which in its forms, <hi rend="italic">parish,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >paroisse,</hi><hi rend="italic">parrocchia,</hi> &amp;c., was restricted to
                    the smaller ecclesiastical districts, each containing a single church.
                    Cathedrals in their original idea possessed much of a missionary character. The
                    district of which they were the ecclesiastical centre in general received the
                    light of religious truth from them. They were the headquarters of the bishop and
                    his clergy, from which they went forth for the evangelization of the heathen
                    inhabitants— <hi rend="italic">pagani,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> dwellers
                    in the <hi rend="italic">pagi,</hi> or surrounding country villages. To this
                    also they returned as their home for rest and refreshment, as well as for
                    necessary conference. In the words of Dean Milman,—“Christianity was first
                    established in the townsand cities, and from each centre diffused itself with
                    more or less success into the adjacent country. . . . The churches adjacent to
                    the towns or cities either originally were or became the diocese of the city
                    bishop " <hi rend="italic">(Hist, of Christianity,</hi> bk. iv. c. 1. § 2).
                    Thus, as Hooker says, “Towns and villages abroad receiving the faith of Christ
                    from cities whereunto they were adjacent, did, as spiritual and heavenly
                    colonies, by their subjection honour those ancient mother churches out of which
                    they grew” <hi rend="italic">(Eccl.</hi><hi rend="italic">Polit.,</hi> bk. vii.
                    c. 8, § 2). In some cases, however, especially in Britain, the history of the
                    cathedral was different. The missionary element was the same; but instead of
                    starting with a bishop as the centre of organized action, establishments of
                    missionary priests were formed, with a church as the focus of their religious
                    life and a monastery as their home, which only tardily attained cathedral rank
                    by the appointment of a bishop to preside over them. The cathedral of Worcester
                    is instanced by Professor Stubbs in this relation, as an example, “like
                    Canterbury itself, of a successful missionary establishment, thus attaining its
                    due development” (“Cathedral of Worcester in the 8th century,” <hi rend="italic"
                        >Árchoedl. Jour.,</hi> voL xix. p. 244). The history of the missionary work
                    of the Church of England during the early part of the present century reproduced
                    this same system. The missionary clergy preceded the bishop, and cathedral
                    dignity was imposed on a church not originally erected with any such object. The
                    last twenty years have seen a return to the other more primitive plan of
                    operations. In newly-constituted dioceses in Africa and elsewhere, the bishop
                    takes the lead among his clergy in date of constitution as he does in official
                    rank, and the cathedral church is one of the first requirements to be provided
                    for. The true character and object of a cathedral church and establishment are
                    thus well set forth by Bishop Stillingfleet :—“Every cathedral in its first
                    institution was as a temple to the whole diocese, where the worship was to be
                    performed in the most decent and constant manner; for which end it was necessary
                    to have such a number of ecclesiastical persons there attending as might still
                    be ready to do all the offices which did belong to the Christian church,—such as
                    constant prayer and hymns and preaching and celebration of sacraments,— which
                    were to be kept up in such a church, as the daily sacrifice was in the Temple.”
                    Though it was the church of the bishop, it was essential for its completeness
                    that he should be surrounded by his college of presbyters, as the members of the
                    body of which he was the head. The purpose of this collective body was threefold
                    :—(1.) Consultative,—as the <hi rend="italic">concilium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >episcopi,</hi> by whose advice he might be strengthened in all important
                    matters concerning the diocese; (2.) Ministerial,—for the maintenance and
                    celebration of public worship in its most reverent and dignified form, <hi
                        rend="italic">cum</hi><hi rend="italic">cantu et jubilatione</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and (3.) Diocesan,—as the bishop’s officials in the
                    administration of his diocese, prepared also to go forth at his bidding to act
                    as missionaries or evangelists in any part to which he might see fit to send
                    them. In this way there sprang up <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n239/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0239-0228"/> the body known as the “chapter” of the
                    cathedral,—a body originally in the closest connection with the bishop, and
                    having no corporate existence apart from him. This collective body sometimes
                    consisted of “seculars,” <hi rend="italic">i,e.,</hi> of clergy not bound by
                    monastic vows, living in the world, with separate homes of their own; sometimes
                    of “regulars,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of clergy living according to a
                    monastic rule, residing in one religious community, and sharing in common
                    buildings. Of both bodies the bishop was the head. When the cathedral was the
                    church of a monastery and was served by regulars, the bishop was regarded as the
                    abbot; and when the chapter consisted of a college of secular clergy, it owed
                    allegiance to no one but the bishop himself. The “dean,” the present head of all
                    English cathedral chapters, was a comparatively late addition, not appearing
                    till the 10th or 11th century. He had been preceded by the <hi rend="italic"
                        >proepositus,</hi> a “provost,” who occurs in the 8th and 9th centuries.
                    Earlier still we find the “archpresbyter,” who was gradually supplanted by the
                    archdeacon” exercising chief authority among the cathedral clergy, but always in
                    strict subordination to the bishop. Another chief officer of the church—one,
                    with the two last, of the “tria culmina ecclesiae ”—was the “custos” or
                    “primicerius,” a title he derived from his name being that first entered on the
                    waxen tablet or list. The strange contradiction by which the bishop has less
                    authority in the church of which he is the titular head, and which takes its
                    distinctive appellation from his throne, than in any other church in his
                    diocese, only gradually came into existence. It was partly a result of the
                    increase of his diocesan duties, partly of his transformation into a great
                    political officer of the state, and partly of the organization of the chapter as
                    an independent corporation. When travelling over his widespread diocese, or
                    attending upon the king as chancellor, or other high officer, the bishop had no
                    leisure to attend to the internal administration of his cathedral, and the
                    authority naturally tended to attach itself to the permanent chief of the
                    chapter, while he gradually sank into a mere external visitor called in when
                    needed to correct abuses, or as an arbiter to settle disputes. Under the bishop
                    as its nominal head the chapter of a fully organized cathedral, when it was
                    formed of secular priests, consisted of the <hi rend="italic">quatuor</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">personoe,</hi> or four chief “dignitaries” of the church, and
                    a body of “canons” or “prebendaries.” The four high officers were—(1.) the
                    “dean,” as the general head of the whole capitular body, charged with the
                    internal discipline of the corporation; (2) the “praecentor,” or “chanter,” who
                    was charged with the management of the choir, and the musical arrangements of
                    the service; (3) the “chancellor,” the literary-man of the chapter, who, as
                    theological professor, superintended the education of its younger members,
                    delivered lectures himself, and procured the delivery of sermons by others, had
                    the care of the library, and wrote the letters of the body; and (4) the
                    “treasurer,” not in the modern fiscal sense of the word, but the officer to
                    whose care were entrusted the treasures of the church, its sacred vessels and
                    altar furniture, reliquaries, and other ornaments. With these were usually
                    united the “archdeacons,” varying in number with the size of the diocese, who
                    were, however, more diocesan than cathedral officers. Next after these
                    dignitaries the main body of a cathedral chapter consisted of “canons” or
                    “prebendaries.” The former name they received originally from being enrolled on
                    the “canon” or list of ecclesiastical officers, though subsequently it was
                    supposed to have reference to their being bound by canons, <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> rules. The additional title of prebendary was given to those
                    canons who enjoyed a separate estate <hi rend="italic">(proebenda),</hi> in
                    virtue of their position, besides their share of the corporate funds. These
                    names were, generally speaking, two different designations for the same
                    individual. A canon was usually, though not always, a prebendary; but a
                    prebendary, as a member of the capitular body, was always a canon. The life of
                    the canons was separate, not coenobitic. Each had his own house and his private
                    establishment. The attempt of Chrodegang, archbishop of Metz (who died in 766),
                    to force a semi-monastic rule on canons, with a common refectory and common
                    dormitory, though eagerly adopted by the Emperor Charlemagne, was short-lived.
                    By the middle of the 9th century the rule was indeed established in almost all
                    the cathedrals of France, Germany, and Italy, and had also been adopted in
                    England. But its strictness proved unpalatable to the canons. It was gradually
                    relaxed everywhere, and found no acceptance in England. The distinction between
                    “residentiary” and “non-residentiary” canons had its origin in the attempt to
                    combat the evils consequent on pluralities. The canons having other preferments
                    were, by the end of the 12th century, generally non-resident. Their cathedral
                    duties were performed by “vicars” receiving a small stipend. To attract them
                    into residence the divisible part of the corporate revenue was ordered to be
                    shared among those canons who had resided for a certain term. This created a
                    degree of confusion, as there was no certainty how many canons would reside
                    during a given year. To obviate this irregularity the duty of residence was laid
                    on a fixed number of canons only, who were to discharge the ordinary duties of
                    the cathedral on behalf of the whole body (Freeman <hi rend="italic">Cathedral
                        Essays,</hi> pp. 148-149). The establishment of “vicars,” or, as they are
                    now more usually but unstatutably called, “minor canons,” as a regular and
                    permanent part of the cathedral body, originally due to non-residence, was
                    sanctioned through the inability of some of the canons to take their part in the
                    choral service of the church. In most cathedrals each officer had his deputy.
                    Thus we find the “sub-dean,” the “sub-chanter” or “succentor,” the
                    “vice-chancellor,” as recognized members of the cathedral staff. Another officer
                    is the “praelector,” or lecturer in theology, who in some cathedrals executes
                    the duties elsewhere performed by the chancellor.</p>
                <p>We have been speaking hitherto of the cathedrals of secular canons. The monastic
                    cathedrals differed little from ordinary monasteries, save in being governed, in
                    the almost constant absence of their titular abbot, the bishop, by a prior as
                    the real head of their society. Cathedrals of this class are peculiar to England
                    and Germany, which received its religion mainly from England. The monks or
                    regular clergy who served them were, in England, everywhere of the Benedictine
                    order, except at Carlisle, where they were Austin canons.</p>
                <p>The distinction between monastic and secular cathedrals in England was
                    perpetuated at the Reformation under the new titles of “Cathedrals of the Old
                    Foundation” and “Cathedrals of the New.” In the cathedrals of the former class
                    the foundation remained substantially unchanged. But the monasteries attached to
                    cathedrals having been suppressed by Henry VIII., together with the other
                    religious houses, these cathedrals were founded afresh as chapters of secular
                    canons presided over by a dean. These new chapters were eight in number, viz.,
                    Canterbury, Durham, Winchester, Carlisle, Ely, Norwich, Rochester, and
                    Worcester. The members of the chapter were designated, not canons, but
                    prebendaries, an improper appellation, as none had any separate estate or
                    “praebenda” assigned to them. The highest number of these new prebendaries was
                    twelve, at Canterbury, Durham, and Winchester; the lowest was four, at Carlisle.
                    With these monastic cathedrals may be classed the new sees formed by Henry VIII.
                    from existing monasteries, viz., Bristol, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n240/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0240-0229"/> Chester, Gloucester, Oxford, and
                    Peterborough. The constitution of these cathedrals was similar to those of the
                    other monastic cathedrals, and the codes of statutes almost identical. In all
                    the cathedrals of the New Foundation the praecentor, instead of being a chief
                    dignitary second only to the dean, is one of the minor canons.-</p>
                <p>The cathedrals of the Old Foundation, whose constitution has not been materially
                    changed since the 13 th century, and which are in some instances still governed
                    by preReformation statutes, are those of York, London, Chichester, Exeter,
                    Hereford, Lichfield, Lincoln, Salisbury, and Wells, together with those of the
                    four Welsh bishoprics—Bangor, Llandaff, St Asaph’s, and St David’s. Monastic
                    cathedrals being nearly peculiar to England and Germany, these Old Foundation
                    cathedrals “are those whose history and constitution has most in common with the
                    churches of Scotland, Ireland, and Western Christendom generally” (Freeman, <hi
                        rend="italic">u.s.,</hi> p. 139).</p>
                <p>To these must be added the two recently-erected cathedrals of Manchester and
                    Ripon. In each of these cases advantage was taken of an existing collegiate
                    establishment on which to graft a cathedral. No provision is made in the Act for
                    the founding of the see of St Alban’s for the creation of a capitular body.</p>
                <p>The legislation of 3 and 4 Victoria reduced all the cathedrals of England and
                    Wales to a uniform constitution. The normal type is that of a dean and four
                    canons. Canterbury, Durham, and Ely, however, have six canons a-piece, and
                    Winchester and Exeter five. To remove still further the distinction between
                    cathedrals of the Old and New Foundation, a body of honorary canons was called
                    into being in the latter to correspond to the prebendaries of the former
                    foundations. The prebendal estates having been alienated, the honour in each
                    case is equally a barren one.</p>
                <p>In not a few of the English cathedrals the due performance of the choral service
                    is provided for by a corporation of “lay vicars,” forming in some cases an
                    independent body endowed with estates of their own. The chorister boys also in
                    some cases are supported and educated from the proceeds of separate estates. The
                    “priest vicars,” or “minor canons,” in several instances, also have their own
                    estates and form a corporation by themselves.</p>
                <p>It does not fall within the scope of the present article to enter upon the ritual
                    and architectural history of cathedrals. In neither of these respects do they
                    differ essentially from other important and dignified churches.</p>
