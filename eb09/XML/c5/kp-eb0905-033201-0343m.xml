                    amass an immense fortune. This enabled his heir to defy the law; condemned on
                    several occasions for murders and unnatural crimes, Francesco Cenci had always
                    managed to escape sentence by the timely administration of enormous bribes. He
                    was, therefore, a very profitable criminal, and one with whom several popes in
                    succession found it to their interest to deal gently. A man of great force of
                    character and at the same time of boundless passions, in the service of which
                    his fine intellect and indomitable courage were wholly employed, he was one of
                    those personalities, interesting by sheer weight of depravity, in which the
                    Italy of the Renaissance abounded. He is distinguishable, however, from his
                    rivals in villainy by an entire absence of ambition except of a sensual
                    kind.</p>
                <p>The pampering of his every appetite would seem to have induced in him its natural
                    result,—the infinite perversity known to psychologists as a common consequence
                    of the weariness that follows satiety. Francesco Cenci was twice married; by his
                    first wife he had had seven children, one of whom had died in infancy; his
                    second wife, Lucrezia Petroni was childless. One of the strangest sides of his
                    horrible character was the intensity of hatred with which he regarded his
                    surviving children. The three eldest, Giacomo, Cristoforo, and Rocco, he had
                    sent to a Spanish university, where he kept them penniless and starving, till
                    they could bear no more, and returned. His conduct towards them remained
                    unchanged. Shortly before the commencement of that episode of his life with
                    which the name of his daughter Beatrice is inseparably connected, he was
                    imprisoned for the third and last time, and his three sons presented a petition
                    to the Pope regnant, Clement VIII., imploring him, for the sake of the honour of
                    their house, to make an end of their father. Clement, however, wanted money, and
                    Francesco Cenci was released. His hate for his children was by no means lessened
                    by this circumstance. Of his sons he never spoke but with curses; his two
                    daughters he was in the habit of beating violently. The elder sister, however,
                    found means to get a petition presented to Clement, in which she prayed to be
                    removed to a convent. The Pope took pity on her, and gave her in marriage to a
                    gentleman of Gubbio, obliging her father to dower her largely. Cenci was
                    furious. He shut his daughter Beatrice, then aged fourteen, in a lonely room,
                    where he visited her to bring her food, to beat her, and to revile her with her
                    sister’s flight. It is said that it was in this place and under these
                    circumstances that Francesco Cenci conceived the monstrous passion that resulted
                    in his death.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Rocco Cenci had been assassinated, and a year afterwards his brother
                    Cristoforo met with a like fate. Thereafter Francesco Cenci, whose joy at the
                    news of his sons’ death is recorded to have been awful, ceased not to torture
                    his unhappy wife and unhappier daughter to the utmost. The ordeal must indeed
                    have been a terrible one that could have transformed the gay light-hearted
                    girlhumorist into the grand woman who was afterwards to play such a notable part
                    in crime and expiation. The accounts of Cenci’s conduct with her are not to be
                    repeated. Meanwhile, however, a certain cardinal, Monsignor Guerra, one of the
                    handsomest men in Rome, had fallen in love with her, and was in the habit of
                    visiting the Palazzo Cenci whenever Francesco left it. Maddened by the failure
                    of a petition for the redress of their wrongs, which they had addressed to
                    Clement, and which had miscarried, Lucrezia and Beatrice turned for aid to the
                    cardinal, and communicated to him their design of ending their troubles by the
                    murder of the author of them. The cardinal allowed himself to be persuaded; he
                    lost no time in sounding Giacomo Cenci, the elder brother, and, after Francesco,
                    head of the house, without whose consent nothing could be attempted. Meetings
                    were held in a room in the cardinal’s palace, and the advice of Lucrezia and
                    Beatrice was taken on all points. For the execution of the design determined on,
                    choice was made of two of Cenci’s vassals, Olimpio and Marzio, both of whom were
                    violently incensed against their master,—Marzio out of pity for his mistresses,
                    and Olimpio for his own wrong’s sake. It was at first proposed to cloak the
                    murder in an attack and robbery by banditti. A dozen men were to be held in
                    readiness to stop Francesco Cenci on his way to Petrella, a fief within the
                    Neapolitan frontier, whether he was wont to betake himself in the summer. An
                    enormous ransom was to be asked, with the alternative of death; the mother and
                    daughter were to return to Rome to obtain the sum; and the assassins were to
                    carry their threat into execution. But the scheme miscarried; Francesco reached
                    Petrella in safety, and the conspirators were forced to arrange other
                    combinations.</p>
                <p>The old man’s treatment of his wife and daughter grew worse daily. He is said to
                    have pretended that he believed them pleased and happy in his gray hairs and
                    declining <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n344/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0344-0333"/> years, and to have tormented them with an
                    incomparable ingenuity and ferocity. Beatrice at last found means to communicate
                    with Monsignor Guerra, and it was agreed that, for the sum of a thousand
                    piastres, one-third to be paid by the cardinal and the rest by Beatrice and
                    Lucrezia, Olimpio and Marzio should enter the castle and kill Francesco in his
                    bed. On September 9, 1588, accordingly, a strong opiate having been dexterously
                    administered to the tyrant, the assassins were introduced into his chamber by
                    Beatrice herself. Here they were overtaken with remorse; the spectacle of the
                    old man sleeping was too much for them; and they retreated without accomplishing
                    their intent. Beatrice, however, whose magnificent· personality had risen to the
                    occasion, received them with such indignation, that they returned and slew the
                    sleeper, much as Jael had slain Sisera, by driving a long nail through the eye
                    into the brain, making assurance doubly sure by driving another through the
                    throat. When this was done Beatrice presented them with a purse of money, and
                    clothed Marzio in a mantle laced with gold, which had belonged to her father.
                    She and Lucrezia then withdrew the nails from the corpse, which they folded in a
                    sheet, and dragged through several rooms to a gallery looking into an unused
                    garden, whence they flung it into the branches of a great elder tree that grew
                    thereby. This gallery was used for such a purpose as would lend reality to the
                    story they intended to tell, of Cenci’s leaving his bed to repair thither, and
                    of his slipping and falling accidentally into the branches below.</p>
                <p>Everything occurred as Beatrice and her mother had foreseen. The alarm was great,
                    but Francesco’s death was accounted for naturally enough; his remains received
                    an honourable burial, and the two women returned to Rome, and lived tranquilly
                    there for several months. Suspicion, however, had been excited in Naples by the
                    circumstances of the event, and a magistrate was sent to Petrella, who arrested
                    all the people employed about the castle. Among them was a washerwoman to whom
                    Beatrice had given the soiled linen from Cenci’s bed, with a story accounting in
                    quite a natural way for the presence of so much blood. The woman, interrogated
                    as to the credibility of the story, threw doubts upon it, basing her opinion on
                    the unusual brightness of colour of the marks. Details of the interrogatory were
                    sent to Rome, but no notice was taken, and Lucrezia and her children remained
                    undisturbed. Meanwhile, however, Monsignor Guerra, as soon as he was informed of
                    what was passing at Naples, had sent out emissaries charged with the murder of
                    Francesco Cenci’s assassins. Olimpio alone had been dispatched. Marzio, arrested
                    by the Neapolitan Government several months after the murder, was taken to
                    Naples; he confessed everything.</p>
                <p>On information being conveyed to Rome, Lucrezia and her three step-children,
                    Giacomo, Bernardo, and Beatrice Cenci, were arrested. Lucrezia, Giacomo, and
                    Bernardo were taken to the Corte Savella prison, while Beatrice was confined to
                    the Cenci Palace, and guarded strictly by a troop of sbirri. Marzio, meanwhile,
                    was brought from Naples, and confronted in the Corte Savella with Lucrezia and
                    her daughter The majesty and strength of Beatrice in this interview were such
                    that the old vassal withdrew his confession, and chose rather to expire under
                    torture than to incriminate his mistresses further. In the absence of any other
                    proof, the whole of the Cenci family were relegated to Sant’ Angelo, where they
                    remained for several months. At the end of that time Olimpio’s assassin was
                    arrested, and confessed as much as he knew. Monsignor Guerra fled from Rome,
                    disguised as a charcoal-burner, and Lucrezia and her children were taken back
                    again to the Corte Savella.</p>
                <p>Put to the torture, Giacomo and Bernardo at once confessed the crime and their
                    share in it. Lucrezia, too, who was of a luxurious habit of body, was not able
                    to enduro the torture of the cord, and acknowledged her complicity also. But
                    Beatrice was not made of such penetrable stuff. The cord made no impression on
                    her whatever, and her genius and force of will so confounded Moscati, the judge
                    charged with her interrogatory, that he made her the subject of a special report
                    to the Pope. The examination was committed to a second of sterner reputation,
                    and Beatrice was questioned by suspension by the hair. While in this posture her
                    brothers and Lucrezia were introduced into the apartment. All of them urged her
                    to confess. She reproached them with their little care for the honour of the
                    family, but at last consented. She then answered the judge’s questions, denying
                    the false and explaining the true. On the release of Beatrice from the torture
                    and the examination, the four dined and spent the evening cheerfully together.
                    Next day the two brothers were taken to the Tor di Nono, the women remaining in
                    the Corte Savella; the Pope, having read the papers, had sentenced them to
                    immediate death.</p>
                <p>Immense efforts were made to obtain a commutation of the sentence, but a respite
                    of twenty-five days was all that could be got. On the twenty-fifth day a body of
                    advocates, among whom was the celebrated jurist Farinacei, presented themselves
                    before Clement, to plead the cause of the accused; the Pope, however, refused to
                    listen to them, and Farinacei alone was allowed to speak. They left their
                    briefs, which Clement spent the night in reading. The next day all four
                    prisoners were ordered to be confined <hi rend="italic">au</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >secret,</hi> and great hopes were entertained of pardon. But a scandalous case
                    of matricide intervened; the assassin fled, and the Cenci were immolated in his
                    stead, Farinacei succeeding after great efforts in saving the life of Bernardo,
                    the youngest boy.</p>
                <p>On the 1lth of September 1599, the four prisoners were conveyed to the scaffold.
                    Lucrezia and Beatrice were on foot; Giacomo was drawn in a cart, and was
                    subjected the whole way to the torture of the pincers, which he bore with great
                    fortitude. Bernardo, who was young and longhaired, was extremely agitated, and
                    was several times mistaken for Beatrice, who indeed was far from sharing her
                    brother’s weakness. The heat was intense, the excitement unparalleled, the crowd
                    enormous; several deaths from fever and sunstroke are said to have occurred
                    during the day. Lucrezia and Beatrice were beheaded, and were afterwards buried,
                    the one in the church of San Giorgio, the other in that of San Pietro in
                    Montario. Giacomo was <hi rend="italic">mazzolato</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    killed with a mace. Bernardo, who fainted several times, was removed to a
                    convent,—“Oriental precautions” being taken, it is said, to prevent his
                    disturbing the new owners in their possession of the confiscated estates of his
                    house.</p>
                <p>Part of these estates, conveyed to a cardinal nephew of •Clement, became the
                    Villa Barberini. Therein are still preserved the portraits of Lucrezia Petroni
                    and of Beatrice Cenci, the latter of which is said to be by Guido Reni.
                    Shelley’s fine tragedy is well known; the poet has dealt freely with much of his
                    material, but the result is of unapproachable excellence. See also the <hi
