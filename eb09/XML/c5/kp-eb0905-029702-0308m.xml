                <p><label type="entry">CELTIC LITERATURE</label></p>
                <p>THE Greeks gave the collective name <hi rend="italic">Keltai</hi> to a Western
                    people, and the name <hi rend="italic">Keltike</hi> to the laud which they
                    inhabited. The region to which the latter term was applied varied according to
                    the more or less accurate knowledge of each writer who used the term. The use of
                    the word <hi rend="italic">Keltai</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> víŭs</hi>
                    equally vague and variable; and this was due as much to the great movements of
                    peoples which took place some centuries before the Christian era as to the want
                    of knowledge of the early Greek writers. One of the displacements of tribes due
                    to those movements has immediate connection with our present subject, the
                    migration of some of the <hi rend="italic">Keltαi</hi> by the valley of the
                    Danube and Northern Greece into Asia Minor; for in the names <hi rend="italic"
                    >Galatai</hi> given to the people, and <hi rend="italic">Galatia</hi> given to
                    the land wherein they settled, we have forms which connect the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">Keltai</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Keltike</hi> with the Roman <hi
                    rend="italic">Galli</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gallioe,</hi> and both, perhaps,
                    with <hi rend="italic">Goulil, Gαeidil,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gaedhü,</hi>
                    the name of one branch of the descendants of the <hi rend="italic">Keltai,</hi>
                    or, to use the modern form of the word, Celts. If <hi rend="italic">Goidil,</hi>
                    or, in the modern Scottish form, <hi rend="italic">Gael,</hi> be radically
                    connected with <hi rend="italic">Keltai, Galatai,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Galli,</hi> these names would represent that by which the original nation, or
                    one of its principal tribes, called itself. We do not know the collective name
                    by which the Germans designated their neighbours. Dieffenbach suggests that it
                    may exist in <hi rend="italic">Halidgastes,</hi> a man’s name, which, as
                    frequently happened, from a tribe name became an appellative, and exists now in
                    the modern German word <hi rend="italic">Held.</hi></p>
                <p>When the Romans became first acquainted with the Celts there were two
                    Gauls,—Cisalpine Gaul or Northern Italy, and Transalpine or Greater Gaul, which
                    included not only France but also Belgium, all that part of Germany west of the
                    Rhine, and Western Switzerland. Whether any Celtic tribes lived east of the
                    Rhine since the attack of the Gauls on Rome, and whether the frontier of the
                    Germans and Celts was a fixed one within historic times or a constantly
                    advancing one, are questions which we have not space to discuss, nor, if we had,
                    would it be profitable to do so in the absence of any real facts to work upon.
                    To the Continental Celtic ground above defined we have to add the British
                    Islands.</p>
                <p>The determination of the limits of the Celtic ground is based chiefly on
                    linguistic evidence. Unfortunately, as regards the Continental part, our
                    materials are scant, and hence a good deal of room is left for the imagination.
                    Thus it has been much discussed whether the language spoken in every part of
                    ancient Gaul was the same. Some have asserted that the Belgians were Germans,
                    and therefore spoke a Teutonic tongue, and that even the Celtic dialect spoken
                    north of the Loire differed considerably from that spoken south of that river in
                    Aquitaine. This opinion was based upon a well-known passage in Caesar’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Gallic War,</hi> in which he states that Gaul was
                    divided into three parts which differed among themselves in language,
                    institutions, and laws. This may mean either that three distinct languages were
                    spoken, or if but one language, that there were three well-marked dialects. Μ.
                    Roget de Belloguet has shown from a careful investigation of all ancient
                    authorities, and an analysis of nearly 400 Gaulish words gathered from ancient
                    authors and inscriptions, that the differences in question were dialectic, and
                    that, save, perhaps, in those parts occupied by a Ligurian or Basque people, the
                    same language was spoken in all GauL</p>
                <p>Community of language does not, however, necessarily imply community of race.
                    People having no kinship may speak the same language, while others nearly akin
                    may speak widely different languages. This has been found to have been the case
                    in Gaul as elsewhere. One language was spoken by two races which gradually fused
                    into one people—a northern, fair-haired, blue-eyed race, of tall stature,
                    lymphatic temperament, and elongated heads, and a southern race, shorter in
                    stature and dry and nervous in temperament, having brown or black hair and eyes
                    and round heads. The free or dominant class of Gauls belonged to the former
                    race, which was evidently an intrusive one. The inhabitants of the British
                    Islands seem to have been composed of the same two races, and to have spoken the
                    same language as those of GauL</p>
                <p>Causes of phonetic change like those which produced the parallel branches of the
                    Teutonic stem (the Germanic and Scandinavian tongues) and of the Windic stem
                    (the Slavonic and Lithuanie tongues) must have existed at an early period in the
                    Celtic language, for the original stem has produced two branches in the British
                    Islands which are wider apart than those of the Teutonic stem, and, according to
                    Zeuss, less widely separated than the two branches of the Windic stem. These
                    branches we shall call, following <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n309/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0309-0298"/> Zeusa, the Irish and British branches. Each of
                    these branches has again produced three dialects. The Irish or Goidelic dialects
                    are—the Irish proper, the Scottish Gaelic, and the Manx, or dialect of the Irish
                    spoken in the Isle of Man. The British dialects are—the Kymraeg or Welsh, the
                    Cornish, and the Armorie, or language of Brittany. The Cornish is now extinct,
                    having died out about the middle of the last century. We have included Armorie
                    among British dialects on the ground that whatever may be its relation to old
                    Gaulish it was intimately connected during the Middle Ages with the Cornish, if
                    it be not a direct descendant of the language spoken by the southern Britons who
                    emigrated to Brittany during the early Saxon wars.</p>
                <p>It would be impossible within the limits of such an article as this to point out
                    even the principal distinctions between the two branches of the Celtic, but the
                    following examples will perhaps enable the reader to realize their general
                    character. The Irish has preserved the hard or <hi rend="italic">k</hi> sound of
                    <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> while in British it is represented by <hi
                    rend="italic">p,- e.g.,</hi> Irish <hi rend="italic">cethir,</hi> four, <hi
                    rend="italic">eland,</hi> posterity, <hi rend="italic">cτann</hi> tree, with
                    initial guttural, are equal to the Welsh <hi rend="italic">pedguar, plant,
                    pren</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Irish <hi rend="italic">nach,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nech,</hi> person, <hi rend="italic">mace,</hi> son, with final
                    guttural, and <hi rend="italic">each,</hi> each, with initial and final <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> correspond respectively with Welsh <hi rend="italic">nep,
                    map,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">paup</hi> This change from a guttural to a
                    labial, and even in some cases to a dental, is what Professor Curtius calls
                    “labialismus,” and is very marked in Greek as compared with Latin; so that as
                    respects this phonetic law Welsh stands to Irish in the same relation as Greek
                    does to Latin. The tendency to labialism is, however, less in Irish than in
                    Latin, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Latin <hi rend="italic">septem,</hi> seven,
                    Irish <hi rend="italic">secht</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and perhaps even than
                    in Sanskrit, for Irish drops initial <hi rend="italic">p, e.g., iasg,</hi> fish,
                    Welsh <hi rend="italic">pysg,</hi> or changes it into <hi rend="italic">b,
                    e.g.,</hi> Welsh <hi rend="italic">pen,</hi> Irish <hi rend="italic">ben.</hi>
                    The reverse process to labialism even sometimes takes place in the case of
                    borrowed words, e.y., <hi rend="italic">Pascha,</hi> Easter, Welsh <hi
                    rend="italic">Pasg,</hi> Irish <hi rend="italic">Casg;</hi> Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">purpura,</hi> Irish <hi rend="italic">cor cur.</hi> So great is
                    the contrast in this respect between Irish and Welsh, that the latter labializes
                    borrowed names, as in the case of the Irish Saint <hi rend="italic">Ciaran,</hi>
                    who became <hi rend="italic">Piaran</hi> in Wales. If Dr Windisch, Mr J. Rhys,
                    and some other philologists are right in thinking that the primitive or true <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> sound when not combined with other consonants has
                    disappeared everywhere from all the Celtic languages, and that when <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> does appear in them, especially in Welsh, it is only the
                    representative of a former <hi rend="italic">qu, mb,</hi> or of a provected <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> that is a δ carried forward from the end of one word to
                    the beginning of the next, then the distinction just dwelt upon, though very
                    marked when we compare modern Welsh and Irish, did not exist in ancient times.
                    But whether this be so or not the Irish articulation maintains a good deal of
                    hardness and strength, in illustration of which we may mention that <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sr</hi> occur as initial sounds—the
                    latter, which is also found in Sanskrit, does not exist perhaps in any other
                    European language. Again, Irish, like Sanskrit, Latin, German, and Slavonian has
                    preserved the sibilant <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> while in British, as in Zend,
                    Persian, and Greek, it has been generally changed into <hi rend="italic">h,
                    e.g.,</hi> Irish <hi rend="italic">sen,</hi> old, Welsh <hi rend="italic"
                    >hen,</hi> Irish <hi rend="italic">sadann,</hi> salt, Welsh <hi rend="italic"
                    >halen</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">s</hi> when
                    combine! with other consonants has. a prefixed <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> as in
                    Irish <hi rend="italic">searad,</hi> separation, Welsh <hi rend="italic"
                    >ysear.</hi> As regards this change of s into <hi rend="italic">h</hi> British
                    also stands to Irish in the same position as Greek does to Latin, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Latin <hi rend="italic">sal,</hi> Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">aλς.</hi> Like the labialism above pointed out, this change did
                    not, however, constitute an ancient distinction. Irish words can also end in s
                    and <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">n</hi> probably derived
                    from <hi rend="italic">m. Of</hi> these, final <hi rend="italic">s</hi>
                    disappears first, but we have an example of the preservation of a final <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> in so common a word as <hi rend="italic">αthir,</hi>
                    father, when it has lost the initial labial. British has often <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi> or <hi rend="italic">w</hi> for au <hi rend="italic">m</hi> in Irish,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g., louan,</hi> a rope, Irish <hi rend="italic"
                    >loman</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">huvel,</hi> low, Irish <hi
                    rend="italic">humai.</hi> All the dialects of the British do not do this
                    equally; thus Irish <hi rend="italic">αmail, amal,</hi> like, is <hi
                    rend="italic">auel</hi> in Cornish, and <hi rend="italic">euel</hi> in Armorie,
                    but <hi rend="italic">mal</hi> in Welsh. And again the Irish preserves letters
                    where the British loses them; this is especially the case with gutturals, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Irish <hi rend="italic">tech,</hi> house, Welsh <hi
                    rend="italic">ti</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Irish <hi rend="italic"
                    >noeht,</hi> night, Welsh <hi rend="italic">nos</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    Irish <hi rend="italic">teglech,</hi> household, Welsh <hi rend="italic"
                    >teulu.</hi> And, lastly, Irish has preserved the declension of its noun even to
                    this day; and forms closely allied to old Indo-European declensions are found in
                    Old Irish, but with the exception of the genitive in Cornish scarcely a trace of
                    declension is to be found in British. Irish verbal forms are also much better
                    preserved than the British ones, though the latter are in a better state than
                    the nouns.</p>
                <p>As regards the dialects of each branch, the Irish ones differ less from each
                    other than do the British dialects. Irish proper and Scottish Gaelic are
                    practically the same language, and do not differ greatly more than the dialect
                    of English spoken in the Scotch Lowlands does from common English. Such
                    differences as do exist indicate the modern origin of the Scottish Gaelic. Among
                    those differences the following will bear out this opinion. In the genitive
                    plural the initial consonant is not modified, or, as Irish grammarians say, does
                    not suffer ellipsis in Gaelic as it does in Irish. Thus a Highlander says <hi
                    rend="italic">nan cos,</hi> of the feet, where an Irishman would say <hi
                    rend="italic">na g-eοs</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the former would, however,
                    use <hi rend="italic">nam</hi> before a labial, as <hi rend="italic">e.g., nαm
                    fear,</hi> of the men. Again the possessive pronouns <hi rend="italic">ar,</hi>
                    our, <hi rend="italic">bhur,</hi> your, do not cause ellipsis in Gaelic as in
                    Irish, <hi rend="italic">e.g., ar buaehaill,</hi> our boy, Irish <hi
                    rend="italic">ar m-buaehaill</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">bhur
                    eosa,</hi> of your feet, Irish <hi rend="italic">bhar g-cosa.</hi> Again there
                    is the frequent ending of the nominative plural in Gaelic in <hi rend="italic"
                    >an,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">slαtan,</hi> rods, a peculiarity which it
                    shares with Manx and Welsh, and probably derives from British; writing the
                    personal ending <hi rend="italic">-αire,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">-οir</hi> as
                    <hi rend="italic">-air</hi> in Gaelic, <hi rend="italic">e.g., sealgair,</hi> a
                    huntsman, for <hi rend="italic">seal-gaire,</hi> and the personal ending <hi
                    rend="italic">-aidh</hi> as <hi rend="italic">-aiehe</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >-ic!ιe, e.g., eoisiehe</hi> for <hi rend="italic">cοisidhe,</hi> a footman;
                    writing the Irish termination <hi rend="italic">-ugadh</hi> in progressive
                    active nouns as <hi rend="italic">-uehadh, e.g., grαdhαchadh</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">gradhughadh</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> writing the passive
                    participle always hard instead of softening it under certain circumstances, as
                    in Irish, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">ta,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tha</hi><hi rend="italic">; te,</hi><hi rend="italic">the.</hi>
                    Among the less marked differences we may point out the use of the negative <hi
                    rend="italic">eha</hi> in Gaelic for the modern Irish <hi rend="italic">ni</hi>
                    and old <hi rend="italic">nocha,</hi> the more frequent use of the auxiliary
                    verb, id in conjugation, and the absence of <hi rend="italic">f</hi> in the
                    future indicative and in subjunctive in Gaelic. Manx differs from Irish much
                    more than Gaelic; but the dissimilarity is not nearly so great as at first sight
                    it appears to be, owing to a kind of phonetic spelling having been adopted in
                    Manx through which the radical letters have often been lost. Manx has been much
                    corrupted, too, in consequence of the connection between Ireland and the Isle of
                    Man having been cut off by the Norse conquest, and also by its having been under
                    the dominion of Wales for some time; add to which that it never received
                    literary cultivation. The chief differences are in orthography,—the ending of
                    the nominative plural in <hi rend="italic">n</hi> already alluded to, the
                    dropping of a final vowel, the substitution of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">g,</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> or c for <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> in the middle or end of words, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>Of the British dialects Cornish and Armorie resemble each other more than either
                    of them does Welsh. This resemblance is, however, not as great as that of the
                    Irish and Scottish Gaelic, but perhaps as close as that between Spanish and
                    Portuguese, especially if the later borrowings from English and French be
                    excluded. As to the words borrowed by the Cornish from French, which are much
                    more numerous than those taken from English, it is interesting in connection
                    with the history of romance to note that many are borrowed directly from
                    Provençal. The difference between Welsh and Cornish and Armorie is
                    considerable<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0310-0299"/>; Mr Edwin Norris thought it to be as great as
                    that between French and Spanish. Besides the difference in their vocabularies,
                    which is, of course, largely due to the great number of words borrowed by the
                    southern British dialects, especially by Cornish, we may mention the following
                    points in which Cornish differs from Welsh, and these will serve to indicate the
                    general character of the difference between the latter and the southern dialects
                    as a whole :—the retention in Cornish of an initial <hi rend="italic">s</hi>
                    combined with other consonants without prefixing <hi rend="italic">y, eg., scol,
                    scod, gpyryt,</hi> which in Welsh are weakened to <hi rend="italic">ysgol,
                    ysgwydd,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ysprydd</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the
                    diphthongation of vowels in Welsh in eases where Cornish preserves the strong
                    vowel, <hi rend="italic">eg.,</hi> Cornish <hi rend="italic">tron, tom,
                    scouth,</hi> which are in Welsh <hi rend="italic">trwyn, twym,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ysgwyd</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the better preservation of
                    consonants in the middle of words in Cornish than in Welsh, <hi rend="italic"
                    >eg.,</hi> Cornish <hi rend="italic">hanter,</hi><hi rend="italic">steren,
                    valtοvat, canteuil,</hi> which have been reduced in Welsh to <hi rend="italic"
                    >hanner,</hi><hi rend="italic">seren,</hi><hi rend="italic">gwallawiad,
                    canyll</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and lastly the preservation in Cornish of a
                    genitive case in complete conformity with the Irish.</p>
                <p>The 'question naturally suggests itself here, when did the original Celtic stem
                    divide into the two branches described l and again, when did each of those
                    branches produce their dialects l The late Mr Edwin Norris was of opinion that
                    the separation took place after the arrival of the primitive stock in the
                    British Islands. This opinion appears to be in entire conformity with all the
                    facts of the case, ethnological, linguistic, and historical. We have already
                    indicated that the Scottish Gaelic is an essentially modern dialect, which has
                    an existence of only a few centuries. It is probable that pure Irish was spoken
                    in the Isle of Man in the 6th and 7th centuries, that is, Irish exhibiting no
                    greater dialectic variety than existed at the same period between any two
                    provinces of Ireland itself, so that the Manx dialect must have grown up since
                    then. Of the two branches the Irish is the most archaic, that is it has
                    preserved more of the characteristics of the original stem. Among the British
                    dialects the most archaic, that is, the one which best represents the British
                    branch, is Cornish, which is the descendant of the speech of the un-R,omanized
                    Britons of England. This was also the opinion of Mr Norris, who held that the
                    older the Welsh the more closely would it approximate to Cornish. It is indeed
                    probable that the Welsh dialect originated in the 5th and 6th centuries, when
                    the conquests of the Saxons began to isolate Wales from the other
                    British-speaking people. The separation of Cornish and Armorie is still more
                    recent, a fact which supports the story of the emigration of Britons to
                    Armorica, and of long-continued intercourse during the early Middle Ages.</p>
                <p>If the preceding view of the origin of the two branches of Celtic and their
                    respective dialects be correct, it disposes once for all of a very vexed
                    question, namely, did old Gaulish belong to the Irish or to the British type,
                    or, to put it more correctly, to which of those types would the dialects belong
                    which would have grown up in France if Gaulish had not been suppressed by Latin?
                    The usual view has been that the Gaulish belonged to the same type as the
                    British. Grimm’s attempt to prove that the medical incantations contained in the
                    book of Marcellus of Bordeaux, a physician of the 4th century, were Celtic of
                    the Irish type led to a modification of this view. Amédée Thierry assumed that
                    the Gauls proper spoke a dialect of the Irish type, while the Belgae and the
                    Gauls or Galatians of Asia Minor spoke Cymric or British. Such a view implies
                    that Irish and British had already grown out of the original stem before the
                    advent of the Celtic people in the British Islands and Gaul; and further that
                    two distinct waves of Celts had come into Western Europe, the first or oldest
                    being the Goidelic or Irish, and the second the Cymric or British. Edward Lhuyd,
                    the father of Celtic philology, long ago suggested an hypothesis of this kind as
                    an explanation of the occurrence of geographical names in Britain which appeared
                    to him to be Goidelic rather than Cymric. Zeuss threw the weight of his great
                    authority into the scale in favour of the kinship of the old Gaulish and Cymric.
                    The grounds on which he based his opinion have since, however, been altogether
                    explained away, or their force much weakened, especially since the
                    investigations of Gluck and R,oget de Belloguet on the Gaulish vocabulary which
                    has been collected from classic authors and inscriptions, and the increased
                    knowledge of the Celtic dialects, the study of which Zeuss himself so powerfully
                    promoted.</p>
                <p>Mediaeval Irish and Welsh manuscripts contain an extensive body of legendary
                    ethnology, which in the case of the Irish legends has been even fitted with a
                    complete chronology. Setting aside the more fabulous parts of the Irish legends
                    which refer to colonists who arrived a short time before and after the deluge,
                    we find four successive colonies mentioned in the following order :— <hi
                    rend="italic">Nemediaιιs, Firbolgs, Tuatha Dé Danann,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Milesians.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Nemedians</hi> are said to have occupied
                    the country during only two hundred years, when the greater part of them went
                    away in three separate bodies, owing to the harassing attacks made upon them,
                    and their final overthrow, by a people who appear in Irish legends as
                    sea-rovers, called Fomorians. One body took refuge in Britain, another went to
                    Thrace, and the third into the north of Europe. The Thracian party became the
                    ancestors of the second colonizing race, the <hi rend="italic">Firbolgs.</hi>
                    The <hi rend="italic">Nemedians</hi> who went to the north of Europe appear
                    afterwards as the <hi rend="italic">Tuatha Dé Danann;</hi> those who went into
                    Britain became the Britons. According to this legend three of the early tribes
                    which peopled Ireland were of the same race with the Britons. The fourth and
                    latest of the Irish races, the <hi rend="italic">Milesians,</hi> or followers of
                    <hi rend="italic">Miled,</hi> are also connected with the others in the
                    genealogies to be found in Irish manuscripts, but the relationship is much more
                    distant than that which is represented to have existed between the other races.
                    All Irish accounts of the early races inhabiting Ireland agree in bringing <hi
                    rend="italic">Miled</hi> from the north of Spain; but in the early times when
                    the Irish ethnic stories received their present shape, the majority of people,
                    not alone in Ireland, but everywhere, had very imperfect notions of geography,
                    and often applied the few geographical names which had reached their ears by
                    pure hazard, and generally without having more than the vaguest notions of the
                    places they referred to. A perusal of Irish and, we may add, of Welsh poems and
                    tales will bear out what is here stated. Spain in the Milesian story probably
                    means no more than that the Milesians, whoever they were, came from a distance,
                    and not from neighbouring countries with which the early Irish had intercourse.
                    Ethnic traditions as a rule do not add much to our knowledge, but it is always
                    dangerous to ignore them altogether because they must necessarily contain some
                    truth. Of all the Irish traditions of this class those only seem to possess real
                    importance which relate to the mysterious people called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tuatha Dé Danann.</hi> This name appears to mean the tribes of <hi
                    rend="italic">Dé</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ana;</hi> and as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dé</hi> is God, and <hi rend="italic">Ana</hi> is called the mother of the
                    Irish gods, these supposed invading tribes are only the deities in a system of
                    mythology which has yet to be unravelled.</p>
                <p>All these deities descend from a common ancestor, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alldai,</hi> or All-God, and appear to form two lines —the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acs Trebair</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic">es</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Side,</hi> probably analogous to the Teutonic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vanir</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aesir.</hi> The close resemblance between the
                    Irish and Norse words <hi rend="italic">Aes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aesir</hi> can hardly be accidental. The former signifies a people; the latter
                    is connected with the Norse <hi rend="italic">ans</hi> and the Anglo-Saxon <hi
                    rend="italic">ôs,</hi> God, which occurs in many men’s names. The <hi

                    Side,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Asgard</hi> was of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aesir.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Mna Sidhe,</hi> women of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sidh,</hi> or in the singular <hi rend="italic">Bean Sidhe</hi>
                    (pronounced <hi rend="italic">Banshee)</hi> of modern fairy mythology, represent
                    the goddesses of the <hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic">es</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Side.</hi> As in other mythologies, the same deity was endowed
                    with different attributes and received different appellatives. The mediaeval
                    genealogists who looked upon the <hi rend="italic">Tuatha Dé Danann</hi> as a
                    real human race, thought it necessary to provide a place in the genealogies
                    which they invented for every different name, and so added confusion to what was
                    before obscure enough.</p>
                <p>As some of those deities occupy a place in Celtic romance, we shall venture to
                    say a few words about some of them, though at the risk of making one out of
                    several distinct deities, and of making several out of one. Ina subject of
                    inquiry which has been hitherto almost entirely uncultivated, and all but
                    unknown, this is nearly inevitable; but a few mistakes, should we make them,
                    will not seriously interfere with the object we have in view. One of the chief
                    deities of the Irish pantheon was <hi rend="italic">Ogmα,</hi> surnamed <hi
                    rend="italic">Griainaincch,</hi> “of the sun-like face,” son of <hi
                    rend="italic">Eladan,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Elathan,</hi> that is, of
                    knowledge. <hi rend="italic">Ogma</hi> had other appellatives, the most
                    important being <hi rend="italic">Dagda, Delbaith Dana</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tuirenn Bicrenn,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cermait</hi> “of the honey-mouth,”
                    though the last sometimes appears as the son of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dagda.</hi> Under the last appellative his wife is <hi rend="italic">Ana,</hi>
                    the mother of the gods, or the <hi rend="italic">Mòr Bígu,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Mór Rigan</hi> also known by the appellatives of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Badb</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Macha.</hi> As the latter, she was the mother
                    of <hi rend="italic">A cd</hi> (fire), who is probably the <hi rend="italic">Aed
                    Mawr</hi> of Welsh legends, father of <hi rend="italic">Prydain,</hi> the first
                    legendary king of Britain, whence the name <hi rend="italic">Ynys Prydain,</hi>
                    or the Island of <hi rend="italic">Prydain,</hi> and the real origin of the
                    mythical <hi rend="italic">Ha</hi> of the mediaeval bards. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dagda</hi> had another son, whose name was <hi rend="italic">Aengus,</hi> or
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mas 0g,</hi> a celebrated personage of early Irish legend,
                    and an equally celebrated daughter, <hi rend="italic">Brigii,</hi> the goddess
                    of wisdom and judgment. Under the appellative of <hi rend="italic">Dclbailh
                    Dana</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tuirenn Bicrenn</hi> (who is represented as the
                    son of <hi rend="italic">Ogma,</hi> and not that personage himself), <hi
                    rend="italic">Ogma</hi> has two wives, <hi rend="italic">Ana,</hi> under that
                    name, and of her other two appellatives, and <hi rend="italic">Emmas,</hi> who
                    is. represented as the mother of the first-named wife; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ana,</hi> under her various names, is therefore at once the daughter and wife
                    of <hi rend="italic">Delbaith. Ana’s</hi> sons by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dclbaith</hi> are <hi rend="italic">Brian, Iuchair,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iucharba,</hi> who are called the gods of <hi rend="italic">Ana,</hi> and hence
                    she is called the mother of the gods. They are the same as the sons of <hi
                    rend="italic">Germait</hi><hi rend="italic">‘</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi> of the honeymouth,” already mentioned as being an
                    appellative of <hi rend="italic">Ogma</hi> himself, or his sou under that of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dagda.</hi> These sons are <hi rend="italic">Seithoir</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Mas Cuill,</hi> a sea-god, <hi rend="italic">Teühair</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Mas Cccht,</hi> the ruler of the sky and heavenly bodies, to
                    whom the plough was sacred, and <hi rend="italic">Ceithsir</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Mas Greins</hi> (son of the earth), the god of the earth. Their
                    mother was the <hi rend="italic">Etain</hi> of Irish legend; and as she was the
                    wife of <hi rend="italic">Ogma</hi> under that name, it proves that <hi
                    rend="italic">Cermait</hi> “of the honeymouth” was only an appellative for the
                    latter, and not his son, under his appellative the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Da&lt;jda.</hi> The wives of the three gods above mentioned were <hi
                    rend="italic">Banba, Fotla,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Eire,</hi> names under
                    which Ireland was personified. <hi rend="italic">Elcmair</hi> was either a son
                    of <hi rend="italic">Ogma</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Delbaith,</hi> or more
                    probably his brother, and was the same as <hi rend="italic">Tads Mor,
                    Orbsen,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lêr</hi> (the sea). Under the last-named
                    appellative he was god of the sea, and is especially interesting, for in him we
                    have the original of Shakespeare’s King Lear, and the father of <hi
                    rend="italic">Manandan</hi> of Irish and Welsh romance. It is probable that <hi
                    rend="italic">Lêr</hi> was the same as <hi rend="italic">Mas Cuill,</hi> the
                    sea-god above mentioned. There was also a god of war, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ncit</hi> (battle), whose son <hi rend="italic">Escrg</hi> (slaughter) was the
                    father of <hi rend="italic">Diancécht Dia na-cêcht),</hi> the god of the powers
                    (of healing), of <hi rend="italic">Goibniu,</hi> the smith, and of other
                    impersonations of the Arts. The god of healing had a son <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cian</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Conn</hi> (valour), who is also known under
                    other appellatives, such as <hi rend="italic">Scalbalb,</hi> and is sometimes
                    confounded with his wife <hi rend="italic">Ethlenn</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ethne</hi> (skill). His daughters were <hi rend="italic">Airmed,</hi> the
                    goddess of physic, and <hi rend="italic">Etain,</hi> the wife of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ogma,</hi> above mentioned. <hi rend="italic">Ettdenn's</hi> son
                    <hi rend="italic">Lug</hi> is a prominent figure in Celtic romance, and was
                    known also by the names of <hi rend="italic">Lug Lámfada,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Lug</hi> “the long-armed,” <hi rend="italic">En,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sab Ildanach,</hi> or pillar of many arts. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abhcan,</hi> the grandson of <hi rend="italic">Ethlenn</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Conn,</hi> was god of music. <hi rend="italic">Conn,</hi> under
                    his appellative of <hi rend="italic">Scalbalb,</hi> is also made one of the sons
                    of <hi rend="italic">Echaid Garb,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Brcas</hi>
                    (power), personages who fill prominent parts in Irish story. Among the other
                    sons of <hi rend="italic">Echaid</hi> we must mention <hi rend="italic">Badb
                    Derg,</hi> the chief of the <hi rend="italic">Side</hi> of Munster, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Uillind Faebar Derg,</hi> who kills <hi rend="italic">Manandan Mac
                    Lir</hi> in a legend. The deities related to <hi rend="italic">Conn</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Cian,</hi> husband of <hi rend="italic">Ethlenn,</hi> and his son
                    <hi rend="italic">Lug</hi> are called the <hi rend="italic">Acs Trebair,</hi>
                    while those related to the <hi rend="italic">Dagda</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ogma</hi> are the <hi rend="italic">Acs Side</hi> of story. The two tribes
                    appear in contention or warfare, but, nevertheless, occasionally associated and
                    intermarry, like the Teutonic <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic

                    daughter of the god of healing, was the wife of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dagda,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Germait</hi> “of the honeymouth;” and <hi
                    rend="italic">Fea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fernand,</hi> the goddess of war,
                    the wives of <hi rend="italic">Feit or</hi><hi rend="italic">Neid,</hi> the god
                    of war, were the daughters of <hi rend="italic">Elcmair</hi> (great «vil), known
                    also as <hi rend="italic">Lêr.</hi></p>
                <p>Before leaving the subject of the early races of Ireland we shall say a few words
                    upon a people incidentally mentioned above, the Fomorians. In Irish legends they
                    appear as sea-rovers who only occasionally visited the coasts, pillaged and
                    oppressed the people by levying tribute, or rather holding the inhabitants to
                    ransom. One of the principal battles of Irish legendary history is supposed to
                    have been fought between the <hi rend="italic">Tuatha Dé Danann</hi> and the
                    Fomorians. Even did we not know, as in this instance we do, that one of the
                    contending races was mythical, we should naturally be inclined to regard such
                    ethnic quarrels as imaginary, unless where we had unquestionable physical
                    evidence of the occurrence of the struggle. On the other hand, in the case of
                    mythologies which reach us, not as the recorded living belief of a people, but
                    as the traditions of a prehistoric time, clothing real personages, who lived
                    just at the close of that period, in what we might call the twilight of the
                    historic period, and around whom as lay figures gather and assume definite shape
                    fragments of old beliefs, we should always expect to find some nucleus of fact
                    in legends relating to such ethnic wars. That the Fomorian and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tuatha Dé Danann</hi> contests are mythological there can be no doubt, but the
                    kernel of fact around which the myths have gathered is the contests of the Irish
                    and the Romans; in other words we believe the Foraorians to have been the
                    Romans. The latter never made any settlements in Ireland, but there can be no
                    doubt that they kept a few galleys in the western ports of Britain to protect
                    the country from the hostile incursions of the Irish or Scots, and that they
                    often chased these into Irish ports, and forced them to pay ransom. The accounts
                    of the Fomorians in Irish story are just in accordance with this view, which can
                    be supported by other evidence, into which, however, we cannot enter here.</p>
                <p>The Welsh or Cymric ethnic traditions are not so elaborate as the Irish, nor do
                    they in their present form bear the same appearance of antiquity about them.
                    According to the Triads, a peculiar kind of literature to which we shall return
                    hereafter, four classes of tribes entered Britain—the social, the
                    refuge-seeking, the invading, and the treacherous tribes. The social tribes, of
                    which there must have been three to make a triad, were the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cymry,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Jdoegrwys,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brython,</hi> who were all of the same race and closely related. The Cymry like
                    the Irish Firbolgs came from the summer land called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Defroboni</hi> or Greece, or to speak as precisely as the Triads, from “where
                    is now Constantinople, by way of the Hazy Sea,” or German Ocean. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Lloegrwys,</hi> or Loegrians, came from the land of <hi
                    rend="italic">Gwasgwyn</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> not Gascony,
                    however, but the country of the Veneti, about the mouth of the Loire, between
                    whom and the Britons there appears to have been much intercourse in the time of
                    Caesar. The <hi rend="italic">Brython</hi> or Britons came from <hi
                    rend="italic">Llydaw</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> that is Armorica,
                    or rather that part of France which lies between the Seine and the English
                    Channel, and which, therefore, included Normandy as well as Brittany. The
                    refuge-seeking tribes were the <hi rend="italic">Celyddοn</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Gοgled,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gwyddel</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Alba,</hi> and the men of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Galedin.</hi><hi rend="italic">Y G</hi><hi rend="italic">ogled</hi> was
                    apparently a general term among early Welsh writers for all the country between
                    the Ribble and the Clyde inhabited by Britons; but it probably had a more
                    restricted meaning, of which we shall speak presently. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Celyddon</hi> can hardly be other, at least in name, than the Caledonians, and
                    were probably a Pictish tribe which had settled in the great forest district
                    amidst the British people of the Scotch Lowlands. The <hi rend="italic">Gwyddel
                    of Alba</hi> were the Picts, and as the name <hi rend="italic">Gwyddel</hi>
                    implies, they were Gaelic. <hi rend="italic">Gwyddel</hi> is the Welsh form of
                    the old Irish <hi rend="italic">Góidil,</hi> or in its modified later form <hi
                    rend="italic">Goeidhil,</hi> or phonetically <hi rend="italic">Gael.</hi> The
                    men of <hi rend="italic">Galedin,</hi> the present Galloway (Wigtown and
                    Kirkcudbright), were part of the tribe <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n312/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0312-0301"/> known in Ireland as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cruitne,</hi> that is Picts, and only differed from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gwyddel</hi> or Picts of <hi rend="italic">Alba,</hi> in having come into
                    Galloway from Ireland. The three invading tribes were the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corαniαid,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Gwyddel FficJdi,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Saesοn</hi> or Saxons. The <hi rend="italic">Cοraniαid</hi> are
                    said to have come from “the land of <hi rend="italic">Pιvyl,</hi> and they could
                    not be driven out,” but dwelt about the River Humber and the shore of the North
                    Sea. If these be the same as the people known to the Romans as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cοritani,</hi> they were probably Picts of the same tribe as the
                    Irish Picts, for there can be no doubt that <hi rend="italic">Cruitne</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Cοritαni</hi> are the same word. The <hi rend="italic">Gwyddel
                    Ffichtí,</hi> or Irish Picts who came to <hi rend="italic">Alba</hi> by the Sea
                    of <hi rend="italic">Llycklyn</hi> (Norway), that is the North Sea, were
                    doubtless a branch of the same Picts who settled about the Humber, in Galloway,
                    and in Ireland. The three treacherous tribes were the <hi rend="italic">Gwyddel
                    Cοclι</hi> or Red <hi rend="italic">Goidil,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Goel</hi>
                    from Ireland, the men of <hi rend="italic">Llychlyn</hi> or Norsemen, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Saeson</hi> or Saxons. The Triads expressly tell us that the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cyrnry,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Lloegrwys,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Brythοn</hi> were of the same stock. The different tribes of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gwyddel</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gael,</hi> including the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cοraιιiaid,</hi> were simply part of the same people who inhabited
                    Ireland. We therefore assume with Mr W. F. Skene that the Picts and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gael</hi> were the same people.</p>
                <p>It thus appears that all the Celtic inhabitants of the British Islands consisted
                    of two branches, which though originally the same people had branched off from
                    each other in language and in other ways, producing the two classes of Celtic
                    dialects, the Goidelic or Irish and the British, as we have above pointed out.
                    But while we agree with Μ. de Belloguet that the Gauls were one in race and
                    language, and, moreover, believe that the people who inhabited the British
                    Islands were the same as those of Gaul, and that the divergence which we now
                    observe between the Goidelic and British dialects first took place after their
                    arrival, there seems no reason to doubt that the Celtic population flowed into
                    these islands in two streams, one from the neighbouring Gaul, and one from some
                    country east of Gaul by way of the North Sea,—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cοretani,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Gwyddel Ffichti</hi> from about the Forth,
                    the Irish <hi rend="italic">Gmitne,</hi> and the Scots forming part of the
                    latter stream, and, if our conjecture be correct, the latest comers, a view in
                    harmony with ethnic traditions, but differing from the ordinary opinion that the
                    so-called <hi rend="italic">Cymry</hi> came long after the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Goidil,</hi> and drove them westward, they themselves being in turn pushed in
                    the same direction by the incoming Saxons.</p>
                <p>It would be interesting to pursue the subject of the ethnology of the early races
                    of the British Islands through the conflicts and displacements of races which
                    took place between the landing of Caesar and the final retirement of the Romans
                    in the 5th century. But as this is not absolutely necessary for the illustration
                    of a literature which only dates from the latter event, we shall content
                    ourselves with giving a sketch of the ethnic distribution of the people of
                    Britain resulting from the conflicts and displacements referred to as it existed
                    in the beginning of the 6th century, when we are on sure ground in the history
                    and literature of Ireland at least. Without such a preliminary sketch much that
                    we shall have to say of great importance in the history of Celtic literature
                    would be unintelligible.</p>
                <p>In the end of the 5th and beginning of the 6th centuries external invasions had
                    ceased, and the different races had gathered into separate states, and commenced
                    a struggle for mastery. In England the Saxons (using that term as a collective
                    name for Saxons proper, Frisians, Angles, and Jutes) held possession of the
                    southern and eastern coast from Dorsetshire to the Humber—the Angles chiefly
                    occupying what is now Suffolk, Norfolk, and Lincoln—and were gradually making
                    themselves masters of Central England towards the Severn, and were even
                    penetrating northwards between the vale of the Ouse and the Pennine Chain, into
                    what is now the West Riding of Yorkshire. With the exception, perhaps, of the
                    immediate neighbourhood of the south-eastern coast, where the continuous arrival
                    of fresh bands of Saxons had driven away the British inhabitants, and of the
                    district about the Humber where in like manner the fresh bands of Angles
                    continually coming must have done the same, we are not to assume, as is usually
                    done, that the former British inhabitants, called by the Welsh <hi rend="italic"
                    >Llοeyrwys</hi> or Loegrians, had all been exterminated, or driven away. On the
                    contrary as the Saxons advanced inwards and the external invasion practically
                    ceased, an increasing proportion of Britons must have been left. The new comers
                    merely dispossessed the British ruling families, as the Norsemen did in
                    Normandy, and as happened afterwards in Ireland, and left the bulk of the
                    peasants. This was unquestionably the case in Central and Western England, and
                    in Deira and Bemicia, the present counties of York, Northumberland, Durham, and
                    the eastern Lowlands of Scotland. Cornwall and Devon were independent British
                    kingdoms. What the Saxons had done on the southern and eastern coast the Irish
                    did on the west. We cannot enter here into the question of when the Irish
                    occupation of Western England commenced, or how long it lasted; there is no
                    doubt, however, now that iu the 5th century they occupied a considerable part of
                    Gwynned, or that part of North Wales now forming Anglesea, Carnarvon, Merioneth,
                    Denbigh, and Flintshire; and Demetia, or that part of South Wales now forming
                    Cardigan, Pembroke, and Carmarthen, or in other words, the north and west coast
                    of Wales. But while the Saxons were gradually displacing the British rule in the
                    east, the Britons were gradually dispossessing the Irish in the west. The
                    leaders of these Britons were the descendants of a certain <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cunedda,</hi> reputed to have been a <hi rend="italic">Gwyddel</hi> or Pict of
                    the east of Scotland. Another <hi rend="italic">Gwyddel,</hi> but probably one
                    from Ireland, who like <hi rend="italic">Cunedda</hi> was said to have married a
                    British wife, <hi rend="italic">Brychan,</hi> has given his name to Brecon or
                    Brecknockshire. <hi rend="italic">Brychan</hi> may, however, have been only the
                    eponymous ancestor of the Goidelic families of Brecon.</p>
                <p>The west of Britain from the Dee to the Clyde, with the exception of Galloway,
                    was occupied by independent British tribes, apparently confederated for purposes
                    of war. On the eastern side between the Humber and the Tyne was <hi
                    rend="italic">Dyfer</hi> or Deira, also British at this period; and north of
                    Deira, was <hi rend="italic">Bryneixh</hi> or Bernicia, which extended to the
                    Forth. These two states probably formed in the beginning of the 6th century part
                    of a confederation of Cumbrian states. But in the course of that century they
                    seem to have been gradually converted into Anglian states without any serious
                    displacement of population, or even of ruling families. On the shore of the
                    Firth of Forth was a district called in Welsh <hi rend="italic">Guοtοdin,</hi>
                    the eastern part of which about the Pentland Hills was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >AIanau Guοtοdin,</hi> and was occupied by a tribe of Goidelic or Irish Picts,
                    who, there is reason to believe, had also settlements in other parts of <hi
                    rend="italic">Bryndch</hi> along the east coast. It was from this tribe that <hi
                    rend="italic">Cunxdda,</hi> if, as is probable, he was not an eponymous
                    ancestor, had sprung. The remainder of <hi rend="italic">Guοtοdin,</hi> between
                    the Lammermoor Hills and the sea, seems to have been also at least partially
                    occupied by another foreign people, most probably Frisians. On the western side,
                    in what is now Argyllshire, north of the Clyde, a settlement of Scots, who had
                    gradually leaked in there from the opposite coast of Ireland, had been formed,
                    and had become organized into a distinct state which was ultimately destined to
                    absorb the whole of Scotland, and give it its present name. The remainder of the
                    country north of the Forth and Clyde was occupied by the Picts, <pb break="no"

                    akin to, indeed almost identical with, the Irish. In Galloway was another branch
                    of Picts, called <hi rend="italic">Gwyddel Fficldi</hi> by the Welsh, that is,
                    Goidelic or Irish Picts, part of the <hi rend="italic">Cruitne</hi> who leaked
                    over from Ireland like the Scots.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the 6th century the Romanized Britons were giving way
                    everywhere before the Teutonic tribes, and the only independent territory which
                    they appear to have held comprised—(1) The Damnonian kingdom of Devon and
                    Cornwall; (2) the part of Eastern Wales now forming Montgomeryshire and
                    Radnorshire, which later formed the principality or lordship of <hi
                    rend="italic">Powys,</hi> and perhaps even yet aÛ the land to the Severn, that
                    is, Herefordshire and Shropshire; (3) Cumbria, that is, all the land from the
                    Ribble to the Solway west of the Pennine chain, and all the Lowlands of Scotland
                    to the Roman Wall, save Galloway, and <hi rend="italic">Guotodin,</hi> or
                    Linlithgow (including part of Stirlingshire),Edinburgh, and Haddingtonshire; <hi
                    rend="italic">(4) Brynewh,</hi> Bernicia, that is, Berwickshire, Durham, and
                    Northumberland; (5) <hi rend="italic">Dyfr,</hi> or Deira, that is, Yorkshire.
                    The ancient dioceses of Scotland, even as they existed in the 13th century, seem
                    to mark out very well the ethnic condition of the Lowlands in the early part of
                    the 6th century. The diocese of Galloway included the territory of the Irish
                    Picts; the diocese of Lothian, which had three rural deaneries—(1) Linlithgow,
                    or <hi rend="italic">Manau Guοtodin</hi> (comprising the shire of that name,
                    part of Stirlinghshire, and the most of Edinburgh), occupied by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Brithwyr,</hi> a mixed race of Picts and Britons, according to Mr
                    Skene; (2) Haddington and the remainder of Edinburgh, that is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guotοdin,</hi> in which, as we have said, there was an early settlement of
                    Frisians, or Angles; and (3) Merse, that is, Berwick. The continued existence of
                    a Goidelic or Pictish population on the south side of the Firth of Forth, even
                    in Berwickshire, down to as late as the 8th century at least, seems to be shown
                    by the existence there of churches belonging to the ancient diocese of Dunkeld.
                    In the 13th century they formed a separate deanery of that diocese, which
                    appears to have corresponded with the Goidelic population of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guotodín. Prydain,</hi> the Cymric or true British country of the Lowlands, was
                    consequently conterminous with the diocese of Glasgow, comprising the five rural
                    deaneries of Glasgow proper—Rutherglen, Lennox, Lanark, Kyle and Cunniughame,
                    and Carrick; and the four deaneries of the archdeaconry of Teviotsdale,—
                    Teviotsdale, Peebles, Nithsdale, and Annandale. This was the region called <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Gogled,</hi> though it is probable that
                    this term was applied to the whole of the independent British territory, that
                    is, Cumbria as well as <hi rend="italic">Prydaìn</hi> proper; but whatever was
                    its extent, <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Gogled</hi> was the cradle
                    of the language and literature of Wales. It was the country of its prehistoric
                    poets Aneurin and Llywarch Hên, and of the seer Merlin, whose fame was so great
                    in the Middle Ages, and who is also reckoned among the early poets of the
                    Welsh.</p>
                <p>To complete this ethnic picture of Britain at the dawn of Celtic literature it
                    would be necessary to give a sketch of the political and social state of the
                    various Celtic tribes, so far as we could directly or by induction ascertain it.
                    But as the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Brehon</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Law</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Clans</hi> give perhaps enough of this kind
                    of information for the purpose we have in view, we refer the readers to those
                    articles.</p>
                <p>In the earlier stages of tribal organization among the Aryans and other races,
                    the chief was priest as well as king. But the Celts appear to have already
                    passed into a higher political stage before they came within the light of
                    history, and to have established a distinct priesthood known to us as that of
                    the Druids. Greek and Roman writers give us very little information on this
                    subject, and the early Welsh records and poetry none at all. Modem Welsh writers
                    have, however, made up for this want in their genuine literature by inventing an
                    elaborate Druidical system of religion and philosophy, which, they pretend,
                    survived the introduction of Christianity, and was secretly upheld by the Welsh
                    bards in the Middle Ages. This neo-Druidic imposture has found numerous
                    adherents, and has been supported with a good deal of misspent learning by
                    several persons of considerable talent. It would be a waste of time to say
                    anything further on the subject here. In Irish poems and tales Druids, and other
                    organized learned classes, are frequently mentioned. From an analysis of these,
                    and aided by whatever light the classical writers throw on the Druidism of Gaul
                    and Britain, we may make the following induction as to their position and
                    organization in Ireland, where they cannot have been very different from what
                    they were in other Celtic countries. There are no definite accounts of the
                    religious rites practised bj the pagan Irish, but there are several allusions,
                    which, though vague, plainly show that such rites existed, and that it was one
                    of the functions of the Druids to perform them. The Druids also invoked the
                    divinities in favour of their friends and against their enemies, and for this
                    purpose they made incantations upon a mound or elevated ground near the field of
                    battle. They determined, by auguries from the heavenly bodies, clouds, wind,
                    smoke, the flight of birds, and other phenomena, the propitious and unpropitious
                    times for fighting a battle, or doing any other important action. They announced
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gaesa</hi> or things which it would be unlucky for a chief
                    or a tribe to do, foretold future events, practised incantations of various
                    kinds, kept events in remembrance^ and were, in a word, the depositaries of such
                    knowledge às was possessed in Ireland at the time. Many of these functions
                    belong equally to the persons usually called poets, and among the qualifications
                    of the higher grade of the latter was a knowledge of certain kinds of
                    incantation, some of which involved many pagan rites, the practice of which we
                    find distinctly ascribed to Druids. That the latter were therefore only a higher
                    degree of the order of poets seems certain. As such they naturally performed or
                    superintended all the higher pagan rites, and hence the whole order, of which
                    they were the highest representatives, were called Druids. After the
                    introduction of Christianity the hieratic functions of the Druids ceased, and
                    the term Druid, which had been the special appellative of the poets who
                    performed those functions, gradually fell into desuetude. But the order of which
                    they were the highest exponents did not disappear as it did in Gaul; there its
                    lay functions were swept away by Roman law, whereas in Ireland they acquired new
                    vigour. In pagan times the poets enjoyed great power and many privileges, both
                    of which they are said to have abused to such an extent that it was proposed to
                    banish them altogether out of Ireland. Through the intercession of the mythical
                    king of Ulster, <hi rend="italic">Conchοbar Mac</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nessa,</hi> this, we are told, was not done; their number was, however,
                    diminished, and their power and privileges curtailed. Among other changes said
                    to have been then effected was that of depriving the poets of the functions of
                    judge, which they had hitherto performed. This legend indicates the existence at
                    some period immediately preceding the introduction of Christianity of a struggle
                    between the lay and the spiritual power, in which the former were to some extent
                    successful. The struggle continued even into Christian times, for in the 6th
                    century it was again proposed to banish them, but on this occasion they were
                    protected by St Columcillé, not, however, without a further diminution of their
                    number and loss of power.</p>
                <p>The organization of the learned classes, as we find it described in Irish
                    manuscripts, is no doubt to be referred to the <hi rend="italic">Dal</hi> or
                    parliament holden at Druimceta about the year 575, at which were present the
                    king of the Dalriadic <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n314/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0314-0303"/> or Scotic kingdom, the paramount king of Ireland,
                    and many sub-reguli, and prominent above all St Columcillé. According to this
                    organization there were three grades or orders,—the <hi rend="italic">Gradh
                    Ecna,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Gradh Fene,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gradh Fili. Ecιιa,</hi> wisdom, meant general as distinguished from special
                    professional knowledge. A graduate of <hi rend="italic">Ecna</hi> was called a
                    <hi rend="italic">Sai,</hi> sage, but there appear to have been several degrees
                    of the title, the highest of which was the <hi rend="italic">Ollamh Sai,</hi>
                    sometimes called also the <hi rend="italic">Rosai,</hi> or very sage, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Sai leitre,</hi> lettered sage. <hi rend="italic">Ollamh</hi>
                    (pron. <hi rend="italic">Ollave</hi> ∖ we may remark, was the title of the
                    highest degree in any profession. An <hi rend="italic">Ollarnh Sai</hi> had the
                    rank and was entitled to the retinue of a <hi rend="italic">Rig Tuatha,</hi> or
                    tribe king. All questions between the different tribes, the interpretation of
                    the laws, the succession to chieftainships, and similar questions were decided
                    by them. They were the genealogists or historians of the chiefs or kings. In
                    pagan times the <hi rend="italic">Gradh Ecna,</hi> which was only a branch of
                    the order, call it which we will, of Druids or poets, was probably the highest,
                    judging by the dignity and privilege of its <hi rend="italic">Ollamh,</hi> and
                    consequently the one whose members were specially called Druids. If this view be
                    correct, it was to this branch that the functions of judge originally belonged.
                    When the right of judgment passed from the Druids into the hands of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rig,</hi> or chief, the latter no doubt acted as judge himself, or
                    appointed some one to fill his place. This judge was called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Breithe%m,</hi> or as he is called from the pronunciation of the modern form of
                    the word, a Brehon, and was always in early times a <hi rend="italic">Sai,</hi>
                    for <hi rend="italic">Fenechas,</hi> or law, formed part of the knowledge
                    comprised under the term <hi rend="italic">Ecna,</hi> a fact which strongly
                    supports the view above expressed, that the <hi rend="italic">Sai</hi> was the
                    successor of the Druid. In time the practice of law grew into a distinct
                    profession, and every <hi rend="italic">Breitheam</hi> of the higher class, that
                    is every one who was a <hi rend="italic">Sai,</hi> kept a kind of law school.
                    Thus arose the <hi rend="italic">Gradh Fene,</hi> or lawyers. One of the causes
                    which no doubt helped to separate the study of <hi rend="italic">Fenechas,</hi>
                    or law, from the general study of <hi rend="italic">Ecna,</hi> or wisdom, was
                    the rise of schools in connection with religious establishments.</p>
                <p>The class of persons whom we have above designated as poets were called <hi
                    rend="italic">File</hi> in Irish, and their art <hi rend="italic">FUidecld.</hi>
                    The latter is usually translated poetry, but it was rather vaticination in which
                    they used verse. The <hi rend="italic">Fili</hi> truly represents the Oùáretç,
                    or vates, who formed one of the orders of Druids, mentioned by Strabo. Some of
                    the forms of incantation practised by the <hi rend="italic">Fili</hi> are
                    described in Irish manuscripts, and, as we have stated above, are attributed to
                    the Druid as well as to the <hi rend="italic">Fili.</hi> Those which involved
                    pagan rites, and which were consequently forbidden by St Patrick, fell into
                    desuetude with the name Druid; but simple incantations by rhymes continued to be
                    practised in Christian times. One of these, the <hi rend="italic">Glam
                    Dichinn,</hi> or an incantation of satirical verses accompanied by certain
                    ceremonies, which was believed to be capable of raising blisters on the face,
                    was much used, and supplies, perhaps, one reason of the great sensitiveness of
                    Celts to satire. The <hi rend="italic">Fili</hi> appears to have been
                    distinguished in early times by some kind of tonsure, the exact nature of which
                    we do not understand. Perhaps it was the same as that afterwards used by the
                    Christian priests, which was one of the causes of difference between the early
                    Irish Church and the Roman Church. It is at all events worthy of remark that the
                    Irish priests were reproached with having the tonsure of Simon Magus, who in
                    those times was the representative of all magicians or others who practised
                    necromancy or vaticination. There were several degrees of the order of <hi
                    rend="italic">Fili,</hi> the highest being the <hi rend="italic">Ollamh
                    Fili,</hi> as we have already pointed out. A <hi rend="italic">Fili</hi> of this
                    rank was entitled to keep, that is, to have supported for him, a greyhound, a
                    beagle, four stallions, two mares, and their foals —the maintenance of the
                    horses, being we are told, at the expense of the church. The king fostered the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ollarnh’s</hi> sons as if they were his own; and the queen was
                    bound to give dowries to his daughters. In return for all these emoluments and
                    privileges the <hi rend="italic">Fili,</hi> or poet, was bound to furnish a
                    panegyric of the prince annually. In fact the chief function of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fili</hi> when he became a mere poet was to eulogize the chief,
                    and the chiefs family and ancestors. The designation, given to the Gaulish
                    bards, of parasites wh(5 attended the Gaulish warriors on military expeditions
                    to celebrate their praise, by Posidonius the Rhodian Stoic, who visited Gaul
                    about 100 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> applies with equal truth to the Irish
                    <hi rend="italic">Fili.</hi> The flattery was not given without hope of reward,
                    however. In the glossary attributed to Cormac, who was at the same time king and
                    bishop at Cashel in the 9th century, which is at least as old as the 10th
                    century, we are told that the reason why the second degree of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fili</hi> was called an <hi rend="italic">Anruth</hi> was because of “the rich
                    stream <hi rend="italic">(Sruth)</hi> of beautiful praise which flows from him,
                    and the stream of treasures which flows to him in return.” This was exactly the
                    sentiment of the Gaulish bard who in eulogizing the magnificence of Bituitus the
                    A,vernian chief said, “From the track of his chariotwheels sprang gold and
                    blessings to mortals.” An <hi rend="italic">0llamh,</hi> or as we might call him
                    a doctor, in <hi rend="italic">FiUdecht</hi> was entitled to have a certain
                    number of scholars who formed his retinue when he went abroad. One of his
                    privileges was to make a circuit at certain times, the extent of which depended
                    upon his rank. When, for instance, an <hi rend="italic">0llamh Fili</hi> became
                    chief poet, and was invested with the <hi rend="italic">Tugen,</hi> or cloak
                    trimmed with white feathers, the symbol of his office, he might make a circuit
                    of Ireland. During his circuit the <hi rend="italic">0Uamh Fili</hi> was
                    entitled to maintenance and protection for a certain time, not only for himself
                    but for his legal retinue, and their horses and dogs also. They could not,
                    however, remain beyond the fixed legal time without special invitation. A <hi
                    rend="italic">Fili,</hi> or indeed any of the recognized learned professions,
                    could not claim hospitality as a right from any one below a certain rank, which
                    was measured by his own.</p>
                <p>The bards who recited poems and stories formed at first a distinct branch from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Fili.</hi> According as the true <hi rend="italic"
                    >Filidecht</hi> fell into desuetude, and the <hi rend="italic">Fili</hi> became
                    simply a poet, the two orders practically coalesced, and the names <hi
                    rend="italic">Fili</hi> and bard became synonymous. There were several degrees
                    of bards, according to the number of poems and stories which the graduate should
                    be able to recite. In pagan times, and during the Middle Ages, the Irish bards,
                    like the Gaulish ones, accompanied their recitation of poems on a stringed
                    instrument called a <hi rend="italic">Crut,</hi> believed to have been a harp.
                    The bard was therefore to the <hi rend="italic">Fili,</hi> or poet, what the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jogler</hi> was to the <hi rend="italic">Troubadour,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Jongleur</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Trouvère.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Cruitire,</hi> or harper, who likewise played upon a kind of Rote
                    called a <hi rend="italic">Timpan,</hi> and who belonged to the privileged
                    classes, while the players on other instruments did not, was probably the
                    representative of the true bard.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting points in the history of Celtic literature is the
                    relation of the transformed Druidic hierarchy just described to the Christian
                    church. Independent of its own intrinsic interest some knowledge of this is
                    necessary in order to understand the system of schools in Ireland in the early
                    Middle Ages, and the position which the native literature occupied in them.
                    Before stating what we have to say on the latter subjects we must therefore
                    briefly describe the character of the early Irish Church.</p>
                <p>The presence of British bishops at several councils, and the production of so
                    distinguished a heresiarch as Pelagius, prove that there must have been an
                    organized church in Britain in the 4th century. At that period there were many
                    populous towns there, and much of the culture of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n315/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0315-0304"/> a rich Roman province. The British Church must,
                    therefore, have been organized upon the municipal type as in the rest of the
                    Roman empire; that is, the jurisdiction of the bishops must have coincided with
                    the civil government of the Romans, out of which the later diocesan system grew.
                    The intercourse, partly commercial, partly hostile, which took place between
                    Britain and Ireland in the 3d and 4th centuries could scarcely have failed to
                    introduce Christianity into the latter country. Mediaeval writers state that
                    Christianity existed in Ireland before St Patrick; and Celestius, the chief
                    disciple of Pelagius, and, according to St Augustine, the real leader of the
                    Pelagians, was an Irishman. Indeed, if we can trust the statement of Genadius,
                    who flourished at the end of the 6th century, the parents of Celestins must not
                    only have been Christians in Ireland in the year 369, but must have known the
                    use of letters, for, according to the writer quoted, Celestius wrote three
                    letters, in the form of little books, on the things necessary for all desirous
                    of serving God. This primitive Irish Church appears to have been principally, if
                    not altogether, confined to the south of Ireland, the province of Munster
                    forming an independent kingdom at this period, or at least one having but little
                    political connection with the other provinces. In after times, when the fame of
                    St Patrick had become established, and he came to be regarded as the sole
                    apostle of Ireland, the saints of the primitive church, many of whose names have
                    come down to us, were assumed to have belonged to the Patrician period, or were
                    confounded with persons of the same name. In this way St Brendan, the voyager,
                    born on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean in the county of Kerry, has been
                    confounded with a later St Brendan who lived in the centre of Ireland. The
                    church which grew up in the south of Ireland, though the offspring of the
                    British Church, must necessarily have adapted itself to the political and social
                    organization of the country, which was altogether tribal, and being without
                    walled towns had none of the elements of municipal government which had moulded
                    the church organization elsewhere. Some of the Irish legendary lives of saints
                    of the early church, though, in the form in which we have them, not older than
                    from the 12th to the 14th century, give us amidst a luxuriant growth of
                    prodigies an insight into this highly interesting church, which the subsequent
                    conversion of the rest of Ireland by St Patrick merely extended, but did not
                    change. When a missionary had converted a chief and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Occa,</hi> or principal men, he became an adopted member of the tribe, and was
                    considered to be a <hi rend="italic">Sai</hi>; in other words, he was given the
                    same rank and privileges as the pagan priests had. Beyond building a round
                    wicker oratory for the priest, no change whatever was made in the organization
                    of the tribe. The course of study for the different grades of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecna, Filideclιt,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Feηechas</hi> went on as before,
                    except that in the course of <hi rend="italic">Ecna,</hi> or wisdom, the
                    Christian doctrine was added. The practice of the different kinds of verbal
                    incantation which did not involve distinct pagan rites some centuries later by
                    the poets shows this. Fasting, prayer, and vigils were practised, and those who
                    wished to embrace the ecclesiastical state, that is, to join the new learned
                    class called later the <hi rend="italic">Grαdh Eclasa,</hi> or grade of the
                    church, tonsured themselves, as did the students of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Filideeld</hi> also, as we have before said. The <hi rend="italic">Dun, or</hi>
                    fortified residence, of the chief, around which lay always a village of the
                    different classes of people who constituted the retainers of an Irish chief,
                    became a kind of <hi rend="italic">Cenobinm</hi> of a novel type. Some members
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Fine,</hi> or “House,” desirous of practising a higher
                    degree of asceticism, went into the march-land, or waste land of the territory,
                    and built a wicker hut and oratory. Others followed, and built their huts all
                    around, and a new Cenobium, consisting of a village of huts and a circular
                    oratory gradually grew up, which differed from the original one only by the
                    absence of the ramparts and ditch forming the <hi rend="italic">Dun.</hi>
                    Afterwards the round tower, which was a mere extension of the circular stone <hi
                    rend="italic">Caisel,</hi> itself an imitation in stone of a circular
                    wicker-house—afforded a refuge and place of safety for preserving from fire and
                    theft the sacred vessels and books belonging to those religious establishments,
                    which were directly established for religious purposes.</p>
                <p>Whether a single <hi rend="italic">Fine</hi> or the collection of “Houses”
                    forming a <hi rend="italic">Tuatlι,</hi> or tribe, became Christian, they were
                    all of the same blood, and the right of succession to the property and
                    government of the church remained with the <hi rend="italic">Fine</hi> or
                    “House” of the donor. The church within each <hi rend="italic">Τuath,</hi> or
                    tribe, which constituted the unit state of the Irish political system, was
                    simply a spiritual <hi rend="italic">Fine,</hi> or “House,” and could receive
                    and hold land only in the same way as any other <hi rend="italic">Fine.</hi>
                    Hence the <hi rend="italic">Comorb</hi> (coheir), or successor of the founder of
                    a Cenobium, might be, and frequently was, a layman. This explains, too, the
                    aristocratic character of the saints of the early Irish Church, who all
                    necessarily belonged to the families of the chiefs, as the unfree classes could
                    not form <hi rend="italic">Fines,</hi> or “Houses,” or enter those in existence,
                    except by adoption according to legal forms. When a person of low birth appears
                    among the saints we are sure to have some legend showing how he came to be
                    adopted by somebody. As a consequence of this system all the Cenobia which grew
                    out of the first, and the chapels which were established in connection with
                    Cenobia to supply the religious wants of districts remote from the latter,
                    remained under the government of the parent establishment. Nay more, the Cenobia
                    founded in neighbouring countries by missionaries often continued to acknowledge
                    the headship of the parent establishment. They formed, in fact, a religious
                    clan, in which the abbot of the parent establishment exercised the same kind of
                    authority as the head of the ordinary clan. In this way it often happened that
                    bishops, notwithstanding the higher order of their functions, were under the
                    jurisdiction of priests, and even of women, as in the case of St Brigit. This
                    peculiar organization of the church continued to exist unaltered in Ireland
                    during several centuries, indeed with few changes, chiefly relating to the
                    position of bishops, down to the Norman Conquest. The Irish carried this
                    organization with them into Wales, Scotland, England, Gaul, Germany, and
                    Switzerland, where it was finally supplanted by the Benedictine order.</p>
                <p>When a <hi rend="italic">Dun,</hi> and its surrounding village, in which lived
                    the various classes who formed the household and retainers of a chief, became a
                    kind of Cenobium, in which were associated together those who had formally
                    adopted a religious life and those who had not, we can understand how a school
                    could grow up in which <hi rend="italic">Ecna, Filidecht,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Fenechas</hi> should be taught along with Latin and Christian
                    knowledge. But even in the case of Cenobia which had a direct religious origin
                    the same thing took place, because many persons of those professions embraced a
                    religious life, and came there with their pupils, either with the object of
                    increasing their own knowledge, or to partake of the literary life of the place.
                    In the 6th century some of those schools had already acquired considerable
                    reputation; while in the 7th and 8th centuries some had grown into small towns,
                    and were much frequented by strangers. Bede-tells us that in 664 many of the
                    nobility and lower ranks of the English nation were in Ireland leading a
                    monastic life, or attending the schools, “going about from one master’s cell
                    (hut) to another.” Incidentally we learn that one of those schools, namely, <hi
                    rend="italic">(Jill Belaigh,</hi> had seven streets of huts occupied by
                    foreigners in the first half of the 8th century. From all this it will be seen
                    that <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n316/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0316-0305"/> the teachers in the Irish schools, even when
                    connected with Cenobia, or later with monasteries, were not necessarily
                    ecclesiastics. Indeed some of the most distinguished men who taught in them were
                    laymen, such as Mac Coise, Colman O’Cluasaigh, &amp;c.; and even Flann, surnamed
                    of the monastery, who was head-master of the school of St <hi rend="italic"
                    >Buite,</hi> now Monasterboyce, in the first half of the 11th century, was a
                    layman and married. This explains the circumstance, so unusual in other
                    countries in the Middle Ages, of so distinguished a scholar as Johannes Scotus
                    Erigeua being a layman.</p>
                <p>The course of instruction included under the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Filidecht,</hi> which an <hi rend="italic">Ollamk Fili</hi> passed through, as
                    laid down in a special tract called the <hi rend="italic">Leabhar
                    Ollanιhan,</hi> or Book of Ollaves, occupied twelve years, eight of which were
                    devoted to learning to read and write the grammar of the Irish language, the
                    laws of the privileged classes, <hi rend="italic">Filidecht</hi> proper, which
                    besides vaticination, &amp;c., included whatever knowledge was then possessed of
                    the phenomena of nature, the elements of philosophy, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dinnsenchas</hi> or historical topography, and learning by heart about 270
                    tales and a number of poems, and the secret language of the poets, &lt;fcc, The
                    ninth and tenth years were devoted to the composition of various kinds of
                    poetry; the eleventh year was employed in composing fifty major and fifty minor
                    specimens of verse requiring the use of four kinds of metre. The studies of the
                    twelfth year consisted in the composition of six orations, and the study of the
                    art of poetry according to the precepts of four different authors, whose
                    treatises are unfortunately either lost or unknown. The last two years of the
                    course were for those who proposed to become <hi rend="italic">0llamhs.</hi>
                    Whatever may have been the character of the teaching or the value of the
                    outcome, it is the earliest example of the cultivation of any vulgar language in
                    Europe. As an example of the importance attached to the native literature, it
                    may be mentioned that the head-master of a school was obliged to go through the
                    course just indicated, as well as to know Latin, “and from the Ten Commandments
                    to the whole of the Scriptures.” The school here implied would be one of those
                    connected with a Cenobium, or monastery, and had usually six teachers. The
                    lowest of these taught the students to recite the psalms; the second taught the
                    course of native literature just described up to the end of the 10th year. The
                    fourth master taught Latin, arithmetic, and the elements of astronomy and
                    geography; the fifth master was professor of divinity; and the sixth was the
                    head-master, who was supposed to know the whole course, both profane and
                    sacred.</p>
                <p>Iu discussing the outcome of this system of education we can here of course take
                    cognizance only of what has been written in Irish, and must consequently leave
                    out of consideration the Latin hymns of the early church, the writings of
                    Columbanus, Sidil or Sedulius, Johannes Scotus, Adamnan, and others who wrote in
                    Latin. For the same reason we must in speaking of existing Irish manuscripts
                    leave out of consideration the Latin ones, among which are some of the most
                    remarkable illuminated books in Europe, such as the Book of Kells. In the
                    Ambrosian Library in Milan, the libraries of the convent of St Gall and of Bern
                    in Switzerland, of the University of Würzburg, and of Carlsruhe, there are
                    several Latin manuscripts glossed more or less copiously with explanatory Irish
                    words. There is also in the town library of Cambray a manuscript containing the
                    canons of an Irish council held in 684, in the middle of which is preserved a
                    fragment of an Irish sermon on selfdenial. These manuscripts, some of which
                    belong to the 8th century and the others to the 9th, furnished materials to
                    Zeuss for his <hi rend="italic">Grammatica Celtica,</hi> a work which created an
                    epoch in Celtic philology. With the exception of the last-mentioned none of
                    these manuscripts contain a continuous Old Irish text. But according to Mone
                    there is in the convent of St Paul, somewhere iu Carinthia, a manuscript
                    altogether in Irish, containing among other pieces poems, copies of which are to
                    be found in manuscripts of the 14th century in Ireland. In the Royal Library at
                    Copenhagen there is one manuscript, partly vellum and partly paper, containing
                    Irish poems, which formerly belonged to Professor Thorkelin, but we do not know
                    its age. The manuscripts formerly belonging to the Irish College at Louvain were
                    dispersed, the better portion being taken to the Franciscan convent of St
                    Isidore at Rome, where they remained until within the last five or six years,
                    when they were brought to the convent of the same order in Dublin. The remainder
                    of the Louvain manuscripts, consisting chiefly of copies of Irish lives of the
                    saints made for Colgan when preparing his <hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum,</hi>
                    are now in the Royal Library at Brussels. These are all the Irish manuscripts
                    now known to exist on the Continent. The Irish manuscripts in the United Kingdom
                    are very numerous, and by good fortune the majority of them, and these the most
                    valuable, are in public libraries, and are thus at once more accessible to
                    scholars and safer from fire, the danger by which Welsh literature has already
                    suffered much loss. The number of Irish manuscripts which formerly existed must
                    have been considerable if the <hi rend="italic">File</hi> were as industrious as
                    they were numerous and well rewarded. More than thirty books are mentioned by
                    special names as sources from which some of the most important existing
                    manuscripts were compiled, which are now lost, although some of them existed as
                    late as the 17th century. Nearly all the most valuable existing books are to be
                    found in four public libraries, namely, those of the Royal Irish Academy and
                    Trinity College, Dublin, the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and the British Museum.
                    The collection of Irish manuscripts belonging to the Royal Irish Academy is the
                    largest of all, and comprises, besides a large number of paper manuscripts
                    containing many things not found elsewhere, the valuable vellum manuscripts, <hi
                    rend="italic">Leabhar na h-Uidhri</hi> or Book of the Dun Cow, the Book of
                    Ballymote, the Book of Lecan, the <hi rend="italic">Leabhar Breac</hi> or
                    Speckled Book, the Book of Fermoy. Next in importance stands the collection of
                    Trinity College, Dublin, which contains the Book of Leinster (the most valuable
                    from a literary point of view of all existing manuscripts), the yellow Book of
                    Lecan, and a number of other manuscripts full of poems and prose tales, besides
                    the most valuable of the existing law manuscripts. The collection in the
                    Bodleian Library, though consisting we believe of only sixteen volumes, is very
                    valuable. Besides a rare law manuscript it includes a manuscript compiled
                    perhaps as early as the year 1100, and certainly not later than the first half
                    of the 12th century, and containing some important poems not known to exist
                    elsewhere. The British Museum Library has now a considerable number of Irish
                    manuscripts, chiefly, however, written on paper. But besides some law
                    manuscripts of value, there is one vellum manuscript, a small folio of 68 leaves
                    beautifully written about the year 1460, formerly belonging to Sir Henry
                    Spelman, which contains the best extant copies of several of the most celebrated
                    historic tales. Of the vellum manuscripts in private hands the most important
                    are the Book of Lismore, belonging to the duke of Devonshire, and kept at
                    Lismore Castle in Ireland; a manuscript in the possession of the O’Connor Don,
                    containing a largo number of poems of the 15th and 16th centuries; the Liber
                    Flavus, a small folio manuscript of about the beginning of the 15th century; the
                    manuscripts formerly belonging to the duke of Buckingham, and now in the
                    possession of the earl of Ashburnham. The most important manuscript in this
                    collection, which is inaccessible to <pb break="no"

                    O’Duvegan, <hi rend="italic">Ollamh</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Ui Maine,</hi> the
                    O’Kelly’s country, who died in the year 1372. The other part of this manuscript
                    is in the British Museum.</p>
                <p>The contents of these manuscripts are of the most miscellaneous character, in
                    fact many of them are mere scrap-books. The following classification will enable
                    the reader to form some general notion of the nature of existing Irish
                    literature :—(1) grammar and glossaries; (2) annals, genealogies, and pedigrees;
                    (3) history, legendary and real, including a large number of narrative poems,
                    some of which might be considered to be ballads, and prose historical tales; (4)
                    mythological and other imaginative tales; (5) lyric poetry; (6) satire; (7)
                    religious literature, including lives of saints; (8) law; (9) science, inclusive
                    of medicine; and (10) miscellaneous translations from other languages. The
                    manuscripts containing this varied literature were written after the 11th
                    century; only three of the principal ones above mentioned are as old as the
                    12th, the remainder being written chiefly in the 13th and 14th centuries. The
                    contents of a manuscript are at least as old as itself and may be much older.
                    Sometimes the manuscript itself informs us that a particular piece was copied
                    from another manuscript which is named. Again poems are attributed to authors
                    who lived long before the manuscript containing them was written, even as far
                    back as pagan times. Can we look upon those poems as the genuine work of the
                    period they are referred to, in the same way as we accept the works of Greek and
                    Latin writers, although we do not possess any manuscripts of them written within
                    even centuries of the author’s time l and if not, how are we to determine the
                    true age of the contents of an Irish or of a Welsh manuscript 1 The answer to
                    this question necessarily affects everything that could be said on the character
                    and growth of Irish and Welsh literature. We must, therefore, say a few words on
                    the subject, especially with a view of pointing out some of the considerations
                    which might help us to arrive at a true solution of the problem.</p>
                <p>The first point which naturally suggests itself for inquiry is whether the Irish
                    knew the use of letters before the introduction of Christianity. This question
                    has been much discussed, but as there is not much evidence one way or the other,
                    the discussion has not been profitable. Caesar says that the Gauls knew writing
                    and used the Greek alphabet, showing that their knowledge of letters probably
                    came from the Greek colony of Massilia; and the Gauls of North Italy used the
                    Etruscan alphabet long before the time of Caesar. But these facts do not
                    necessarily imply that their brethren in the British Islands had also a
                    knowledge of letters before the arrival of the Romans, nor have we any evidence
                    even after that event that the British language was written. The Celtic names on
                    British coins prove nothing one way or the other. As regards Ireland the only
                    piece of evidence of the existence of a knowledge of writing before St Patrick’s
                    time is the statement of Gennadius respecting the letters of Celestins. This, it
                    must be admitted, would be very slender evidence to found a conclusion upon
                    unless supported by more definite facts.</p>
                <p>In certain parts of Ireland, and in those parts of Wales once occupied by the
                    Irish, are found rude stone monuments. upon the edges of which are cut
                    inscriptions consisting of a number of long and short lines. This method of
                    writing, which ia called <hi rend="italic">Ogam,</hi> was practised in Christian
                    times even as late as the 9th and 10th centuries, for marginal entries written
                    in <hi rend="italic">Ogam</hi> characters are found in some of the manuscripts
                    of St Gall; and in the vellum manuscript in the library of the Royal Irish
                    Academy, called the Book of Ballymote, compiled near the close of the 14th
                    century the different styles of Ogamic writing and the value of the letters are
                    explained in a special tract on the subject. The character of many inscribed
                    monuments, and the circumstances under which they are usually found, seem to
                    favour their pre-Christian use also. On this point, however, there is still much
                    uncertainty, and the utmost that we could venture to say is that the archaic
                    character of the grammatical forms of Ogamic words, and especially the case of
                    one bilingual inscription, places their relative antiquity beyond question. The
                    geographical distribution of 0&lt;7&lt;m-inscribed stones is worthy of
                    attention; they are almost exclusively confined in Ireland to Munster, and
                    chiefly to the south-western counties. In the provinces of Leinster and
                    Connaught only a few have been found at one or two spots, and but one has been
                    found in Ulster; they are, in fact, most abundant in the district where,
                    according to tradition, the Milesians or Scots first landed in Ireland. In Wales
                    they seem also to be chiefly confined to the districts formerly occupied by the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gwyddel,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gad.</hi> Notwithstanding
                    the use of <hi rend="italic">Ogam</hi> by Irish scribes in the 9th century, and
                    the existence of the key in the Book of Ballymote, the deciphering of the
                    inscriptions has not been hitherto very easy, perhaps, as some think, because
                    many are cryptic. Those that have been deciphered with certainty are very
                    simple, and evidently marked the grave in some instances, perhaps in every case,
                    of a <hi rend="italic">Sai</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Fili,</hi> that is, if used
                    in pagan times, of one of the Druidic order. If we can trust to the authority of
                    some of the oldest of the romantic tales, <hi rend="italic">Ogam</hi> was used
                    in the north of Ireland as well as in the south; there, however, it was cut on
                    sticks or twigs, as Venantius Fortunatus tells us the barbarians cut their
                    runes. In some Irish poems mention is made of <hi rend="italic">Duile Feda,</hi>
                    which has been interpreted to mean “Books of Wood,” and may have been
                    Qyαm-inscribed tablets. But as no specimen of this literature has come down to
                    us, and as they must, if they were ever used at all, have been an inconvenient
                    and imperfect mode of recording the product of thought, we may leave them out of
                    consideration. Whatever opinion then may be held as to the existence in Ireland
                    of a knowledge of letters in prehistoric times, we may safely assume that
                    literature in the true sense of the word began there with Christianity. In
                    saying this, however, we are not to be understood as denying that a record of
                    events, accounts of battles, panegyrics of warriors, may not be orally
                    transmitted in verse. Metre, alliteration, rhyme, and assonance are powerful
                    aids to the memory, and a bar to the introduction of new matter, and
                    consequently prevent two different streams of traditions from mingling. But in
                    time, and especially among a highly imaginative people possessing the power of
                    improvising in verse, the streams of verse did mingle, enlarge, and modify
                    themselves. Nevertheless it is marvellous how perfectly long poems of the most
                    complex metrical structure may be transmitted by oral tradition for centuries.
                    Poems transmitted in this way follow of course all the phonetic changes of the
                    language, and, when at length they are written down from memory, look as if they
                    had been composed at first in the living language. In this way an essentially
                    pagan literature may come as it were into existence long after paganism itself
                    had passed away. The <hi rend="italic">Kalevala, or</hi> heroic epopee of the
                    Finns, and the <hi rend="italic">Kalevi</hi><hi rend="italic">Poeg</hi> of the
                    Esthonians, are examples of this. In order that this should take place, the
                    manners, customs, and general state of culture should undergo but little change.
                    When any serious change in these respects occurs, the stream either ceases
                    altogether, or becomes so modified and admixed with foreign elements that a new
                    literature may be said to begin. One of the most marked changes which takes
                    place under such circumstances is the substitution of vague descriptions of
                    dress and arms, and a vague toponomy, for the full and definite descriptions and
                    precise toponomy of the primitive poems.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n318/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0318-0307"/>
                <p>The knowledge of writing does not necessarily involve the entire supplanting of
                    tradition by written narrative. Many Asiatic nations who possess alphabets from
                    olden time nevertheless still transmit their history by oral tradition. The
                    account which we have given of the organization and method of instruction of the
                    poets clearly shows that in early times genealogies, laws, history, tales,
                    &amp;c., were transmitted orally, or, as was said, “from mouth and tongue.” This
                    should always be borne in mind when discussing the antiquity or genuineness of
                    poems, prose tales, or histories. Here it may be well to remark that verse is a
                    better vehicle for the oral transmission of knowledge than prose. Besides being
                    more difficult to remember than verse, prose offers greater facility, not to say
                    inducements, to introduce new matter by way of explanation or commentary, or to
                    fuse legends of different kinds. Hence laws were transmitted in verse, and
                    wherever we have a legend embodied in verse, it will be found to be both more
                    archaic and purer than when in prose. The use of prose seems to indicate the
                    passage from oral to written tradition. Another point which should be kept in
                    view in judging of such literatures as those of Ireland and of Wales, is that
                    after the traditions of a country have been committed to writing the different
                    kinds of knowledge will not be transmitted in equal purity or preserve their
                    original form and language equally. Every fresh copy of an account of a battle,
                    a legend, or a life of a saint, or of a narrative or description, would follow
                    the change in the spoken language, and to some extent in the accessories of the
                    picture, such as dress, arms, &amp;c. ,∙ in other words it would be a new and
                    popular edition made intelligible to all. On the other hand, the exact words of
                    a law or decision are important and would be sure to be copied without other
                    changes than what the carelessness or ignorance of the scribe would produce. As
                    vellum was dear and not easily procured everywhere the words were written close
                    together and contractions were used, especially for the terminations; here was a
                    fertile source of error and of the corruption of grammatical forms by ignorant
                    and careless scribes. The most cursory examination of Irish manuscripts will
                    illustrate the preceding remarks. In the same manuscript may be found pieces
                    which differ in language by centuries. If the manuscript contain law-tracts, or
                    pieces on subjects not of common or popular interest, they will be found written
                    in obsolete language, and generally noted with explanatory glosses or
                    commentaries. The language of the tales and popular poems on the other hand will
                    represent exactly the period of the compilation of the manuscript; and yet they
                    may have been originally composed long before the law.</p>
                <p>We need not dwell on the first category of Irish literature further than to
                    observe that Irish scribes seem to have had a special liking for glossing, and
                    that if all the existing glossaries, old and new, were added together we should
                    have at least 30,000 words besides those in printed dictionaries, a richness of
                    vocabulary unequalled perhaps by any living language. Among the old glossaries
                    we may mention that attributed to <hi rend="italic">Cormac</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mac Cuilennáin,</hi> king and bishop of Cashel, who was killed in 903, as an
                    early attempt at comparative etymology, the author referring to Latin, Greek,
                    Hebrew, Norse, and British. Many of these derivations are no doubt wrong, but as
                    an early attempt it is curious. The earliest copy of this glossary is to be
                    found in the Book of Leinster, compiled in the first half of the 12th century,
                    but though some articles may have been added, there is no reason to doubt that
                    it was the work of Cormac. As grammar formed an important subject of the course
                    of <hi rend="italic">Filidecht</hi> we might expect to find many treatises on it
                    in Irish manuscripts. Several are mentioned, but they appear to be lost. There
                    is, however, one deserving of much attention, written perhaps in the 9th or 10th
                    century; the oldest copies now known, however, are those in the Books of
                    Ballymote and of Lecan, manuscripts compiled towards the end of the 13th
                    century.</p>
                <p>Annals form a notable element in Irish literature, but we can do little more than
                    mention a few of the more important compilations. During the 11th century
                    attempts were made to synchronize Irish events with those of other countries. Of
                    these may be mentioned the synchronisms of <hi rend="italic">Flann</hi> of
                    Monasterboyce, already mentioned. But the most notable attempt to synchronize
                    events is that made by <hi rend="italic">Tighernaclι 0'Braοin,</hi> abbot of
                    Clonmacnoise, who died in 1088. <hi rend="italic">Tighernach</hi> in his Annals
                    displays considerable scholarship, and for the time fair critical power. He was
                    probably the first to introduce the common era into Irish annals. The oldest
                    copy, and unfortunately only a fragment, is in a manuscript of the 12th century
                    in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, nor can a perfect copy be made out of the six
                    or seven other copies which are known. The Annals called by most writers since
                    the times of Usher and Ware the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Ulster,</hi> but
                    more correctly the Annals of <hi rend="italic">Senat</hi><hi rend="italic">Mic
                    Maghnusa,</hi> or Mac Manus, compiled or copied by Cathal Maguire in 1498, in an
                    island in Upper Lough Erne called <hi rend="italic">Senat</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mic Maghnusa,</hi> and continued in some copies to 1604, are of special
                    importance, because the book contains notices of comets, eclipses, and other
                    natural phenomena, which appear to have been recorded by eyewitnesses, as is
                    proved by the day and hour of the eclipse of the sun on 1st May 664 being
                    correctly recorded, while Bede, who records the same eclipse post-dates it, as
                    the result of calculation, by two days, as does the Saxon Chronicle also. <hi
                    rend="italic">Tighemack,</hi> like the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Ulster,</hi>
                    gives the right date. This fact shows that both <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tigliernach</hi> and the compiler of the <hi rend="italic">Annals of
                    Ulster</hi> must have had access to contemporary documents, at least as old as
                    the middle of the 7 th century. But the most extensive though the
                    latest-compiled Annals is the collection called by Father John Colgan, editor of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum Hibemioe,</hi> the Annals of the Four
                    Masters, the chief of whom was Michael O’Clery, a Franciscan friar, who, after
                    collecting materials from the then existing Irish manuscripts, commenced in
                    1632, amidst the ruins of the convent of his order in Donegal, the compilation
                    of this very remarkable monument, and in four years completed it. The Annals of
                    the Four Masters extend from fabulous antiquity to 1616. Down to the 4th century
                    the entries are little more than lists of kings, but thenceforward they become
                    fuller and more trustworthy.</p>
                <p>The political and social organization of Ireland, and especially the custom of
                    gavel-kind, made pedigrees and genealogies matters of great importance. The
                    Irish genealogies are usually carried up to Noah, and include on the way many
                    eponyms and even divinities. The Biblical portion may be easily removed without
                    detriment to the Irish part; but it is not so easy to say where the legendary
                    and the true touch. Within the historical period the pedigrees and genealogies
                    afford great help in historical inquiry, though it should not be forgotten that
                    a <hi rend="italic">Sai</hi> was quite as capable of inventing a pedigree as any
                    modem herald. Topography may be said to be the complement of pedigrees, and like
                    the latter was of great use to Irish families, and was accordingly, as we have
                    already pointed out, well attended to. Of this kind of literature the most
                    curious and valuable example is the tract called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diηnsenchas,</hi> said to have been compiled at Tara by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sai,</hi> named <hi rend="italic">Amergiη Mae Amalgaidh,</hi> or Macauley,
                    about the year 550. This work, the oldest copy of which is in the Book of
                    Leinster, gives an account of the legendary origin of several places of note,
                    and thus preserves invaluable mythological materials.</p>

                <p>Every successive race which peopled Ireland had, we are told, its historian,
                    whose names are given, and in some cases particular verses and even long poems
                    are attributed to them. These are, of course, mythological personages, but this
                    fact is in itself a proof of the antiquity of the system of recording in verse
                    the history of the country. Without going back to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coirbre,</hi> the son of the goddess <hi rend="italic">Etain,</hi> wife of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ogma</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    sun-like face,” a long list of •poets beginning with <hi rend="italic">Ailill
                    Olum,</hi> a king of Munster in the 2d century, the supposed progenitor of the
                    chief Celtic families of the south of Ireland, may be made out. There are three
                    poems in the Book of Leinster attributed to the <hi rend="italic">Ailill</hi>
                    just named. It is needless to say that in their present form these poems could
                    not be the work of a poet who lived a thousand years before the Book of Leinster
                    was written, even if the poet were not, as is probable, only an eponymous
                    ancestor of Munster clans. To the same or a somewhat later period belong several
                    other mythological personages to whom poems still extant are attributed, and of
                    whom we shall have something to say presently,—namely, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Finn</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Cumall,</hi> contemporary of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cormac</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Art,</hi> “the lone man,” and
                    a reputed author himself, <hi rend="italic">Oisin</hi> the son of <hi
                    rend="italic">Finn</hi> (the Ossian of later romance), and his brother <hi
                    rend="italic">Fergus,</hi> and his cousin <hi rend="italic">Cailte.</hi> In <hi
                    rend="italic">Niall</hi> of the Nine Hostages, who was killed on an excursion
                    into Britain in 405, we have probably an undoubted historic personage, and in
                    <hi rend="italic">Torna</hi><hi rend="italic">Eigeas</hi> or the learned,” his
                    <hi rend="italic">Fili,</hi> a real poet. There are many poems attributed to him
                    still extant, but in their present form they belong to a period not perhaps
                    earlier than the 11 th century. His contemporary <hi rend="italic">Laideenn</hi>
                    was the author of an Art of Poetry which has not reached us. After the
                    conversion of the whole country in the 5th century there cannot be any doubt
                    that the poets whose names occur in the Annals, and to whom poems are attributed
                    in manuscripts, were real personages. Some of the poems attributed to the
                    earlier ones have come down in such an archaic dress that it is probable we have
                    the genuine work of the poet. The works of the poets of the 9th, 10th, and 11th
                    centuries are either their genuine productions or at most slightly modernized
                    versions. Between the first of those centuries and the 14th the change in the
                    language was not very great. Among the names of authors of historical poems who
                    lived between the 5th and the 11th century the following deserve special mention
                    :—Bishop <hi rend="italic">Fiacc,</hi> author of a metrical life of St Patrick
                    which survives nearly, if not quite, in its original form; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dalian Forgaill,</hi> a contemporary of St Columcillé, and author of an elegy
                    on that saint, which is to be found in the oldest manuscript written wholly in
                    Irish now in Ireland, the <hi rend="italic">Leabhar no h-Uidhri,</hi> or Book of
                    the Dun Cow, which was compiled before 1106. The poem in question is glossed and
                    accompanied by a kind of commentary on the difficult words, so that the language
                    was already so obsolete in the end of the 11th century as to be practically
                    unintelligible. In the 7th century the most prominent names are the following.
                    <hi rend="italic">Senchán Torpeist,</hi> the successor of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dalian</hi> just mentioned as chief poet of Ireland, flourished about the year
                    600. <hi rend="italic">Senchan</hi> is one of those to whom the authorship of
                    the existing form of the principal Irish tale, the <hi rend="italic">Tâin Bo
                    Cuailnge,</hi> is attributed. <hi rend="italic">Finntann,</hi> poet of <hi
                    rend="italic">Raghallach,</hi> king of Connaught, killed in 648, has attributed
                    to him the authorship of a very spirited ballad on the deeds and death of his
                    patron. The language of this poem, admitting it to have been written by <hi
                    rend="italic">Finntann,</hi> has been modified to some extent in the way above
                    suggested. St <hi rend="italic">Moling</hi> was the author of several poems of
                    considerable merit, some of which only come under the present category. Two of
                    St <hi rend="italic">Moling’s</hi> poems have been found by Mone in the
                    manuscript in the convent of St Paul in Carinthia above mentioned, and scarcely
                    differ in orthography from the copies which exist in manuscripts in Ireland
                    compiled six hundred years later than the St Paul codex, assuming the latter to
                    be, as Mone suggested, of the 8th century. <hi rend="italic">Cennfaeladh</hi>
                    “the Learned,” the reputed author of the grammar of the Irish language above
                    mentioned, died in 678. During the 8th century the number of writers appears to
                    have been smaller than in the preceding and succeeding centuries. This was no
                    doubt due to the great number who went abroad, for during that century, and the
                    early part of the 9th, Irishmen were to be found in every part of Europe. In the
                    latter century <hi rend="italic">Fothadh, Flanagan,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flann Mac Lonáin</hi> occupied a prominent position as writers of historical
                    poems. <hi rend="italic">Laitheog,</hi> the mother of <hi rend="italic">Flown
                    Mac Lonain,</hi> deserves mention also as a poetess, and as showing that women
                    shared in the literary cultivation of the period. In the 10th century the most
                    prominent poets were <hi rend="italic">Cormac</hi> “the Learned,” <hi
                    rend="italic">Cinacdh O'Hartogon,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Echaid
                    O'Flinn</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> andin the 11th century, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Echaid 0'Ceirin,</hi> surnamed “the Learned,” author of a curious historical
                    poem descriptive of one of the great fairs or <hi rend="italic">Oenechs,</hi>
                    held in Ireland; <hi rend="italic">Mac Liag, Mac Coise, Cuan O'Lothcain,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Flann</hi> of the Monastery. The historical poems
                    attributed to the writers of the 10th and 11th centuries are, as might be
                    expected, much more numerous than those of preceding ones. Indeed we might make
                    an epitome of the whole history of the country, especially of the legendary
                    part, from the poems of the writers just mentioned, the poets of one period
                    deriving the materials of their own poems from those of their predecessors.</p>
                <p>• In the 11th and 12th century prose came largely into use, as is shown by the
                    large number of prose historic tales and romances which were written at this
                    time. It is difficult to draw a line between real history and historical fiction
                    in an early literature, but in Irish it is especially so, for we find many of
                    the so-called historical tales so free from the miraculous, and so sober in the
                    narrative, that at first sight we could scarcely refuse to accept them as
                    history; and yet one of them to which this description applies is undoubtedly an
                    account of a war between deities. In general, however, we can follow all the
                    stages from a simple historical narrative up to a fullblown romance. The
                    circumstances under which this kind of literature was produced show why this
                    should be so. The business of the <hi rend="italic">Fili,</hi> or poet, was to
                    praise his chief, celebrate the achievements of his ancestors, and find him
                    amusement when he regaled his <hi rend="italic">Sobaid,</hi> or props, as the
                    chief men of the tribe were called, in his alehouse. For this purpose a simple
                    narrative of a foray or a skirmish required to be embroidered with a little
                    romance; hence the number of accounts of battles, deaths, feasts, &amp;c., which
                    though in the main founded on real events belong by their treatment to fiction.
                    There are, however, some productions which though not free from invention may
                    yet be classed as attempts at writing prose historical narrative. Perhaps the
                    earliest of this class of compositions is the History of the Borromean Tribute,
                    or great tribute of cows levied in the province of Leinster by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tuothol,</hi> surnamed <hi rend="italic">Teachtmor,</hi> or “the Legitimate,”
                    whose death is variously stated to have occurred at from 106 to 160. and who
                    consequently belongs to the dawn of the historic period. This tribute was
                    abolished by the paramount king of Ireland <hi rend="italic">Finnoclιia,</hi>
                    surnamed “the Festive,” at the instance of the St <hi rend="italic">Moling</hi>
                    above mentioned, but imposed again in the beginning of the 11th century by <hi
                    rend="italic">Brian,</hi> surnamed from this circumstance <hi rend="italic"
                    >Boroimhé,</hi> or “Brian of the Cow Tribute,” as a punishment of Leinster for
                    supporting the Danes. This interesting work is found in the Book of Leinster,
                    and was therefore probably written at the time of the reimposition of the
                    tribute. Another work of the same period is the Wars of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gaedhil</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">Gaill,</hi> or the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n320/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0320-0309"/> history of the invasions of Ireland by the Danes
                    and Norsemen. The only perfect copy of this work known is one in the handwriting
                    of Michael O’Clery, chief of the Four Masters, in the National Library at
                    Brussels, but there is a fragment of it in the Book of Leinster, the remainder
                    being lost. The existence of this fragment shows that it was written at latest
                    within a century of the brittle of Clontarf; but from curious incidental
                    evidence it must have been written by an eye-witness of the battle, or by some
                    one who received his information from one who had been there. It is mentioned in
                    the history that the tide in Dublin Bay coincided with sunrise on the 23d of
                    April 1014, the day the battle of Clontarf was fought, and that the returning
                    tide in the evening aided in the defeat of the Danes; astronomical calculations
                    have shown that the first part of this statement is quite correct. The style of
                    this work is poor, the descriptions are wanting in precision and accuracy of
                    detail, owing to the redundancy of nearly synonymous adjectives, and it was
                    evidently written by a partizan of <hi rend="italic">Brian.</hi> But with all
                    its faults it is a work of some interest even from a literary point of view. The
                    Wars of Turloch, written by John Mac Grath, historian of the Clans of Thomond,
                    now the county of Clare, about the year 1459, is a third example of historic
                    prose, and one which gives us an insight into the nature of the feuds and
                    struggles for power between rival claimants for a chieftancy, and the part which
                    the Norman adventurers played in these intestinal contests, which ultimately
                    allowed them to become masters of the country. The immediate subject of the
                    history in question was the war between Turloch O’Brian and his uncle Brian
                    Ruadh O’Brien, and the sons of the latter, aided by the De Clares; but it may be
                    said to be a history of Thomond for more than two hundred years, from the
                    Anglo-Norman invasion to the death of Robert de Clare and his son. Like the work
                    last mentioned the style of this history is very redundant, the descriptions
                    being overloaded with adjectives almost identical in meaning, and often
                    incorrectly applied; it is not, however, devoid of skill in the narrative, and
                    many of the incidents are described with vigour and force. Perhaps if we had the
                    original texts of this and the Wars of the <hi rend="italic">Gaedhil</hi> with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gaill,</hi> we should find the style purer. One of the
                    ways in which scribes corrupted the texts of the works they copied was by adding
                    meaningless adjectives to give as they thought dignity and ornament to the
                    descriptions.</p>
                <p>The Book of Munster, though of uncertain date, and not known to exist in any old
                    manuscript, is a work which illustrates very well the peculiarities of Irish
                    historical compilations. It begins with an account of the Creation taken from
                    Genesis, which serves as an excuse for tacking on the Biblical genealogies to
                    the Irish ones; then follows the history of the Milesians from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eber,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Miled,</hi> the eponymous ancestor of the
                    Munster tribes, to <hi rend="italic">Brian Boroimhe.</hi> The legendary part of
                    the work is to be found in most of the principal Irish manuscripts; but the part
                    relating to the period from the 7th to the 10th century is of great interest,
                    and contains much not found elsewhere. The ethnic legends just referred to,
                    which form so prominent a feature in Irish historical compilations, have been
                    all brought together in what is called the Book of Invasions. This work is a
                    link between genealogies and historical narrative proper, and consists of the
                    legendary histories of the successive tribes supposed to have peopled Ireland,
                    and of their eponymous leaders, into which are introduced many curious so-called
                    historical poems, the matter of which, if not the language, is of considerable
                    antiquity. The oldest copy of the Book of Invasions, the author of which is not
                    known, is that in the Book of Leinster; the one which existed in the Book of the
                    Dun</p>
                <p>Cow in 1631 has been unfortunately since lost, with much of that valuable
                    manuscript. Michael O’Clery, chief of the Four Masters, compiled from the copy
                    just referred to and others, a condensed version, the original of which is now
                    in the possession of Lord Ashburnham. In speaking of the Book of Invasions we
                    are reminded of the first attempt made to write a general history of Ireland, by
                    Geoffrey Keating, a parish priest in the county of Tipperary, in the beginning
                    of the 17th century. His work, which is written in the spoken Irish of the
                    period, and compiled under very unfavourable circumstances, is an epitome of the
                    copious mixture of legend and fact which is found in Irish manuscripts, and
                    among other things contains much borrowed from the Book of Invasions. He appears
                    to have had access to many manuscripts since lost, and though he makes no
                    attempt to examine his materials critically, the work has considerable value,
                    and bears comparison with similar attempts made under analogous conditions in
                    other languages.</p>
                <p>The learning of stories formed, as we have seen, an important feature in the
                    course of <hi rend="italic">Filideclιt.</hi> An <hi rend="italic">Ollamh
                    Fili,</hi> for example, was bound to know two hundred and fifty prime stories,
                    and one hundred secondary ones. In the 11th and 12th centuries the number of
                    stories current must have been very considerable. There is a list of one-hundred
                    and eighty-one tales in the Book of Leinster classified under the
                    heads—Destructions, Cow Spoils,. Wooings, Battles, Adventures in Caves,
                    Wanderings and Voyages, Deaths or Tragedies, Feasts, Sieges, Adventures,.
                    Abductions, Slaughters, Irruptions of Lakes, tfcc., Visions. Loves, Expeditions,
                    Marches or Progressions. More that one hundred of these are still extant, and of
                    these nearly one half are to be found in manuscripts as old as the 12th century,
                    into which they were copied, as in many instances· we are distinctly told, from
                    older books. The existing tales belong to six categories :—(1) ethnic, or those
                    relating to the peopling of the country, and the subsequent struggles of the
                    different races; (2) voyages, expeditions-to Scotland, the Isle of Man, or
                    Britain, and the sieges, battles, adventures, deaths, and abductions which took
                    place there; (3) mythological stories connected with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Side</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> (4) tales forming the heroic cycle of Queen
                    <hi rend="italic">Medb</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cuchulaind;</hi> (5) the tales
                    of the Fennian or Oisianic period; and (6) miscellaneous tales belonging to
                    pagan and Christian times,, but chiefly to the periods of the 3d and 7th
                    centuries.</p>
                <p>The Book of Invasions is simply an attempt to put the principal stories of the
                    first category into a methodical order. The staple of the stories of this class
                    is unquestionably of considerable antiquity, though in the present form they are
                    not much older than the 12th century. Of the existing ones the most important
                    are the accounts of the battle of <hi rend="italic">Mag Tuired Conga,</hi>
                    supposed to have been fought between the <hi rend="italic">Firbolgs</hi> and the
                    intrusive <hi rend="italic">Tuatlιa Dé Danann,</hi> and the battle of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mag Tuired</hi> of the Fomorians, supposed to have been fought
                    between the latter and the <hi rend="italic">Tuatha Be Banann.</hi> The first of
                    these tales has the terseness and simplicity of a Norse Saga, and depicts a rude
                    and early state of society wholly unlike that in the later stories. The
                    supernatural is so little developed in them that, notwithstanding the chief
                    personages are the gods of the Irish pantheon, they must represent real ethnie
                    struggles.</p>
                <p>The stories we would propose to place in the second category have little in
                    common save that they refer to what we might call the prehistoric relations of
                    Ireland with Britain. Some relate to personages of the heroic or mythological
                    cycles; others to Scotic invasions of Britain; and others again to the Christian
                    Dalriadic kingdom. Of the tales of this second category two are of great value
                    in the history of romance—namely, the Abduction of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Blathnαd</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n321/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0321-0310"/> daughter of <hi rend="italic">Paìll</hi> by <hi
                    rend="italic">Cúchulaind,</hi> and the Voyage or Exile of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Breccán.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Paill</hi> of the first story appears to be
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pawl</hi> of the Welsh <hi rend="italic">Mabinogion,</hi>
                    which we shall mention further on; and in her second husband we have the <hi
                    rend="italic">Corτοi mab Dayry</hi> of a Welsh poem, which gave rise to much
                    discussion. The <hi rend="italic">Breccán</hi> of the second story was,
                    according to Cormac’s glossary, the son of <hi rend="italic">Niall</hi> of the
                    Nine Hostages, one of the Scotic invaders of Britain, who traded with a fleet of
                    fifty boats between Ireland and Alba, but was wrecked, and he and his whole
                    fleet lost, in a whirlpool formed by the meeting of the tidal currents in the
                    channel between the two countries, which on this account was called <hi
                    rend="italic">Coire</hi><hi rend="italic">Breccâin</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Breccán’s</hi> cauldron. Dr Reeves thinks this was between the mainland of
                    Antrim and the Island of Rathlin; but it has since migrated with the legend to
                    the channel between Jura and</p>
                <p>“Scarba’s Isle, whose tortured shore Still rings to Corrievrekan’s roar.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Breccán</hi> has also left footprints of himself not only in
                    Welsh legend but also in Welsh hagiology, and as we have already mentioned in
                    Welsh toponomy, for he is the <hi rend="italic">Brychan,</hi> the founder of one
                    of three families of saints, who has given his name to Brecknock.</p>
                <p>The mythological tales all relate to the inhabitants of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Side</hi> or Celtic Elysium, whose chiefs were the mythical <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tuatha De Danann</hi> leaders, and who form, as we have pointed out above, an
                    extensive pantheon. Among those who figure in the tales are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Etain,</hi><hi rend="italic">Lêr, Manandan</hi> his son, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dagda, Tuirenn Bicrenn</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Delbaith</hi> and his three
                    sons, and <hi rend="italic">Lug Max Eithlenn.</hi> These tales may be divided
                    into three classes. In the first of these the actors are all <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tuatha Dé Danann,</hi> or these associated only with personages of remote
                    antiquity, and in the second the same divinities are associated with personages
                    of the heroic period, especially with <hi rend="italic">Medb</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cúchulaind,</hi> and those in which historic or semi-historic
                    personages are associated with the deities of the <hi rend="italic">Side.</hi>
                    The Wooing of <hi rend="italic">Etain,</hi> the Exile of <hi rend="italic">Bri
                    Leith,</hi> the Death of the Sons of <hi rend="italic">Tuirenn,</hi> are
                    examples of the first class. The <hi rend="italic">Seirglige Cοnchulaind,</hi>
                    or Bed of Decline of <hi rend="italic">Cúchulaind,</hi> one of the most
                    remarkable of all the Celtic mythological tales, is an excellent example of the
                    second. The third class embraces such tales as the Wooing of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Becuma</hi> by <hi rend="italic">Conn</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> u</hi>
                    of the Hundred Battles,” and the Adventures of <hi rend="italic">Cοndla</hi> the
                    Beautiful, son of the <hi rend="italic">Conn</hi> just mentioned. In the third
                    class might also be placed a number of curious tales in which pagan myths are
                    transformed into Christian ones. We may observe this transformation of the pagan
                    into the Christian myth in every stage of the process; thus in the tale called
                    <hi rend="italic">Tomaidm Locha Eachach,</hi> or the Irruption of Loch Neagh,
                    or, as it is called in the <hi rend="italic">Leabhar nah-Uidhrτ, Aided Echach
                    Mac Maireda,</hi> the Death of <hi rend="italic">Echaid</hi> son of <hi
                    rend="italic">Μaired,</hi> we have a legend more than half of which is pagan,
                    but which in the latter part is changed into a Christian myth without affecting
                    the general pagan character of the whole. The Fate of the Children of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lêr,</hi> or Lear, is a legend of the same kind; indeed the same
                    pagan myth serves as the basis of the Christian part of the myth in both tales.
                    In the Birth of <hi rend="italic">Aed Slane,</hi> king of Ireland, who died in
                    600, we have an Aryan myth completely transformed into a Christian one. <hi
                    rend="italic">Diarmait,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">CerbeoU Aed's</hi> father,
                    had two wives, <hi rend="italic">Murend</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Murgán,</hi>
                    the former of whom was bald, and was provided with flowing hair by the aid of St
                    <hi rend="italic">Ciaran,</hi> or Kyran; the latter was barren, but becomes
                    fruitful through the aid of St <hi rend="italic">Finden</hi> and of a bishop
                    named <hi rend="italic">Aed</hi> (fire, spark), who gives her a drink of blessed
                    water which renders her pregnant of a lamb; a second drink causes her to bring
                    forth a silver salmon; but the third drink gives her a son called <hi
                    rend="italic">Aed.</hi></p>
                <p>There is a special class of legends, the <hi rend="italic">Immrams</hi> or
                    Wanderings by sea, which we have not included in any of the foregoing
                    categories, but which, as examples of the fusion of pagan and Christian elements
                    in a legend, may be disposed of here. The origin of the Christian <hi
                    rend="italic">Imrnram</hi> is to be found in several pagan tales such as the
                    Visit of <hi rend="italic">Conn</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> of the Hundred
                    Battles” to the Land of Promise, which forms part of the Wooing of <hi
                    rend="italic">Becunιa,</hi> already mentioned. The principal <hi rend="italic"
                    >Immrams</hi> are—the Voyage of St Brendan (the most celebrated of all), the
                    Wandering of the sons of <hi rend="italic">Ua Corra,</hi> and the Wandering of
                    <hi rend="italic">Maeldun.</hi> In these the transformation of the pagan myth is
                    so complete that we should not have been able to trace their origin but for the
                    existence of the pagan tales just mentioned.</p>
                <p>There is another class of compositions—the <hi rend="italic">Fisa,</hi> or
                    Visions, which, though strictly belonging to the category of religious
                    literature, offer so many analogies to the <hi rend="italic">Inιmrams</hi> or
                    Wanderings, in some of the incidents, that it is better to say a few words on
                    them in this place. In several pagan tales we have examples of visions, some
                    brought about by pagan rites, which are the prototypes of the later Christian
                    visions, such as those of St <hi rend="italic">Adamnán,</hi> and St Fursey. The
                    Christian visions of Hell and Heaven owe something to Virgil, but the extent of
                    the obligation is much smaller than might at first sight be supposed, for we can
                    trace the growth of the ideas under which the <hi rend="italic">Fis</hi> or
                    vision was evolved and developed to the fusion of pagan, Celtic, and Christian
                    notions. Several of the adventures of Brendan, <hi rend="italic">Maeldun,</hi>
                    and the sons of <hi rend="italic">Ua Corra</hi> contain scenes which have the
                    same origin as many of those depicted in the visions.</p>
                <p>The tales which we propose to include under the head of heroic tales form a large
                    and well-marked epic cycle. The central tale of the series is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Táin Bo Cuailnge</hi> or Cattle Spoil of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cualnge, vwm</hi> Cooly, in the county of Louth, which relates the history of
                    the war w aged by <hi rend="italic">Medb,</hi> queen of Connaught, the Queen Mab
                    of fairy mythology, and her husband <hi rend="italic">Ailill,</hi> with <hi
                    rend="italic">Condιobar Mac</hi><hi rend="italic">Nessa,</hi> king of Ulster,
                    for the possession of the mystic brown bull of <hi rend="italic">Cualnge,</hi>
                    in which the hero <hi rend="italic">Cúchulaind</hi> defends Ulster
                    single-handed, while the king and his champions are in a peculiar state of
                    debility inflicted upon them for a savage act of the former. The existing tales
                    of the series amount to about thirty, exclusive of the tale of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Táin</hi> itself and of the prologues and fore-tales narrating the
                    preparations for the great cow-prey. In these tales as a whole we have one of
                    the most complete epic cycles in any literature. We have a narrative of the life
                    of the great hero of the series from his conception to his death, of <hi
                    rend="italic">Medb,</hi> the chief heroine, and of all the chief personages on
                    both sides, male and female— <hi rend="italic">Conchobor Mac</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Nessa,</hi><hi rend="italic">Fergus Mac Roigh,Ailill,</hi> husband
                    of <hi rend="italic">Medb, Conall Cemaclι</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Loi-</hi><hi rend="italic">guire</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Leghaire
                    Buadach,</hi> companions of <hi rend="italic">Cúchulaind,</hi> the sons of <hi
                    rend="italic">Uisnech,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ferdiad; Deirdriu,Eτner,</hi>
                    and the other women who take part in the action. In some of the stories <hi
                    rend="italic">Curoi Mac Daire,</hi> the Munster king, <hi rend="italic">Conaire
                    Mbr,</hi> the paramount king of Ireland, <hi rend="italic">Manaendan Mac
                    Lir</hi> and his wife <hi rend="italic">Fand,</hi> and many other personages of
                    Celtic mythology come in. The principal tales of this remarkable series exist in
                    manuscripts written in or before the early part of the 12th century, and the
                    others in vellum manuscripts of good authority. The stories are mixed prose and
                    verse, the latter being generally more abundant in the oldest copies; the finest
                    episode of the <hi rend="italic">Táin</hi> itself, descriptive of the single
                    combats between <hi rend="italic">Cúchulaind</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ferdiad,</hi> consists of about equal parts of both. Prose, as we have said
                    above, marks a transition period, and it is therefore likely that the whole
                    series originally consisted of poems which the bard in reciting introduced by
                    brief prologues which served to connect the subjects of the several poems into a
                    kind of connected narrative. This may be regarded as the first <pb break="no"

                    is, when the isolated poems fashioned by different rhyme-smiths are first welded
                    into some kind of connected whole. A second stage would be the linking together
                    of the separate episodes by a permanent setting of prose which would connect,
                    continue, and expand the stories of the separate poems into a continuous
                    coherent narrative. A third stage would be the forging of the whole material,
                    poems and prose settings, into one continuous epic poem. The elder Edda, which
                    consists of thirty-eight poems collected from the mouths of the Skalds, perhaps
                    in part composed by Saemund Sigfusson, towards the end of the 11th century,
                    gives us the first or embryonic stage of growth. Snorro-Sturleson’s prose Edda,
                    made in the beginning of the 13th century out of the poetic Edda and other
                    materials, gives us a second stage; and after a long interval a third stage was
                    reached in Oehlenschläger’s <hi rend="italic">Nordens Guder,</hi> or “Gods of
                    the North.” In this case the original materials underwent complete fusion in
                    each stage. The <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>
                    of Homer are examples of epics in a third stage, but we do not know their
                    previous stages. The Finnish Epic, <hi rend="italic">Kalevala,</hi> made in the
                    present century shows us that an epic may be fashioned directly from the popular
                    poems without passing through a prose stage at all. The <hi rend="italic">Táin
                    Bo Cuailnge</hi> is clearly in the second stage, a fact which should not be
                    forgotten in comparing it with other national epics, as for iustance with the
                    Nibelungen Lay, which is an epic in the third stage. But the Irish epic not only
                    belongs to a different stage of poetic workmanship, but, owing to the
                    comparatively isolated position of Ireland, to a relatively much earlier and
                    more archaic type of society than that of the German epic, which moreover was
                    recast, or at all events reached its third stage in the 12th century in the
                    times of the brilliant Hohenstaufen.</p>
                <p>Who the author of the <hi rend="italic">Tain Bo Cuailnge</hi> or of any of the
                    tales of the heroic period was is not known. A curious legend points to <hi
                    rend="italic">Senchán Torpeist,</hi> a poet who flourished about 600, as the
                    person who gave the <hi rend="italic">Tdin</hi> its present form; another
                    tradition assigns the work to St <hi rend="italic">Ciaran</hi> of Clonmacnoise.
                    The language of the portion of the <hi rend="italic">Tain</hi> in the Book of
                    the Dun Cow is not older at most than the beginning of the 10th century; the
                    text of the Book of Leinster, which contains the whole story, is more modern,
                    although the two manuscripts do not differ in age perhaps fifty years, the
                    language of each copy evidently following, as we have before pointed out, the
                    current of the spoken language. The tales of the heroic cycle, whenever
                    originally written, are essentially pagan, and represent an early state of
                    society still unaffected by Christianity or by Roman influence. That real
                    persons may become the heroes of legends, and very simple everyday acts the
                    roots of myths, is too well known to require proof. Indeed, it may be doubted
                    whether a real personage may not always be necessary as a lay figure for the
                    myths to gather round in the first instance. Be this as it may, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cvxhulaind, Medb,</hi> and the rest of the personages of the
                    heroic period, notwithstanding their complete anthropomorphism, are a phase of
                    Irish mythology. The connection of the <hi rend="italic">Tuαtha De Danann</hi>
                    pantheon and the actors in the heroic tales is direct and explicit. Thus the
                    rival bulls, which are the direct cause of the war, are but metamorphoses of two
                    hostile personages among the inhabitants of the <hi rend="italic">Side,</hi> the
                    representatives perhaps of the Teutonic Aesir and Vanir. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fedelm,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Ben Fdth,</hi> prophetess, from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sid</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Cruαchan,</hi> appears to <hi
                    rend="italic">Medb</hi> and describes to her <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cúckulaind</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">Badb,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mor Rigu,</hi> forewarns <hi rend="italic">Cúchulaind</hi> of his
                    death; the latter in the tale of the Bed of Decline, which we have referred to
                    in speaking of the mythological tales, is bewitched by the woman of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sid</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">Fand,</hi> wife
                    of <hi rend="italic">Manandan Mas Lir,</hi> falls in love with him; he visits
                    <hi rend="italic">Tir Tairng ire,</hi> or the Land of Promise, and assists the
                    people of the <hi rend="italic">Side</hi> in a battle against their enemies. <hi
                    rend="italic">Medb,</hi> too, has power over the <hi rend="italic">Geiniti
                    Glindi,</hi> or Spirits of the Glen, and in many ways shows her divine
                    nature.</p>
                <p>The poems and tales which we have called Fennian, or Oisianic, form a cycle
                    entirely distinct from the heroic one. Their history, too, is curious. <hi
                    rend="italic">Finn,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Find,</hi> the son of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cuτnall,</hi> the chief hero of the tales, is supposed to have
                    flourished in the second half of the 3d century and to have acted as commander
                    of a body of mercenaries. He therefore lived at a time which may be considered,
                    if not actually within the historic period, at least upon its threshold. The
                    struggle of the various races for mastery was ended, and this militia or
                    standing army was evidently intended to keep the subject races in check. That
                    the idea of such a force was suggested by the Roman army in Britain there can be
                    little doubt. Perhaps to the existence of this body is due the considerable
                    scale upon which the subsequent invasions of Britain by the Scots took place. As
                    <hi rend="italic">Finn</hi> appears in the accounts of the battles which he is
                    supposed to have fought, he has all the air of an historical character, and is
                    almost entirely devoid of legendary accessories. The same may be said of his son
                    <hi rend="italic">Oisin,</hi> the poet, and of his grandson <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oscar.</hi> In the Book of Leinster are two poems ascribed to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oisin,</hi> and only two or three tales belonging to the Fennian cycle—one of
                    which has reached the present time—are mentioned. Indeed in the older
                    manuscripts there are few references to <hi rend="italic">Finn,</hi> or to any
                    of the personages of the Fennian romances. In the 12th century it would appear,
                    therefore, that <hi rend="italic">Finn</hi> and the other Fenuians had only just
                    begun to become the heroes of romance. But between the end of the 12th and the
                    middle of the 15th century a rich body of poems and tales came into existence.
                    This new Fennian epos possessed considerable vitality, for it continued to grow
                    even down to the present century, and at least one entirely new tale belongs to
                    the 18th century, and many received considerable expansion during the same time.
                    The cause of this very remarkable growth of legend is obscure, and would be well
                    worth investigating in connection with the history of romance. The two streams
                    of romance are perfectly distinct and never mingle; at least we never find any
                    of the heroes of the heroic period mentioned as actors in genuine Feunian tales.
                    No better proof of the spurious character of a legend could be given than the
                    co-existence in the same poem or story of actors belonging to the two romantic
                    cycles.</p>
                <p>The Fennian or Oisianic legends are very numerous and very romantic, and there is
                    a distinct Fenuian toponomy, which has not obscured or invaded that of the
                    heroic period. <hi rend="italic">Finn</hi> is still a popular hero, while <hi
                    rend="italic">Cŭchulaind</hi> has become a shadow. In the current Fennian
                    literature, as distinguished from the mere corrupt popular plastic legend on the
                    one hand, and the Fennian poems and tales contained in good manuscripts of the
                    15th century on the other, there is an increasing disregard of relative
                    chronology, and of consistent toponomy. There is not the same terseness and
                    clearness of expression in the new as in the old stories; they are evidently the
                    work of a people who are no longer in the same stage of Culture. The
                    descriptions of the dress and arms of the actors are vague, the number of those
                    slain in battle is greater. The romances of the 14th and 15th centuries are full
                    of magic and wild prodigies, but nevertheless they have the aroma of the forest
                    and the mountain heather; one hears the echo of the huntsman’s horn, and sees
                    the rude life of the <hi rend="italic">Dun,</hi> and the deep drinking of the
                    chief’s ale-house. The prose tales lack the refinement of the Welsh <hi
                    rend="italic">Mabinogion,</hi> and the poems the polish of the Welsh ones, but
                    they are truer products of the national culture of the period.</p>

                <p>The sixth or miscellaneous class of legends do not require special notice, the
                    more so as we have already included among the mythological tales some that might
                    come under this head. Nor do the limits of this article permit us to say
                    anything on the subject of lyric poetry. We have spoken of the incantations in
                    verse of the <hi rend="italic">File,</hi> and of the satirical poetry which
                    originated in them, and which for a long time was endowed by the popular mind
                    with baneful powers. This belief was the source of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fiiïs</hi> influence in Christian times, and encouraged him to indulge in
                    satirical compositions. Some of these possess considerable merit, and two of
                    them deserve to be specially mentioned as early examples of a form of satire
                    which was used by the French writers of <hi rend="italic">fabliaux,</hi> and
                    which in the hands of Rabelais and Swift gave rise to great works. The first is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aislinge</hi> or Phantasy of a certain <hi rend="italic">A
                    nier,</hi> the son of <hi rend="italic">Conglinn,</hi> who lived at the end of
                    the 8th century. He was at first a theological student, but soon relinquished
                    divinity for satire and the free life of a <hi rend="italic">Fili.</hi> He
                    betook himself to Cork, to <hi rend="italic">Cathal,</hi> king of Munster, who
                    happened to sufferat the time from the disease of a voracious appetite, for
                    which he sought everywhere a cure. <hi rend="italic">Anier</hi> undertakes it
                    and succeeds. The piece opens with a kind of prelude in which a northern hag
                    boasts that <hi rend="italic">Maeldun,</hi> king of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ailech</hi> in Ulster, <hi rend="italic">Cat hat's</hi> rival for the paramount
                    sovereignty of Ireland, is about to go to the south and carry off its spoils; a
                    southern hag defies him, and says he will stop on the way. The poet, as if to
                    raise his own importance, gives in a short poem the names, tribes, and places of
                    eight scholars of repute, among whom is of course the poet himself, who had
                    studied together at the school of Armagh. Having thus given himself the
                    necessary importance, he describes his preparation for his journey to Cork, and
                    the journey itself. On his arrival there he goes to the guest-house of the
                    Cenobium, but not finding it an agreeable place, and the food being not to his
                    liking, he writes a severe satire on the place, for which he is treated badly by
                    the abbot <hi rend="italic">Anier</hi> revenges himself by writing a singular
                    genealogy of <hi rend="italic">Manchan,</hi> the abbot, whose ancestors up to
                    Adam he represents to be various forms of luxurious viands. He then acquaints
                    the abbot with his object in visiting Cork, and relates a vision which he had of
                    an island of wheaten bread in the midst of a lake of new milk, on which was a
                    house of butter and other articles of food. He fancies himself ferried over to
                    this island in a boat of beef, and finds at the house a singular doorkeeper
                    dressed in clothes of beef, curds, fish, butter, &amp;c., and ornamented with
                    garlands of sausages. Here he learns how to cure his voracious appetite, which
                    he feigns to be the object of his search. The result of this account of his
                    vision is that <hi rend="italic">Manchan</hi> sends him to the house of a
                    certain <hi rend="italic">Pichan,</hi> where he has an interview with king <hi
                    rend="italic">Cαthαl,</hi> and relates to him another vision of a mansion made
                    of the most delicious viands, with the object of enticing the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lοnchraes,</hi> or voracious demon, with which the king was supposed to be
                    possessed, to come forth. By such stratagems he ultimately succeeds in enticing
                    the demon out, and curing the king. The personification of viands in this
                    curious piece forcibly reminds us of the French <hi rend="italic">fabliau</hi>
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Bataille</hi><hi rend="italic">de Karesme</hi><hi

                <p>The Dream or Phantasy of <hi rend="italic">Anier Mac Conglinne</hi> is in a
                    manuscript, of about the year 1400, called <hi rend="italic">Leabhar Breac,</hi>
                    the Speckled Book, but the language of the piece even in its present state
                    proves that it is much older. There seems, indeed, no reason to doubt that it
                    really was written in the 8th or 9th century, and that the orthography has been
                    only a httle changed by the scribes who copied it. The contrast between the
                    dishes, the mere recital of which it was hoped would entice the demon from <hi
                    rend="italic">Cathal</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> stomach, and those
                    mentioned in the French <hi rend="italic">fabliau</hi> are very instructive as
                    regards the kinds of food in use, and the relative degree of skill in the
                    culinary art, and the general culture of Ireland and France at the periods when
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aislinge</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">fabliau</hi> were

                    Westmeath, which was plundered and demolished in his absence by some of the

                    rend="italic">Mac Cοise</hi> not being in a position to demand redress directly,
                    had recourse to his art. Going to the <hi rend="italic">Dun</hi> of <hi

                    the king, as was customary, asked him what tales he could recite; the poet names
                    those he knows, all of which the king has heard before save one called the

                    rend="italic">Mac Cοise</hi> then describes the attack and destruction of his
                    house, using allegorical names for all the actors in the outrage. He first gives
                    the pedigree of <hi rend="italic">Mael</hi> “of the honeyed words,” from the god
                    <hi rend="italic">Dagda.</hi> As the hostile party approach the <hi

                    they are, and what they seek. The spokesman of the enemy gives a number of
                    allegorical names, which when interpreted mean the O’Neills themselves. The
                    nymph asks would they not prefer the jewels of poetic eloquence and eulogy to
                    the torturing lash of satire, for she possessed abundance of both, from the
                    panegyrics of <hi rend="italic">Mac Lonáin,</hi> the satires of <hi

                    “Broom, daughter of Tidiness,” and so on. The result of this clever piece of
                    satire was the restoration of the poet’s property, and compensation for his

                    conventionally called Druidic, and that charms and incantations formed part of
                    the means of cure, like those of the Gallo-Roman physician Marcellus Burdi-gaH
                    ensis. The position assigned to the leech by the laws in the Middle Ages was a
                    very high one. He ranked with the smith and the <hi rend="italic">Cerd,</hi> or
                    artist in gold and silver; and the <hi rend="italic">0llamh,</hi> or doctor in
                    leechcraft, ranked with an <hi rend="italic">Aire Ard,</hi> that is, one of the
                    highest grades of lord, who had ten free-stock tenants and ten base-stock
                    tenants. He had also a distinguished place at assemblies, and at the table of
                    the king. Leech-craft became hereditary in certain families, some of whose names
                    indicate their profession, as O’Lee, that is <hi rend="italic">O’Liaigh,</hi>
                    the descendant of the leech; and O’Hickey, <hi rend="italic">O'IHceadha,</hi>
                    the descendant of the healer. The heads of these families kept schools of
                    leechcraft, as the <hi rend="italic">Breitheams</hi> kept schools of law. many

                    says of both classes of schools, “They speake Latine like a vulgar language,
                    learned in their common schooles of Leachcraft and Law, whereat they begin
                    children, and hold on sixteene or twentie yeares conning by roate the Aphorismes
                    of Hypocrates, and the Civill Institutions, and a few other parings of those two
                    faculties.” Many of the books of these families still exist in the libraries of
                    the Royal Irish Academy, the King’s Inns, &amp;c., in Dublin. These books show
                    that the Irish leeches were well acquainted with the works of Hippocrates,
                    Dioscorides, Galen, Avicenna, Rhazes, and most of the medical writers of the
                    Continent of their time. They also contain early translations into Irish of
                    several medical works of repute.</p>

                    >Leabhar Breac,</hi> or Speckled Book, now in the library of the Royal Irish
                    Academy, contains chiefly religious writings, which give us the means of
                    estimating what may be called the popular religious literature in the 13th and
                    14th centuries. It contains homilies on moral, scriptural, doctrinal, and
                    ritualistic subjects, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> on the duties of kings and
                    subjects, on charity, almsgiving, the ten commandments, the commandments of the
                    church, the different festivals, prayer, fasting, and abstinence, baptism, the
                    ceremonies of the mass, &amp;c.; an epitome of Bible history from the Creation
                    to the Ascension, which often so closely follows the text of the Scriptures,
                    that we may regard it almost as a translation; the legends of the Finding and
                    Exaltation of the Holy Cross, embodying much of the Gospel of Nicodemus, which
                    was popularized in every country in Europe in the Middle Ages; the acts of
                    several saints, which are found in Early English, French, and German literature;
                    the lives of the three principal Irish saints, Patrick, Brigit, and Columcillé,
                    and of some others; the elegies of St <hi rend="italic">Colum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cillé,</hi> and St <hi rend="italic">Senán,</hi> &amp;c. There are
                    also many legendary lives of the saints of the early Irish Church in some of the
                    principal vellum manuscripts. It will thus be seen that the popular religious
                    literature in Ireland did not differ from that of neighbouring countries, and on
                    the whole bears favourable comparison with it.</p>
                <p>We have no direct evidence that the Pictish language was ever written, but
                    inductive reasoning is rather against the supposition, for no trace of a poem or
                    legend has survived. The cause of this is not far to seek. The Pictish language,
                    as we have already pointed out, was a Goidelic dialect, which at the period of
                    the principal Dalriadic settlement in the west of Scotland did not perhaps
                    differ from Irish more than Low German or Alemanian does from High German, if
                    even so much. There was just difference enough to make intercourse between the
                    Scots and the Picts at first somewhat difficult. This close relationship of
                    language is no doubt the explanation of the readiness with which Scots and Picts
                    allied against the Britons. In the 5th and 6th centuries, when the Irish kingdom
                    established in Alba began to become an important factor in the affairs of that
                    country, the Irish were a lettered people. The Irish <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fili,</hi> or poet, followed in the track of the Irish missionary, and carried
                    the poems and historic tales of Ireland among a kindred people, having the same
                    eponymous ancestors, and nearly identical mythological traditions. For several
                    centuries after the conversion of the Picts, Alba, as Scotland was then called,
                    was a second home to the Irish <hi rend="italic">Ceilĕ Dé,</hi> or monk, and the
                    Irish poet and harper. Even in the 12th and 13th centuries the Irish poets and
                    musicians included Scotland in their circuit, and took refuge, or sought their
                    fortune there. We shall mention one instance as it happens to be instructive in
                    another way, that of <hi rend="italic">Muiredĭiach</hi> O’Daly, better known, on
                    account of his long residence in Scotland, as <hi rend="italic">Μuiτedhach
                    Albanach,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Muireaxh</hi> the Albanian, or as we should
                    now say, the Scotchman. Did we not know the whole history of this man, who is
                    believed by the Rev. Dr T. M*Lauchlan to be the ancestor of the great race of
                    Mac Vurrichs, bards to MacDonald of Clanranald, we should never have suspected
                    him to have been an Irish <hi rend="italic">Fili.</hi> It is easy to understand
                    how under these circumstances the literary and cultivated language came to be
                    Irish. But beneath this literary language there was the under-current of the
                    original Pictish, which was gradually modified under the influence of the Irish,
                    in the same way that a literary language always influences the spoken language.
                    Nor should we forget that in this case the action was more potent because it was
                    directly exerted on the people through the preachers, and by the bards reciting
                    their poems and telling their stories. Towards the middle of the 15th century
                    Irish literature began to decline and the Irish language to recede. Irish poets
                    aud musicians still continued, however, to include Scotland in their
                    visitations, but the connection between the two countries began to be weakened,
                    and the Scottish dialect accordingly gradually rose into literary importance.
                    Poems and tales began to be written in it; and those originally written in Irish
                    were recast in the local· dialect. There can be no doubt, too, that the legends
                    and historical traditions brought over from Ireland, which had been transformed
                    by, or had absorbed into them, the primitive Pictish traditions of the same kind
                    which grew from the same original stem, began to be recast and modified, and a
                    new growth of legends to spring up indigenous to Scotland. In this way a <hi
                    rend="italic">Gaelic</hi> literature arose, of which some examples are to be
                    found in the Dean of Lismore’s Book. Its development was, however, arrested by
                    the Reformation. This would have been only a temporary check, but for the
                    political changes which followed, and which by gradually bringing the most
                    remote part of the Highlands into the current of a wider and more active
                    political life, and by drawing to the capital and within the direct influence of
                    modern European culture the Scottish nobility, gave an additional stimulus to
                    the spread of English, and reduced the Gaelic to a peasants’ patois. Under other
                    and more favourable circumstances the translation of the Bible into Gaelic, and
                    the composition of a Gaelic liturgy, together with the change in the whole
                    current of religious ideas, might have given rise to a new type of Celtic
                    literature.</p>
                <p>The success which attended some translations made by James MacPherson led him to
                    make a tour in the Highlands, and to gather as many poems and other specimens of
                    Gaelic literature as he could find. It was no doubt during this tour that he
                    matured his idea of using the legends preserved in the popular memory, written
                    down in Scottish Gaelic, and existing in the Irish MSS.; which he came across in
                    his travels, as materials out of which to compose the poems which have since
                    become so celebrated under the name of the poems of Ossian. We mean of course
                    the English poems, for in the usual sense of that word no Gaelic originals
                    existed. The so-called originals are a very curious kind of mosaic, constructed
                    evidently with great labour afterwards, in which sentences, or parts of
                    sentences of genuine poems are cemented together in a very inferior word-paste
                    of MacPherson’s ow n. We have pointed out that the personages of the two cycles
                    of romance, the heroic and the Fennian, are never mingled as actors in genuine
                    national poetry or tales. This is, however, done commonly by MacPherson. Thus in

                    under the influence of the <hi rend="italic">Tain Bô Cuailnge,</hi> we have <hi

                    (Gaul, son of Morna), and other heroes of the Ossianic period. This mingling of
                    the heroes of two different cycles of romance would be sufficient to prove, did
                    we possess no other test, that MacPherson had no original. The old Celtic tales
                    are especially characterized on the one hand by the detailed descriptions they
                    give of the personal appearance, dress, and arms of the chief actors in a tale,
                    and of the internal arrangements of the houses, &amp;c.; and on the other by the
                    absence of descriptions of scenery, except when <hi rend="italic">Tir
                    Taimgire,</hi> the Land of Promise, is in question. The aspects of nature were
                    familiar tò those who listened to those tales, what they wanted to realize was
                    the actors and their deeds. MacPherson’s poems on the contrary are full of
                    word-pictures of nature, sometimes no doubt bombastic, but generally giving
                    beautiful, and often grandly poetic, descriptions of the most characteristic
                    features of the scenery of the Highlands. But the actors in his epic are like
                    figures seen through a mist, barely sketched in outline, whose dress, ornaments,
                    and arms are so generally and vaguely described as to lose all peculiar and
                    distinctive character. The Poems of Ossian are thoroughly modern, more so even
                    than the current legends of the west of Scotland which retain many
                    things—talking ravens, soothsaying, &amp;c., which savour of old times. An
                    examination of the poems and prose tales of the Irish Oisianic cycle is very
                    instructive in this connection; the older they are the more detailed are the
                    descriptions of the actors and of their dress and arms; the newer the vaguer and
                    more general—the more like MacPherson’s heroes do they become. In this respect
                    MacPherson did no more than what he was entitled to do, and what has been done
                    by others who have used similar materials for the construction of poems. The
                    author of the Nibelungen Lay fused in the 12th century legends of the Horny
                    Siegfried with those of a different and newer cycle concerning Attila, Dietrich
                    von Bern, Brunhild, &amp;c. So the romances of Arthur and the St Graal, though
                    of a totally different origin have mingled together. So, too, the mediaeval
                    German poets took many liberties with the French romances, which served them as
                    materials. What he had no right to do was to call his poem a translation. It is
                    unfortunate for his fame that he should have supported this comparatively
                    trivial error by the grave one of producing his pretended original. Let us add
                    that the publication of a selection of the poems in the manuscript known as the
                    Dean of Lismore’s Book by Mr W. F. Skene and the Rev. T. M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> Lauchlan, and Mr J. F. Campbell’s collection of <hi
                    rend="italic">Popular Tales of the West Highlands,</hi> have done more to settle
                    the Ossianic controversy than all that had been written by the combatants on
                    both sides.</p>
                <p>The number of Welsh manuscripts is considerable, but with the exception of those
                    in the British Museum, the library of Jesus College, Oxford, and that of the
                    university of Cambridge, they are all in private collections. Of these the most
                    important is the Hengwrt collection, consisting of the manuscripts collected by
                    Mr Jones of Geliy Lyvdy, between the years 1590 and 1630, and by the antiquary
                    Mr Robert Vaughan of Hengwrt, who died in 1666. The two collectors arranged that
                    their manuscripts should be united on the death of one of them, the survivor to
                    become the possessor of the whole. According to this arrangement they became the
                    property of Mr Vaughan, and hence got the name of the Hengwrt collection. Some
                    years ago Sir Robert Vaughan bequeathed the collection, comprising, we believe,
                    about four hundred volumes, to Mr W. W. E. Wynne of Peniarth, in whose
                    possession it now is. But although Welsh manuscripts are numerous there are very
                    few of any considerable antiquity, the others being comparatively modern
                    compilations, often the work of ignorant scribes, the contents of which seem for
                    the most part to have been in the first instance taken from the old books just
                    spoken of. Of such old books there are, exclusive of law manuscripts, only five
                    of such antiquity or importance as to deserve special mention here. The first is
                    a copy of the hexametrical paraphrase of the Gospels of Juvencus in the
                    University Library of Cambridge, as old at least as the 9th century. The only
                    Welsh it contains are some glosses and two short poems written in Irish
                    characters; but as the oldest specimens of Welsh known they are invaluable as a
                    standard wherewith to compare the language of other manuscripts. The second is
                    the Black Book of Carmarthen, a small quarto vellum manuscript of 54 leaves,
                    written in Gothic letters by various hands in the reign of Henry II.
                    (1154-1189). This manuscript originally'belonged to the Priory of Black Canons
                    at Carmarthen, and was given by the treasurer of the Church of St David to one
                    of the commissioners appointed by Henry VIII. for the suppressed monasteries,
                    Sir John Price. It is now in the Hengwrt collection at Peniarth. The third is
                    the Book of Taliessin, also in the Hengwrt collection, a small quarto manuscript
                    consisting of 38 leaves of veUum written in Gothic letters throughout in one
                    hand, some time in the early part of the 14th century. Its history before it
                    came into the possession of Robert Vaughan, the antiquary, is not known. The
                    fourth is the Book of Aneurin, a small quarto manuscript of 19 leaves of vellum,
                    written probably in the end of the 13th century. It was purchased by the late
                    Sir Thomas Phillips of Middlehill, and may have been formerly in the Hengwrt
                    collection. The fifth is the Red Book of Hergest, so called from Hergest Court,
                    one of the seats of the Vaughans, for whom it was probably compiled. This
                    important manuscript, the chief repository of Welsh literature, is a folio
                    volume of 360 leaves of vellum, written in double columns at different times,
                    from the early part of the 14th to the middle of the 15th century, and is now in
                    the library of Jesus College, Oxford.</p>
                <p>The text of a large number of the poems and other compositions contained in Welsh
                    manuscripts has been published in a work in three volumes, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales.</hi> The first volume, containing
                    poems, and the second, chronicles and historical documents of various kinds,
                    were published in 1801; and the third, moral, didactic, legal, and miscellaneous
                    pieces, in 1803. This publication is due to the noble patriotism of three
                    men,—Owen Jones, a furrier in London, and the son of a Welshman, with whom the
                    idea originated while still a young man, and who devoted no inconsiderable
                    portion of his fortune to its realization; Edward Williams, a stonemason, better
                    known by his assumed name of <hi rend="italic">Iolo Morganwg,</hi> the chief
                    contributor to the collection; and William Owen, who afterwards assumed the name
                    of Pughe, the author of the principal dictionary of the Welsh. Had the critical
                    judgment and knowledge of the editors equalled their patriotism, the work would
                    be of great value.</p>
                <p>Welsh manuscript literature may be classed for our <pb break="no"

                    (6.)'Medicine and science. There are very few Welsh glossaries, because there
                    exist in fact few examples of obsolete or old Welsh. The oldest Welsh laws are
                    attributed to <hi rend="italic">Hοιοel Dda,</hi> who died in 950, and the oldest
                    codex containing them is believed to have been written in the 12th century. If
                    this codex contained the laws in their original form they would probably require
                    no gloss to explain them, because the language did not change very much in the
                    interval between the framing of the laws and the writing of the manuscripts. But
                    like all Welsh manuscripts, even the oldest copy of the laws gives us an edjtion
                    in the language of the time. A grammar of the Welsh, said to have been made by
                    <hi rend="italic">Edeyrn Dafod Aur,</hi> by the order and at the desire of three
                    Welsh princes, in the second half of the 13th century, has been published by the
                    Rev. J. Williams ab Ithel, from a copy made in 1832 from another copy made in
                    1821 from a manuscript of Edward Williams, or <hi rend="italic">Iolo
                    Morganwg.</hi> Whatever may be the intrinsic scientific value of the treatise
                    itself, this is a very doubtful source to derive historical value from. Mr
                    Williams has also published in the same volume a work on the rules of Welsh
                    poetry, originally compiled by <hi rend="italic">Daυydd Ddu Athraw</hi> in the
                    14th century, and subsequently enlarged by <hi rend="italic">Simwnt Vychαn</hi>
                    in the 16th century. We have no evidence as to how much belonged to the former
                    and how much to the latter, but it all appears to belong to the 17th century. Mr
                    Williams has also added a great deal of matter of his own, which is
                    distinguished from the text by being printed in smaller type. His object was to
                    combine in one volume as complete a body of information on the subject as
                    possible. It would be outside the scope of this article to criticise this
                    laborious work.</p>
                <p>If we might judge by names alone, the British, between the departure of the
                    Romans and the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons, possessed many historians. Welsh
                    anti quaries give a long list, and some find a place even in the works of
                    English, and foreign writers; but with the exception of Gildas and Nennius, the
                    titles only of their writings are known, nor are these above suspicion. Bede
                    quotes Gildas, and so far we have proof that as early as his time there was a
                    belief in the existence of such an author. The works now known as those of
                    Gildas and Nennius are written in Latin, and are properly outside our scope, but
                    they are so inseparably connected with the <hi rend="italic">Bruts</hi> or
                    Annals, and with the history of romance, that we must say a few words concerning
                    each. Gildas was the son of a British king of <hi rend="italic">Ailclyd,</hi>
                    the present Dumbarton, and was therefore from that part of Britain referred to
                    in Welsh works as <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Gogled.</hi> Several
                    dates have been assigned for his birth and death, but we prefer for the former
                    516, and for the latter 570, and his book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Excidio</hi><hi rend="italic">Britannioe,</hi> if genuine, seems
                    to have been written about 560. According to his legendary lives, he went to
                    Ireland on the invitation of St Brigit, founded monasteries there, and taught at
                    the school of Armagh. His work above named is written in an inflated style, and
                    is a mere sketch of British history under the Romans, and in the period
                    immediately succeeding their withdrawal from the country, and so includes the
                    period of the wars of the Britons with the Picts, Scots, and Saxons; it is fall
                    of blunders and anachronisms. Mr Skene suggests, very reasonably, that the
                    well-known letter of the Britons to Aetius, asking for Roman aid, is misplaced,
                    and that if put in its proper place the discrepancy between Gildas’s account of
                    the departure of the Romans from Britain and that of Greek and Roman writers
                    will disappear.</p>
                <p>Nothing is known of the person called Nennius, to whom the short History of the
                    Britons known by his name is attributed. In the earliest known manuscript of it,
                    written about the middle of the 10th century, and now in the Vatican Library, it
                    is ascribed to a certain Marc, who is believed to be the Marc who with his
                    nephew, <hi rend="italic">Moengal,</hi> better known as Marcellus (little Marc),
                    came to the monastery of St Gall about the middle of the 9th century, having
                    with him many books and a considerable retinue. Bestowing his wealth on his
                    followers, and reserving for himself only the books, he and his nephew remained
                    at St Gall, where the latter became celebrated as the teacher of Notker,
                    Ratpert, and Tutilo. Mr Skene thinks it was originally written in British in
                    Cumbria, or <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Goglcd,</hi> and was
                    afterwards translated into Latin. To this nucleus was added the genealogies of
                    the Saxon kings, down to 738; the above-mentioned Marc appended, probably about
                    823, the life of St Germanus, and the legends of St Patrick, which were
                    subsequently incorporated with the history. Some South Welshman added to the
                    oldest manuscript of the history in these countries, about 977, a chronicle of
                    events from 444 to 954, in which there are genealogies beginning with <hi
                    rend="italic">0wain,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Howel Dda</hi> king of South
                    Wales. This chronicle, which is not found in other manuscripts, has been made
                    the basis of two later chronicles brought down to 1286 and 1288 respectively. It
                    is consequently not the work of one author. A <hi rend="italic">Sai</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Fili,</hi> named <hi rend="italic">Gilla Caomhan,</hi> who died
                    1072, translated it into Irish, and added many things concerning the Irish and
                    the Picts.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Historia Britonum</hi> is more valuable for the legendary
                    matter which it contains than for what may be accepted as history, for it gives
                    us, at least as early as the 1 Oth century, the British legends of the
                    colonization of Great Britain and Ireland, the exploits of King Arthur, and the
                    wonderful birth and prophecies of Merlin, which are not found elsewhere before
                    the 12th century. The date of the book is of the greatest importance to the
                    history of mediaeval romance, and there can now be no doubt, especially since
                    the publication of the Irish Nennius, that it is earlier than the Norman
                    Conquest, and that the legends themselves are of British origin. The books
                    attributed to Gildas and Nennius contain the germs of the fables which expanded
                    into Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History of Britain, which was written in Latin
                    sometime before 1147, the date of the epistle dedicatory to Robert, earl of
                    Gloucester, the son of Henry I. by <hi rend="italic">Nest,</hi> only daughter of
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhys</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tewdwr,</hi> and was a manifestation of the great advance which took place in
                    Welsh literature consequent on the restoration of the Welsh prince just named,
                    and of <hi rend="italic">Gruffyd</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynan,</hi> and of which we shall have more to say hereafter. In the epistle
                    just referred to Geoffrey states that Walter, archdeacon of Oxford, had given
                    him a very ancient book in the British tongue, giving an account of the kings of
                    Britain from Brutus to <hi rend="italic">Cadwaladyr,</hi> and that he had
                    translated it into Latin at the archdeacon’s request. But in the Welsh version
                    of Geoffrey’s chronicle in the <hi rend="italic">Myvyrian Archaiology,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Brut Geoffrey ap Arthur,</hi> there is this postscript: “I,
                    Walter, archdeacon of Oxford, did turn this book out of Welsh into Latin; and in
                    my old age I turned it a second time out of Latin into Welsh.” That Geoffrey
                    drew his materials from British sources, and did not coin any of them, seems to
                    us the legitimate conclusion to be drawn from a careful study of the whole
                    subject. His book is, however, a compilation and not a translation, at all
                    events no book now exists which can be regarded as his original, while all the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bruts</hi> or chronicles are posterior to Geoffrey’s book and
                    based upon it. Of these there are the <hi rend="italic">Brut Tysilio</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Brut Geoffrey ap Arthur,</hi> both of which are also
                    called <hi rend="italic">Brut</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Brenhinoedd,</hi> or Chronicle of the Kings. The copy of the latter in the Red
                    Book is <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n327/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0327-0316"/> followed by a chronicle in continuation which,
                    according to an entry in a later hand, was called <hi rend="italic">Brut
                    Twysogion,</hi> or Chronicle of the Princes. In some manuscripts there is also
                    added a chronicle of Welsh events interspersed with Saxon ones, which is from
                    this called the <hi rend="italic">Brut</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Saeson,</hi> or Chronicle of the Saxons; in one manuscript this is
                    attributed to Caradoc of Llancarvan. The chronicle of events from 444 to 954,
                    which is contained in the British Museum manuscript of the History of Nennius,
                    and two other chronicles, already mentioned, bringing events down to 1286 and
                    1288, have been printed together as the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cambrioe.</hi> These later chronicles ought not, as Mr Skene
                    properly remarks, to have been incorporated with the older one, which alone
                    possesses the special value of having been written before the Norman Conquest,
                    and a century and a half before the <hi rend="italic">Bruts.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the chronicles or <hi rend="italic">Bmts</hi> there are no historical
                    works properly so called in Welsh, unless we include the Triads, a curious kind
                    of literature peculiar to Wales; for although there are some Irish Triads they
                    are imitations of the Welsh ones, an imitation which fortunately did not extend
                    very far. The Triads are an arrangement of similar subjects, similar events, or
                    things which might be associated in the mind, or be worthy of remembrance,
                    &amp;c., in series of three, <hi rend="italic">eg.,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi>
                    Three ornaments of a hamlet—a book, a teacher versed in song, and a smith in his
                    smithy;” or “Three punishments for theft in hand—the first is imprisonment, the
                    second is cutting off a limb, the third is hanging.” This kind of composition
                    appears to have come into use in the 12th century, the earliest specimen being
                    the Triads of the Horses, which are in the Black Book. The Triads of Arthur and
                    his warriors are perhaps as old as the 13th century. The Red Book contains the
                    Triads of the Island of Britain, which include those last mentioned, an enlarged
                    edition of the Triads of the Horses, and many others. The Triads of <hi
                    rend="italic">Dyfnwal Moelιnud,</hi> a supposed ancient king of Britain, are
                    perhaps as old as the beginning of the 16th century.</p>
                <p>The poetic literature of the Welsh, which is very extensive, maybe conveniently
                    divided into—(1.) Poems attributed to poets who lived before the 12th century,
                    and anonymous poems in the Black Book; and (2.) Poems written by or attributed
                    to poets who lived in the 12th and succeeding centuries. The claims of the Welsh
                    to possess an ancient literature rests altogether on the poems of the first
                    category, hence they have been the subject of much discussion. The grounds upon
                    which such discussions have hitherto rested have altered considerably within the
                    last few years. The labours of Zeuss and others who have worked at Celtic
                    philology, and the discovery of specimens of Old Welsh in the Cambridge Codex of
                    Juvencus, furnish us with much safer canons of criticism than existed in 1849,
                    when even a learned Welshman, the late Mr Thomas Stephens, who did more than any
                    one else to establish the claims of his country to a real literature, doubted
                    the authenticity of a large number of the poems said to have been written by
                    Taliessin, Aneurin, Merlin, and Llywarch Hên, who are supposed to have lived in
                    the 5th century. Mr W. F. Skene has done a very great service to Welsh
                    literature by the publication of the texts of those poems from the four
                    principal manuscripts now known, the Black Book, the Book of Taliessin, the Book
                    of Aneurin, and the Red Book. In addition to the texts Mr Skene has given
                    translations of the poems specially made for him by the Rev. D. Silvan Evans and
                    the Rev. Robert Williams, so that next to the Welsh Laws, and Stephens’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Literature of the Kymry,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Four Ancient
                    Books of Wales</hi> is the most important contribution to Welsh literature yet
                    made.</p>
                <p>If we judge by the test of language alone, the poems which we have included in
                    our first category, and which are nearly all to be found in Mr Skene’s book, are
                    not in their present form older than the 1lth century. But while the form may be
                    new the substance may be old, as we have already pointed out in the case of many
                    Irish poems. It is probable that many of the poems attributed to Aneurin, and
                    several of the mythological and religious poems, are only popular editions of
                    much older poems, and further that the change effected in some of them may be so
                    small that we have substantially the original poems. Others again have been so
                    deeply modified that they may be regarded as new poems on an old theme.</p>
                <p>The following classification of those poems shows their origin, and will help to
                    render the few observations we can offer here more intelligible.</p>
                <p>1. Poems referring to events in Romanized Britain, or to the east frontier of
                    Wales.</p>
                <p>2 Poems referring to events on the Mercian frontier and in South Cumbria.</p>
                <p>3. Poems referring to personages and events connected with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gwyddel</hi> or Goidelic occupation of Wales and Cornwall.</p>
                <p>4. Poems referring to the <hi rend="italic">Gwyr</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gogled,</hi> or Men of the North.</p>
                <p>5. Poems relating to or attributed to <hi rend="italic">Taliessin</hi> of a
                    general character.</p>
                <p>6. Proverbial poetry attributed to <hi rend="italic">Llywarch, Hên.</hi></p>
                <p>7. Poems attributed to poets between the 7th and 11th centuries.</p>
                <p>8. Anonymous religious poems in the Black Book.</p>
                <p>9. Poems referring to personages and events of Welsh history in the 12th and
                    subsequent centuries.</p>
                <p>The first class is represented by one poem in the Book of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taliessin,</hi> The Reconciliation of <hi rend="italic">Llud</hi> the Less,
                    which would be unintelligible but for a <hi rend="italic">Mabinogi</hi> to which
                    we shall refer later. The poem has no mark of antiquity about it, and belongs to
                    the 13th century. To the second class belong the Death Song of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Erof,</hi> and other pieces in which that warrior is mentioned, and the Death
                    Song of <hi rend="italic">Uthyr Pendragon,</hi> all of which are in the Book of
                    <hi rend="italic">Taliessin,</hi> and in form and substance are not older than
                    the 12th century. The poems of the third class are of considerable importance,
                    but here we shall merely give the names of a few as examples, reserving what we
                    have to say concerning them until we come to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mabinogion.</hi> The following are good examples of the class—The Death Song of
                    <hi rend="italic">Corroi,</hi> The Battle of <hi rend="italic">Godeu,</hi> and
                    The Chair of <hi rend="italic">Ceridwen,</hi> from the Book of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taliessin∙,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Preiddeu Annwn</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">Daronιvy,</hi> and the poems relating to <hi
                    rend="italic">Gwydyon ap Don,</hi> from the Black Book, the Book of <hi
                    rend="italic">Taliessin,</hi> and the Red Book. The poems which belong to the
                    fourth class are the most numerous and important. Among them may be mentioned
                    first of all the <hi rend="italic">Gododin</hi> poems, those relating to <hi
                    rend="italic">Urien Rheged,</hi> the war between the sons of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Llywarch Hen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mwg Μawr Drefydd,</hi> poems relating
                    to the battle of <hi rend="italic">Adderyd,</hi> as for instance the <hi
                    rend="italic">Avail man,</hi> or Apple Trees, and poems relating to <hi
                    rend="italic">Cadwallawn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cadwaladyr.</hi> We have
                    already explained that <hi rend="italic">y G</hi><hi rend="italic">ogled</hi>
                    was that portion of Britain which lay between the Walls of Hadrian and
                    Antoninus, and had been erected into the Roman province of Valentia. As it was a
                    loose terra, it may have included all the independent British country north of
                    the Ribble. This country, and especially that part of it forming the ancient
                    diocese of Glasgow, was the cradle of the Welsh language and literature. It was
                    the only part that could have been this. Here the question naturally suggests
                    itself, to what extent was Britain Romanized î That it was not so to the extent
                    usually supposed may be shown in many ways. It is obvious that, if the southern
                    Britons were as thoroughly Romanized as Gaul or Spain, the language of Cornwall
                    should have been a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n328/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0328-0317"/> Romance dialect, and that of Brittany an allied
                    one. Again, if the Welsh were a remnant of the Romanized Britons driven westward
                    by the conquering Saxons, the Welsh language also should be a Romance dialect,
                    oj ’ its vocabulary should contain a large intermixture of words borrowed from
                    the Latin, and especially of words connected with law, trades, &lt;fcc. But this
                    is not so. The fact is the population of Britain was not Romanized to any
                    extent. In the towns the principal citizens no doubt spoke Latin, as they speak
                    English in Calcutta and other large towns in India. A large British population
                    iu part bilingual gathered round the cities and towns, as the Irish did about
                    the Anglo-Norman towns of the Pale, and as the Letts, Esthonians, and Russians
                    do about the German towns of the Russian Baltic provinces. We should also not
                    forget that the legionaries in the 2d and 3d centuries were only Roman in name,
                    being recruited from every part of the empire, and consequently could not
                    contribute to Romanizing the inhabitants among whom they were located. The
                    peasantry continued British, but the nobility, no doubt, learned to speak Latin,
                    but not for home use. When afterwards the Saxons on the east and the Irish on
                    the west of what is now Wales displaced the ruling families, the Romanized part
                    of the independent British population, hemmed in between the two hostile
                    peoples, and with an ever-encroaching Saxon frontier on one side, gradually
                    merged into the Celtic-speaking peasantry, and lost the use of the Latin tongue.
                    This was not a state of things favourable for the development of a literature.
                    In the north especially, between the Walls of Hadrian and Antoninus, in the
                    province of Valentia, which never had Roman towns, only camps occupied by
                    legionaries, who for the most part probably spoke no Latin, the whole population
                    must have remained essentially British after the withdrawal of Roman power. Here
                    if anywhere the first germs of a British literature should show themselves, and
                    accordingly tradition makes <hi rend="italic">Taliessin, Aneurin, Llywarch
                    Hên,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">My r din</hi> or Merlin, to whom most of the
                    supposed ancient Welsh poems are attributed, natives of this region. Here also
                    the actors in the events referred to in the poems lived, and the places where
                    those events are supposed to have taken place are to be found. The greater part
                    of this region, too, enjoyed substantial independence down to the end of the 9th
                    century, with the exception of the interval from 655, when they were subjected
                    to the kingdom of Northumbria by Oswy, after the defeat of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cadwallawn</hi> and Penda, to the battle of Dunnichen in 686, when Ecfrid, king
                    of Northumbria, was defeated. From the 7th to the 9th century Cumbria, including
                    under that name all the British territory from the Ribble to the Clyde, was the
                    principal theatre of British and Saxon conflict. The τise of the dynasty of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mailcun,</hi> who according to Welsh tradition was a descendant of
                    <hi rend="italic">Cunedda,</hi> one of the <hi rend="italic">Gwyddd</hi> or
                    Goidelic Picts of the district called <hi rend="italic">Guotodin,</hi> brought
                    Wales into close connection with the Cumbrian kingdom, and prepared both North
                    and South Wales for the reception of the northern traditions and the rise of a
                    true Welsh literature.</p>
                <p>Whether the poets of Cumbria really wrote any of the poems which in a modified
                    form have come down to us or not, there can be no doubt that a number of lays
                    attributed to them lived in popular tradition, and that under the sudden burst
                    of glory which the deeds of <hi rend="italic">Cadwallawn</hi> called forth, and
                    which ended in the disastrous defeat of 655, a British literature began to
                    spring up, and was nourished by the hopes of a future resurrection under his son
                    <hi rend="italic">Cadwaladyι',</hi> whose death was disbelieved in for so long a
                    time. These floating lays and traditions gradually gathered into North Wales,
                    according as the nobility and bards sought refuge there from the advancing
                    conquests of the Saxon kings in the north. The heroes of Cumbria became
                    Welshmen, and the sites of the battles they fought were identified with places
                    of similar name in Wales and England. When <hi rend="italic">Howel Dda</hi>
                    became king of all Wales, the legends of the north passed into South Wales, and
                    like the legends of <hi rend="italic">Oisin</hi> in Scotland, became so
                    thoroughly identified with their new home, that they seem to have first
                    originated there.</p>
                <p>Of all the poems attributed to the four ancient Welsh bards, the one which has
                    most claim to be considered genuine, and the only one we can specially allude to
                    here, is that known as <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Gododin.</hi>
                    As published by Mr Skene from the Book of <hi rend="italic">Aneurin,</hi> it
                    consists of 94 stanzas, and is both obscure and fragmentary. The latter
                    character Mr Skene explains, and we think successfully, by supposing that it
                    consists in reality of two distinct poems, referring to two events separated by
                    a long interval of time. The first event is the battle of <hi rend="italic"
                    >CaUrαeth,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Bellum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Miathorum</hi> of Adamnan, fought between the Britons and Scots under <hi
                    rend="italic">Aedan,</hi> king of Dalriada, and the pagan Saxons and their
                    British subjects in <hi rend="italic">Devyr</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bryneick</hi> or Deira and Bernicia, and the half-pagan Picts of <hi
                    rend="italic">Guotodin,</hi> a district corresponding to the northern part of
                    the Lothians along the Firth of Forth. <hi rend="italic">Cattraeth</hi> was the
                    adjoining district on the Forth where the great Roman wall terminates at
                    Carriden, the Fort of <hi rend="italic">Eidinn.</hi> If this view be correct,
                    and it is the best that has yet been proposed, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mynydawg</hi> of the poem was <hi rend="italic">Aedan Mac Gabran,</hi> and the
                    battle the one fought in 596, of which Columcillé prophesied that <hi
                    rend="italic">Aedan</hi> would be unfortunate but victorious,—the misfortune
                    being doubtless the loss of his four sons in the battle, one of whom was named
                    <hi rend="italic">Artur (Art).</hi> The second and later portion of the poem, Mr
                    Skene thinks, refers to the battle of <hi rend="italic">Strathcαimnn,</hi> now
                    Strathcarron, in which <hi rend="italic">Domnal Brec,</hi> king of the Dalriadic
                    Scots of <hi rend="italic">Alba,</hi> was slain, 642. In the brevity of the
                    narrative, the careless boldness of the actors as they present themselves, the
                    condensed energy of the action, and the fierce exultation of the slaughter,
                    together with the recurring elegiac note, this poem (or poems if it be the work
                    of two authors) has some of the highest epic qualities. The ideas and manners
                    are in harmony with the age and country to which it is referred. The poems
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Gordians,</hi> which are also found in the Book of
                    <hi rend="italic">Aneurin,</hi> and refer to the personages and events of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gododin,</hi> possess many of the characteristics of that
                    poem, and are probably the work of the same time, if not of the same poet.</p>
                <p>Still more celebrated than <hi rend="italic">Aneurin,</hi> the reputed author of
                    <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Gododin,</hi> was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Talixssin,</hi> a name which has been interpreted as “Splendid Forehead,” and
                    has consequently been the subject of a good deal of mysticism. The number of
                    poems in the Book of <hi rend="italic">Ι'alisssin</hi> supposed to have been
                    written by him is considerable; in language they are not older than the 12th
                    century, though many of them may be what we have called in other cases popular
                    editions of older poems. Several belong to the fourth class which we have been
                    just considering; the poems which we would include in a special fifth class are
                    those which have been made the subject of bardic speculation in consequence of
                    their generality and vagueness, such as the Fold of the Bards, Hostile

                    Many of these poems possess considerable merit, and even as the work of the 12th
                    and 13th centuries might bear comparison with similar compositions in other
                    European literatures of the period.</p>

                    philosophy in which each proverb or wise saw is accompanied by a reference to
                    some natural feature, such as “Bright the tops of the broom,’’ which serves as a
                    kind of mnemonic catchword. This catchword is sometimes the same in every verse,
                    as in the poem <hi rend="italic">Eiry mnyd,</hi> mountain snow.</p>
                <p>Welsh tradition has preserved few poems of the period between the end of the 6th
                    century and the end of the 11 th, a period of 500 years, nor for the matter of
                    that even the names of poets, a circumstance which is intelligible enough if we
                    consider that Welsh literature really began with the 11th century, but
                    inexplicable according to the ordinary views of Welshmen. In the Black Book are
                    five poems attributed to three poets who lived in the early part of the barren
                    interval,— <hi rend="italic">Meigant,</hi> whose name also occurs in Irish
                    literature; <hi rend="italic">Elaeth,</hi> to whom are attributed two out of the
                    five poems, which are of a religious character; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cukelyn,</hi> a bard of the 9th century. The two poems attributed to the last
                    are of very great importance, because in them occurs the earliest mention of the
                    goddess <hi rend="italic">Cerixlwen,</hi> who plays so conspicuous a part in the
                    modern bardic system of Neo-Druidism. The anonymous religious poems of the Black
                    Book, apart from the language, may belong to any time from the 6th to the 12th
                    centuries; they probably belong in great part to the 11th and 12th centuries,
                    and were most likely the work of the monks in whose monastery the Black Book was
                    compiled. The ninth and last division of the early Welsh poems are those which
                    covertly allude to passing events in Wales, and can therefore be no older than
                    those events. Two of them refer to <hi rend="italic">Powys</hi> in Norman times,
                    the Satire of <hi rend="italic">Cynan Garwyn,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brochwael,</hi> in the Book of <hi rend="italic">Tăliessin,</hi> and the elegy
                    on <hi rend="italic">Gyndylan</hi> in the Red Book. The others are the poems
                    which Mr Skene groups together under the head “Poems which mention Henry or the
                    son of Henry;’’ the most important of them are those attributed to <hi
                    rend="italic">My rdin</hi> or Merlin, such as the Dialogue between <hi
                    rend="italic">Myrdin</hi> and his sister <hi rend="italic">Gwendydd,</hi> a
                    Fugitive Poem of <hi rend="italic">Myrdìn</hi> in his Grave, containing a number
                    of predictions, and the Songs of the Little Pigs, each stanza of which begins
                    with “<hi rend="italic">0ian a par-chellan,"</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi>
                    Listen, 0 Little Pig.” The structure of the last poem being like that of the
                    poem called the <hi rend="italic">A vellenau,</hi> each stanza of which
                    commences with that word “Sweet Apple-tree,” both are classed together, and in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Myvyrian Archaeology</hi> are attributed to Merlin. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Avellenau</hi> is, however, found in the Black Book, and is
                    every way an older poem; but it is needless to add that none of the poems of
                    Merlin are genuine, and that with the exception perhaps of the Apple-tree poem,
                    they all refer to times later than the 12th century, and to the present
                    Wales.</p>
                <p>Before discussing the second division of Welsh poetic literature, or poems
                    written by or attributed to poets who lived in Wales in the 12th and succeeding
                    centuries, we must say a few words on the Welsh bards. The organization of the
                    classes of learned men in Wales was far less developed than in Ireland.
                    According to the laws each king or prince had a household bard, who appears to
                    have performed the functions of the Irish <hi rend="italic">Sai</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Fili,</hi> and also that of harper. His position was honourable,
                    and on investiture he was presented by the king with a harp, and by the queen
                    with a gold ring. Beside the <hi rend="italic">Bardd Teuleu,</hi> or household
                    bard just spoken of, a <hi rend="italic">Pencerdd,</hi> chief of song, is
                    mentioned in the laws, who in North Wales was an officer of the household, but
                    in South Wales was not,—his position there being apparently that of a privileged
                    personage entitled to make a circuit and so spend his time where he pleased. The
                    chief of song was also called a chaired bard, because he was one of the fourteen
                    entitled to a chair at court. The installation of a bard to a chair appears to
                    have been attended with some ceremony, for the judge of the king’s court was
                    entitled as a perquisite of his office to the bugle-horn, the gold ring, and the
                    cushion which was under the bard on the occasion. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pencerdd</hi> represented the Irish <hi rend="italic">0Uam]ι Fili,</hi> and
                    like him appears to have kept a school of poetry, for he was entitled to receive
                    24 pence from each minstrel who completed his course of instruction, to their
                    services “as a man placed in authority over them,” and to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gobyr</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Amobyr</hi> of their daughters, that is to the
                    fee payable to the lord on the marriage of a maiden. Among his emoluments was a
                    fee of 24 pence from every maiden on her marriage. In the court his seat was on
                    the side of the judge of the court, and he lodged with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edling,</hi> that is the heir-apparent of the king or prince, corresponding to
                    the Irish <hi rend="italic">Tanaiste.</hi> A villain or serf could not become a
                    bard, nor a smith without the permission of his lord; nor could a bard practise
                    his art after he had taken holy orders. Should a serf or a stranger happen to
                    become a bard he became personally a free <hi rend="italic">Cyrn,ro</hi> or
                    Welshman, but his children were not free, though the time in which his
                    descendants might rise to the privileges of a free <hi rend="italic">Cyrnro</hi>
                    was shortened. A minor bard was forbidden to solicit a gift without the
                    permission of the <hi rend="italic">Pencerdd,</hi> but the latter might ask a
                    gift though all others should be forbidden to do so. The duty of the chief of
                    song was to commence the singing or recitation of poetry by singing two songs on
                    entering the hall, one concerning God and the other about kings; the household
                    bard then repeated the third song below the entrance of the hall. This is nearly
                    all that the laws contain about bards. There is not a word about the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ovydd,</hi> or the Druid-bard, nor about the sky-blue dress of the
                    former, the emblem of peace and truth, nor of the white robe of the Druid, nor
                    of the green robe of the <hi rend="italic">Ovydd,</hi> the colour of nature, nor
                    of the robe of the <hi rend="italic">Aιcenydd</hi> or bardic student striped
                    with the three colours, nor of the <hi rend="italic">Gorsedd</hi> or assembly of
                    bards. If any of these things existed in the 12th century, the most brilliant
                    period of Welsh poetry, we should expect to find them in the Welsh laws. But so
                    far from any relics of the ancient Druidic organization having survived at that
                    period, it is probable that even the organization above given from the laws was
                    in part at least the work of <hi rend="italic">Gruffyd</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi><hi rend="italic">Cynan.</hi> They are, in fact, the inventions of later
                    times when Wales had lost its political liberty. We have the first stage of the
                    invention in the Triads, and it seems to have been completed by that
                    extraordinary man Edward Williams, whom we have already mentioned as one of the
                    editors and the principal contributor of the <hi rend="italic">Myvyrian
                    Archaiology,</hi> who pretended to be the head of the bardic order of South
                    Wales, and accordingly assumed the bardic title of <hi rend="italic">Iolo
                    Morganwg</hi> from his native county of Glamorgan. He is probably the source
                    whence the Rev. Edward Davies derived the chief part of the material for his
                    marvellous system of Neo-Druidic philosophy. According to the supporters of this
                    system, the religion of the Druids, a medley of sunworship and Jewish Noachian
                    traditions, the emblems of which were the bull, the horse, and fire, survived
                    the introduction of Christianity, and continued to be believed by the bards, and
                    its rites practised in secret by them. The principal source whence evidence was
                    derived in support of this assumption was the early poems which we have been
                    discussing. Davies gave what he called translations of some of those poems, in
                    which the simplest and plainest phrases are made to express mysterious and
                    abstruse doctrines. In the religious poems which contain such expressions as
                    “Christ the Son,” “Merciful Trinity,” Mr Davies omits the latter, or treats them
                    as mere phrases introduced to deceive the uninitiated, and make them believe the
                    pagan bards were Christians. Among the doctrines attributed to the Neo-Druids
                    was that of metempsychosis. The chief source from whence evidence was derived in
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n330/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0330-0319"/> support of this assumption outside a pretended
                    work called <hi rend="italic">Barddas,</hi> or treatise on the whole system of
                    the bards, which <hi rend="italic">Iolo Morgαnισg</hi> possessed, was the
                    Romance called <hi rend="italic">Hanes Taliessin,</hi> or history of <hi
                    rend="italic">Taliessin,</hi> which though partly prose, and therefore coming
                    under the head of the prose romances, of which we shall speak later, may be more
                    conveniently referred to here. A fragment of the Welsh text of this history was
                    given in the <hi rend="italic">Myυyrian Archaiology</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    the whole tale was afterwards published by Dr Owen Pughe; and Lady Charlotte
                    Guest published it again in the third volume of her <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mabinogiσn</hi> from two fragments, one dated about 1758, and the other
                    belonging to <hi rend="italic">Iolo Morgαnwg.</hi> The romance of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hanes Taliessin</hi> in its existing form belongs to the beginning
                    of the 17th century. Of the thirteen poems contained in Lady Charlotte Guest’s
                    book, only two are found in the Book of <hi rend="italic">Taliessin,</hi> the
                    Ode to the Wind and the Mead Song. It is evident that a number of poems
                    attributed to <hi rend="italic">Tediessiu</hi> were floating about in popular
                    tradition, and were strung together in the 16th century into a romance. Although
                    of these so taken up only the two just mentioned find a place in the special
                    manuscript of <hi rend="italic">Tαliessin</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> poems
                    in the 14th century, we are not therefore entitled to assume that the other
                    poems did not therefore exist at that period. It is singular that the compiler
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Hanes Taliessin</hi> did not include such poems as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Canu</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Meirch,</hi> or the Song of the Horses, which would find its place after the
                    account of the contest of <hi rend="italic">Elphin</hi> against the 24 horses of
                    <hi rend="italic">Mailcun,</hi> the Ale Song, which is the counterpart of the
                    Mead Song, the Chair of <hi rend="italic">TaUessin,</hi> and the Chair of the
                    Sovereign <hi rend="italic">(Kadsir Teymon).</hi> In all these there is no
                    mythology, nor indeed anything indicative of a secret. But when the Elegy of the
                    Thousand Sons, a religious poem on the saints before and after Christ, which is
                    in the Book of <hi rend="italic">Taliessin,</hi> is believed to contain the
                    doctrine of metempsychosis, any doctrine whatever may be drawn from the Welsh
                    poetry. But while the whole of the Neo-Druidic speculations must be looked upon
                    as fables, it does not follow that there are no mythological allusions in Welsh
                    poems as old as from the 12th to the 14th century. We have already alluded to
                    the occurrence of the name of the goddess <hi rend="italic">Ceridwen</hi> in two
                    poems in the Black Book attributed to <hi rend="italic">Cuhelyn,</hi> a bard of
                    the 9th century. The following poems in the Book of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taliessin</hi> also contain traces of mythology :—Song concerning the Sons of
                    <hi rend="italic">Llyr</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Brochure!,</hi> the Chair of <hi rend="italic">Ceridwen,</hi> the Spoils of <hi
                    rend="italic">Annum, Daronwy,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Angar</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gyfindawd.</hi> But as the mythology of the poems is intimately
                    connected with that of the prose tales we shall reserve our observations on the
                    subject until we are considering the <hi rend="italic">Mabinogion.</hi></p>
                <p>Whether the poems we have been hitherto considering were really first written
                    after the 1Oth century, or, as seems much more probable, were composed at an
                    earlier period and transmitted by popular tradition, their language undergoing
                    the same changes as the spoken language, they must be considered from a merely
                    literary point of view as the products of the period from the 11th to the 13th
                    century inclusive. But apart from those poems there is another and a perfectly
                    legitimate Welsh literature which may be said to have commenced with the
                    restoration of the old royal families of North and South Wales. <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhys</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">Tewdwr,</hi>
                    the reputed legitimate heir to the throne of South Wales, returned from Brittany
                    in 1077 bringing with him no doubt the Armorie legends of the Round Table; and
                    <hi rend="italic">Gruff yd</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynan</hi> came in 1080 from Ireland, where he was born and had been educated,
                    and where he must have become familiar with its poetry and music. Indeed, we
                    know on the authority of Welsh writers that <hi rend="italic">Gruffyd</hi>
                    reorganized the bards and improved the music, and in other ways gave a great and
                    beneficial impulse to Welsh literature. Among the changes which he effected in
                    the organization of the bards may have been the institution of bardic <hi
                    rend="italic">Gorsedds</hi> or meetings, of which the modern <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eisteddfod</hi> is an imitation. In Ireland the poets did not, so far as we
                    know, hold separate meetings of this kind, but they took a prominent part in the
                    great periodic gatherings called <hi rend="italic">Aonechs</hi> or fairs held
                    fora threefold purpose,—for promulgating laws, for public games, and as a
                    market. At these gatherings poems were sung, stories narrated, and prizes
                    awarded.</p>
                <p>One of the earliest poets whose productions we can be certain of is <hi
                    rend="italic">Meilyr,</hi> bard of <hi rend="italic">Trahaearn,</hi> whom <hi
                    rend="italic">Gruffyd</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">Gynan</hi>
                    defeated at the battle of Carno, and afterwards of the conqueror <hi
                    rend="italic">Gruffyd</hi> himself. His best piece is the Death-bed of the Bard,
                    a semi-religious poem, which is distinguished by the structure of the verse,
                    poetic feeling, and religious thought. <hi rend="italic">Meilyr</hi> was the
                    head of a family of bards; his son was <hi rend="italic">Gwalchmai,</hi> one of
                    the best Welsh poets; and the latter had two sons, <hi rend="italic">Einion</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Meilyr,</hi> some of whose poetry has reached us. <hi
                    rend="italic">Gwalchmai</hi> was a true poet, and not a mere professional bard.
                    In his <hi rend="italic">Gorhoffedd Gwalchmai, Gwalchmaís</hi> Delights, there
                    is an appreciation of the charms of nature, the murmuring of brooks, and the
                    songs of birds not unworthy of one of the modern Lake poets. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Arwyrain i 0wain</hi> is an ode of considerable’beauty, and full
                    of vigour in praise of <hi rend="italic">0wain Gwynedd,</hi> king of North
                    Wales, on account of his victory of <hi rend="italic">Tai</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi><hi rend="italic">Moelvre,</hi> part of which has been translated by Gray
                    under the name of “The Triumphs of Owen.” This translation, though not very
                    literal, preserves the terseness and boldness of action of the original. <hi
                    rend="italic">Kynddelw,</hi> who lived in the second half of the 12th century,
                    was a contemporary of <hi rend="italic">Gwalchmai,</hi> and wrote on a great
                    number of subjects including religious ones; indeed, some of his eulogies have a
                    kind of religious prelude. He had command of words and much skill in
                    versification, but he is pleonastic and fond of complicated metres and of ending
                    his lines with the same syllable. There is a certain obscurity about some of his
                    poems which has given him an importance among the disciples of the Neo-Druidic
                    or bardic philosophy. Among the other poets of the second half of the 12th
                    century may be mentioned <hi rend="italic">0wain Kyveilwg</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Howel</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">0wain
                    Gwynnedd.</hi> The first-named was prince of <hi rend="italic">Powys,</hi> and
                    was distinguished also as a soldier. The <hi rend="italic">Hirlas,</hi> or
                    Drinking Horn, is a rather long poem marked alike by originality and poetic
                    merit. The prince represents himself as carousing in his hall after a fight;
                    bidding his cup-bearer fill his great drinking-horn, he orders him to present it
                    in turn to each of the assembled warriors. As the horn passes from hand to hand
                    he eulogizes each in a verse beginning <hi rend="italic">Diwallaw di
                    venestr,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> Fill, cup-bearer.” Having thus praised the
                    deeds of two warriors, <hi rend="italic">Tudyr</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moreiddig,</hi> he turns round to challenge them, but suddenly recollecting
                    that they had fallen in the fray, and listening as it were to their dying
                    groans, he bursts into a broken lamentation for their loss. The second was also
                    a prince; he was the eldest of the many sons of <hi rend="italic">0wain
                    Gιcynnedd,</hi> and ruled for two years after his father until he fell in a
                    battle between himself and his step-brother David. He was a young man of
                    conspicuous merit, and one of the most charming poets of Wales,—his poems being
                    especially free from the conceits, trivial common-places, and complicated metres
                    of the professional bards, while full of gay humour, a love of nature, and a
                    delicate appreciation of woman. Some of his love songs especially are charming.
                    There are two other poets, who, though they lived into the 13th century,
                    belonged perhaps more to the 12th, namely, <hi rend="italic">Llywarch</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">Llewelyn</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gwynvardd Brycheiniοg.</hi> Mr Stephens attributes the Songs of the Pigs to the
                    former, and believes that the poet covertly alludes to the events which occurred
                    in the reign of <hi rend="italic">Llewelyn</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ioτweτth,</hi> grandson of <hi rend="italic">0wain Gwynedd;</hi>

                    The poems which are distinctly referred to him are marked by much power of
                    delineation and poetic feeling, of which his address to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Llewelyn</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">Ioru&lt;erth</hi>
                    affords a good instance. The Welsh poets, as we have said, went circuit like
                    their Irish brethren, staying in each place according as hospitality was
                    extended to them. When departing, a bard was expected to leave a sample of his
                    versification behind him. In this way many manuscripts came to be written, as we
                    find them, in different hands. The Irish manuscript known as the Book of Fermoy
                    is just such a book kept in the house of David Roche of Fermoy in the 15th
                    century. <hi rend="italic">Llywarch</hi> has left us one of those departing
                    eulogies addressed to <hi rend="italic">Rhys Gryg,</hi> prince of South Wales,
                    which affords a favourable specimen of his style. <hi rend="italic">Gwynvardd
                    Brycheiniog's</hi> poem on St David, in which he enumerates all the churches
                    dedicated to the saint, is a typical example of a kind of topographical poem
                    abounding in Irish. There is an early anonymous example of this kind of poem in
                    the Black Book, the <hi rend="italic">Eιglynniοnn</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi><hi rend="italic">Bedeu,</hi> The Verses of the Graves, which is the
                    exact counterpart of the Irish Lay of the <hi rend="italic">Leachts,</hi> and
                    some other poems of the same kind.</p>
                <p>The following are a few of the poets of the 13 th century whose poems are still
                    extant. <hi rend="italic">Davydd Benvras</hi> was the author of a poem in praise
                    of <hi rend="italic">Llewelyn</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Iοrwerth</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> his works, though not so verbose or trite
                    as bardic poems of this class usually are, do not rise much above the bardic
                    level, and are full of alliteration. <hi rend="italic">Elidyr</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sais</hi> was, as his name implies, of Saxon origin, and wrote
                    chiefly religious poetry. <hi rend="italic">Einiawn db Gwgaιvn</hi> is the
                    author of an extant address to <hi rend="italic">Llewelyn</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi><hi rend="italic">Iοrwerlh</hi> of considerable merit. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phylip Brydydd</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or Philip the poet, was
                    household bard to <hi rend="italic">Rhys Gryg (Rhys</hi> the hoarse), lord of
                    South Wales; one of his pieces, An Apology to <hi rend="italic">Rhys Gryg,</hi>
                    is a striking example of the fulsome epithets a household bard was expected to
                    bestow upon his patron, and of the privileged domesticity in which the bards
                    lived, which as in Ireland must have been fatal to genius. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prydydd Bychan,</hi> the Little Poet, was a South Wales bard, whose extant
                    works consist of short poems all addressed to his own princes. The chief feature
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Eηglynniοηn</hi> is the use of a kind of assonance in
                    which in some cases the final vowels agreed alternately in each quatrain, and in
                    others each line ended in a different vowel,—in both cases with alliteration and
                    consonance of final consonants, or full rhyme. <hi rend="italic">Llygad Gwr</hi>
                    is known by an ode in five parts to <hi rend="italic">Llewelyn</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">Gruffyd</hi> written about the year 1270,
                    which is a good type of the conventional flattery of a family bard, <hi
                    rend="italic">Howel Voel,</hi> who was of Irish extraction, possessed some
                    poetical merit; his remonstrance to <hi rend="italic">Llewelyn</hi> against the
                    imprisonment of his brother <hi rend="italic">0wain</hi> is a pleasing variety
                    upon the conventional eulogy. It has many lines commencing with the same word,
                    <hi rend="italic">eg., gwr,</hi> man. The poems of <hi rend="italic">Bleddyn
                    Vardd,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Bleddyn</hi> the Bard, which have come down to
                    us are all short eulogies and elegies. One of the latter on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Llewelyn</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">Gruffyd</hi> is a good
                    example of the elaborate and artificial nature of the Welsh versification. There
                    are seven quatrains, the first, second, and fourth of which all end in <hi
                    rend="italic">-af.</hi> With the exception of the first and last stanza the
                    first three lines of each stanza begin with <hi rend="italic">gwr,</hi> man, or
                    a compound of it, “manly.” The second, third, and fourth lines of the first
                    stanza also begin in the same way; the fourth line is a kind of refrain, which
                    in the first two stanzas begins like the other lines with <hi rend="italic"
                    >gwr</hi> or a compound of it; in the third and last it begins with <hi
                    rend="italic">yn,</hi> and in the fourth, fifth, and sixth with <hi
                    rend="italic">hyd.</hi> The best of all the poets of the century was <hi
                    rend="italic">Gruffyd</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">yr Ynad
                    Coch,</hi> whose elegy, notwithstanding its alliteration and conventional use of
                    the same initial word, or of words having the same fore-sound, has the ring of
                    true poetry. His religious poems, too, possess considerable merit. But of all
                    the religious poems in early Welsh we have seen, that which best deserves the
                    name is one written by <hi rend="italic">Madawc</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gwallter.</hi></p>
                <p>The death of <hi rend="italic">Llewelyn</hi> and the subjugation of all Wales,
                    and especially the social and other internal changes which took place in the
                    Principality, necessarily checked literary efforts. A general revival took
                    place, however, in the time of <hi rend="italic">0wain Glyndwr</hi> and the Wars
                    of the Roses, with which the Welsh had much to do. In the meantime a
                    considerable improvement had taken place in the aesthetic feeling of the people.
                    The bardic system, which had helped to raise the Celtic people in their tribal
                    stage above other barbarous peoples, but which at a later period had fettered
                    their intellectual and political development, was, at least so far as regards
                    exclusive privileges, at an end; inter-tribal wars had ceased, aud great
                    improvements in the houses, churches, dress, and food of the people had taken
                    place. Love supplanted war as the theme of song, and much attention w as paid to
                    language and versification. Nature, too, was made a theme of poetry by several
                    poets. We have already had occasion to notice some examples of this love of
                    nature; but at the period we are now considering, one cannot help being struck
                    with the power of observation of natural phenomena, and the keen sense of
                    objective natural beauty, which many Welsh poets exhibit; nor is there wanting
                    the higher poetic feeling of subjective beauty. These high qualities are, it is
                    true, often marred by artificial systems of versification. Among the poets who
                    flourished in the 14th century, the following may be mentioned. <hi
                    rend="italic">Gu'ilym Ddu</hi> is the author of two odes to the unfortunate Sir
                    <hi rend="italic">Gruffyd Llwyd,</hi> one of which, the Odes of the Months,
                    written in 1322, was composed while the subject of it was in prison. Forty-three
                    out of sixty-three begin with the word <hi rend="italic">neud</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> it is moreover strongly alliterated, and many of the lines
                    end <hi rend="italic">iη-ed.</hi> He is also the author of an elegy on the poet
                    <hi rend="italic">Trahaeam,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Gτoηwy,</hi> a
                    contemporary poet. This poem, which is a panegyric on Welsh poets past and
                    present, is skilfully constructed. A considerable number of writers of love <hi
                    rend="italic">Englynnionns</hi> flourished at this time, among whom may be
                    specially mentioned <hi rend="italic">Iorwerth Vychan, Casnodyn,</hi> who is
                    believed to be the same as the foregoing <hi rend="italic">Trahaeam,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Gronwy</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Davydd,</hi> who was probably the father of the latter. But the representative
                    poets of this period are <hi rend="italic">Rhys Goch</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi><hi rend="italic">Rhícert</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Davydd</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">Gwilym.</hi> The verses of the former to
                    a Maiden’s Hair, though strongly alliterated aud rhymed, are smooth and less
                    intricate and conventional than most poems of the period, and possess a good
                    deal of the character of the love romants of the time, in Southern Europe, with
                    which he undoubtedly was acquainted. Both <hi rend="italic">Rhys Goch</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Davydd</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Gwilym,</hi> the Cambrian Petrarch, as he has been called, were great lovers of
                    nature, and no modern poets sing more sweetly of the woodland, wildflowers, the
                    voice of birds, and other charms of the country. It is amidst such scenes they
                    place their lovers, who are real swains and maids, and not the mock ones of the
                    pastoral poetry of the 18th century. Two hundred and sixty two poems, chiefly
                    pastoral of <hi rend="italic">Davydd</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gwilym</hi> are said to exist, some of which, as for instance his
                    exquisite Ode to Summer, would be worthy of any literature.</p>
                <p>The most distinguished poet of the 15th century was <hi rend="italic">Lewis Glynn
                    Cothi,</hi> more than one hundred and fifty of whose poems are known. The period
                    o,f the civil wars in the 17th century had its poets, the best known of whom,
                    <hi rend="italic">Huw Morus,</hi> was on the Royalist side. Since then a new
                    literature has grown up which, however, lies outside the scope of this
                    article.</p>
                <p>We have already alluded to the probability of the tales in verse, whether
                    historical or romantic, being earlier than those in prose. Most of the heroes of
                    the earlier poems, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n332/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0332-0321"/> whatever may be their real age, are also the
                    subjects of prose tales. In the poems, as a rule, if there be any definite
                    picture of the actors, they appear as men, and there is very little necromancy
                    surrounding them; the prose tales, on the other hand, are full of marvels and
                    magical transformations. In the older prose tales there is a certain unity in
                    the personages and events; gradually two or more streams of romance mingle, as
                    in MacPherson’s Ossian. The Welsh prose tales all belong to South Wales; the
                    poems, on the other hand, belong to a large extent to North Wales. The prose
                    tales which still exist are few in number, and are evidently only a small part
                    of those which were once current. The reason of the small number of prose tales
                    preserved, as compared with the very large number of poems, is doubtless to be
                    explained by the fact that the poets were a privileged class, who formed part of
                    the households of the lords; while the prose tales were chiefly told by the
                    strolling minstrels, against whom, and not against the bards properly so called,
                    so many severe enactments were made. The privileged bards despised the tales of
                    the story-teller, and hence, unfortunately for the history of romance and of
                    comparative mythology, so few have been preserved.</p>
                <p>In the Red Book there are eleven prose tales, which have been published by Lady
                    Charlotte Guest, together with the <hi rend="italic">Hanes Taliessin,</hi> of
                    which we have spoken above, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Mabinogion,</hi>
                    though that name is applied in the Red Book to four only. We may classify them
                    thus according to their origin. I. Roman-British—(1) The Contention of <hi
                    rend="italic">Llu&lt;Ll</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Llevdys; (T)</hi> The Dream
                    of <hi rend="italic">Maxen Wledic.</hi> II. Irish Romances—(3) The Tale of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pwyll,</hi> Prince of <hi rend="italic">Dιjved</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> (4) <hi rend="italic">Branwen,</hi> daughter of <hi

                    (6) <hi rend="italic">Math,,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Mathonwy.</hi> HI.
                    Arthurian Romances—(7) The Lady of the Fountain; (8) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peredur,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Eυrawc</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> (9)
                    <hi rend="italic">Geraint,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Erbiii.</hi> IV. Mixed
                    Romances—(10) The Story of <hi rend="italic">Kilhwclι</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Olwen</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> (11) The Dream of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhonabwy.</hi> To the category of mixed romances may also be added, as a third
                    kind, the story of the St Graal contained in a Hengwrt manuscript.</p>
                <p>The first story relates to <hi rend="italic">Lludd,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bell</hi> the great, son of <hi rend="italic">Manogan,</hi> who became king
                    after his father’s death, while his brother <hi rend="italic">Llevdys</hi>
                    becomes king of France, and shows his brother how to get rid of the three
                    plagues which devastated Britain :—first a strange race, the Coranians, whose
                    knowledge was so great that they heard everything, no matter how low soever it
                    might be spoken; second, a shriek which came into every house on May eve, caused
                    by the fighting of two dragons; and third, a great giant, who carried off all
                    the provisions in the king’s palace every day. The second relates how <hi
                    rend="italic">Maxen</hi> or Maximus, emperor of Rome, has a dream while hunting,
                    in which he imagines that he visits Britain, and sees a beautiful damsel, Helen,
                    whom he ultimately succeeds in finding and marrying. The personages of this tale
                    are mentioned in the earliest form of the <hi rend="italic">Brut Gruffyd</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">Arthur,</hi> but the account is
                    different. Both tales seem to be British, and to be traceable to Roman
                    times.</p>
                <p>We have called the second group Irish romances, not only because the action in
                    some of them is placed occasionally in Ireland, and some of the actors are
                    distinctly stated to have been Irishmen, but because they are unmistakably
                    relics of the period of the occupation of the coast of Wales by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gwyddel</hi> or Irish. The group of four romances form a cycle of
                    legends, and are the only ones called <hi rend="italic">Mabinogìon</hi> in the
                    manuscript from which they have been taken. In the first tale the principal
                    characters are <hi rend="italic">Pwyll,</hi> prince of <hi rend="italic">Dy
                    fed,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arawn,</hi> king of <hi rend="italic">Annwn</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Annwyvn;</hi> in the second <hi rend="italic">Bran</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Manawyddan</hi> the sons, and <hi rend="italic">Branwen</hi>
                    the daughter, of <hi rend="italic">Llyr,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Matholwch,</hi> king of Ireland; in the third <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manawuddan,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Llyr,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pryderi,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Pwyll</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    in the fourth, <hi rend="italic">Math,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mathonwy,</hi> king of <hi rend="italic">Arvon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mona,
                    Gwydyon ap Don</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arianrod</hi> his sister, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Llero Llaw Gyffes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dylan</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">eil</hi><hi rend="italic">Ton,</hi> the sons of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arianrod.</hi> These personages are mentioned in several of the poems
                    attributed to <hi rend="italic">Taliessin,</hi> in whose reputed works curiously
                    enough the relics of the ancient mythology are chiefly found. Among these poems
                    we may mention the following, some of which are in the Book of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taliessin,</hi> while others are not:— <hi rend="italic">Kadeir
                    Kerrituen,oτt</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">iQ</hi> Chair of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ceridwen,</hi> the Spoils of <hi rend="italic">Annwn;</hi> the <hi

                    Murwnat</hi><hi rend="italic">eil</hi><hi rend="italic">Ton,</hi> the Death Song
                    of <hi rend="italic">Dylan,</hi> son of the wave; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Daronwy;</hi><hi rend="italic">Angar</hi><hi rend="italic">Cyflndawd;</hi> the
                    story of <hi rend="italic">Llyr</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Brochu</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">el Powys</hi><hi rend="italic">;—</hi> in other
                    words, all the so-called mythological poems. In these tales and poems we have
                    undoubtedly the relics of the ancient Irish mythology of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tuatha Dé Danann,</hi> sometimes mixed with later Arthurian myths. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Goer Sidi</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">Sid</hi> of Irish
                    mythology, the residence of the gods of the <hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">es</hi><hi rend="italic">Side.</hi> The seven other <hi
                    rend="italic">Caers</hi> or resid ences mentioned in the poem on the Spoils of
                    <hi rend="italic">Annum</hi> are the various <hi rend="italic">Side</hi> of the
                    immortals. <hi rend="italic">Llyr</hi> is the Irish seι-god <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lêr,</hi> and was called <hi rend="italic">Llyr Llediaith,</hi> or the
                    half-tongued, implying that he spoke a language only partially intelligible to
                    the people of the country. <hi rend="italic">Bran,</hi> the son of <hi
                    rend="italic">Llyr,</hi> is the Irish <hi rend="italic">Bran Mac</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Allait, Allât</hi> beingone of the names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lêr.</hi> This <hi rend="italic">Bran</hi> is probably the same as <hi
                    rend="italic">Brian,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Tuirenn,</hi> though
                    according to the Irish genealogies, <hi rend="italic">Brian</hi> would be the
                    nephew of <hi rend="italic">Lêr. Manawyddan ap Llyr</hi> is clearly the <hi
                    rend="italic">Manandan</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Manannan Mac Lir</hi> of Irish
                    mythology. In one derivation of his name, if correct, we have a most important
                    link in these romances. According to this etymology, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manannan</hi> comes from <hi rend="italic">Man,</hi> lord, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Annan,</hi> of the foamy sea, <hi rend="italic">Lêr,</hi> his
                    father’s name, meaning also the sea. In <hi rend="italic">Annan</hi> we would
                    have the <hi rend="italic">Annum</hi> of the poems, and of the story of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pwyll,</hi> and commonly identified with hell, but really
                    corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">Tir Taimgire</hi> or Elysium of the
                    Irish. <hi rend="italic">R1ιi- annon,</hi> the wife of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pwyll,</hi> who possessed marvellous birds which held warriors spell-bound for
                    eighty years by their singing, comes from <hi rend="italic">Annwn,</hi> and her
                    son <hi rend="italic">Pryderi</hi> gives her, on the death of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pwyll,</hi> as a wife to <hi rend="italic">Manawyddan.</hi> With <hi
                    rend="italic">Annum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Annwvyn</hi> we naturally connect
                    the Irish <hi rend="italic">Ana,</hi> the mother of the gods, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Mór Bigu,</hi> and wife of the <hi rend="italic">Dagda.</hi> She
                    was the mother of <hi rend="italic">Aed,</hi> the Welsh <hi rend="italic">Aed
                    Mawr,</hi> and was probably the same as <hi rend="italic">Ceridwen.</hi> In a
                    previous part of this article we have made the <hi rend="italic">Dagda</hi> the
                    same as <hi rend="italic">Delbaith Dana</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tuirenn,</hi>
                    the father of <hi rend="italic">Lêr</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> if we are right
                    in our conjecture, <hi rend="italic">Ana</hi> would be the mother of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ler,</hi> the sea, as well as of <hi rend="italic">Aed,</hi> fire.
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhiannon,</hi> daughter of <hi rend="italic">Heveydd Hen,</hi>
                    and wife of <hi rend="italic">Pwyll,</hi> and afterwards of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manaιvyddan,</hi> is perhaps also to be connected with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Annwn.</hi> Again, the <hi rend="italic">Gaer
                    Sidi</hi> above mentioned, where neither disease nor old age affects any one, is
                    called the prison of <hi rend="italic">G</hi><hi rend="italic">weir</hi> in one
                    of the poems. This <hi rend="italic">Gweir,</hi> we have no doubt, represents
                    <hi rend="italic">Gaiar,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Manandan Mac Lir,</hi>
                    the Atropos who cut the thread of life of Irish mythology. In one legend <hi
                    rend="italic">Gaiar</hi> is made the son of <hi rend="italic">Uisle</hi> and of
                    <hi rend="italic">Deirdriu,</hi> celebrated iu the story of the sons of <hi
                    rend="italic">ljisnech,</hi> and the foster son of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manandan,</hi> who aids him in banishing <hi rend="italic">Gonehobar
                    Mac</hi><hi rend="italic">Nessa</hi> to Alba on account of his killing the sons
                    of <hi rend="italic">īīisnech,</hi> and becoming king of Ulster in his place.
                    Afterwards, <hi rend="italic">Gaiar</hi> relinquishes the kingship by the advice
                    of <hi rend="italic">Manandan,</hi> who takes him to <hi rend="italic">Ernhaim
                    Abhlach,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ernain</hi> of the Apple-trees, where he
                    dies. <hi rend="italic">Gaiaι∙</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> sister <hi

                    part in the contests between the swineherds of <hi rend="italic">Ochull

                    chiefs of <hi rend="italic">Side.</hi> These examples show that <hi
                    rend="italic">Don,</hi> the fath er of <hi rend="italic">Gwydyon,</hi> may be
                    connected with the <hi rend="italic">Acs Side. Manandan Mac Lir</hi> had a son
                    who was <hi rend="italic">Ech-Dσn M6r,</hi> or the great <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ech-Don,</hi> who is probably the <hi rend="italic">Donn</hi> mentioned in the
                    Fennian <hi rend="italic">Agallarnh na Senorach,</hi> or Dialogue of the Sages,
                    as having been slain by a certain <hi rend="italic">Derg Dianscothash</hi> in a
                    war between <hi rend="italic">Ilbhreash</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Sid</hi>
                    of <hi rend="italic">Eas Ruadh</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ler</hi> of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sid Finnachaidh.</hi> It may be remarked here that whenever the
                    <hi rend="italic">Aes Side</hi> are brought into the Feunian romances there is
                    generally some confusion. Thus in the romance just mentioned <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lér</hi> is represented as at war with <hi rend="italic">Ilbhreash,</hi> who in
                    the genealogies is made the son of <hi rend="italic">Manandan.</hi> Before
                    leaving those curious tales, it will be better to discuss one of the mixed
                    romances, The Story of <hi rend="italic">Kilhweh</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Olwen.</hi> By mixed romance we mean one in which two distinct streams of
                    legends have mingled. The one just mentioned belonged originally to the same
                    class of legends as the four <hi rend="italic">Mabinogion</hi> we have been
                    discussing, but it got mixed up with the Arthurian romance <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kilhwch</hi> asks for wife <hi rend="italic">Olwen,</hi> the daughter of <hi
                    rend="italic">Yspaddaden Penkawr,</hi> who imposes upon him a number of tasks
                    before he would give him his daughter, the final one being to fetch the comb and
                    scissors which were between the ears of the <hi rend="italic">Twrch Trwyth.</hi>
                    All these he effects through the aid of his cousin Arthur. Among the personages
                    mentioned are— <hi rend="italic">Amaethon,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Don,</hi> who is represented as a great husbandman, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Govannon,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Don,</hi> a smith. Among the actors are
                    <hi rend="italic">Gwyther,</hi> the son of <hi rend="italic">Greidawl,</hi> who
                    is betrothed to <hi rend="italic">Creiddylad,</hi> daughter of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lludd Llaw Ereint,</hi> that is Cordelia, daughter of Lear. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gwen Ap Nudd,</hi> however, carries off <hi rend="italic">Creiddylad,</hi> but
                    Arthur makes peace between them, the condition being that the maiden should be
                    restored to her father’s house, and <hi rend="italic">Gwen</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gwyther</hi> should fight for the yellow-haired maiden on the
                    first of May each year. This very curious tale is altogether based on Irish
                    mythology. <hi rend="italic">Govannon</hi> is <hi rend="italic">Goibniu,</hi>
                    the Irish Vulcan, the brother of <hi rend="italic">Diancscht</hi> or <hi

                    Britain.</p>
                <p>By an Arthurian romance we mean a tale in which Arthur is a chief hero, and the
                    scene of which is laid in Wales or South England. The legends of Arthur in this
                    sense belong chiefly to South Wales, and must have origf nated there in great
                    part, though they were afterwards mucìj modified by new elements introduced from
                    Armorica oy <hi rend="italic">Rhys</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tewdwr</hi> and his followers at the end of the 11 th century. At
                    this period South Wales was more civilized than North Wales, because less
                    mountainous and more fertile, and also because it had considerable intercourse
                    with France. These very circumstances led to its conquest by the Normans earlier
                    than North Wales, which maintained its independence nearly a century longer.
                    Before the advent of the Normans in South Wales, stone-built castles and
                    churches existed, but they erected much stronger and more splendid castles, and
                    the clergy whom they introduced built fine churches and great abbeys. The Norman
                    castles and walled towns and trained men at arms, always ready for war, must
                    have afforded more protection to commerce and agriculture than it could enjoy
                    under the Welsh tribal system. The wants of the new nobility, too, were greater,
                    their courts were more splendid, their dresses and arms more costly than those
                    of Welsh princes; and corresponding splendour was introduced into the ceremonies
                    of the church. The Norman baron was not prouder, but he was graver and more
                    courtly than the Welsh lord. All these things acted on the popular stories and
                    gradually transformed them, as manners improved, into elegant romances of
                    chivalry. The abundant materials of romance which existed in Wales were the
                    property, so to say, of the strolling minstrels and peasantry, and were despised
                    by the lettered bard with whose poems the popular tales competed. Carried into
                    Armorica, they became, as it were, ennobled, and assumed a more polished and
                    courtly form; and when brought back by <hi rend="italic">Rhys</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">Tewdwr,</hi> almost entirely displaced
                    the conventional poems of the bards, which were chiefly eulogies of the Jiving,
                    and elegies of their dead patrons. This is the reason why South Wales produced
                    so few poems from the 12th to the 15th century. These romances were soon
                    translated, or rather new ones constructed upon the same themes, by the Norman
                    Jongleurs, who soon spread them among the Norman nobility everywhere. The heroes
                    of <hi rend="italic">y G</hi><hi rend="italic">ogled</hi> were well adapted to
                    serve as actors in the courtly romances. They appear in the poems which we have
                    discussed above as so many lay figures upon which to put the rich dresses and
                    armour of the Normans, and who might be put into a fine castle anywhere without
                    incongruity. The necromancy seems to have been largely borrowed from the Irish
                    legends, a great many of which, of the same character as the Mabinogion, must
                    have still existed in the 12th and 13th centuries.</p>
                <p>The position assigned to Arthur in romance is due to accident. No one of the name
                    occupied so prominent a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n334/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0334-0323"/> position in the north as to give him of right the
                    place occupied by Arthur in those productions. Some tale or ballad, in which a
                    hero called <hi rend="italic">Artur</hi> was the chief actor, might have had
                    perchance the necessary elements for popular success; and around this as a
                    nucleus gathered the legends of other <hi rend="italic">Arturs.</hi> One of the
                    sons of <hi rend="italic">Aedan Mac Gabran,</hi> killed at the battle of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cattraeth,</hi> was named <hi rend="italic">Artur;</hi> and there
                    were doubtless many others of the name, both Scots and Britons. The name <hi
                    rend="italic">Art</hi> has a place in Irish romance also. Thus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Art,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> the loue man,” son of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conn</hi> of the Hundred Battles, was beloved on account of his great fame by
                    <hi rend="italic">Becuma</hi> of the fair skin, wife of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Labrad</hi> of the quick-hand-at-sword, and probably the same as <hi
                    rend="italic">Etain,</hi> a goddess already so often mentioned, and who had been
                    unfaithful with <hi rend="italic">Gaiar,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Manandan
                    Mae Lir. Becuma,</hi> driven out of <hi rend="italic">Tir Taimgire</hi> or
                    Elysium on account of her offence, is sent adrift in a boat, and lands on the
                    Hill of Howth in Ireland, where, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Delbh
                    Caemh,</hi> daughter of <hi rend="italic">Morgan,</hi> she presents herself to
                    <hi rend="italic">Conn</hi> and marries him. She next insists on the banishment
                    of <hi rend="italic">Art</hi> from Tara. Evil, however, comes on the country on
                    account of <hi rend="italic">Conn’s</hi> marriage, and the Druids announce that
                    it could only be averted by sprinkling the blood of the son of an undefiled
                    couple on the door posts. <hi rend="italic">Conn</hi> sails away in search of
                    such a youth, finds him in <hi rend="italic">Tir Tairngire,</hi> Elysium, and
                    brings him to Ireland. Then we have a scene of exactly the same character as
                    that told of <hi rend="italic">Gorti-gem,</hi> but the boy is ultimately saved
                    from immolation by the appearance of his mother, who tells them they must banish
                    <hi rend="italic">Becumα.</hi> The latter then plays a game of chess with <hi
                    rend="italic">Art</hi> the son of <hi rend="italic">Conn,</hi> and he wins, and
                    imposes upon her the obligation of getting the champion’s wand which was in the
                    hand of <hi rend="italic">CuroiMacDaire</hi> when making the conquest of <hi
                    rend="italic">Eriu,</hi> and of the whole world. She visits the <hi
                    rend="italic">Side,</hi> and at length finds it, and brings it to <hi

                    >Beσuma</hi> wins, and sends him in search of <hi rend="italic">Delbh
                    Caemh,</hi> daughter of <hi rend="italic">Morgan, i.e.,</hi> herself, whom he
                    would find in an island in the middle of the sea. He sails away, and arrives at
                    a beautiful island full of apple-trees, flowers, birds, and spotted horses; in
                    which too there were joyous ever-blooming women, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crede,</hi> the ever beautiful. Again <hi rend="italic">Art</hi> was named <hi
                    rend="italic">Oenfhir,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> the lone man,” because his
                    brother <hi rend="italic">Condla,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> the beautiful,”
                    being invited by a <hi rend="italic">Ben Side</hi> to rule over <hi
                    rend="italic">Magh Mell,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> il</hi> the plain of
                    honey in the Laud of Promise,” went thither and left him without a brother. <hi
                    rend="italic">Art</hi> is also credited with having anticipated Christian
                    belief; and consequently it is supposed that neither he nor his son <hi
                    rend="italic">Cormac</hi> was buried in the pagan cemetery on the River
                    Boyne.</p>
                <p>It should be remembered that this <hi rend="italic">Art</hi> lived either at the
                    beginning of the Scotic invasions of Roman Britain, or immediately before that
                    period, for his son <hi rend="italic">Cormac,</hi> according to Irish legends,
                    was expelled from Ireland, and, going over the sea, obtained the sovereignty of
                    Alba, and his fame must have been carried into Wales, where he must have been
                    the subject of many legends. These legends were the nucleus around which
                    gathered all the floating traditions which came down from the north into North
                    Wales, and thence into South Wales. Some obscure Arthur of the north, perchance
                    <hi rend="italic">Aedan</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> son, was clothed in the
                    legendary glory of <hi rend="italic">Art,</hi> and was made a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guledig</hi> or generalissimo, and paramount king of Britain. From South Wales
                    these legends passed into Cornwall and Armorica, where it is probable the Round
                    Table was invented or borrowed in the same way that at a later period the legend
                    of the St Graal, which there is reason to believe originally came from Provençe,
                    was carried by the Jongleurs into Brittany, and thence into Wales. If the
                    preceding view be correct, the Arthurian legends attained considerable
                    development in Wales before the Round Table was developed, and were’carried by
                    itinerant story-tellers and musicians among the Normans before Geoffrey of
                    Monmouth wrote his history. That book gave a value to the popular tales which
                    they otherwise could never havo attained, and afforded a key by which to correct
                    them. To the Norman clerics the romances owe their polish, and to a large extent
                    their chivalry. But the germs of mediaeval chivalry, and even of knight-errantry
                    were already in the original legends, associated, no doubt, with much
                    barbarism.</p>
                <p>Besides the <hi rend="italic">Bruts,</hi> poems, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mabinogion,</hi> genealogies, and some miscellanous pieces including a few
                    legendary lives of saints and the grammatical works alluded to in a preceding
                    part, the only other early works in the Welsh language which have been printed,
                    are two medicine books, and a music book. The two medicine books belonged to a
                    family of leeches of <hi rend="italic">Mydvai</hi> in Carmarthen, descended from
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhiwallon,</hi> family leech to <hi rend="italic">Rhys
                    Gryg</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Rhys</hi> the Hoarse, prince of South Wales, in
                    the 13th century. The oldest of the two books is in the Red Book, and may
                    possibly have been copied from the Book of <hi rend="italic">Rhiualloìi</hi>
                    himself, or of his sons; the second is the Book of <hi rend="italic">IIowd
                    Veddyg,</hi> or Howel the Leech, a descendant of <hi rend="italic">Einion,</hi>
                    son of <hi rend="italic">Rhiwallon,</hi> and was written probably towards the
                    end of the 17 th century. Both books are mere dispensatories, and contain very
                    little which would enable us to judge of the theoretical knowledge of disease
                    possessed by the Welsh leeches, and cannot represent the real state of
                    leechcraft in Wales in the 16th and 17th centuries. In Wales the practice of
                    leechcraft was, as in Ireland, hereditary in certain families, who held land by
                    the tenure of medical service. The rank and privileges of the family leech to
                    the king are given in the Welsh laws; and in Wales he was obliged, as in
                    Ireland, to take a guarantee from the kindred of his patient equal to the sum
                    which should be paid for the homicide of a man of his rank, in case he might
                    happen to die from his treatment, otherwise he should answer for his death. The
                    music book, published in the <hi rend="italic">Myvyriαn Archaiology,</hi> which
                    is believed to contain some of the ancient music of Wales, and a peculiar system
                    of musical notation, contains merely the music of the lute or some stringed
                    instrument, perhaps the Welsh <hi rend="italic">Crwth</hi> or Crowd, with the
                    notation in common use for such instruments in every part of Europe, and there
                    is no evidence that it contains any of the ancient music of Wales.</p>
                <p>The literature of the Cornish dialect of the British, which was once the spoken
                    language of the centre and south of England, is very limited indeed. There is
                    first the <hi rend="italic">Pascon Agan Arluth,</hi> The Passion of our Lord,
                    consisting of 259 stanzas, each of which is a quatrain of four double lines, in
                    rhyme, or eight single heptasyllabic lines with alternate rhymes, the final
                    vowel and consonant in the rhymes being almost always the same ^n each stanza.
                    This important monument of the Cornish language has been printed with a
                    translation by Mr Whitley Stokes. Secondly, there is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ordinalia,</hi> a MS. of which is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. It forms a
                    dramatic trilogy, consisting of three miracle plays—the Beginning of the World,
                    the Passion, and the Resurrection of our Lord. The latter piece is divided into
                    the Resurrection and the Ascension, with a curious interlude of the putting of
                    Pilate to death. These dramas are founded on the Gospels, the Acts of the
                    Apostles, the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus or Acts of Pilate, and several
                    legends which were current all over Europe in the Middle Ages. They are probably
                    translations or adaptations of French mlracle plays of the end of the 14th
                    century. The metre is syllabic, with few exceptions, each line having seven
                    syllables, like the lines of the poem of the Passion. A great many of those
                    lines are arranged in stajιzas of eight or of four lines, with alternate rhymes,
                    as in the poem just <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n335/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0335-0324"/> mentioned; others in stanzas of six, in which the
                    third rhymes with the sixth, and the others together or in pairs. Occasionally
                    there are eight-lined stanzas, in which the first, second, and third lines, and
                    the fifth, sixth, and seventh lines form triplets rhyming together or
                    separately, and the fourth and eighth lines rhyming together. In lyric and
                    declamatory passages, the lines are occasionally only tetrasyllable. There are
                    many other varieties of metre, but those here described make up more than
                    three-fourths of the whole. The late Mr Edwin Norris published the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ordinalia</hi> with a translation under the title of the “Ancient
                    Cornish Drama.” The third relic of the Cornish language is a miracle play
                    founded upon the life of St <hi rend="italic">Meriasek,</hi> son of a duke of
                    Brittany, and called in Breton <hi rend="italic">St Meriadec.</hi> This piece,
                    which was written in 1504, was found a few years ago by Mr Whitley Stokes among
                    the Hengwrt manuscripts at Peniarth. The language is newer than that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ordinalia,</hi> the admixture of English being also greater; the
                    metre employed is, however, much the same. The fourth work is also a miracle
                    play, The Creation of the World, with Noah’s Flood, written in 1611 by one
                    William Jordan. It is written in a more corrupt language than those above
                    mentioned, is full of English words, and imitates, in some instances almost
                    copying, passages in the <hi rend="italic">Ordinalia.</hi> The remaining
                    literature consists of two versions of the Lord’s Prayer, the Commandments, and
                    the Creed, and two indifferent versions of the first chapter of Genesis, a few
                    songs, a short tale, and a few proverbs, and lastly a Cornish Glossary,
                    explanatory of Latin words. The oldest copies of the poem on the Passion is a
                    vellum manuscript in the British Museum of the 15th century; the age of the
                    principal manuscript of the dramatic trilogy is about the same. The Glossary is
                    the most ancient monument of the Cornish language, for the manuscript which
                    contains it belongs probably to the end of the 12 th or beginning of the 13th
                    century; and it was copied into this from a more ancient MS. The miracle plays,
                    as we learn form Carew’s <hi rend="italic">Survey of Cornwall,</hi> printed in
                    1602, were played down to the beginning of the 17th century, in earthen
                    amphitheatres in the open fields as in France and Germany, which in the 18th
                    century, when Borlase wrote, were popularly known as “Rounds.”</p>
                <p>Armorie like Welsh is a living language, but no monument of the old form of the
                    language exists and the relics of Middle-Breton literature consist of two
                    miracle plays, a prayer-book or “Hours,” a dictionary, and the chartularies of
                    two monasteries. Of this small list only one of the plays and the dictionary are
                    known to exist in early manuscript originals or copies. The play, which is
                    founded on the life of St Nonna or Nonita, is in a paper manuscript, which has
                    been purchased by the National Library at Paris, and is believed by Zeuss to
                    belong to the 14 th century. This piece which, with the chartularies of Rhedon
                    and Landevin, was the principal source whence Zeuss drew the materials for the
                    Armorie part of the <hi rend="italic">Grammatica Celtica,</hi> was published
                    together with a translation in 1837, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Bahez
                    Santez Nonn.</hi> The second play, the <hi rend="italic">Burzud braz Jezuz,</hi>
                    the Great Mystery or Miracle of Jesus, is also referred to the 14th century, but
                    no manuscript of it is known to exist. Μ. Hersart de la Villemarqué has
                    reprinted it from copies, probably unique, of two editions printed in Paris in
                    the years 1530 and 1622. It consists of two parts—the Passion and the
                    Resurrection, and is treated somewhat differently from the corresponding parts
                    of the Cornish trilogy. It possesses some literary merit, which the elegant
                    translation of the editor does ample justice to. Only two copies of the “Hours,”
                    printed apparently in 1524, are known. From these Mr Whitley Stokes has recently
                    reprinted it, adding extracts from a missal printed in 1526, and a catechism
                    printed in 1576. One of the most valuable of the Middle-Breton documents is the
                    Breton-French and Latin Dictionary of Jean Lagadeuc or Lagadec, curé of
                    Ploegonen, a manuscript of which, extending to the middle of the letter P, dated
                    1464, is in the National Lib rary of Paris. Under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">CathoUcon</hi> it has been printed several times, the
                    earliest edition being that of 1499.</p>
                <p>Miracle-plays died out in France and England in the 16th century, but in
                    Cornwall, as we have seen, they continued to be played down to the beginning of
                    the 17th century, and in Brittany almost down to our own time. The Great Mystery
                    of Jesus, modernized and otherwise altered, was in great repute in the 18th
                    century. One of the widest known and most popular mysteries which have come down
                    to modern times is that of St Tryphine and King Arthur, which Μ. Luzel has
                    published. The language is more modern than in the two plays above mentioned,
                    and is largely mixed with French expressions, hence we did not include it among
                    Middle-Breton documents. The Breton miracle-plays, as well as the Cornish ones,
                    are free to a great extent from the disgusting realism, coarse expressions, and
                    indecent buffooneries of the English and French plays of the 15th century.</p>
                <p>Although modern Breton literature, like modern Welsh literature, is outside the
                    scope of this article, we should except from this category popular poems and
                    tales, for, though modern in form, they contain materials for comparative
                    mythology and linguistic studies, and exhibit the whole intellectual life,
                    belief, and customs of the people, and the impressions which the events of their
                    history have left on the popular mind. Of such collections the most important is
                    Μ. de la Villemarqué’s <hi rend="italic">Barzaz Brciz,</hi> the fruit of many
                    years’ labour in every part of Lower Brittany. This collection consists of <hi
                    rend="italic">gwers,</hi> or short heroic, historical, or mythological ballads;
                    <hi rend="italic">sons,</hi> or love and festive songs; and religions poems. The
                    language is, of course, modern, but is full of archaisms, showing very well how
                    old poetic material becomes modified in the current of popular tradition. The
                    Breton text is accompanied by an elegant translation into French, an
                    introduction and notes, and in the sixth edition all the pieces have the
                    original airs noted. Mr Tom Taylor published in 1865 a translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Barzaz Breiz.</hi> Μ. Μ. F. Luzel, already well known as the
                    author of a volume of excellent Breton poetry <hi rend="italic">(Bepred
                    Breizad,</hi> Morlaix, 1865), and by his edition of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sainte</hi><hi rend="italic">Tryphine</hi><hi rend="italic">et le roi
                    Arthur,</hi> published in 1868 a volume of <hi rend="italic">gwers</hi> or
                    popular ballads collected in a part of the ancient diocese of Tréguier, under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Gwerzion Brei∑- tzel.</hi> Similar collections
                    have been made in other parts of Brittany, especially by MM. Penguern, G. Milin,
                    Goulven-Denis, &amp;c., which have not, so far as we know, been yet published.
                    Μ. Luzel has also published some popular tales in the Tréguier dialect, and
                    Colonel A. Troude and G. Milin an interesting collection of seven in the Léon
                    dialect.</p>
                <p>In concluding what we have had to say on the literature of the respective
                    dialects, it may be well to add a few words on a subject which belongs to all
                    alike, upon which Μ. de la Villemarqué has given a short essay by way of
                    introduction to his edition of <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Grand</hi><hi rend="italic">Mystère</hi><hi rend="italic">de Jesus,</hi> and
                    upon which Μ. Luzel has also some remarks in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sainte</hi><hi rend="italic">Tryphine</hi><hi rend="italic">et le roi
                    Arthur,</hi> namely, the theatre of the Celts. Μ. de la Villemarqué assumes that
                    there is no evidence of a drama among the Goidelic branch of the Celts, but he
                    thinks that it existed among the British branch, at least in an embryonic state,
                    and refers to the Welsh poems in dialogue as evidence. Mr Stephens had
                    already<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Literature of the Kμmry,</hi> p. 82.</p></note> drawn attention to

                    rend="italic">Arthur</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gwenhwyvar, Gwalchnιai</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Trystan, Taliessin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Myrtin
                    (Myrdin</hi> or Merlin), &lt;fcc., and given it as his opinion that written
                    dialogue seems to indicate the existence of drama of some sort, and that
                    dialogues such as those referred to are inexplicable on any other hypothesis. If
                    this argument were admissible, we cannot see how the existence of the dramatic
                    form should be denied to the Irish, inasmuch as dialogue is very frequent in
                    Irish poems and tales. Indeed, the “Fight of <hi rend="italic">Ferdiad</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Cúchulaind,</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi> and other episodes of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Táin Bo Cuailnge,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Briáthar
                    chath ban Ulad,</hi> or “Wordy War of the Women of Ulster,” the <hi
                    rend="italic">Siαbur charpat Conculaind,</hi> or “Phantom Chariot of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cúchulaind,”</hi> possess as much of the character of incipient
                    drama as any poetic or prose dialogues in Welsh literature. The truth is,
                    however, neither the Welsh nor the Irish had the drama in the proper sense of
                    the word, for the sufficient reason that though, like other Aryan peoples, they
                    may have possessed the germ, it could not be developed among a people who had no
                    civic life. The miracle-plays of the Cornish and Bretons are of foreign and
                    ecclesiastical origin, and merely prove that there existed a closer contact
                    between their churches and the great body of the church in Europe than between
                    the latter and the Irish and Welsh churches. No Welsh miracle-play is known, if
                    there ever was one; nevertheless, it is possible that the words <hi
                    rend="italic">lvud a lledrith,</hi> which are explained “illusion,” “phantasm,”
                    may have really referred to some exhibition of the kind, though the explanation
                    of those words given in the <hi rend="italic">Iοlο</hi> MSS , upon the authority
                    of a certain <hi rend="italic">Ieuαn Vawr αp</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Diwliths,</hi> who, according to Mr Edward Williams <hi
                    rend="italic">(Iοlο Mοrgαnwg),</hi> wrote his treatise on Welsh metres about the
                    year 1180, looks very suspicious. Μ. de la Villemarqué also alludes to a rustic
                    fête, known as <hi rend="italic">le jeu de printemps et de la jeunesse,</hi> in
                    which three characters, two young men and one maiden, acted, while the
                    spectators formed the chorus, and repeated the dialogued chants of the principal
                    actors while dancing. Although this fête seems to be a survival of pagan times,
                    and to possess to some extent the elements of an incipient drama, yet in the
                    absence of written monuments or ancient evidence, no argument as to the
                    existence of a native drama among the Celts can be legitimately drawn from
                    it.</p>
                <p>Celtic literature, although it has no great masterpiece of its own to point to,
                    has exercised a considerable amount of influence on the creations of modern
                    European literature. This influence was exerted by several distinct currents of
                    legends. The first is that of the legends of the <hi rend="italic">Aes Side</hi>
                    and those of Queen <hi rend="italic">Mebd</hi> or Mab and the heroic period; of
                    these the existing Irish legends, and the modified form of them in the Welsh <hi
                    rend="italic">Mαbinοgiοn,</hi> give us one type. In Britain this first current,
                    modified and mixed with foreign and especially Teutonic elements, has gone on
                    altering, growing, and decaying until the traces of its origin are almost
                    unrecognizable. It is from this source that much of our fairy mythology is
                    derived, and that Chaucer and Spenser obtained materials. To it also may be
                    traced the legends which formed the groundwork of Shakespeare’s immediate
                    sources for King Lear and Midsummer Night’s Dream. The legends of the second
                    stream were in reality but modifications of those of the first—all secondary
                    streams of legend must be necessarily but branches of the primitive stream.
                    These legends were translated into Latin at an early period, and thus, while
                    they spread far and wide, and passed into every language of Europe, we are
                    better able to follow the current up to its first sources. These legends are the
                    Irish <hi rend="italic">Immrams</hi> or Wanderings and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fisa</hi> or Visions which we described above. The idea of a land without
                    winter, of never-ending day, in which the flowers of spring and summer should
                    coexist with the fruits of autumn, and in which bodily ills and old age should
                    be unknown, is common to all lands and to all times. The belief in perpetual
                    youth and especially of abundance of fruit at all times was spread over all
                    Western Europe, and found expression in the popular legends of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schlauer-affenlαnde, Pays de Cοcaigne,</hi> &lt;fcc. The Irish idea of this
                    kingdom of the dead, an idea common to all the branches of the Celtic race, and
                    to the Teutonic races also, is given us in the descriptions of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tir Tairngire,</hi> The Land of Promise; <hi rend="italic">Magh Mell,</hi> The
                    Plain of Honey; and the Country of the <hi rend="italic">Side.</hi> Thither went
                    several of the heroes of romance <hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cúchulaind, Find, Conn,</hi> and his son <hi rend="italic">Ari.</hi></p>
                <p>In some legends the land of the <hi rend="italic">Aes Side</hi> was reached
                    through caves, as in Virgil’s Cave of the Sibyl; in others, and more usually, by
                    water,—it being conceived in such cases as an island. In the legends of <hi
                    rend="italic">Conn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Art</hi> this island lay to the
                    eastward, that being the direction in which all the expeditions of the Irish
                    went, the direction in which lay the wealth of the Roman towns of Britain and
                    the metals for bronze of Cornwall. In early Christian times asceticism carried
                    many to the headlands and islands along the west and south-west coast, and the
                    Land of Promise followed the setting sun. A comparison between the Irish pagan
                    and Christian legends of <hi rend="italic">Tir Taimgire,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">terra</hi><hi rend="italic">repromissionis</hi> of the Latin
                    mediaeval writers, and those of the Teutonic <hi rend="italic">Glasberg,</hi> or
                    heaven, shows very clearly the common origin of the two streams. The individual
                    features of the Celtic and Teutonic notions of the kingdom of the dead are the
                    same, though their combinations may differ according to age and other
                    circumstances. The great sea cat and the island of cats in St Brendan’s
                    voyage—the island being also met with in other <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">Freyja</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Holda;</hi> the island of
                    black faced dwarfs of the Irish legends reminds us of the dwarfs dwelling in <hi
                    rend="italic">Glasberg.</hi> Like <hi rend="italic">Holda s</hi> soul-kingdom,
                    <hi rend="italic">Tir Taimgire</hi> was an island hidden in a cloud-mantle,
                    enjoying never-ending day and perpetual Lgless summer, full of fine mansions
                    surrounded by grassy, flower-bedecked lawns, whose flowers never wither,
                    abounding in apple trees, bearing at the same time flowers and fruit—a land rich
                    in milk, ale, and pork, whose air was ever filled with sweet music, and whose
                    inhabitants enjoying perpetual youth were of spotless innocence, free from
                    blemish, disease, or death. Of all the qualities of <hi rend="italic">Tir
                    Tairngire</hi> abundance of apples, the only important fruit known to the
                    northern nations, seems to have been the one which conveyed the highest notion
                    of enjoyment. Hence the soul-kingdom was called by the Welsh the island of
                    apples, <hi rend="italic">Ynys yr Avallon,</hi> and sometimes <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ynysvitrin</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ynysgutrin,</hi> Glass Island, a name
                    which identifies it with the Teutonic <hi rend="italic">Glasberg.</hi> When
                    these names passed into other languages untranslated, so that their meaning
                    became obscured or forgotten, the kingdom of the dead was localized at
                    Glastonbury, the Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">Glaestinga buι∙h.</hi> There,
                    according to legend, Arthur lies buried, but another popular tradition has it
                    that he was carried away to the island of <hi rend="italic">Avallon</hi> by his
                    sister the fairy <hi rend="italic">Morgana,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Morgue la

                    visits <hi rend="italic">Tir Taimgire,</hi> as already mentioned. When <hi
                    rend="italic">Art</hi> reaches the Land of Promise, the lady he finds is <hi
                    rend="italic">Crede,</hi> “the ever beautiful.” In the romance of <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">Auberon,</hi> the Oberon of fairy romance, and. <hi
                    rend="italic">Mallabron,</hi> a sprite of the sea. A curious legend in the
                    vellum manuscript called the Book of Lismore connects <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brendan</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Crede.</hi> According to this legend a
                    certain tribe king named <hi rend="italic">Doburchu,</hi> whose wife’s name was

                    all these legends with Celtic mythology is the introduction of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brendan</hi> into the curious legend of the irruption of Loch Neagh, beneath
                    which lived in her sun-house <hi rend="italic">Liban,</hi> probably the same as
                    <hi rend="italic">Becuma,</hi> and therefore as <hi rend="italic">Morgana,</hi>
                    whose lapdog was transformed into an otter when she herself became a salmon. In
                    the Christian <hi rend="italic">Immrαms</hi> or Wanderings the pagan
                    soul-kingdom was simply changed into a place where souls were to await the final
                    resurrection. It is probable, however, that a tradition of real wanderings among
                    the rocky and inaccessible islands along the western coasts of Ireland and
                    Scotland, and on the ocean itself, served as a nucleus around which gathered and
                    fused together the pagan and Christian notions of the kingdom of the dead. The
                    islands of birds, and the whale serving as an island (in the Latin St Brendan
                    <hi rend="italic">Iαsconius, i,e,,</hi> Irish <hi rend="italic">iasc-inù,</hi>
                    fish-island), support this view.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Fisa,</hi> or prophetic Visions, are merely a different
                    type from the <hi rend="italic">Immrarns</hi> or Wanderings of the same
                    fundamental legends; although perfectly pagan in their origin the better known
                    ones belong to Christian times when the Celtic Soul-Kingdom, and the Christian
                    story of the Day of Judgment, and the Elysium and Tartarus of the Romans, as
                    depicted by Virgil in the sixth book of the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> which
                    became known to the Irish as early at least as the 6th century, were fused
                    together. The visions when translated into Latin passed into European languages.
                    The original Irish of some of them is not now known; perhaps some of them were
                    first written in Latin; their thoroughly Irish character, however, and the
                    existence in Irish only of one of the most perfect of them, the Vision of <hi
                    rend="italic">Adamnán,</hi> lead to the opposite conclusion. The Wandering of St
                    Brendan, the Purgatory of St Patrick, and the Vision of Tundale represent three
                    distinct types of the second stream of legends. The first is the way of getting
                    at the soul-kingdom by water, the second by a cave, and the third by a <hi
                    rend="italic">fis</hi> or vision, which in pagan times would have formed part of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Filidecht</hi> of the poet. These three legends, which are
                    to be found in every European language in the Middle Ages, constitute three out
                    of the five main sources of the plot of Dante’s great poem.<note anchored="true"

                    geographical discovery does not come within our scope, and we shall therefore
                    only add that his island, which was simply the Celtic soul-kingdom, is to be
                    found on maps of the 17th century, and was the subject of an article in a treaty
                    between Spain and Portugal in the 18th.</p>
                <p>The third current we have already touched upon. It was formed by the fusion of
                    the legends of <hi rend="italic">Art,</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Conn,</hi>
                    the necromancy of the <hi rend="italic">Aes Side,</hi> and the legendary history
                    of the struggles of the Britons and Saxons in the North of England and the South
                    of Scotland, which latter legends supplied heroes, a toponomy, and events. To
                    this stream flowed afterwards, as we have pointed out, the Armorican tributary
                    stream of the Round Table, and the Provençal stream of the St Graal. The effects
                    of this stream of legend, which in its early course belongs to South Wales, on
                    the literatures of Europe is too well known to require discussion here further
                    than to point to its threefold action :— (1 ) much of the romantic literature of
                    Europe may be traced back directly or indirectly to those legends; (2) they
                    helped as the vehicle of that element we call chivalry, which the church infused
                    into them, to fashion and mould the rude soldiers of feudal times into Christian
                    knights; and (3) they expanded the imagination, and incited the minds of men to
                    inquiry beyond the conventional notions of things, and thus materially assisted
                    in creating modem society.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bibliography.</hi> —In the following list we have included
                    only the more important works bearing more or less directly upon the subjects
                    treated of in the foregoing article. We have been consequently obliged to
                    exclude many valuable works on the history of Celtic peoples, and especially the
                    numerous and interesting books on Celtic antiquities. Although the Neo-Druidic
                    heresy may be considered to be now fully exploded, we have, nevertheless, deemed
                    it necessary to include a few of the principal works of the upholders of that
                    singular delusion, because of the historic interest which they possess.</p>
