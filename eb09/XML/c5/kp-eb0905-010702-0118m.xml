                    (1798-1869), a popular Irish novelist, was born at Prillisk, Clogher, in the
                    county of Tyrone. His father was a peasant tenant, and young Carleton passed his
                    early life among scenes precisely similar to those he afterwards delineated with
                    so much power and truthfulness. His parents, though of humble rank, were highly
                    endowed by nature. The father was remarkable for his extraordinary memory, which
                    was well stored with anecdote and tale; the mother was noted throughout the
                    district for the rich sweetness of her voice. Both possessed in a high degree
                    those domestic virtues so frequently found among the humbler classes of the
                    Irish people. The beautiful character of Honor, the miser’s wife, in <hi
                    rend="italic">F</hi><hi rend="italic">ardor ougka,</hi> is evidently sketched
                    from the life by the loving hand of a son.</p>
                <p>The education received by Carleton was of a very humble description. As his
                    father removed from one small farm to another, he attended at various places the
                    hedge-schools, which used to be a notable feature of Irish life. The admirable
                    little picture of one of these schools in the <hi rend="italic">Traits and
                    Stories</hi> bears every mark of having been drawn from real experience. A
                    smattering of some higher learning was picked up here and there as opportunity
                    offered, and at the age of seventeen Carleton resolved to prosecute his
                    education as a poor scholar. The resolution was not carried into effect; he
                    remained at home, preparing to enter upon the training for the priesthood, and
                    receiving the unbounded veneration of the neighbouring peasantry for his
                    supposed wonderful learning. An amusing account of this phase of his existence
                    is given in the little sketch <hi rend="italic">Denis O' Shaughnessy.</hi> When
                    about the age of nineteen he undertook one of the religious pilgrimages then
                    common in Ireland. His experiences as a pilgrim were such as at a later period
                    made him resign for ever the thought of entering the church. His vacillating
                    ideas as to a mode of life were determined in a definite direction by the
                    reading of <hi rend="italic">Gil Blas,</hi> which chance had thrown in his way.
                    He resolved to cast himself boldly upon the world, and try what fortune had in
                    store for him. He went to Killanny, and for six months acted as tutor in a
                    neighbouring farmer’s family. Soon tiring of this occupation, he set out for
                    Dublin, and arrived in the metropolis with 2s. 9d. in his pocket. He began to
                    contribute to the journals, and his paper “The Lough Derg Pilgrim,” which was
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Examiner,</hi> excited great
                    attention. In 1830 appeared the first series of <hi rend="italic">Traits and
                    Stories of ths Irish Peasantry,</hi> which at once placed the author in the
                    first rank of Irish novelists. A second series appeared in 1832, and was
                    received with equal favour both in Ireland and in England. From that time till
                    within a few years of his death Carleton’s literary activity was incessant. The
                    best of his many productions are <hi rend="italic">Far-darougha the Miser,</hi>
                    perhaps on the whole the finest and most powerful of all his works; <hi
                    rend="italic">The Tithe Proctor; Valentine M</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    i</hi><hi rend="italic">Clutehy</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >The Blade Prophet</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">The Emigrants
                    of Ahadarra.</hi> Some of his later writings, such as <hi rend="italic">The
                    Squanders of Castle Squander,</hi> were not so successful as the earlier tales.
                    The author was not happy in describing the upper classes of Irish society, and
                    overloaded his work with political or semi-political matter.</p>
                <p>Carleton is <hi rend="italic">facile</hi><hi rend="italic">princeps</hi> among
                    Irish novelists, and it is to his pages that one must look for an adequate
                    picture of the peculiar Irish character. His style is clear, graphic, and
                    pleasing; the plots of his stories are generally slight but well constructed. In
                    his pictures of peasant life he is unsurpassed; the lights and shades of Irish
                    character, the buoyant humour and domestic virtues that under other conditions
                    would lead their possessors to prosperity and happiness, and the fatal flaws
                    that seem to render it impossible for Ireland ever to become capable of
                    selfgovernment, receive equal justice at his hands. He invariably writes from
                    intimate acquaintance with the scenes described and from loving sympathy with
                    the many good and noble elements in the Irish nature. He does not hesitate to
                    point out the darker features of Irish life, nor to draw attention to the fatal
                    system of education and priestly supremacy that did so much to produce them.</p>
                <p>Carleton, after spending some years in America, settled in Dublin, where he died
                    on the 30th January 1869. For many years before his death he had enjoyed a
                    pension of £200 from the Crown.</p>
