                    his mind may be traced in many allusions in his writings, and in the vivid
                    admiration which he ever expressed for it in afterlife. To the society of the
                    town of Newport he owed but little; it was a bustling, crowded seaport, where a
                    certain Puritanic strictness, inherited by tradition from the founders of the
                    State, was kept up, not only in connection with, but too much as a salvo for, a
                    considerable amount of laxity both of speech and practice. As a bathing-place it
                    was a resort for strangers from other parts, and the interfusion of French and
                    British officers tended to modify the peculiarities which the un mixed influence
                    of retired sea captains, West Indian traders, and keen New England lawyers might
                    have rendered too strong.</p>
                <p>As a child, Channing was remarkable for a refined delicacy of feature and
                    temperament, which made him an object of admiration and affection in the
                    household. From his father he inherited a fine person, simple and elegant
                    tastes, sweetness of temper, and warmth of affection; from his mother (who
                    appears to have been a remarkable woman) he derived the higher benefits of that
                    strong moral discernment and straightforward rectitude of purpose and action
                    which formed so striking a feature of his character. By both parents he was
                    carefully instructed in those strict religious principles which were
                    characteristic of the people of New England; and by both, but especially by his
                    mother, was his moral training most sedulously cared for. Other influences,
                    however, were in the meantime operating upon him. The excitement of the
                    revolutionary war was inspiring him with a profound and ardent love of freedom.
                    The sick chamber of an aunt of his father, who was a woman of much piety and
                    sweetness, was the source of many serious and hallowed lessons of gentleness and
                    goodness. An amateur Baptist preacher, who was by trade a cooper, by refusing,
                    though very poor, to manufacture any of the articles of his trade used for
                    containing ardent spirits, gave him an impulse which he never lost in favour of
                    temperance. A female servant, whose religious views were of a more cheerful cast
                    than those prevalent in his circle, used to talk to him in a way that greatly
                    engaged him, and probably sowed the germ of not a few of the ideas which
                    afterwards regulated his modes of religious sentiment. Able and free-minded men,
                    like Dr Stiles and Dr Hopkins, frequented his father’s house, and the quiet and
                    thoughtful boy listened to their conversations, and laid many suggestive words
                    that fell from them to heart. While but a child he had begun to draw inferences
                    from what he heard from the pulpit and elsewhere that were not quite such as his
                    guardians would have wished him to draw; and he “was even then quite a
                    theologian, and would chop logic with his elders according to the fashion of
                    that controversial time,” as he himself tells us.</p>
                <p>Whilst very young, he was sent to a dame’s school, who exacted from the incipient
                    republicans the title of <hi rend="italic">Madam,</hi> and enforced her
                    authority and her lessons by means of “a long round stick.” From this he passed
                    under the care of two excellent women, by whose instructions he profited
                    greatly. His next step was to the school of a Mr Rogers, considered the best at
                    that time in the town; and in his twelfth year he was sent to New London to
                    prepare for college, under the care of his uncle the Rev. Henry Channing. His
                    career at school does not appear to have been marked by any remarkable aptitude
                    for letters; on the contrary, his progress was at first somewhat slow, though
                    after the few initiatory difficulties were overcome, he advanced rapidly, both
                    in a knowledge of the classics and an appreciation of their excellencies. His
                    disposition was thoughtful and retiring, though among his companions he showed
                    no absence of relish for lively conversation or hearty amusement. A certain
                    mingled dignity and sweetness gave him a commanding influence in the school,
                    where he went by the name of “the Peacemaker.” and “Little <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n405/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0405-0394"/> King Pipin,” and where he was obeyed, though
                    “small and delicate,” with more readiness than mere physical strength could ever
                    have commanded.</p>
                <p>Shortly after he went to reside with his uncle, his father died. This event,
                    however, though it produced a great change in the circumstances of the family,
                    was not allowed to interrupt the course of his studies. After the funeral he
                    returned to the house of his uncle, where he remained till he had reached his
                    fifteenth year, when he was removed to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and entered at
                    Harvard College as freshman in 1794. Before leaving New London he came under the
                    influence of a religious revival which took place there, a circumstance to which
                    he was accustomed to trace the commencement of a decidedly religious life.</p>
                <p>The four years he remained at college seem to have been most profitably spent.
                    Besides acquiring an extensive acquaintance with classical and general
                    literature, he read largely and thought earnestly in the department of
                    psychology and ethics. The books which appear to have exerted most influence
                    upon his mind and opinions were Price’s <hi rend="italic">Dissertations,</hi>
                    Hutcheson on <hi rend="italic">Beauty and Virtue,</hi> and Ferguson on <hi
                    rend="italic">Civil Society.</hi> To the study of Shakespeare also (the interest
                    in whose works was then newly awakened in that quarter) he owed much; and so
                    deep was the impression made on him by the genius of the poet, that to the close
                    of his life one of the greatest of his intellectual treats was furnished by
                    recitations from his writings. By patient and well-directed assiduity he trained
                    himself to the mastery of that copious and vigorous style of composition to
                    which his subsequent position in the world of letters is in no small measure
                    due, and at the same time also laid the basis of his success as a public
                    speaker, by the formal study of rhetoric, and by frequent practice in addressing
                    assemblies of his fellow-students.</p>
                <p>For a year and a half after leaving college in 1798, Channing was resident at
                    Richmond, in Virginia, as tutor in the family of Mr David Meade Randolph. Here
                    he had time for study, which he employed chiefly on theological subjects. In
                    regard to many points, touching both the evidences of Christianity and its
                    doctrines, his mind was burdened with doubt and anxiety; and so earnestly did he
                    labour to attain satisfaction, that his constitution sank under the incessant
                    toil. When, in 1800, he returned to Newport, his friends were shocked to find
                    him changed to “a thin and pallid invalid;” and unhappily, at this time were
                    sown the seeds of that depressed condition of health which continued through
                    life his severest trial. He remained in the bosom of his family for another year
                    and a half, engaged in the pursuit of his studies, and in preparing himself, by
                    physical and moral as well as intellectual training, for the work to which he
                    was looking forward —that of the ministry. In 1802 he returned to Cambridge,
                    having been elected to the office of regent in Harvard University, a situation
                    which, without exacting from him any large amount of service, secured to him the
                    advantage of independence, and an opportunity of prosecuting his studies within
                    reach of a valuable library, and under influences favourable to success. In the
                    autumn of 1802 he began to preach, having received approbation to do so from the
                    Cambridge Association; and in the beginning of the following year he accepted
                    the invitation of the Congregational Church, Federal Street, Boston, to be their
                    pastor. To this office he was ordained in June 1803.</p>
                <p>Channing entered on his ministry with a deep and almost painful sense of the
                    responsibility of the office he had assumed, and with an earnest desire to
                    acquit himself faithfully of its obligations. His theological views were at this
                    time probably not definitely fixed. We have his own assurance that he was not a
                    Trinitarian,‘but he had not at this time severed himself from those holding
                    orthodox views. In 1808 he took part in the ordination of the Rev. J. Codman, a
                    well-known minister of the Congregational order, when he delivered a sermon
                    which was afterwards published. In this sermon, though the language and
                    sentiments are such as any evangelical divine might use, there is nothing that
                    certainly indicates that the author held any of the views peculiarly distinctive
                    of evangelical orthodoxy unless it be the application of the title “Divine
                    Master” to Jesus Christ, and the use of such expressions as that the blood of
                    Christ was “shed for souls,” and that for man’s salvation “the Son of God
                    himself left the abodes of glory and expired a victim on the cross.” It is not
                    thus that Unitarians, in England at least, are wont to speak of Christ and his
                    death. But Channing never identified himself with any theological party. He
                    called himself a Unitarian, and so in a sense he was, but his views were Arian
                    rather than what are commonly known as Unitarian. He reverenced in Jesus Christ
                    not only a sublimely perfect character, but a nature higher than that of man. He
                    believed in His pre-existence in heaven, and that He came down from heaven for
                    man’s salvation; and he taught that “the Scriptures ascribe the remission of
                    sins to Christ’s death with an emphasis so peculiar that we ought to consider
                    this event as having a special influence in removing punishment, as a condition
                    or method of pardon, without which repentance would not avail us, at least to
                    that extent which is now promised by the gospel” <hi rend="italic">(Sermon at
                    the ordination of Rev. Jared Sparks').</hi> The truth is, that Channing was too
                    much a lover of free thought, and too desirous to hold only what he saw to be
                    true, to allow himself to be bound by any party ties. “I wish,” he says, “to
                    regard myself as belonging not to a sect but to the community of free minds, of
                    lovers of truth, and followers of Christ, both on earth and in heaven. I desire
                    to escape the narrow walls of a particular church, and to stand under the open
                    sky in the broad light, looking far and wide, seeing with my own eyes, hearing
                    with my own ears, and following Truth meekly but resolutely, however arduous or
                    solitary be the path in which she leads” <hi rend="italic">(Sermon at
                    Installation of Rev. Μ. J.</hi><hi rend="italic">Motte).</hi> Thus refusing to
                    be enclosed within the limits of party, and acting freely as respected religious
                    association, he may be claimed as one whom men of all parties honour for his
                    abilities, his integrity, and his work.</p>
                <p>In 1814 Channing married his cousin, Ruth Gibbs, a union which brought him an
                    increase of worldly substance, as well as a rich addition to his personal
                    happiness. “Inwardly and outwardly,” his biographer tells us, “his lot
                    henceforward was singularly serene.” He was now fast rising in reputation, both
                    as a preacher and as a public man. Interested in all that concerned his country
                    and the cause of humanity, his voice was heard on most of the questions that
                    came before the American public, and always with marked and growing effect. He
                    had begun also to command attention as a writer for the press. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Address on JVar,</hi> some of his sermons, and especially his able
                    tract on <hi rend="italic">The Evidences of Christianity,</hi> had given him a
                    position of eminence among the writers of his country. In 1821 he received the
                    title of D.D. from Harvard University. In 1822 he undertook a journey to Europe,
                    in the course of which he visited Great Britain and some parts of the Continent.
                    When in England he made the acquaintance of some distinguished men of letters,
                    especially Wordsworth and Coleridge, on both of whom he appears to have left a
                    most favourable impression. Coleridge wrote of him, “He has the love of wisdom
                    and the wisdom of love.” On his return Dr Channing resumed his duties as a
                    minister, but with a more decided attention than before to literature and public
                    affairs. In 1824 he received as colleague the Rev. Ezra Stiles Gannett, at <pb

                    discourses. From this time forward his energies were devoted, in addition to his
                    pulpit labours, chiefly to the furtherance of great schemes of social reform. Of
                    the anti-slavery cause he was throughout the firm, eloquent, and uncompromising
                    advocate; and in every question that bore upon the happiness of the people he
                    took a lively interest. Of his publications, the most extensively read are his
                    <hi rend="italic">Remarks on the Life and Character of Napoleon Bonaparte,</hi>
                    his <hi rend="italic">Remarks on the Character and Writings of John Milton,</hi>

                    sixty-third year of his age, on Sunday, the 2d of October 1842, whilst on a
                    journey, at Bennington, Vermont, and was buried at Boston, on the 7th of that
                    month. An extended memoir of him by his nephew, William Henry Channing, appeared
                    in 1848 (republished in 1870). His <hi rend="italic">Complete Works</hi> were
