                <p><label type="entry">CIRCASSIA</label>. The name of Circassia is commonly given to
                    the whole of the north-western portion of the Caucasus, including the district
                    between the mountain range and the Black Sea, and extending to the north of the
                    central ridge as far as the River Kuban. In this sense the term is still in use
                    as a geographical appellation, though the Circassians, as a nation, may be
                    regarded as extinct. The region thus defined may be considered as extending from
                    the neighbourhood of Anapa on the Black Sea to the frontiers of Mingrelia, and
                    having a seaboard of about 280 English miles. Throughout this extent the country
                    is almost wholly mountainous,—the great range of the Caucasus, which begins in
                    the neighbourhood of Anapa at a moderate elevation, rising gradually as it
                    extends towards the south-east, till it culminates in the lofty summit of Mount
                    Elbruz, at an elevation of 18,526 feet. The strip of land between the dividing
                    ridge or watershed of these mountains and the sea, a tract varying from twenty
                    to forty miles in width, is extremely rugged, traversed by successive offshoots
                    of the mountains, extending quite down to the sea, and covered for the most part
                    with extensive forests. The slopes on the northern side of the Caucasus are more
                    gentle, and here the valleys afford abundant pasturage, but hardly any portion
                    of Circassia, properly so called, is a level or open country.</p>

                <p>The Tcherkesses or Circassians, who gave name to this region, of which they were
                    until lately the sole inhabitants, are a peculiar race, differing from the other
                    tribes of the Caucasus in origin and language. They designate themselves by the
                    name of Adighe, that of Tcherkesses being a term of Russian origin. By their
                    long-continued struggles with the power of Russia, during a period of nearly
                    forty years, they attracted the attention of the other nations of Europe in a
                    high degree, and were at the same time an object of interest to the student of
                    the history of civilization, from the strange mixture which their customs
                    exhibited of clιivalrous sentiment with savage customs. For this reason it may
                    be still worth while to give a brief summary of their national characteristics
                    and manners, though these must now be regarded as in great measure things of the
                    past.</p>
                <p>In the patriarchal simplicity of their manners, the mental qualities with which
                    they were endowed, the beauty of form and regularity of feature by which they
                    were distinguished, they surpassed most of the other tribes of the Caucasus. At
                    the same time they were remarkable for their warlike and intrepid character,
                    their independence, their hospitality to strangers, and that love of country
                    which they manifested in their determined resistance to an almost overwhelming
                    power during the period of a long and desolating war. The government under which
                    they lived was a peculiar form of the feudal system. The free Circassians were
                    divided into three distinct ranks, the princes or <hi rend="italic">pschi,</hi>
                    the nobles or <hi rend="italic">uork</hi> (Tartar <hi rend="italic"
                    >usdeιι),</hi> and the peasants or <hi rend="italic">hοkotl.</hi> Like the
                    inhabitants of the other regions of the Caucasus, they were also divided into
                    numerous families, tribes, or clans, some of which were very powerful, and
                    carried on war against each other with great animosity <hi rend="subscript"
                    >;</hi> Γhe slaves, of whom a large proportion were prisoners of war, were
                    generally employed in the cultivation of the soil, or in the domestic service of
                    some of the principal chiefs.</p>
                <p>The will of the people was acknowledged as the supreme source of authority; and
                    every free Circassian had a right to express his opinion in those assemblies of
                    his tribe in which the questions of peace and war, almost the only subjects
                    which engaged their attention, were brought under deliberation. The princes and
                    nobles, the leaders of the people in war and their rulers in peace, were only
                    the administrators of a power which was delegated to them. As they had no
                    written laws, the administration of justice was regulated solely by custom and
                    tradition, and in those tribes professing Mahometanism by the precepts of the
                    Koran. The most aged and respected inhabitants of the various <hi rend="italic"
                    >aοuls</hi> or villages frequently sat in judgment, and their decisions were
                    received without a murmur by the contending parties. The Circassian princes and
                    nobles were professedly Mahometans; but in their religious services many of the
                    ceremonies of their former heathen and Christian worship were still preserved. A
                    great part of the people had remained faithful to the worship of their ancient
                    gods,—Shible, the god of thunder, of war, and of justice, Tleps, the god of
                    fire, and Seosseres, the god of water and of winds. Although the Circassians are
                    said to have possessed minds capable of the highest cultivation, the arts and
                    sciences, with the exception of poetry and music, were completely neglected.
                    They possessed no written language. The wisdom of their sages, the knowledge
                    they had acquired, and the memory of their warlike deeds were preserved in
                    verses, which were repeated .from mouth to mouth and descended from father to
                    son.</p>
                <p>The education of the young Circassian was confined to riding, fencing, shooting,
                    hunting, and such exercises as were calculated to strengthen his frame, and
                    prepare him for a life of active warfare. The only intellectual duty of the <hi
                    rend="italic">αtalik</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or instructor with
                    whom the young men lived until they had completed their education, was that of
                    teaching them to express their thoughts shortly, quickly, and appropriately. One
                    of their marriage ceremonies was very strange. The young man who had been
                    approved by the parents, and had paid the stipulated price in money, horses,
                    oxen, or sheep, for his bride, was expected to come with his friends fully
                    armed, and to carry her off by force from her father’s house. Every free
                    Circassian had unlimited right over the lives of his wife and children. Although
                    polygamy was allowed by the laws of the Koran, the custom of the country forbade
                    it, and the Circassians were generally faithful to the marriage bond. The
                    respect for superior age was carried to such an extent, that the young brother
                    used to rise from his seat when the elder entered an apartment, and was silent
                    when he spoke. Like all the other inhabitants of the Caucasus, the Circassians
                    were distinguished for two very opposite qualities, the most generous
                    hospitality, and implacable vindictiveness. Hospitality to the stranger was
                    considered one of the most sacred duties. Whatever were his rank in life, all
                    the members of the family rose to receive him on his entrance, and conduct him
                    to the principal seat in the apartment. The host was considered responsible with
                    his own life for the security of his guest, upon whom, even although his
                    deadliest enemy, he would inflict no injury while under the protection of his
                    roof. The chief who had received a stranger was also bound to grant him an
                    escort of horse to conduct him in safety on his journey, and confide him to the
                    protection of those nobles with whom he might be on friendly terms. The law of
                    vengeance was no less binding on the Circassian. The individual who had slain
                    any member of a family was pursued with implacable vengeance by the relatives,
                    until his crime was expiated by death. The murderer might, indeed, secure his
                    safety by the payment of a certain sum of money, or by carrying off from the
                    house of his enemy a newly-born child, bringing it up as his own, and restoring
                    it when its education was finished. In either case, the family of the slain
                    individual might discontinue the pursuit of vengeance without any stain upon its
                    honour. The man closely followed by his enemy, who, on reaching the dwelling of
                    a woman, had merely touched her hand, was safe from all other pursuit so long as
                    he remained under the protection of her roof. The opinions of the Circassians
                    regarding theft resembled those of the ancient Spartans. The commission of the
                    crime was not considered so disgraceful as its discovery; and the punishment of
                    being compelled publicly to restore the stolen property to its original
                    possessor, amid the derision of his tribe, was much dreaded by the Circassian
                    who would glory in a successful theft. The greatest stain upon the Circassian
                    character was the custom of selling their children, the Circassian father being
                    always willing to part with his daughters, many of whom were bought by Turkish
                    merchants for the harems of Eastern monarchs. But no degradation was implied in
                    this transaction, and the young women themselves were generally willing partners
                    in it. Herds of cattle and sheep constituted the chief riches of the
                    inhabitants. The princes and nobles, from whom the members of the various tribes
                    held the land which they cultivated, were the proprietors of the soil. The
                    Circassians carried on little or no commerce, and the state of perpetual warfare
                    in which they lived prevented them from cultivating any of the arts of
                    peace.</p>
                <p>The early history of Circassia is exceedingly obscure, This part of the coasts of
                    the Black Sea was inhabited in ancient times only by wild and barbarous tribes,
                    whose names are very differently given by ancient writers. No Greek colonies
                    were planted within the limits of Circassia proper, though the Greeks carried on
                    an extensive trade with the nations of the interior at Dioscurias, near Sukhum
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n802/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0802-0789"/> Kaleb. In the 12th and 13th centuries the princes
                    of Georgia were successful in reducing Circassia into the condition of a
                    province; and are said to have also been the first to introduce Christianity
                    into the country—a religion which they continued to profess (in name at least)
                    till the 18th century, when they were converted to Islamism by the teaching of a
                    fanatical devotee named Mansur. The common people, however, retain to a great
                    extent their pagan customs and beliefs. After they had succeeded in throwing off
                    the Georgian yoke, the Circassians passed for a time under the rule of the
                    Tartar khans of the Crimea, from whom they emancipated theraselves, with the
                    assistance of Ivan I., czar of Russia. But the Russian monarchs do not appear to
                    have regarded their conquest as a matter of much importance, until the time of
                    Peter the Great. That powerful monarch, perceiving how much the possession of
                    the Caucasus would contribute to his political and commercial influence in
                    Western and Central Asia, made an unsuccessful attempt to reduce it permanently
                    under his dominion. Catherine II. pursued a similar line of policy. Georgia
                    having been harassed by the successive invasions of the Persians and Turks, the
                    prince of that country at last threw himself under the protection of the
                    Russians, and became tributary to their power. The River Kouban being afterwards
                    fixed as the southern boundary of the Muscovite empire, the Russians became
                    ambitious of extending their dominion uninterruptedly to the extreme limits of
                    Georgia. In the wars which now took place between the Russians and the Turks,
                    the latter used every exertion, by exciting the fanatical feelings of the
                    Circassians against the infidels, to induce them to harass the Russians by
                    frequent incursions into their territory. After various vicissitudes of fortune,
                    the Turks were worsted, and compelled by the treaty of Adrianople in 1829 to
                    cede a considerable portion of their territory to the czar. Assuming a right of
                    political sovereignty which they had never possessed, they included Circassia in
                    this cession. The Circassians, refusing to acknowledge the right of the sultan
                    (whom they had never recognized as their sovereign, though acknowledging him as
                    head of their religion) thus to dispose of their country, were now exposed to
                    the hostility of the Russians, who determined to become masters of the territory
                    on the coasts of the Black Sea, and indeed of the whole Caucasian region, by
                    force of arms. This was the origin of that remorseless war which was carried on
                    with so much animosity down to a very recent period, and cost the Russians an
                    incredible amount of blood and treasure.</p>
                <p>A brief outline of the leading events which characterized this long-protracted
                    struggle will be found in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Caucasus.</hi> After
                    the Circassians were finally reduced to submission, the inhabitants of the
                    sea-coast, rather than submit to the regulations imposed by the Russian
                    Government, determined to quit their country, and emigrate in a mass to Turkey.
                    Not less than half a million of people carried out this resolution, and were
                    settled in different parts of the Turkish empire,—the greater part of them in
                    Asia Minor, but some also in the mountain country on the borders of Bulgaria and
                    Servia. Since that period the whole tract along the sea-coast from Anapa to
                    Sukhum Kaleh, which was that best known as Circassia, has been almost entirely
                    destitute of inhabitants. But the northern slopes of the Caucasus, and the
                    valleys descending towards the Kuban, are still occupied by tribes of Circassian
                    race; and the Kabardans, a kindred tribe, but of less warlike character,
                    extending eastwards to beyond the Terek, have long settled down quietly in the
                    condition of Russian subjects. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. h. b.)</hi></p>
