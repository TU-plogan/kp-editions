                    13th of January 1808. After graduating with distinction at Dartmouth College, at
                    the age of eighteen he opened a classical school at Washington, and commenced
                    the study of law under William Wirt. In 1830 he was admitted to the bar; and he
                    soon after gained for himself considerable reputation by a compilation of the
                    statutes of Ohiα Throughout his whole career he was a consistent and vigorous
                    opponent of slavery. From the first he was willing to risk his hopes of
                    professional success by undertaking the defence of runaway slaves or of those
                    who assisted their escape; and he boldly argued that slavery was merely an
                    institution of the individual States, to which the national Government could not
                    extend its sanction. He took a prominent part in the anti-slavery convention
                    which met at Columbus in 1841, in the first “National Liberty Convention” of
                    1843, in the “Southern and Western Liberty Convention” of 1845, and in the
                    second “National Liberty Convention” of 1847. He also presided over the
                    “National Convention” of 1848, which nominated Van Buren for president and Adams
                    for vice-president. In 1849 he became member of the senate; and in 1855 he was
                    elected governor of Ohio, in which position he was so popular that he was
                    re-elected, two years after, by an extraordinarily large number of votes. He was
                    also three times nominated for the presidency, though he never attained that
                    dignity.</p>
                <p>On the accession of Lincoln to the presidency, in March 1861, Chase became
                    secretary of the treasury; and he fulfilled the duties of this most important
                    and difficult post with the greatest energy till June 1864. Still,
                    notwithstanding his ability and zeal, it cannot be said that the measures he
                    adopted were the best even in the extremely difficult circumstances in which he
                    was placed. Though he appears to have apprehended some of the evil consequences
                    likely to arise from the creation of inconvertible notes, he argues that their
                    issue was necessary on the ground that it would increase the loanable capital of
                    the country, while, in fact, employed as it was by Government in defraying
                    expenses, it could have no such effect. At first Chase contemplated raising a
                    large sum by direct taxation; but this course Congress refused to pursue. He was
                    forced, therefore, to resort to a considerable increase of the taxes on imports,
                    to issues of an inconvertible paper currency, and to enormous loans, which were
                    contracted upon unnecessarily expensive terms. The interest was, in reality,
                    about double its nominal amount, owing to the fact that it was paid in gold;
                    and, beside this, a considerable loss was sustained through the arrangement by
                    which the debt contracted in depreciated paper was discharged in coin.</p>
                <p>It was under his management that Congress passed the Banking Law of February
                    1863, which, as amended in June 1864, is still in force (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Banking,</hi> vol. iii. p. 310). It was at that time useful in
                    two ways; for it procured for the Government, in its necessity, a considerable
                    loan from the banks, and it replaced the notes of the banks, which had lost
                    their credit through frequent failures, by notes which possessed the Government
                    guarantee. Its great recommendation at present is that it secures the
                    trustworthiness of the note currency.</p>
                <p>In December of the year in which he resigned the secretaryship of the treasury,
                    Chase was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, and
                    in this capacity he had to undertake the responsibility of superintending the
                    trial of President Johnson. But his health was now broken, and his old activity
                    was no longer possible. In June 1870 he suffered a shock of apoplexy, and on May
                    7, 1873, he died at New York.</p>
