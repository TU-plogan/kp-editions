                    grown in abundance. Cattle, sheep, and pigs have been introduced; there is a
                    great variety of birds, and the lagoons abound with turtle and fish. The
                    inhabitants are a dark copper-coloured race, and bear evident traces of Malay
                    and Papuan blood. Not only the separate islands, but even the villages form
                    independent but co-operative republics. The most peculiar institution is the
                    Clöbbergoll, a kind of corporation for purposes of mutual aid and defence. The
                    women have clöbbergolls of their own, and possess a considerable share of
                    political influence. The Pelewese still used stone instruments and weapons at
                    the close of last century, but produced a variety of artistic articles with
                    their limited means. They have five kinds of recognized currency in the islands,
                    consisting of pieces or beads of ancient glass and enamel, to which they ascribe
                    a divine origin. The population seems to be rapidly decreasing; Dr Semper
                    calculates that at present the whole group contains 10,000 inhabitants. The
                    Pelews were brought prominently into notice by Captain Henry Wilson, whose ship—
                    the “Antelope ”—was wrecked, in August 1783, on one of the islands. A narrative
                    of his residence on the islands was published by George Keate, in 1788. Dr
                    Semper gives a graphic account of his intercourse with the natives in his <hi

                    during 1865-1868.</p>
                <p>The Central Carolines, or those which are more usually known as the Carolines
                    proper, consist of about 48 groups with 400 or 500 islands. Omitting Ualan,
                    Puynipet, and Rug the area is hardly 20 square miles, but including them it
                    amounts to 360. The Ngoli, Gulu, or Mateiotas group lies to the north-east of
                    the Pelews, and consists of three islands inhabited by a few people from Yap.
                    Yap or Guap lies further to the north-east, is about 10 miles in length, and has
                    an excellent harbour on the south-east. The natives are at a higher level of
                    civilization than most of their neighbours; they cultivate the betel-nut with
                    great care, build first-rate boats, lay out their villages regularly, pave their
                    streets, and construct stone piers and wharves. A Spanish mission was
                    established in the island in 1856. A map and description will be found in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Godeffroy Journal</hi> for 1873, which also gives an
                    account of the Ulithi, Elivi, or Mackenzie group, previously described by
                    Captain Wilkes of the United States exploration. The Ulea, Swede, and Lütke
                    Islands are of little importance; but the Hugoleu or Rug group, discovered in
                    1824 by Duperrey, is composed of five large and about forty smaller islands, and
                    contains nearly 35,000 inhabitants, who are divided into two distinct races—a
                    black and a red—which are often at war with each other. The Mortlock or Young
                    William’s group, which received its former name from its discoverer in 1793,
                    consists of three atolls called respectively Satoan, Etal, and Lukunor. The
                    natives, who number about 3400, are of Samoan origin, and are the only
                    worshippers of regular idols in the archipelago. To the north-east lies Ngatik,
                    Nutik, or Raven Island, discovered in 1773, and inhabited by immigrants from
                    Puynipet, greatly mingled with foreign blood. An account of a visit by the
                    “Star” to the last three or four islands is given in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Geographical Magazine</hi> for 1874. Puynipet (Bornabi, Bonabe, Bonibet,
                    Funopet, or Panapee), also called Ascension by the French, along with the two
                    low atolls of Andema and Paphenemo (known to English sailors as Ant’s Islands
                    and Pakeen respectively), constitute the group called by Admiral Lütke the
                    Seniavine. The population at the time of the “Novara’s” visit in 1858 was 2000,
                    reduced by small-pox from 5000 in 1846. There is a small colony of whites, and
                    the island has been the seat of an American mission since 1851. The island is
                    the chief rendezvous for the whalers in that part of the Pacific. There is a
                    remarkable mass of ruins in the centre of the island, which seems to have
                    belonged to a fortification. (See Kubary, “Die Ruinen von Naumatie auf der Insel
                    Ponape,” in the <hi rend="italic">Godeffroy Journal.)</hi> Ualan Kusai, or
                    Strong’s Island, which occupies almost the centre of the Carolines proper, is a
                    volcanic island with an area of about 30 square miles and a population from 700
                    to 1000. It was discovered in 1804 by the American Crozer, and is the seat of an
                    American mission.</p>
                <p>The Eastern Carolines are otherwise known as the Mulgrave Archipelago, and
                    comprise the Radak, Ralik, or Marshall group and the Gilbert group. The total
                    population is estimated at 100,000. They were discovered by the two voyagers
                    whose names they bear in 1788.</p>
                <p>The Carolines were probably first visited by Alvaro de Saavedra in 1528; in 1579
                    Drake discovered the Pelews; and in 1686 another group was added to the list by
                    Admiral Francesco Lazeano. To the last-mentioned navigator they owe the name
                    they now bear, which was given in honour of Charles II. of Spain.</p>
