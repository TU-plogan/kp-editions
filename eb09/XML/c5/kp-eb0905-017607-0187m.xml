                <p><label type="entry">CASPIAN SEA</label>. The Caspian Sea, which was known under
                    that name to the Greeks and Romans (Herodotus having given a generally accurate
                    account of it, stating that it is an inland sea having no connection with the
                    ocean), is the largest of those salt lakes or closed inland seas which may be
                    considered as “survivals” of former oceanic areas; and it is the one whose
                    physical and biological conditions have been most fully studied.<note

                    respects extremely peculiar; and tolerably certain conclusions of great interest
                    may be drawn from them, in regard to the past history of the large extent of low
                    steppes that lie—chiefly in Asia, but partly in Europe also—to the east, north,
                    and west of its present area. These will be most fitly considered after a
                    general survey has been taken of the existing basin of the Caspian, and of its
                    relations to the surrounding land.</p>
                <p>The general form of the Ca spian may be described as a broad band, with sides
                    almost straight and parallel, except near its northern end, where it turns
                    sharply round to the east. The general direction of its axis is about N.N.E. and
                    S.S.W., ranging from lat. 47° 20' to 36° 40' N.,—its most northerly point nearly
                    coinciding with the mouth of the River Ural, and its most southerly being about
                    halfway between the towns of Reshd and Astrabad. The distance in a straight line
                    between these two points is about 740 miles in a straight line. The average
                    breadth of its middle portion is about 210 miles, but the eastern extension of
                    its northern portion into the Bay of Mertvy Kultuk increases the width of that
                    part to 430 miles; and its southern portion also widens to nearly 300 miles. The
                    total area is estimated at about 180,000 square miles.</p>
                <p>The most important fact in the physical geography of the existing Caspian is that
                    its surface is 84 feet below that of the Black Sea, which may be considered as
                    not differing much from the general oceanic level.</p>
                <p>The basin of the Caspian may be considered as consisting of three distinct
                    parts,—the northern, the middle, and the southern. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >northern</hi> portion is extremely shallow,— its bottom, which is nowhere more
                    than 50 feet below the surface, being a continuation of the almost imperceptible
                    slope of the steppe, so that there is no definite shore-line. It is into this
                    portion that the Volga, the Ural, and the Kuma discharge themselves; and the
                    deposit of alluvium which these rivers bring down is gradually raising its
                    bottom, and will in time convert it into a salt marsh. Along the north-western
                    border of this basin, from the delta of the Volga to that of the Kuma, a space
                    of 250 miles, the shore is gashed with thousands of narrow channels, termed <hi
                    rend="italic">limans,</hi> from 12 to 30 miles in length, separated by chains of
                    hillocks called <hi rend="italic">bugors,</hi> which pass landwards into the
                    level ground of the steppes. In the neighbourhood of the mouths of the Volga and
                    Kuma, the excess of water which these rivers bring down at the time <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n188/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0188-0177"/> of the melting of the snows passes into these
                    channels, and tends to keep them open; so that when the inundation is over, the
                    sea again flows into them. But along the intervening part of the coast, the
                    channels, like the intervening hillocks, are not continuous, but form chains of
                    little lakes, separated by sandy isthmuses. Although these channels run nearly
                    parallel to each other, yet they have a somewhat fan-like arrangement; their
                    centre of radiation being the higher part of the isthmus which separates the
                    basin of the Caspian from the north east portion of the Black Sea, —a fact, as
                    will be seen hereafter, of no small significance. The coast-line of the Bay of
                    Mertvy Kultuk, on the other hand, is formed by a chain of low calcareous hills,
                    constituting the rampart of the plateau of Ust Urt or Turkoman Isthmus, which
                    divides the Caspian from the Sea of Aral; and it is between head-lands of this
                    high plain that the long extension of this bay termed the Karasu (or Black
                    Water) runs inland, the town of Novo Alexandrovsk being situated near its
                    entrance.</p>
                <p>The northern basin of the Caspian may be considered to terminate on the west side
                    with the Bay of Kuma, and on the east with the hilly peninsula of Mangishlak, on
                    which the town of Novo Fetrovsk is situated. To the south of the line joining
                    these points, in the parallel of 44° 1 0' N. lat., the western shoreline is
                    higher, and the water deepens considerably,—thus forming the <hi rend="italic"
                    >middle</hi> basiu of the Caspian, which may be considered to extend as far
                    south as Cape Apsheron, the south-eastern termination of the great Caucasian
                    range. This middle basin receives the large river Terek, which discharges itself
                    by several mouths (some of them entering the Bay of Kuma) through an alluvial
                    delta; and several smaller streams flow into it from the slopes of the Caucasian
                    mountains through the low plain which intervenes between their base and the
                    border of the Caspian. Near the most considerable of these, the Kabir Yalama, a
                    rocky spur of the Caucasus comes down nearly to the sea; and a narrow pass is
                    thus formed, which has been fortified from very ancient times, being formerly
                    known as the <hi rend="italic">Albanioe</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caspioe</hi><hi rend="italic">Pylae,</hi> and now as the Pass of Derbend, this
                    being a small town built on the declivity in which the range terminates. The
                    eastern shore of this portion of the Caspian is formed by the plateau of Ust
                    Urt, or “high plain,” a very remarkable plateau from 550 to 727 feet above the
                    level of the Caspian, which extends from its eastern shore to the sea of Aral,
                    rising abruptly from I oth seas, and ranging about 400 miles in the north and
                    south direction; its north and south borders are formed by a precipitous face or
                    cliff, which has much the appearance of an ancient sea-margin. As it is composed
                    of later Tertiary strata, its elevation must have occurred at a time not
                    geologically remote. The headlands of the Ust Urt form an abrupt coast-line
                    along the northern part of the eastern border of the middle basin, with
                    occasional bays into which several small streams from the plateau discharge
                    themselves. Further south, however, the plateau recedes, and the land shelves
                    off more gradually; and here an extensive but shallow basin presents itself (of
                    which more will presently be said) almost entirely cut off from that of the
                    Caspian, termed the Karaboghaz, or Black Gulf. To the south of this the
                    coast-line rises again; and a peninsula is formed by an extension of the Balkan
                    Mountains, which may be considered as forming the southern termination of the
                    middle basin. Except along the shore-lines, the depth of this basin everywhere
                    excedes that of the northern,—being greatest in its middle portion, where over a
                    small area it reaches 400 fathoms, whilst it shallows again towards the south,
                    where there is a sort of ridge between Cape Apsheron and the Balkan peninsula,
                    at the average depth of 30 fathoms, that separates it from the southern
                    basin.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">southern</hi> basin ranges from the Balkan Peninsula on the
                    east and Cape Apsheron on the west to the shore-line formed by the base of the
                    great Elburz range of mountains, which curves round its low and swampy border,
                    from the mouth of the Kur to Astrabad, at an average distance of about 40 miles,
                    rising in the peak of Sawalan near Tabreez to 15,800 feet, and in the
                    snow-capped summit of Demavend, on whose southern slope Teheran is situated, to
                    18,G00 feet. These mountains are composed of granite and porphyry, and are
                    covered with recent volcanic deposits. South of Cape Apsheron, this basiu
                    receives the large river Kur, which drains the southern slopes of the Caucasian
                    range; and this is joined, at no great distance from its mouth, by another large
                    river, the Aras or Arax (the ancient <hi rend="italic">Araxes),</hi> which forms
                    the boundary between Russian Trans-Caucasia and Persia. The joint channel
                    discharges its water by several mouths, part of them opening into the Gulf of
                    Kizil-Agatch, which is the most considerable extension of the southern basin.
                    From the mouths of the Kur to the Gulf of Enzeli, which resembles the Karaboghaz
                    on a smaller scale, there is no considerable stream; but not far to the east of
                    the town of Reshd of which Enzeli is the port, the Sefid or White River
                    discharges itself, this being formed by the confluence of the Kizil-Uzen with
                    another considerable river, the two together draining a large portion of the
                    slopes of the western division of the Elburz range, and of its extension towards
                    the Caucasus. The southern border of the Caspian, between the mouth of the Sefid
                    and Astrabad, receives numerous small streams from the northern slopes of the
                    Elburz, but no considerable river; the Bay of Astrabad, however, receives at its
                    northern end the Attruk, a river of considerable importance, which drains an
                    extensive valley enclosed by the mountain ranges that form the southern border
                    of the desert plains of Khiva. On the eastern coast, opposite to the Gulf of
                    Kizil-Agatch, are the Balkan Bay and the Adji-Bojur Bay, which lie between
                    extensions of the Balkan Mountains. One or both of these bays, it may now be
                    pretty confidently stated, formerly received the mouths of the ancient <hi
                    rend="italic">0xus</hi> (now Amou-Daria), when it discharged itself into the
                    Caspian, instead of into the Sea of Aral; and there is further reason to believe
                    that a communication here at one time existed between the Caspian and the Sea of
                    Aral, through a furrow which lies along the southern border of the Ust Urt, and
                    which terminates in what was formerly known as the Gulf of Aboughir, a southern
                    extension of Lake Aral now dried up. The depth of the southern basin of the
                    Caspian is for the most part considerable, ranging in its central portion
                    between 300 and 500 fathoms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Drainage Area.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The drainage-area
                    of the Caspian is much more extensive on the north and west than on the east and
                    south. The Volga is estimated to drain an area of 527,500 square miles, and the
                    Ural an area of 85,000 square miles,—these two rivers together probably bringing
                    down more water than the Danube and the Don pour into the Black Sea. When to
                    these we add the Kuma, the Terek, the Arax and Kur, the Sefid, and the Attruk,
                    it is obvious that the total amount of river water annually discharged into the
                    basin of the Caspian must be almost, if not quite, the equal of that which is
                    discharged into the basin of the Black Sea. Yet the whole amount of fresh water
                    returned by rain and rivers to the basin of the Caspian is only sufficient to
                    compensate for the loss by evaporation from its surface,—as is shown by the fact
                    that its present level remains constant, or, if it changes at all, rather sinks
                    than rises. Now that the level of the Caspian was formerly about the same as
                    that of the Black Sea, although at present 84 feet below it, is shown by the
                    erosion of the rocks that formed the original sea-shore of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n189/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0189-0178"/> the southern basin, which, at the height of from
                    65 to 80 feet above the present level, have been furrowed out into tooth-shaped
                    points and needles; and if the water were again to rise to that level, it would
                    overflow many hundred thousand square miles of the southern steppes, extending
                    the area of the basin as far as Saratov. Now supposing the Caspian to have been
                    formerly in communication with the general oceanic area (which will be hereafter
                    shown to be almost a certainty), a reduction of its level and a contraction of
                    its area would follow as a necessary consequence, whenever that communication
                    was cut off. For, as the evaporation-area would have then been much greater than
                    it is at present, whilst the drainage-area would have been the same, there must
                    have been a great excess of loss by evaporation over the water returned by rain
                    and rivera; and this excess, producing a reduction of level, would have reduced
                    the area of the northern shallow portion, until it contracted itself within its
                    present limits. That this reduction was rapid, is indicated by two sets of
                    facts;—first, the absence of any erosion of rocks between the level of the old
                    erosion and the present level; and second, the fan-like arrangement of the <hi
                    rend="italic">limans</hi> and intervening <hi rend="italic">bugors</hi> on the
                    north-west shore, which makes it difficult to suppose that these channels can
                    have been formed except by the furrowing of the soft soil during the sinking of
                    the water, corresponding to that which is seen on a small scale on the muddy
                    banks of a reservoir in which the water is being rapidly lowered by the opening
                    of a sluice-gate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Salinity of the Water of the Caspian.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> It might have been anticipated that such a reduction in the volume of
                    the Caspian water as must have taken place in this lowering of' its level, would
                    have shown itself (as in the Dead Sea) in an increase of its salinity; whereas
                    the fact is that the proportion of salt in the water of the Caspian, though
                    varying in different parts of the basin, and also at different seasons, is
                    generally much less than the proportion in oceanic and even in Black Sea
                    water.</p>
                <p>In the northern portion, whose shallowness causes the enormous amount of fresh
                    water brought down by the Volga, the Ural, and the Terek to exert the greatest
                    diluting influence, the salinity is so slight (especially when the ordinary
                    volume of these rivers is augmented by the melting of the snows) that the water
                    is drinkable, its specific gravity not being higher than 1O016. In the central
                    and southern basins, on the other hand, which contain a body of salt water too
                    large to be thus affected, the salinity is stated by Von Baer to be about
                    one-third that of ordinary sea-water, the average sp. gr. being about 1009. This
                    reduction from what may be presumed to have been its original amount seems fully
                    explained by Von Baer, who traces it to the number of shallow lagoons with which
                    the basin is surrounded, every one of them being a sort of natural salt-pan for
                    the evaporation of the water and the deposit of its saline matter in the solid
                    form. The process may be well studied in the neighbourhood of Novo Petrovsk,
                    where what was formerly a bay is now divided into a large number of basins
                    presenting every degree of saline concentration. One of these still occasionally
                    receives water from the sea, and has deposited on its banks only a thin layer of
                    salt; a second, likewise full of water, has its bottom covered by a thick crust
                    of rose-coloured crystals like a pavement of marble; a third exhibits a compact
                    mass of salt, on which are pools of water whose surface is more than a yard
                    below the level of the sea; and a fourth has lost all its water by evaporation,
                    the stratum of salt left behind being now covered with sand. A similar
                    concentration is taking place in the Karasu; for notwithstanding the proximity
                    of the mouths of the Ural and Volga, the proportion of salt there rises to such
                    a degree (the sp. gr. being 1O57) that animal life is almost, if not entirely,
                    suppressed. In the Peninsula of Apsheron, again, there are ten salt lakes, from
                    one of which 10,000 tons of salt are annually obtained.</p>
                <p>This process of elimination goes on, however, upon its greatest scale in the
                    Karaboghaz, whose nearly circular shallow basin, about 90 miles across, is
                    almost entirely cut off from the Caspian by a long narrow spit of land,
                    communicating with it by a channel which is not more than about 150 yards broad
                    and 5 feet deep. Through this channel a current is stated by Von Baer to be
                    continually running inwards (during the summer months, at least) at an average
                    rate of three miles per hour; this rate being accelerated by westerly and
                    retarded by easterly winds, but never flowing at less than a mile and a half per
                    hour. The navigators of the Caspian, and the Turkoman nomads who wander on its
                    shores, struck with the constant and unswerving course of this current, have
                    supposed that its waters pass down into a subterranean abyss, through which they
                    reach either the Persian Gulf or the Black Sea,— an hypothesis for which there
                    is not the least foundation, and which is directly negatived by comparison of
                    levels. The current is really due to the indraught produced by the excess of
                    evaporation from the surface of the basin, which is exposed to every wind and to
                    intense summer heat, and which receives very little return from streams. The
                    small depth of the bar seems to prevent the return of a counter-current of
                    highly saline water, such as, in the Strait of Gibraltar, keeps down the
                    salinity of the Mediterranean (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mediterranean),</hi>
                    none such having been detected by the careful investigations of Von Baer. And
                    thus there is a progressively increasing concentration of the contents of the
                    basin of the Karaboghaz, so that seals which used to frequent it are no longer
                    found there, and its borders are entirely destitute of vegetation. Layers of
                    salt are being deposited on the mud at the bottom; and the sounding-line, when
                    scarcely out of the water, is covered with saline crystals. Taking the lowest
                    estimates of the salinity of the Caspian water, of the width and depth of the
                    channel, and of the speed of the current, Von Baer has shown that the Karaboghaz
                    daily withdraws from the Caspian the enormous quantity of 350,090 tons of
                    salt.</p>
                <p>Now, if such an elevation of the bar were to take place as should cut off the
                    basin of the Karaboghaz from that of the Caspian, the former would quickly
                    diminish in extent, and the concentration of its waters would cause an increased
                    deposit of salt to take place on its bottom. According to the proportion between
                    the evaporation from the area so reduced and the return of fresh water by rain
                    and streams, the Karaboghaz would either be converted into a shallow lake of
                    extremely salt water, or into a salt marsh, or might altogether dry up and
                    disappear, leaving behind it a thick bed of “rock-salt” resembling the deposits
                    contained in the Saliferous strata of various geological periods. These several
                    conditions all obtain at the present time in different parts of the great area
                    of the steppes of Southern Russia. There are several small salt lakes which
                    receive water enough from rain, snow, and streams to compensate for the loss
                    they sustain by evaporation; these especially occur in the Kirghiz steppes,
                    which lie to the north-east of Astrakhan, between the Volga and the Mongodjar
                    Hills that form the southern extremity of the Ural range; the most notable of
                    them being Lake Elton, which lies about 200 miles to the north of the present
                    border of the Caspian, and from which large quantities of salt are annually
                    procured. There are large tracts of these steppes, again, which are alternately
                    muddy and white with salt, according as they are moistened by rain or dried up
                    by the heat of the sun; one of these, lying between Lake Elton and the River
                    Ural, occupies a <pb break="no"

                    level of the Caspian, and more than 160 feet below that of the Black Sea.
                    Everywhere the sand of these steppes contains an admixture of salt; and there
                    are various local accumulations of salt, often associated with marl, having
                    shells and fish-bones imbedded in them, and thus clearly marking the sites of
                    lakes which survived for a time the reduction of level and recession of the
                    northern border of the Caspian, but which are now entirely dried up.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate of the Caspian.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    temperature of the Caspian area is remarkable for its wide range, both
                    geographical and seasonal,—the difference between the mean winter temperatures
                    of its northern and southern extremities being very great, whilst over its whole
                    extent a high summer temperature prevails. The January isotherm of 15° skirts
                    its northern border; that of 20° crosses it at the line of division between its
                    northern and middle basins; that of 30° crosses it between its middle and its
                    southern portions; and that of 40° skirts its southern border. Thus between the
                    mean winter temperatures of the northern and southern extremities of the Caspian
                    there is a <hi rend="italic">geographical range</hi> of 25°. These means,
                    however, do not indicate the extremely low temperatures which prevail over the
                    whole region of the steppes during the prevalence of north-east winds; the
                    thermometer then sinking to — 20°, or even lower, on the level areas, whilst on
                    the elevated plateau of Ust Urt a temperature of - 30° is nothing
                    remarkable.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was here

                    again, crosses the middle basin of the Caspian, nearly coinciding with the
                    January isotherm of 25°; and that of 80° skirts the southern border of the sea,
                    nearly coinciding with the January isotherm of 40°; so that the <hi
                    rend="italic">mean annual range</hi> is 50° over the northern portion of the
                    basin, and 40° at its southern extremity. These summer means give no truer
                    indication than the winter means of the extremes of temperature occasionally
                    reached; thus Major Wood saw the thermometer mark 110° in the shade on the bank
                    of the Oxus, recalling to his recollection the intense heat of Annesly Bay in
                    the Abyssinian expedition.</p>
                <p>The shallow northern basin of the Caspian is frozen during the entire winter, and
                    the ice sometimes extends to the middle basin; the deep southern basin on the
                    other hand, is never frozen over.</p>
                <p>The prevalent winds of the Caspian are the south-east, which usually blow between
                    October and March, and the north or north-west, which are common between July
                    and September. They sometimes continue with great violence for days together,
                    rendering navigation dangerous, and inundating the shores, wherever these are
                    low and flat, against which they blow. The same cause tends to disturb the
                    general level of the water, which is raised or lowered by from 4 to 8 feet at
                    the north or the south end of the basin, according to the direction of the wind;
                    and when this changes suddenly, as it often does, strong currents are generated.
                    There are no perceptible tides in the Caspian; and the changes of level
                    occasionally observed without any wind to account for them seem attributable on
                    the one hand to inequality between the evaporation and the return of water by
                    rain and riveκs, and on the other to differences in atmospheric pressure between
                    one part of the area and another, such as alter the level of the Baltic (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Baltic).</hi> It was stated by Colonel Monteith <hi
                    rend="italic">(Royal Geographical Journal,</hi> vol. iii.), that during his
                    residence in that part of Asia from 1811 to 1828, the Caspian, “as well as every
                    other lake in Persia, had sensibly decreased in depth;” but according to the
                    information given him by the inhabitants of Enzeli, there is a rise and fall of
                    several feet in periods of thirty years; and Von Baer, by whom the question was
                    carefully examined, could not obtain an evidence that any continuous reduction
                    of level is at present in progress. There is indeed reason to believe that the
                    level of the Caspian was once much <hi rend="italic">lower</hi> than it is at
                    present; for at Derbend, whose foundation is assigned to Alexander, masonry has
                    been ascertained to exist at a depth of 50 feet below the present surface level;
                    and as it is recorded that the Khorasmians made an offer to Alexander to conduct
                    his army to Colchis, it would seem as if the ridge at the southern end of what
                    is now the middle basin could then have been crossed dry-shod. This does not
                    appear very improbable, if, as ancient geographers and historians explicitly
                    state, the Volga flowed in their time, not into the Caspian, but into the Sea of
                    Azoff,—a condition which seems to have persisted as late as the 5th century. The
                    channel of its lower part would then have been that of the present River Don,
                    which at one part approaches so closely to that of the Volga, that the two are
                    united by a canal of less than 50 miles’ length.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fauna of the Caspian.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The animal
                    life of this inland sea presents a remarkable admixture of marine and freshwater
                    types. The presence of seals and herrings seems an unmistakable indication of
                    its former communication with the ocean,—and this rather northwards with the
                    Polar Sea than westwards through the Black Sea and Mediterranean. Again, the
                    Caspian abounds in salmon, a fish that may be considered essentially marine,
                    though resorting to rivers to breed. And among its most notable and valuable
                    inhabitants are four species of <hi rend="italic">Sturicnidae·—</hi> the
                    sturgeon, the sterlet, the sevriouga, and the beluga—which are essentially
                    estuary fish, ascending rivers from their mouths. The fisheries are extremely
                    valuable,—a very large amount of fish being salted for transmission to distant
                    parts, while the Sturionidae afford the principal supply of caviare (prepared
                    from their roe) and of isinglass (their swim-bladders cut into strips) for the
                    whole world. The Molluscan fauna is not by any means proportionally numerous or
                    varied. It principally consists of these widespread marine forms which are able
                    to adapt themselves to a variety of conditions, and especially to a reduction in
                    the salinity of the waters they inhabit, which (as in the parallel case of the
                    Baltic) tends to dwarf the races of mollusks subjected to it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Naphtha and Petroleum Springs.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    Various parts of the shore of the Caspian abound in naphtha and petroleum. This
                    is especially the case with the Peninsula of Apsheron, and with the Island of
                    Tchilehon or Naphthalia, which lies near the opposite coast, off the Bay of
                    Balkan. The whole soil of Apsheron is said to be saturated with naphtha, which
                    rises wherever a hole is bored; and round the town of Baku there are nearly a
                    hundred bituminous springs, from many of which considerable supplies of naphtha
                    are drawn. Some of these are constantly burning; and one of them, termed the
                    “burning field,” was formerly a celebrated “shrine of grace” to the Ghebers or
                    Parsees, multitudes of pilgrims resorting to it, as Mahometans do to Mecca.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Former Extent of the Caspian.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> From
                    what has been stated, there can be no reasonable doubt (1) that the area of the
                    Caspian must have formerly been much more extensive than at present, and (2)
                    that it must at some time have had free communication with the ocean. It was
                    long since pointed out by Pallas that the presence of salt lakes, dry saline
                    deposits, and sea shells of the same species as those now inhabiting the
                    Caspian, over a very large extent of the steppes to the east, north, and west of
                    the present basin, can only be accounted for on such an hypothesis; and he
                    traced out what may probably be regarded as a northern shore-line, along the
                    base of the Mongodjar hills. Further, the fauna of the Caspian corresponds so
                    remarkably with that of the Black Sea on the one side, and with <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n191/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0191-0180"/> that of the Sea of Aral on the other, that it can
                    scarcely be doubted they were formerly in free communication with one other; and
                    the lines of this communication can be pretty certainly traced out by the
                    peculiar lowness of the levels. Thus between the Caspian and the Black Sea, or
                    rather the Sea of Azoff, it would have lain across the low-lying portion of the
                    steppe, which is at present a receptacle for the drainage of the surrounding
                    area, forming the long and shallow Lake Manytsch. And between the Caspian and
                    the Aral Sea it probably followed both the northern and the southern borders of
                    the Ust Urt, which would have thus formed an insulated platform. If the
                    elevation of level were sufficiently great to raise the water in Lake Aral to
                    the height which it had in former times (as is shown by various clearly
                    discernible landmarks), it would have overflowed a large area to the south also;
                    and of this again, some parts of the coast-line are traceable. A very slight
                    further elevation would bring it into communication with the Arctic Sea.</p>
                <p>There is much to support this view, not only in the writings of ancient
                    geographers and in the incidental notices which have been gleaned from the
                    records of early travel, but also in the physical relations of the three basins
                    now forming separate seas. For if the outlet of the Bosphorus were closed, the
                    progressive accumulation of the excess of fresh water which at present escapes
                    from the Black Sea by that channel (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Black Sea),</hi>
                    would in no long time cause an overflow into the basin of the Caspian; since,
                    although the Black Sea proper is separated from the southern portion of the
                    Caspian by the mountainous region of the Caucasus, yet between the Sea of Azoff
                    and the northern portion of the Caspian there is only the low steppe inhabited
                    by the Don Cossacks and the Kalmucks; and, according to Major Wood, an elevation
                    of the Black Sea to no more than 23 feet above its present level would cause it
                    to overflow into the basin of the Caspian by the line of the Manytsch. The
                    continuance of such an overflow would in time raise the Caspian to the same
                    level, and would thus produce (as already shown) an immense extension of its
                    area. For although that area would be prevented by the interposition of the Ust
                    Urt from directly spreading towards the Sea of Aral, yet a continued rise of the
                    Caspian would enable its water to find its way along the north and south of that
                    plateau, so as to extend itself over a large part of the Aralo-Caspian
                    depression, including what is now the isolated Sea of Aral, and completely
                    surrounding the Ust Urt, which would rise as an island in the midst of it. A
                    rise of 158 feet above the sea would bring it up to the level of the Sea of
                    Aral; and it is considered by Major Wood that a further rise of about G2 feet,
                    making 220 feet in all, of which there is distinct evidence in horizontal
                    water-marks, would cause this Asiatic Mediterranean to overflow its northern
                    boundary into the watershed of the Tobol, one of the tributaries of the Obi,
                    through which its water would be discharged into Polar Sea. And it is a fact of
                    no little interest, that the existence of such a communication between the Ai ’
                    alo-Caspian basin and the Northern Ocean was most distinctly affirmed by Strabo
                    and other ancient geographers.</p>
                <p>Now, as there is strong reason to suspect, from the evidence of recent volcanic
                    change in that locality, that the opening of the Bosphorus took place within a
                    period which, geologically speaking, was very recent, it does not seem at all
                    improbable that this event (which some writers identify with the deluge of
                    Deucalion) was the commencement of a series of changes, by which the “Asiatic
                    Mediterranean” came to be divided into the three separate basins which now
                    constitute its “survivals.” Supposing, then, the level and extent of this great
                    inland sea to have been formerly such as just described, the effect of the
                    opening of the Bosphorus would of course be to lower its surface and to contract
                    its area. So long as the Caspian retained its communication with the Black Sea,
                    it would remain at the general oceanic level,—the excess of the river drainage
                    into the western basin (including that of the Volga) supplying what was
                    deficient in the eastern. But if, by a slight elevation of the intervening
                    isthmus, this communication were cut off, the excess of evaporation over the
                    Caspian area (which would have been previously separated from the Aral Sea)
                    would have reduced its level all the more rapidly, when the Volga, which now
                    furnishes its principal supply, was not one of its affluents; and we can thus
                    account for that depression of its surface much below its present level, which
                    seems to have existed in the time of Alexander. By the subsequent deflection of
                    the lower part of the Volga from the Sea of Azoff into the basin of the Caspian,
                    the level of the latter would have been raised again, and its area extended,
                    until that equality came to be established between the evaporation-loss and the
                    riversupply which obtains at the present time.</p>
                <p>The changes produced in the eastern portion of the “Asiatic Mediterranean” by the
                    opening of the Bosphorus would have been yet more considerable. In consequence
                    of the greater elevation of the Aralian area, a comparatively slight reduction
                    of level would have served to lay dry a large proportion of it, and to cut off
                    all communication with the Caspian except by a narrow outlet; and the
                    maintenance of the level in what thenceforth existed as an isolated basin would
                    depend upon the relation between its evaporation aud its river-supply. This
                    supply is mainly derived from two principal rivers :—the Syr Darya (the ancient
                    <hi rend="italic">Jaxartes),</hi> which takes its rise in the high valleys to
                    the east of Kokand, flows through that khanate in a westerly direction, and now,
                    after passing Khojend, turns suddenly northwards, and then to the north-west,
                    and finally discharges itself into the Sea of Aral near its northern extremity;
                    and the Amou Darya (the ancient <hi rend="italic">Cxus),</hi> which rises in the
                    plateau of Pamir and the high valleys of the Hindu Kush— its sources being in
                    close proximity to those of the Indus,— and then, rapidly descending into the
                    great Turcoman Plain, at present continues onwards in a north-west direction to
                    Khiva, after passing which it flows into the southern end of the Aral Sea. A
                    large proportion of the water of both these rivers, however, is withdrawn from
                    them in the latter part of their course,—partly by percolation through the sandy
                    soil (there being no defined river-beds), and partly through the extensive
                    irrigation by which the dwellers along their course render productive the
                    otherwise barren land. The supply which they bring to the existing Aral Sea does
                    not suffice to keep it up to its present level, as is proved by recent exact
                    observation; and it is clear, therefore, that even the whole body of water they
                    bring down could not have maintained the level of the far larger area over which
                    it must have originally spread, and that this must consequently have been
                    rapidly reduced. Now there is very distinct evidence, both historical and
                    physical, that the Oxus, within a comparatively recent period, flowed westwards
                    across the desert of Khwarezm, near the parallel of 39° N., and discharged
                    itself into the Caspian basin through the Balkan Bay. And there is also much
                    reason to believe that the Syr Darya also, or a considerable part of it, once
                    flowed westwards where it now takes its northerly bend, crossed the desert of
                    Kizzel Koom, and finding its way into the Uzboy furrow which skirts the southern
                    border of the Ust Urt, poured its water into the Caspian. Thus the area now
                    occupied by the Aral Sea, deprived of its two main affluents, must either have
                    entirely dried up, or have been reduced to a salt marsh, until a change in their
                    course filled its basin to somewhat above its present level.</p>

                <p>Thus it would appear that the condition of the Aralo-Caspian area must have
                    undergone very considerable alterations within the historic period; and it is
                    maintained by Major Wood <hi rend="italic">(The Shores of Lake Aral,</hi> 1876)
                    —who has recently investigated the whole subject both physically and
                    historically,—that these alterations may have taken place without any such
                    geological disturbances as some physical geographers have supposed necessary.
                    Some of these changes, he argues, may be fairly attributed to human agency,
                    which can be shown to have exerted a considerable influence, not only on the
                    amount of water carried along by the two great rivers of the Aralian area, but
                    even, it is probable, on their course.</p>
                <p>But the hypothesis of an Asiatic Mediterranean will not of itself account for the
                    facts which indicate that its basin was formerly in free communication with the
                    general oceanic area. For as the water of this great inland sea must have risen
                    to 220 feet above its present level, to have escaped across the ridge that
                    formed its northern boundary, into the watershed of the Obi, only an outward or
                    overflow current could have passed that ridge, and no sea-water could have
                    entered the basin from the outside. Hence the saltness, not only of the water of
                    the Caspian and Aral seas, but of that of the numerous lakes still remaining in
                    the most depressed spots formerly covered by the Asiatic Mediterranean, together
                    with the large admixture of salt in the sand that covers what is now its
                    dried-up bed, can only be accounted for on the supposition that this Asiatic
                    Mediterranean was itself a “survival” of an extension of the oceanic area
                    properly so called,— retaining not only much of its salinity, but a portion of
                    its characteristic fauna. And this conclusion derives confirmation from the fact
                    (ascertained by the researches of the Russian naturalist, Bυgdanoff) that the
                    polar fauna may be traced through the succession of salt lakes lying to the
                    north of the Aral Sea, and that its proportion increases as we approach the
                    Polar Ocean. Now it is certain that the whole of this area was submerged during
                    the Cretaceous period,—what is now the North Atlantic Ocean having then extended
                    (with little interruption of its continuity) from the American continent to
                    Siberia. The general rise of the Asiatic and European part of its sea-bed, which
                    took place at the end of the Secondary period, may not improbably have cut off
                    the Asiatic Mediterranean, enclosing it within the limits already pointed out,
                    and at the same time elevating it above the general level of the sea. Under
                    these conditions it would have for some time retained much of its original
                    saltness; and this seems the explanation of the fact that the marine shells
                    which are now scattered over the ancient sea-bed, and are occasionally found
                    accumulated in masses, are much larger than the shells of the same species now
                    inhabiting the weakly-saline Caspian. If the river-drainage into this area were
                    more than sufficient to equalize its loss by evaporation, it may have remained
                    without any essential alteration of its conditions, until the opening of the
                    Bosphorus initiated a new succession of changes, which in the case of the Aral
                    Sea appear to be still in progress. In this later succession, such alterations
                    in the courses of the two great rivers of the Aralian area as are distinctly
                    indicated by historical as well as physical evidence must have exerted a very
                    important influence; and a due appreciation of the results of these alterations
                    seems (as already shown) to afford the clue to the differences in the accounts
                    that have been given of the Aral Sea within the historic period.</p>
