                <p><label type="entry">CHESS</label>, simply defined, is an intellectual pastime. It
                    recreates not so much by way of amusement properly so termed, as by taking
                    possession of the mental faculties and diverting them from their accustomed
                    grooves. The cerebral organ, after being much occupied in business, or greatly
                    worried by cares, or in any way beset by painful reflections, finds in the
                    absorbing and abstracting properties of chess that temporary relief which
                    lighter pastimes will not always afford. The reason of this is not far to seek.
                    Cares are caused by looking forward to or apprehending things to come, and, as
                    such, are neutralized by that foresight which the conduct of a game of chess
                    demands. Again, mental perturbations, however much varied, can but be the
                    employment of the imagining and reasoning faculties in the digestion of the
                    particular cause of annoyance or pain; but these same faculties are required,
                    and their exclusive exercise demanded, in providing for the emergencies of the
                    intellectual combat, and in solving the ever varying problems that arise in the
                    course thereof. It is very commonly supposed that chess is a difficult game,
                    whether to acquire or practise. This, however, is a mistake. The moves may be
                    learned in half an hour, and a week’s practice will evoke a sufficient amount of
                    skill to afford pleasure both to the learner and his tutor. The intelligent
                    novice will soon be convinced that an ignorant manipulation of the pieces does
                    not conduce to success, and he will seek for instruction in the right manner of
                    opening the game; the various débuts are after all simple, and he will find no
                    difficulty in acquiring them one after the other. Six months will suffice for
                    this purpose if his understanding be not enslaved by obstinacy, indolence, or
                    self-esteem, and the rest goes with his natural capacity. A merely average
                    intelligence is sufficient for a very fair amount of proficiency and strength:
                    while intellect not much above the common mean will suffice (assuming here
                    natural aptitude) to lead right up to the second class of players, viz., those
                    to whom the masters of the game can only concede the small odds of “pawn and
                    move.” Those wishing to improve will find it very beneficial to play upon even
                    terms with players stronger than themselves; for a persistence in taking odds,
                    besides having a discouraging and debilitating effect upon the weaker player,
                    takes the game out of its proper grooves, and tends to produce positions not
                    naturally arising in the ordinary course of the game as developed from the
                    recognized openings. In fact, the reception of odds incapacitates a player from
                    acquiring an insight into the principles of the science of chess, and from
                    comprehending the latent meanings and conceptions upon which combinations and a
                    proper plan of warfare are founded; while, upon the contrary, playing on even
                    terms throws the combatant at once upon his own judgment, and by causing him to
                    study his opponent’s play, leads necessarily to a material improvement in his
                    own style.</p>
                <p>To turn now to the elements of the game. The accompanying diagrams represent
                    chess boards, and it will be perceived that they respectively consist of
                    sixty-four checkered squares</p>
                <p>In diagram 1 the chessmen are arranged as they should be at the commencement of
                    the battle, while diagram 2 shows the denomination of the squares according to
                    the English and German systems of notation, to be explained hereafter. Under
                    diagram 1 are the names of the various “^Pieces,” for so the superior officers
                    are termed—each side, white and black, having a king, a queen, two rooks, two
                    knights, and two bishops. The eight common men in front are called Pawns.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moves of the different Chessmen.</hi> —Briefly described,
                    the powers of the various pieces and of the pawns are as follows.</p>
                <p>The king may move in any direction—forward, back ward, laterally, or diagonally;
                    but he can move only one square at a time. Under certain conditions he has once
                    in the game a peculiar privilege called castling, which will be explained
                    further on.</p>
                <p>The queen moves in any straight or diagonal direction, whether forward, backward,
                    or laterally. There is no limit to her range, except when her progress is
                    stopped by any piece or pawn. She is the most powerful piece on the board, for
                    her action is a union of those of the rook and bishop. At the commencement of
                    the game the queen always stands upon a square of her own colour.</p>
                <p>The rooks move in straight lines—forward, backward, or laterally; they cannot
                    move diagonally. Their range is, like the queen’s, unlimited.</p>
                <p>The bishops move diagonally in any direction whether backward or forward. They
                    have an unlimited range, with the same exception as before. It is evident that
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n604/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0604-0593"/> bishops standing originally on differently
                    coloured squares can never meet.</p>
                <p>The knights have a mode of moving which it is not easy to describe. Their range
                    is not unlimited, like that of the pieces just noticed, but is restricted in a
                    particular way. They move from one corner of any rectangle of three squares by
                    two to the opposite corner; thus, in diagram 3, the white knight can move to the
                    square occupied by the black one and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> To
                    illustrate the move further, suppose that in diagram 2 a knight stands on the
                    square marked K4 counting from the white side of the board; that knight can move
                    to any of the following squares, viz., to K B 2, Q 2, K Kt 3, Q B 3, K Kt 5, Q B
                    5, K B 6, and Q 6. The squares which the knight appears to pass over in moving
                    may be occupied by other pieces, but his move has no thing whatever to do with
                    those intervening squares. A knight may thus vault over any piece or pawn,
                    whether adverse or friendly; the knights are the only pieces which possess this
                    privilege. It will be perceived that the <hi rend="italic">locus</hi> of the
                    knight, unlike that of the bishop, changes colour at every move.</p>
                <p>The king, queen, rooks, and bishops may capture any foeman which stands anywhere
                    within their respective ranges; and the knights can capture the adverse men
                    which stand upon the squares to which they can leap. A capture is effected by
                    the piece which takes occupying the square of the piece which is taken, the
                    latter being then removed from the board. The king cannot capture any man which
                    is protected by another man.</p>
                <p>The motions aud capturing powers of the pawns are as follows: —Each pawn for his
                    first move may advance either one or two squares straight forward, but
                    afterwards one square only, and this whether upon starting he exercised his
                    privilege of moving two squares or not. A pawn can never move backwards. He can
                    only capture diagonally,—that is to say, if any adverse piece or pawn stand upon
                    the first diagonal square, either to right or left, such adverse piece or pawn
                    can be captured and removed from the board, the captor taking its place, but a
                    pawn cannot take any man standing directly in front of it. In other words, a
                    pawn moves straight forward except when he captures, in which case he moves
                    diagonally, and for capturing purposes he can only, even for his first move,
                    advance one square. When a pawn arrives at an eighth square, viz., at the
                    extreme limit of the board, he may be promoted, that is to say, he may, at the
                    option of his owner, become a queen, rook, bishop, or knight; and it matters not
                    how many queens or other pieces a player may have on the board at one time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Check and Checkmate.</hi> —The king can never be captured,
                    but when any piece or pawn attacks him, he is said to be “in check,” and the
                    fact of his being so attacked should be announced by the adverse player saying
                    “check,” whereupon the king must move from the square he occupies, or be
                    screened from the check by the interposition of one of his own men, or the
                    attacking piece must be captured. If, however, the king, being thus in check,
                    cannot move to another square without being still in check, and there is no
                    piece or pawn which can be interposed, and the checking piece or pawn cannot be
                    taken, then it is “checkmate,” whereupon the game terminates, the player whose
                    king has been thus checkmated being the loser. The position of the king when in
                    check being the same as that of any piece when exposed to be captured, with the
                    only difference that the king cannot be taken, it follows that the pawn gives
                    check just in the same way that he captures, viz., diagonally. One king cannot
                    give check to the other, nor can a king be moved into check.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stalemate.</hi> —When the king is not in check, but his
                    owner has no move left save such as would place the king in check, this is
                    “stalemate,” and the game is drawn.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Castling.</hi> —This is a peculiar move permitted to the
                    king once in the game; it is performed in combination with either the king’s
                    rook or the queen’s rook, and in either case by the king being moved two squares
                    laterally, while the rook is placed on the other side of him. But the king
                    cannot castle after having been moved, nor with a rook that has moved, nor when
                    any piece either white or black stands between him and the rook, nor if he is in
                    check, nor when he has to cross over a square commanded by an adverse piece or
                    pawn; the rook can, however, move from or cross over such a square. It will be
                    perceived that after castling with the king’s rook the latter will occupy the K
                    B square, while the king stands on the K Kt square, and if with the queen’s
                    rook, the latter will occupy the queen’s square while the king stands on the Q B
                    square. This move will easily be understood with the aid of diagram 2.</p>

                        >Passant.</hi> —This is a privilege possessed by any of the pawns under the
                    following circumstances :—If a pawn, say of the white colour, stands upon a
                    fifth square, say upon K 5 counting from the white side, and a black pawn in the
                    supposed case moves to Q 4 or K B4 counting from the black side, the white pawn
                    can take the black pawn “en passant.” For the purposes of such capture the
                    latter is dealt with as though he had only moved to Q 3 or K B 3, and the white
                    pawn taking him diagonally then occupies the square the captured pawn would have
                    reached had he moved but one square.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Drawn Game.</hi> —This arises from a stalemate (noticed
                    above), or from either player not having sufficient force wherewith to effect
                    checkmate, as when there are only two kings left on the board, or king and
                    bishop against king, or king and one or even two knights against king. The same
                    consequence follows from either player being able to give perpetual check to the
                    adverse king. There are also cases in which one of the players can call upon the
                    other to give checkmate in fifty moves, the result of failure being that the
                    game is drawn. The right to make this requisition arises in various positions,
                    to explain all of which would take up much space; it is sufficient to say that
                    when, neither side has any pawns left on the board the player with the inferior
                    force may make the fifty moves call <hi rend="smallcaps">Other Chess Terms.</hi>
                    —A “minor piece” means either a knight or bishop. “Gaining the exchange”
                    signifies giving a minor piece in exchange for a rook. A “passed pawn” is one
                    that has no adverse pawn either in front or on either of the adjoining files. It
                    may be as well to explain that a “file” is simply a line of squares extending
                    vertically from one end of the board to the other. There are therefore eight
                    files, and they are respectively named after the pieces which occupy the first
                    squares on either side, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the “king’s file,”
                    which extends from one king to the other, and so forth. An “open file” is one on
                    which no piece or pawn of either colour is standing. “Gambit” is a word derived
                    from the Italian <hi rend="italic">gambetto,</hi> a tripping up of the heels; it
                    is a term used to signify an opening in which a pawn is sacrificed to obtain an
                    attack. An “opening/’ or “début,” is a certain set method of commencing the
                    game; there are regular and irregular openings. A “check by discovery” is given
                    when a player, by moving one of his pieces, checks with another of them. “Double
                    check,” as its name implies, means attacking the king at once with two
                    pieces,—one of the pieces in this case giving check by discovery.</p>

                    pawn as the unit, the following will be an estimate near enough for practical
                    purposes :—pawn 1, bishop 3 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 25, knight 3 <hi

                    more often than not be advantageously exchanged for the queen. The knight is
                    generally stronger than the bishop in the end game, but two bishops are usually
                    stronger than two knights, more especially in open positions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Laws.</hi> —The laws of chess differ, although not very
                    materially, in different countries. Various steps have been taken, but as yet
                    without success, to secure the adoption of a universally authoritative code. In
                    competitions among English players the particular laws to be observed are
                    specially agreed on,—the regulations most generally adopted being those laid
                    down at length in Staunton’s <hi rend="italic">Chess Praxis,</hi> or the
                    modification of the <hi rend="italic">Praxis</hi> laws issued in the name of the
                    British Chess Association in 1862.</p>
                <p>The following rules may be here indicated. The board must be so placed that each
                    combatant has a white square in his right hand corner. A player touching any of
                    his own men or those of his adversary (except accidentally) without previously
                    saying <hi rend="italic superscript"> li</hi><hi rend="italic">j</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">adoube</hi>,” or “I
                    adjust,” or words to that effect, may be compelled to move or capture (as the
                    case may be) the man so touched; if this cannot be done he must move his king,
                    but if that be likewise impossible, there is then no penalty. If a player make a
                    false or illegal move or capture, he must, at the choice of his opponent, and
                    according to the case, move his own man legally, capture the man legally, or
                    move any other man legally movable. In practice, the usual demand is that the
                    offender shall move his king. After four moves have been made on each side, any
                    such illegality is waived, and the game must be played out as it stands. Should
                    the king be left in check, all the moves subsequently made must be retraced and
                    the check replied to.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Modes of Notation.</hi> —The English and German systems of
                    notation (i.e., the manner of describing the moves made in a game) are
                    different. According to the English method each player counts from his own side
                    of the board, and the moves are denoted according to the names of the files and
                    the numbers of the squares. Thus when a player for his first move advances the
                    king’s pawn two squares, it is described as follows :—“I P to K 4 ;” for the
                    pawn has moved to the fourth square of the king’s file. The following moves of
                    the Giuoco Piano Opening, with the aid of diagram 2, will enable the reader to
                    understand the principles of the British notation, wherein it may also be
                    observed that only the initials of the pieces are now used:—</p>

                <p>It is now usual to express the notation as concisely as possible; thus, the third
                    moves of White and Black would be given as 3 B to B 4, because it is clear that
                    only the fourth square of the queen’s bishop’s file is intended. In like manner
                    White’s fourth move would be described as 4 P to B 3, and Black’s fourth move as
                    4 Kt to B 3. Sometimes instead of the word “takes” a cross is used, thus—6 P ×
                    P.</p>
                <p>The German notation employs the alphabetical characters <hi rend="italic">a, b,
                        c, cl, e, f, g,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> proceeding from left to
                    right, and the numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, running upwards, these being
                    always calculated from the White side of the board (see diagram 2). Thus the
                    White Queen’s Rook’s square is al; the Black Queen’s Rook’s square, α8; the
                    White Queen’s square is c∏; the Black Queen’s square, c?8; the White King’s
                    square, el; the Black King’s square, e8, and so with the other pieces and
                    squares. The German names of the pieces are as follows :—King, <hi rend="italic"
                        >König;</hi> Queen, <hi rend="italic">Dame;</hi> Rook, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Thurm;</hi> Bishop, <hi rend="italic">Läufer;</hi> Knight, <hi
                        rend="italic">Springer;</hi> Pawn, <hi rend="italic">Bauer.</hi></p>
                <p>The initals only of the pieces are given, the pawns <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Bauern)</hi> being understood. The Germans use the following signs in
                    their notation, viz.:—for “check” (+); “checkmate <hi rend="italic">'</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">(i)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi> “takes” (:); “castles on King’s side” (0-0); “castles on Queen’s
                    side” (0-0-0); for “best move” a note of admiration (!); for “weak move” a note
                    of interrogation (î). The Giuoco Piano Opening moves just rendered in the
                    English will now be given in the German notation, which will make the latter
                    easily intelligible :—</p>

                <p>The game is about equal, though White has a somewhat freer position.</p>
                <p>The two following games are brilliant specimens of the style of those eminent
                    players, Herr Anderssen and Mr Paul Morphy. The manner in which White in the
                    first game forces the victory, though losing piece after piece, scarcely finds a
                    parallel in the records of chess strategy.</p>

                    been devoted by writers on chess to the examination of end-games, and many of
                    the particular combinations of forces that are apt to occur have been fuUy and
                    carefully analyzed. The study of and taste for problems have become very general
                    in the chess community, especially within the last twenty years; and to minister
                    to the growing public demand for such compositions is now an important function
                    of chess periodicals, and of the numerous serial publications that devote a
                    column to chess. The six problems given below <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> are

                    obscurity, a fact which has rather invited than repelled learned speculations on
                    the subject. The invention of the pastime has been variously ascribed to the
                    Greeks, Romans, Babylonians, Scythians, Egyptians, Jews, Persians, Chinese,
                    Hindus, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n608/mode/1up"

                    Welsh. Not content with upholding the claims of nations or races, some have
                    endeavoured to fix upon particular individuals as the originators of the game;
                    and, amongst others, the following have found supporters :—Japhet, Shem, King
                    Solomon, the wife of Ravan king of Ceylon, the philosopher Xerxes, the Grecian
                    prince Palamedes, Hermes, Aristotle, the brothers Lydo and Tyrrhene, Semiramis,

                    Hansing, the Brahman Sissa, and Shatrenscha, stated to be a celebrated Persian
                    astronomer. Many of these ascriptions are of course fabulous, others rest upon
                    little authority, and some of them proceed from easily traceable errors, so
                    where the Roman games of <hi rend="italic">Ludus Latrunculorum,</hi> and <hi

                    chess; whereas, so far as the Romans and Welsh are concerned, the contrary can
                    be proved, while from what little is known of the Irish game it appears not to
                    have been a sedentary game at all, but most likely an open-air recreation. The
                    claims of the Chinese were advocated in a letter addressed by Mr Eyles Irwin in
                    1793 to the Earl Charlemont. This paper was published in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy,</hi> and its purport was that
                    chess, called in the Chinese tongue <hi rend="italic">diovig-là,</hi> which,
                    according to Mr Irwin, means the “royal game,” was invented in the reign of Kao
                    Tsu, otherwise Lin Pang, then king, but afterwards emperor of Kiangnan, by a
                    mandarin named Hansing, who was in command of an army invading the Shensi

                        >chdke-choo-hong Id,</hi> literally, “the play of the science of war.” (See
                    also a paper published by the Hon. Daines Barrington in the 9th vol. of the <hi

                        rend="italic">Persian Chess</hi> (London, 1850), endeavours to prove that
                    the Persians were the inventors of chess, and he maintains that the game, after
                    being born in Persia, found a home in India, whence, after a series of ages, it
                    was brought back to its original birth-place. The view, however, which has been
                    most seriously put forward, and which has obtained the most credence, is that
                    which attributes the origin of chess to the Hindus. Dr Hyde of Oxford, writing
                    in 1694 <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Ludis Orientalibus),</hi>
                    seems to have been the first to propound this theory. He, however, laboured
                    under two somewhat serious disadvantages; he appears to have been ignorant of
                    the game itself, and the treasures of ancient Hindu knowledge. contained in
                    Sanskrit records were not accessible in his time. About 1783-89 Sir William
                    Jones took up the mantle of Hyde, and in an essay published in the 2d vol. of
                        <hi rend="italic">Asiatic Researches,</hi> argued that Hindustan was the
                    cradle of chess, the game having been known there from time immemorial by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">chaturanga,</hi> that is, the four “angas,” or members
                    of an army which are said in the <hi rend="italic">Amarakοsha</hi> to be
                    elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers. As applicable to real armies,
                    the term chaturanga is frequently used by the epic poets of India. Sir William
                    Jones was resident in Bengal, and was president of the Asiatic Society of that
                    province; he commenced the study of Sanskrit to assist him in his judicial
                    functions, and was the first who possessed real and profound knowledge of that
                    language; he was, besides, well acquainted with and fond of chess, so that
                    altogether he was more advantageously situated than Hyde for forming an opinion
                    upon the matter. His essay is substantially a translation of and a commentary
                    upon the <hi rend="italic">Bhawishya Parana,</hi> in which is given a
                    description of a four-handed game of chess played with dice. A pundit named
                    Rhadhakant informed him that this was mentioned in the oldest law books, as also
                    that it was invented by the wife of Ravan, king of Lanka (Ceylon), in the second
                    age of the world, in order to amuse that monarch while Rama was besieging his
                    metropolis. This account claims for chess an existence of 4000 or 5000 years.
                    Sir William, however, grounds his opinions as to the Hindu origin of chess upon
                    the testimony of the Persians, and not upon the above manuscript; while he
                    considers the game described therein to be more modern than the Persian game.
                    Though sure that the latter came from and was invented in India, he yet, with
                    commendable candour, admits that he could not find any account of it in the
                    classical writings of the Brahmans. He lays it down that chess under the
                    Sanskrit name chaturanga was exported from India into Persia in the 6th century
                    of our era; that by a natural corruption the old Persians changed the name into
                    chatrang, but their country was soon afterwards taken possession of by the
                    Arabs, who had neither the initial nor final letter of the word in their
                    alphabet, wherefore, they altered it farther into Shatranj, which name found its
                    way presently into the modern Persian, and ultimately into the dialects of
                    India.</p>
                <p>So far Sir William Jones; but Captain Hiram Cox, in a letter upon Burmese chess,
                    written in 1799, and published in the 7th vol. of <hi rend="italic">Asiatic
                        Researches,</hi> refers to the above essay, and considers the four-handed
                    game described in the above-mentioned Sanskrit manuscript to be the most ancient
                    form of chess.—the Burmese and Persian games coming successively second and
                    third in order of precedence. Later on, viz., in the 11th and 24th vols, of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Archoeologia.</hi> Mr Francis Douce and Sir Frederick
                    Madden expressed themselves in favour of the views held by Hyde and his
                    followers.</p>
                <p>This brings us to the issue of Professor Duncan Forbes’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >History of Chess,</hi> in 1860, in which Captain Cox’s views, as founded
                    upon Sir William Jones’s Sanskrit manuscript are upheld and developed into an
                    elaborate theory. Professor Forbes holds that the four-handed game of chaturanga
                    described in the <hi rend="italic">Blιawishya Parana</hi> was the primeval form
                    of chess; that it was invented by a people whose language was Sanskrit (i.e.,
                    the Hindus); and that it was known and practised in India from a time lost in
                    the depths of a remote antiquity, but, as he considers, for a period the
                    duration of which may have been from 3000 to 4000 years before the 6th century
                    of the Christian era. He endeavours to show, though certainly quite
                    speculatively, for he adduces no proof, how the four armies commanded by four
                    kings in Sir William J ones’s manuscript became converted into two opposing
                    armies, on which conversion he says that two of the kings were reduced to a
                    subordinate position, and became “monitors” or “counsellors,” one standing by
                    the side of the white and the other of the black king, these counsellors being
                    the farzins from which we derive our queens. Among other points he argues,
                    apparently with justice, that chaturanga was evidently the root of shatranj, for
                    the latter word he states is a mere exotic in the language of the inhabitants of
                    Persia, defying all the ingenuity of their grammarians to make it their own.</p>
                <p>Van der Linde, in his exhaustive work, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte und</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Litteratur</hi><hi rend="italic">des Schachspiels</hi>
                    (Berlin, 1874), has much to say of the origin theories, nearly all of which he
                    treats as so many myths. He agrees with those who consider that the Persians
                    received the game from the Hindus; but the elaborate chaturanga theories of
                    Forbes receive but scant mercy at the hands of the learned Dutch author. Van der
                    Linde argues that chaturanga is always used of an army, and never of a game, by
                    the old Indian poets; that all Sanskrit scholars are agreed that chess is
                    mentioned in none of the really ancient Hindu records; that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Puranas</hi> generally, though formerly considered to be
                    extremely old, are held in the light of modern researches to reach no further
                    back in reality than the 10th century,—while, moreover, the copies of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Bhawishya Purana</hi> which are in the British Museum and
                    Berlin Library do not contain the extract relied upon by Forbes, though it is to
                    be found in the <hi rend="italic">Raghunamdana,</hi> which was translated by
                    Weber in 1872, and is stated by Bühler to date from the 16th century. The
                    ultimate outcome of Van der Linde’s studies appears to be that chess certainly
                    existed in Hindustan in the 8th century, and that probably that country is the
                    land of its birth. While putting forth nothing as positive which cannot be
                    proved, he inclines to the idea that the game originated among the Buddhists,
                    whose religion was prevalent in India from the 3d to the 9th century. According
                    to their ideas, war and the slaying of one’s fellowman, for any purpose
                    whatever, is criminal, and the punishment of the warrior in the next world will
                    be much worse than that of the simple murderer; but they ministered to the
                    combative propensities of human nature by inventing the bloodless warfare of
                    chess as a harmless imitation of and a substitution for the carnage of the
                    battle-field. In opposition to Forbes, therefore, and agreeing with Sir William
                    Jones, Van der Linde takes the view that the four-handed game of the
                    above-mentioned manuscript is a comparatively modern adaptation of the primal
                    Hindu chess, and he altogether denies that there is any proof of the game in
                    whatever form having the antiquity <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n610/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0610-0599"/> attributed to it. Certainly, internal
                    evidences seem to contradict the view of Sir William Jones’s manuscript being a
                    very ancient testimony; for it mentions two great sages, Vyasa and Gotama, the
                    former as teaching chaturanga to Prince Yudhishthira, and the other as giving an
                    opinion upon certain principles of the game; but this could not well be, seeing
                    that it was played with dice, and all games of hazard were positively forbidden
                    by Menu. It would appear also that Indian manuscripts cannot be absolutely
                    relied on in evidence of the antiquity of their contents; for the climate has
                    the effect of destroying such writings in a period of 300 or 400 years. They
                    must therefore be from time to time re-copied, and in this way later
                    interpolations might easily creep in.</p>
                <p>Von der Lasa, who had, in an article prefixed to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Handbuch</hi> in 1864, accepted Forbes’s views, withdraws his support in a
                    review of the work just noticed, published in the September and November numbers
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Deutsche Schachzeitung,</hi> 1874, and expresses his
                    adherence to the opinions set forth by Van der Linde.</p>
                <p>Altogether, therefore, we find the best authorities agreeing that chess existed
                    in India before it is known to have been played anywhere else,—a fact which
                    naturally leads them to fix upon that country as its probable birthplace. In
                    this supposition they are strengthened by the names of the game and of some of
                    the pieces. Shatranj, as Forbes has well pointed out, is a foreign word among
                    the Persians and Arabians, whereas its natural derivation from the term
                    chaturanga will strike an ordinarily educated as well as a scholarly mind.
                    Again, al-fil, the Arabic name of the bishop, means the elephant, otherwise
                    alephhind, the Indian ox. As to how long chess has really existed, unless we
                    choose to rely upon evident myths and old fables, we shall find no ground
                    whatever for attributing to it the great antiquity that some have maintained.
                    Our earliest authority is Masudi, an Arabic author who wrote about 950 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> According to him, shatranj had existed long
                    before his time; but the spirit of historic criticism will not permit of our
                    unreservedly accepting his testimony in that regard. Say that he may speak not
                    only for his own generation but for a couple of centuries before, and that will
                    give an existence to chess of over a thousand years, a respectable period of
                    time enough, and one to be satisfied with until a greater duration be
                    proved.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chess in Early and Mediaeval Times.</hi> —The dimness which
                    shrouds from view the origin of chess naturally obscures also its early history.
                    All kinds of fables and legends lie in the way of the inquirer, and obstruct his
                    progress, so that until a comparatively recent date a firm historical foundation
                    is not to be found. We have seen that chess crossed over from India into Persia,
                    and became known in the latter country by the name of shatranj. Some have
                    understood that word to mean “the play of the king;” but undoubtedly Sir William
                    Jones’s derivation carries with it the most plausibility, if indeed his reasons
                    may not be said to amount to a demonstration of the correctness of his view. But
                    how and when the game was introduced into Persia we have no means of knowing.
                    True, the Persian poet Firdusi, in his historical poem, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Shahnama,</hi> gives an account of the introduction of shatranj into Persia
                    in the reign of Naushirawan (Chosroes), to whom came ambassadors from the
                    sovereign of Hind, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> India, with a chess-board and
                    men, asking him to solve if he could the secrets of the game, and otherwise to
                    pay tribute. Naushirawan was the contemporary of Justinian, and reigned in the
                    6th century of our era. Professor Forbes seems to think that this poem may be
                    looked upon as substantially an authentic history and credited as such. This
                    appears, however, to be somewhat dangerous, especially as Firdusi lived some 450
                    years after the supposed event took place. Other Persian and Arabian writers
                    state that shatranj came into Persia from India, and there appears, as we have
                    seen, such a consensus of opinion as may be considered to settle that part of
                    the question. We have then the game passing from the Hindus to the Persians,
                    thence to the Arabians after they took possession of Persia in the 7th century,
                    and from whom directly or indirectly it came to various parts of Europe, at a
                    time which cannot be definitely fixed upon, but which was either in or before
                    the 11th century. That the source of the European game is Arabic is clearly
                    enough deducible, not merely from the words “check” and “mate,” which are
                    evidently from <hi rend="italic">Shah mat,</hi> but also from the names of some
                    of the pieces, to be noticed further on. There are various chess legends having
                    reference to the 7th and 8th centuries, but these may be passed by as presenting
                    no appearance of historical verity; and equally unworthy of credence appear the
                    many Oriental and Occidental romances which revolve around those two great
                    central figures, Harun al Rashid and Charlemagne. There is no proof that either
                    of them knew anything of chess, or, so far as the latter is concerned, that it
                    had been introduced into Europe in his time. True, there is an account given in
                    Gustavus Selenus, taken from various old chronicles, as to the son of Prince
                    Okar or Otkar of Bavaria having been killed by a blow on the temple struck by a
                    son of Pepin after a game of chess; and there is another well-known tradition as
                    to the magnificent chess-board and set of men said to have been sent over as a
                    present by the Empress Irene to Charlemagne. But both tales are not less
                    mythical than the romance which relates how the great Frankish monarch lost his
                    kingdom over a game of chess to Guerin de Montglave; for Van der Linde shows
                    that there was no Bavarian prince of the name of Okar or Otkar at the period
                    alluded to, and in an equally relentless manner the sceptical Dutch writer
                    breaks down the tradition about Irene’s chessmen. With respect to Harun al
                    Rashid, among the various stories told which connect him with chess, there is
                    one that at first sight may seem entitled to some degree of credit. In the
                    annals of the Moslems by Abulfeda, there is given a copy of a letter stated to
                    be “From Nicephorus, emperor of the Romans, to Harun, sovereign of the Arabs,”
                    which (using Professor Forbes’s translation) after the usual compliments, runs
                    thus :— “The empress (Irene) into whose place I have succeeded, looked upon you
                    as a <hi rend="italic">Rukh</hi> and herself as a mere <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pawn,</hi> therefore she submitted to pay you a tribute more than the
                    double of which she ought to have exacted from you. AU this has been owing to
                    female weakness and timidity. Now, however, I insist that you, immediately on
                    reading this letter, repay to me all the sums of money you ever received from
                    her. If you hesitate, the sword shall settle our accounts.” Harun’s reply,
                    written on the back of the Byzantine emperor’s letter, was terse and to the
                    point. It ran thus :—“In the name of God the merciful and gracious. From Harun,
                    the commander of the faithful, to the Roman dog Nicephorus. I have read thine
                    epistle, thou son of an infidel mother; my answer to it thou shalt <hi
                        rend="italic">see,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">hear."</hi> Harun was as good
                    as his word, for he marched immediately as far as Heraclea, devastating the
                    Roman territories with fire and sword, and soon compelled Nicephorus to sue for
                    peace. Now the points which give authority to this narrative and the alleged
                    correspondence are that the relations which they assume between Irene and
                    Nicephorus on the one hand and the warlike caliph on the other are confirmed by
                    the history of those times, while, also, the straightforward brevity of Harun’s
                    reply commends itself as what one might expect from his soldier-like character.
                    Still, the fact must be remembered, that Abulfeda lived about five centuries
                    after the time to which he refers.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0611-0600"/>
                <p>Perhaps we may assume it to be not improbable that the correspondence is genuine;
                    but the words “rukh” and “pawn” may have been substituted for other terms of
                    comparison originally made use of.</p>
                <p>As to how chess was introduced into Western and Central Europe nothing is really
                    known. The Spaniards very likely received it from their Moslem conquerors, the
                    Italians not improbably from the Byzantines, and in either case it would pass
                    northwards to France, going on thence to Scandinavia and England. Some say that
                    chess was introduced into Europe at the time of the Crusades, the theory being
                    that the Christian warriors learned to play it at Constantinople. This
                    supposition is negatived by a curious epistle of Cardinal Damianus, bishop of
                    Ostia, to Pope Alexander IL written about 1061 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi>
                    which, assuming its authenticity, shows that chess was known in Italy before the
                    date of the first crusade. The cardinal, as it seems, had imposed a penance upon
                    a bishop whom he had found diverting himself at chess; and in his letter to the
                    Pope he repeats the language he had held to the erring prelate, viz., “Was it
                    right, I say, and consistent with thy duty, to sport away thy evenings amidst
                    the vanity of chess, and defile the hand which offers up the body of the Lord,
                    the tongue that mediates between God and man, with the pollution of a
                    sacrilegious game?” Following up the same idea the statutes of the church of
                    Elna, in the 3d vol. of the <hi rend="italic">Councils of Spain,</hi> say,
                    “Clerks playing at dice or chess shall be <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi>
                    excommunicated.” Eudes de Sully, bishop of Paris under Philip Augustus, is
                    stated in the <hi rend="italic">Ordonn.</hi><hi rend="italic">des Rois</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">de France,</hi> to have forbidden clerks to play the game, and
                    according to the <hi rend="italic">Hist. Eccles,</hi> of Fleury, St Louis king
                    of France condemned to a fine all who should play it. Ecclesiastical
                    authorities, however, seem to have differed among themselves upon the question
                    whether chess was or was not a lawful game according to the canons, and Peirino,
                        <hi rend="italic">De Proelat.</hi> chap. 1, holds that it was permissible
                    for ecclesiastics to play thereat. Among those who have taken an unfavourable
                    view of the game may be mentioned John Huss, who, when in prison, deplored his
                    having played at chess, where by he had lost time and risked being subject to
                    violent passions. Among authentic records of the game may be quoted the <hi
                        rend="italic">Alexiad</hi> of the Princess Anna Comnena, in which she
                    relates how her father, the Emperor Alexius, used to divert his mind from the
                    cares of state by playing at chess with his relatives. This emperor died in
                    1118. Con cerning chess in England there is the usual mingle-mangle of the
                    legendary and the possibly true. Snorre Sturleson relates that as Canute was
                    playing at chess with Earl Ulfr, a quarrel arose, which resulted in the latter
                    upsetting the board, with the further consequence of his being murdered in
                    church a few days afterwards by Canute’s orders. Carlyle, in his recent work,
                        <hi rend="italic">The Early Kings of Norway,</hi> repeats this tale, but Van
                    der Linde treats it as a myth; and certainly the act imputed to the great·minded
                    Dane seems altogether inconsistent with his character. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ramsey Chronicle</hi> relates how Bishop Utheric, coming to Canute at night
                    upon urgent business, found the monarch and his courtiers recreating themselves
                    at dice and chess. There is nothing intrinsically improbable in this last
                    narrative; but Canute died about 1035, and the date therefore is suspiciously
                    early. Moreover, allowance must be made .for the ease with which chroniclers
                    turned other games, such as tables, &lt;fcc., into chess. William the Conqueror,
                    Henry I., John, and Edward I. are variously stated to have played at chess, but
                    such assertions must be taken <hi rend="italic">quantum valeant.</hi> Not devoid
                    of plausibility is the allegation that the Court of Exchequer derives its name
                    from <hi rend="italic">Eschiquier</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> though whether,
                    in support of the same idea, we are to believe, as is stated by an old writer,
                    that at the coronation of Richard I. in 1189, six earls and barons carried a
                    chess-board with the royal insignia to represent the said court is another
                    thing. According to Edmonson’s <hi rend="italic">Heraldry,</hi> twenty-six
                    English families bore chess rooks in their coats of arms. Altogether, strewed
                    about the chronicles and writings of the Middle Ages are many allusions to the
                    game, but the subject cannot be further elucidated here; though a word or two
                    about the pieces and the changes they have undergone may be worth adding.</p>
                <p>The king seems always to have had the same move as at present; but it is said he
                    could formerly be captured. There seems no recorded proof, however, of his ever
                    having been subject to this liability in the real shatranj. His castling
                    privilege is a European invention; in lieu thereof he formerly leaped two and
                    even three squares, and also to his Kt 2d, which would be a knight’s move.
                    Castling dates no further back than the first half of the 16th century. The
                    queen has suffered curious changes in name, sex, and power. In shatranj she was
                    called farz or firz (also farzan, farzin, and farzi), signifying a “counsellor,”
                    “minister,’’ or “general.” This was Latinized into farzia or fercia. The French
                    slightly altered the latter form into fierce, fierge, and as some say, vierge,
                    which, if true, might explain her becoming a female. Another and much more
                    probable account has it that whereas a pawn on reaching an eighth square became
                    a farzin, and not formerly any other piece, which promotion was of the same kind
                    as at draughts (in French, <hi rend="italic">dames'),</hi> so she became a dame
                    or queen as in the latter game, and thence dama, donna, &amp;c. There are old
                    Latin manuscripts in which the terms ferzia and regina are used indifferently.
                    The queen formerly moved only one square diagonally, and was consequently the
                    weakest piece on the board. The immense power she now possesses seems to have
                    been conferred upon her so late as about the middle of the 15th century, and
                    there can be little doubt that her investiture therewith arose analogically
                    through the similarity of the powers of promotion possessed alike by the pawns
                    and the common men in draughts. It will be noticed that under the old system the
                    queens could never meet each other, for they operated on diagonals of different
                    colours. The bishop’s scope of action was also very limited formerly; he could
                    only move two squares diagonally, and had no power over the intermediate
                    squares, which he could leap over whether they were occupied or not. One result
                    of the peculiar motion of the bishops was that they could never encounter each
                    other even when running on diagonals of the same colour. This limitation of
                    their powers prevailed in Europe until the 15th century. This piece, according
                    to Forbes, was called among the Persians, pil, an elephant, but the Arabs, not
                    having the letter <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in their alphabet, wrote it fil, or
                    with their definite article al-fil, whence alphilus, alfinus, alfiere, the
                    latter being the word used by the Italians; while the French no doubt get their
                    fol and fou from the same source. The pawns formerly could move only one square
                    at starting; their powers in this respect were increased about the early part of
                    the 16th century. It was customary for them on arriving at an eighth square to
                    be exchanged only for a farzin (queen), and not any other piece; therefore, the
                    plurality of queens is not, as some suppose, a new doctrine. The rooks and
                    knights appear to have always had the same powers as at present. As to the chess
                    boards they were formerly uncoloured, and it is not until the 13th century that
                    we hear of checkered boards being used in Europe.</p>

                    conquest of Constantinople, and culminated in the introduction of typography,
                    the discovery of America, the enunciation of the Copernican theory, &amp;c. The
                    time of the first important writer on modern chess, the Spaniard Ruy Lopez de
                    Segura (1561), is also the period when the latest improvement, castling, was
                    introduced, for his book <hi rend="italic">(Libro</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                        invention</hi><hi rend="italic">liberal y</hi><hi rend="italic">arte del

                    the old mode of play, which consisted of a solitary leap of the king. Shortly
                    afterwards, the old shatranj disappears altogether, the struggle for existence
                    resulting as usual in the victory of the stronger. Of Lopez it may be said that
                    he was the first who merits the name of chess analyst, as he gives reasons for
                    his different variations in the openings, and for holding different opinions
                    from his predecessor Damiano. At this time flourished the flower of the Spanish
                    and Italian schools of chess—the former represented by Lopez, Ceron, Santa
                    Maria, Busnardo, and Avalos; the latter by Giovanni Leonardo da Cαtri (il
                    Puttino), and Paolo Boi (il Syracusano). In the years 1562-1575, both Italian
                    masters visited Spain, and defeated their Spanish antagonists, so that this
                    period is rightly considered as that when international chess tournaments first
                    took place. The following century yielded a great number of chess writers, but
                    scarcely any great players; and, in fact, during the whole 17th century, we find
                    but one worthy to be mentioned, viz., the very ingenious Giacchino Greco (il
                    Calabrese), whose recorded games abound in the most beautiful, but often not
                    very sound, combinations. The middle of the 18th century inaugurates a new era
                    in chess, for now the compilations and reprints of very indifferent writers were
                    abandoned by the student and relegated to the collections of bibliophilists.
                    Instead we find real chessplayers and painstaking analysts. The leading man of
                    this time was François André Danican Philidor. He was born the 7th of September
                    1726 at Dreux, near Paris, played chess very early, and was trained by the Μ. de
                    Kemur Sir de Legal, the then star of the Café de la Régence, which has been the
                    centre of French chess ever since the commencement of the 18th century. In 1747
                    Philidor visited England, and defeated the Arabian player Phillip Stamma by 8
                    games to 1 and 1 draw. In 1749 he published in London his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Analyse des Ĕchxcs,</hi> a book which went through more editions and was
                    more translated than a score of other works upon the game. In fact it was the
                    chess Koran. During more than half a century Philidor travelled much in England,
                    Holland, and Germany; but unfortunately he never went to Italy, the only country
                    where he could have found opponents of first-rate skilL Italy was represented in
                    Philidor’s time by a trio renowned in the history of chess as forming the
                    Modenese school—Ercole del Rio, Lolli, and Ponziani. The style of these experts
                    was less sound than that of Philidor, but certainly a much finer and, in
                    principle, a better one. It may be added that as an analyst the Frenchman was in
                    many points refuted by Ercole del Rio, who wrote under the <hi rend="italic"
                        >nom</hi><hi rend="italic">de plume</hi> of the Anonymous Modenese.
                    Blindfold chess play, already exhibited in the 11th century by Arabian and
                    Persian experts, was taken up afresh by Philidor, who played on many occasions
                    three games simultaneously without sight of board or men. These exhibitions were
                    given in London, which he visited every season from 1784 as the guest of the
                    Chess Club in St James’s Street; and he died in that city on the 24th of August
                    1795. As eminent players of this period must be mentioned Count Ph. J. van
                    Zuylen van Nyevelt (1743— 1826), and the German J. Allgaier (1763-1823), after
                    whom is called a well-known brilliant variation of the King’s Gambit. Philidor’s
                    mantle was taken up by Alexander Louis Honoré Lebreton Deschapelles (1780-
                    1847), who possessed undoubtedly a great genius for the game, and was its
                    champion for many years, notwithstanding that he lacked all knowledge of the
                    theory. The only player who is known to have fought Deschapelles not
                    unsuccessfully on even terms is the veteran John Cochrane. The Frenchman
                    generally declined to play except at odds, and he was ever ready to handicap
                    himself liberally. Helost, however, a match (1821) to W. Lewis, to whom he
                    conceded the pawn and move, the Englishman winning 1 and drawing the 2 others.
                    Deschapelles’s greatest pupil, and the strongest player France ever possessed,
                    was Louis Charles Mahé de Labourdonnais—born in 1797—who was the leader of the
                    French school from 1821 until his death in December 1840. His most memorable
                    achievement was his contest with the English champion, Alexander Macdonnell, in
                    a series of matches which resulted in the French player winning in the
                    proportion of 3 to 2 of all the games played.</p>
                <p>The English school of chess commenced about the beginning of the present century,
                    and Sarratt was its first leader. He flourished from 1808 to 1821, and was
                    followed by his great pupil W. Lewis, who, however, exhibited his skill in
                    practical play for a short time only, and will be principally remembered for his
                    writings, which stamp him as a great and original chess analyst. His literary
                    career belongs to the period from 1818 to 1848, and he died in 1869. A.
                    Macdonnell has been already mentioned; he was born in 1798 and died in 1835. He
                    was a very ingenious and brilliant player, but lacked soundness. To the same
                    period belongs also Captain Evans, the inventor of the celebrated Evans Gambit
                    (1828), who died at a very advanced age in 1873; Perigal, who participated in
                    the correspondence matches against Edinburgh and Paris; George Walker, for
                    thirty years chess editor of <hi rend="italic">Belis Life in London,</hi> who is
                    still alive; and John Cochrane, who has crossed swords with every strong player
                    from Deschapelles downwards, and is still in constant play. In the same period
                    Germany possessed but one player who was above the mediocrities of the time,—J.
                    Mendheim, whose name is connected with Berlin chess, in which city he resided
                    from 1810 to 1836. The fifth decennium of the 19th century is marked by the fact
                    that the chess sceptre departed from the French school, and was grasped by the
                    English. After Labourdonnais’s death Fournié de Saint-Amant became the leading
                    player in France; as such he visited England in the early part of 1843, and
                    contended successfully against the best English players, including Howard
                    Staunton; but the latter soon took his revenge, for in November and December
                    1843 the great match between Staunton and Saint-Amant took place in Paris, the
                    English champion winning by 11 games to 6 with 4 draws. During the succeeding
                    eight years Staunton maintained his reputation by defeating in matches upon even
                    terms Popert, Horwitz, and Harrwitz, besides a number of strong amateurs to whom
                    he conceded large odds. He had also two other matches with Harrwitz, one at pawn
                    and two moves, and the other at pawn and move—the former being won by Staunton,
                    and the latter lost by him. Staunton’s services in the cause of chess literature
                    are adverted to below. That they were very great, and that the game in England
                    owes much of its present popularity to him is not to be questioned, as also that
                    for thirty years he occupied a position in the English chess world possessed by
                    none of his contemporaries. Staunton was defeated by Anderssen at the London
                    tournament in 1851, and from that time his match-playing <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0613-0602"/> career concluded. He died suddenly on the 22d
                    of June 1874, at the age of sixty-four. Among the contemporaries of Staunton,
                    mention should certainly not be omitted of Henry Thomas Buckle, author of the
                        <hi rend="italic">History of Civilization.</hi> His remarkable powers as a
                    chess-player were principally exhibited in games played only for recreation at
                    Simpson’s Chess divan, wherein he was successful over Kieseritzki, and used to
                    concede odds to strong players such as Barnes, Bird, &amp;c. He beat Anderssen
                    in 1851—when the Breslau player was at the height of his strength—in a series of
                    15 well-contested games played between them, by a majority of one game, and he
                    also about the same time defeated Löwenthal in a match.</p>
                <p>In the ten years 1830-1840 a new school arose in Berlin, the seven leaders of
                    which have been called the Pleiades. These were Bledow (1795-1846), Bilguer
                    (1815-1840), Hanstein (1810-1850), Mayet (1810-1868), Schorn (1802-1850), B.
                    Horwitz, born in 1809 and now living in London, and last, but not least, the
                    eminent player and chess author, Von Heydebrandt und der Lasa, at present the
                    imperial German ambassador at Copenhagen. As belonging to the same period must
                    be mentioned the three Hungarian players,—Grimm, who died in Turkish Asia,
                    whither he had fled after the insurrection of 1848; Szen, known by his
                    successful combats with Labourdonnais (who conceded the Pesth player pawn and
                    two moves, but lost 11 games out of 12), his competition in the 1851 tourney, as
                    also his general play with the strongest adepts of his time; and J. Löwenthal,
                    lately deceased, whose career, however, belongs more naturally to the period of
                    later British chess. Among other proofs of the skill of these Hungarians is the
                    correspondence match in 1843-45 between Pesth and Paris, won by the former.</p>
                <p>The first modern international chess tournament, held at London in 1851, marks
                    the commencement of the present epoch, and was the forerunner of various similar
                    contests between strong players of different nationalities. This tourney brought
                    forward a player who, so far as beauty of combination goes, stands even to the
                    present moment without a rival, viz., A. Anderssen, born in Breslau the 6th of
                    July 1818. Before his appearance in England he had defeated all his German
                    antagonists, and at the above-mentioned tournament he took the first prize,
                    having successively beaten L. Kieseritzki, Szen, Staunton, and Mr Wyvill, M.P.
                    Anderssen played the same year in the tournament of the London Club, and again
                    took first honours. In 1857 he competed in the Manchester tourney, but lost in
                    the last round to Löwenthal, who consequently won the first prize, Anderssen
                    having the second. In December 1858 Anderssen was beaten by Morphy in a match
                    played at Paris, the score being 7 games to 2 and 2 drawn. In 1860 the
                    indefatigable Breslau player again visited Paris, and played successfully
                    against J. Kolisch; and he also defeated the latter in 1861 in a set match
                    played at London by 4 games to 3. In the London tournament of 1862, Anderssen
                    took the first prize; but in 1866 he lost a match to Steinitz, the winner’s
                    score being 8 to 6. In 1869 Anderssen came out first in the North German and
                    Rhenish tournaments, and again in 1870 at the Baden-Baden congress; but in the
                    spring of 1871 he lost a match to Zukertort, score 5 to 2, and he took but the
                    third prize at the Vienna congress of 1873. Altogether he has shown himself the
                    most soldier-like of chess players, ever ready for the fight, and never caring
                    to rest upon his reputation. Among those who may be reckoned as more or less
                    owing their training to him are the following eminent players :— D. Harrwitz, J.
                    Dufresne, Max Lange, B. Suhle, P. Hirschfeld, G. R. Neumann, E. Schallopp, S.
                    Mieses, J. H. Zukertort, and many others.</p>
                <p>Paul Morphy, who beat Anderssen by such a decisive majority of games, is
                    considered by many competent judges, and probably with truth, to have been the
                    strongest chess player that ever lived. His career was short but brilliant. Born
                    in New Orleans on the 22d of June 1837, he was taught chess by his father when
                    only ten years of age, and in two years time became a strong player, able to
                    contend with success against his uncle Mr Ernest Morphy and Mr Eugene Rousseau,
                    both high-class experts. When not quite thirteen he played three games with
                    Löwenthal, and won two of them, the other being drawn. He was twenty years of
                    age when he competed in the New York congress of 1857 <hi rend="subscript">
                        i</hi>, where he won the first prize, having defeated C. H. Stanley, L.
                    Paulsen, and other strong American amateurs. In 1858 he visited Europe, and
                    there met with a series of triumphs. He arrived first in England, and there
                    defeated by large majorities Boden, Medley, Mongredien, Owen, Bird, and others.
                    He also, in a match played in London, beat Löwenthal by 9 games to 3 and 2
                    drawn. In September of the same year (1858) he played a match at Paris with
                    Harrwitz, whom he defeated by 5 to 2 and 1 drawn; and later on he obtained a
                    victory over Anderssen as above stated. During his stay in Europe he on two or
                    three occasions played without sight of board or men and simultaneously against
                    eight strong players, each time with great success. He returned to America in
                    May 1859, and here his chess career virtually finishes. He continued to play in
                    his own circle, but with decreasing interest in the game, until 1866, when he
                    totally abandoned its practice and has never played since.</p>
                <p>Wilhelm Steinitz, born at Prague in 1836, and for the last fourteen years
                    resident in London, took the sixth prize at the London congress of 1862.
                    Immediately afterwards he defeated Blackburne in a match by 7 to 1 and 2 draws.
                    In 1866 he beat Anderssen in a match by 8 games to 6; and in 1867 he took the
                    third prize at the Paris tournament. In 1868 he carried off the first prize in
                    the British Chess Association handicap, in 1870 the second prize of the
                    Baden-Baden tournament, and in 1872 the first prize of the London grand tourney.
                    In the last-mentioned year he defeated Zukertort in a match by 7 games to 1 and
                    4 draws. In 1873 he carried off the first prize at the Vienna congress; and in
                    1876 he defeated Blackburne, winning 7 games right off. He has also won matches
                    against Dubois, Mongredien, Deacon, and Bird, and in 1872-4 he, in conjunction
                    with W. N. Potter, conducted and won a telegraphic correspondence match for
                    London against Vienna.</p>
                <p>One of the special characteristics of the present time is the extraordinary power
                    of playing blindfold chess which we now so often see exhibited. In Phiüdor’s age
                    it was considered an almost incredible wonder that he should be able to play
                    three simultaneous games without seeing board or men, but Paulsen, Blackburne,
                    and Zukertort have often played 10 or 12 simultaneous blindfold games, while
                    even as many as 14 and 15 have been so played.</p>
                <p>With the following summary of tournaments contested during the last 25 years, the
                    modern history of chess may conclude :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Literature of the Game.</hi> The number of works that have
                    been written upon chess in various languages is very large; and only a few of
                    the principal books on this subject can be cursorily alluded to here. Confining
                    ourselves to those authors who have treated of the practice and science of the
                    game, we may begin with Jacobus de Cessolis, otherwise Jacopo Dacciesole, whose
                    main object, however, though he gives the moves, &amp;c., was to teach morals
                    rather than chess. He was a Dominican friar, and his treatise, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Solatium Ludi Scaschorum, scilicet,</hi><hi rend="italic">Libellus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Moribus Hominum et Officiis
                        Nobilium,</hi> was written before the year 1200. It was afterwards
                    translated into French, and in the year 1474 Caxton, under the title of <hi
                        rend="italic">The Game and Playe of the Chesse,</hi> printed an English
                    translation of the French version. It has been held by many that this was the
                    first book printed in England.</p>
                <p>In 1490 we have <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Göttinger
                        Handschrift,</hi> a work containing nine different openings and fifty
                    problems. The author of this manuscript is not known. It is supposed that both
                    he and Lucena were indebted to an earlier source, now unknown. Then comes
                    Vicent, a Spanish writer, whose book bears date 1495. This is pretty well all we
                    know about him, for only the title page has been preserved, the rest of the work
                    having been lost in the first Carlist war, forty years ago. Of Lucena, another
                    Spanish author who wrote in or about 1497, we are better informed. His treatise
                        <hi rend="italic">{Repeticion des</hi><hi rend="italic">Amores</hi><hi

                    positions, illustrated by 160 well executed wood-cuts. Various of those
                    positions are identical with those in <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Göttinger Handschrift.</hi> Damiano’s work is an
                    unacknowledged reproduction of Lucena’s. In the sixteenth century works upon the
                    game were written by Damiano (as just mentioned), Ruy Lopez, and Horatio
                    Gianutio della Mantia; in the seventeenth century by Salvio, Polerio, Gustavus
                    Selenus, Carrera, Greco, Fr. Antonio, and the authors of the <hi rend="italic"

                    Ponziani, Stein, Van Nyevelt, Allgaier, and Peter Pratt; in the present century

                    writers are quoted below.</p>
                <p>English chess owes much to W. Lewis and George Walker for their multifarious
                    literary labours in the early part of the present century, the former being the
                    best original analyst that England has yet produced. But to Howard Staunton must
                    be ascribed the most important share in creating the popularity which the game
                    has achieved in this country. His victory over St Amant in 1843, and his
                    successful career as a match player during the ensuing eight years, tended in
                    the first place to attract the popular attention, while his works gave a style
                    and a shape to the practice of the game amongst his countrymen such as
                    contributed much towards laying the basis of that high degree of excellence
                    which now characterises chess playing in England. Staunton’s first work, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Chess Player's Handbook,</hi> was published in 1847, and again
                    (revised) in 1848. For want of further adequate revision many of its variations
                    are now out of date, while later additions and discoveries naturally find no
                    place therein; but taking the <hi rend="italic">Handbook</hi> as it was when
                    issued, very high praise must be bestowed upon the author for the good judgment,
                    ability, and painstaking labour evidenced in the compilation of the work. If
                    there be anything wanting in original analysis, this is more than compensated
                    for by the care, acumen, learning, and research which enabled him to utilize and
                    condense in a clear, intelligible, and attractive form all the stores of
                    knowledge then accessible. His other works are the <hi rend="italic">Chess
                        Player's Text Book</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Chess Player's
                        Companion</hi> (1849), the latter being a collection of his own games, the
                        <hi rend="italic">Chess Praxis</hi> (1860),and various smaller treatises. As
                    has been already stated, the laws of the game, as laid down in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Praxis,</hi> form the basis of the rules adopted by the
                    British Chess Association in 1862, the main differences between the two codes
                    arising from a mitigation in the Association laws of some of the severe
                    penalties laid down in the <hi rend="italic">Praxis,</hi> and the enactment of
                    the “Dummy Pawn” rule, whereby a pawn on reaching an eight square may, if the
                    player chooses, remain a pawn. In 1840 Staunton established the <hi
                        rend="italic">Chess Player's Chronicle,</hi> which periodical he continued
                    to edit until 1856, while for four years—commencing in 1865—he carried on the
                        <hi rend="italic">Chess World.</hi> Moreover, he was the chess editor of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi> during a period of thirty
                    years, viz., from 1844 till his death in 1874. The services which he rendered to
                    chess in thus popularizing the game and successfully engrafting it upon our
                    periodical literature have been admitted in all quarters. In this respect also
                    George Walker’s work in <hi rend="italic">Bell's Life in London,</hi> of which
                    publication he was the chess editor for forty years, should not go without
                    special acknowledgment. To Staunton’s works must now be added his posthumous <hi
                        rend="italic">Chess Theory and Practice,</hi> edited and prepared for the
                    press by R. B. Wormaid, 1876.</p>
                <p>Among Continental chess authorities Von Heydebrandt und der Lasa (more usually
                    known by his second title) stands pre-eminent. The German <hi rend="italic"
                        >Handbuch,</hi> the famous volume with which his name is inseparably
                    associated, was commenced in 1843 by Von Bilguer, who died before the first
                    edition was completed. The second, third, fourth, and fifth editions (the last
                    published in 1874) were successively edited and revised by Von der Lasa, and the
                    book now stands a lasting monument of his genius and industry.</p>
                <p>Of recent English works upon the openings the following may be mentioned :— <hi
