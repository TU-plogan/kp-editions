                    Oil Plant or Palma Christi, <hi rend="italic">Ridnus communis,</hi> belonging to
                    the Natural Order <hi rend="italic">Euphorbiaceoe.</hi> The plant is a native of
                    the East Indies, but it has been introduced, and is now cultivated in most
                    tropical and in the warmer temperate countries. In size it varies from a shrubby
                    plant to a tree of from 30 to 40 feet in height according to the climate in
                    which it grows, being arborescent in tropical latitudes. On account of its very
                    large beautiful palmate-peltate leaves, which measure as much as 2 feet in
                    diameter, it is cultivated as an ornamental plant. In the south of England, with
                    the habit of an annual, it ripens its seeds in favourable seasons; and it has
                    been known to come to maturity as far north as Christiania in Norway. The fruit
                    consists of a tricoccous capsule, covered externally with soft yielding
                    prickles, and each cell develops a single seed. The seeds of the different
                    cultivated varieties, of which there are a great number, differ much in size and
                    in external markings; but average seeds are of an oval laterally compressed
                    form, with their longest diameter about four lines. They have a shining, marble
                    grey and brown, thick, leathery epidermis, within which is a thin dark-coloured
                    brittle coat. The cotyledons readily separate, and show a large distinct leafy
                    embryo. The oil is obtained from the seeds by two principal methods—expression
                    and decoction,—the latter process being largely used in India, where the oil, on
                    account of its cheapness and abundance, is extensively employed for illuminating
                    as well as for other domestic and medicinal purposes. The oil exported from
                    Calcutta to Europe, which is said to be “cold drawn and nearly tasteless,” is
                    prepared by shelling and crushing the seeds between rollers. The crushed mass is
                    then placed in hempen cloths and pressed in a screw or hydraulic press. The oil
                    which exudes is mixed with water and heated till the water boils, and the
                    mucilaginous matter in the oil separates as a scum. It is next strained, then
                    bleached in the sunlight, and stored for exportation. A considerable quantity of
                    castor oil of an excellent quality is also made in Italy; and in California the
                    manufacture is conducted on an extensive scale. The following is an outline of
                    the process adopted in a Californian factory. The seeds are submitted to a dry
                    heat in a furnace for an hour or thereby, by which they are softened and
                    prepared to part easily with their oil. They are then pressed in a large
                    powerful screwpress, and the oily matter which flows out is caught, mixed with
                    an equal proportion of water, and boiled to purify it from mucilaginous and
                    albuminous matter. After boiling about an hour, it is allowed to cool, the water
                    is drawn off, and the oil is transferred to zinc tanks or clarifiers capable of
                    holding from 60 to 100 gallons. In these it stands about eight hours, bleaching
                    in the sun, after which it is ready for storing. By this method 100 ft&gt; of
                    good seeds yield about 5 gallons of pure oil.</p>
                <p>Castor oil is a viscid liquid, almost colourless when pure, possessing only a
                    slight odour, and a mild yet highly nauseous and disagreeable taste. Its
                    specific gravity is ∙96, a little less than that of water, and it dissolves
                    freely in alcohol, ether, and glacial acetic acid. It contains palmitic and
                    several other fatty acids, among which there is one— ricinoleic acid—peculiar to
                    itself. In 1864 Tuson isolated from the oil a principle which he denominated an
                    alkaloid under the name of ricinine, and that substance has since been extracted
                    from the leaves, which are used as galactagogues and emmenagogues. Castor oil
                    forms a clean, light-coloured soap which dries and hardens well, having no
                    tendency to deliquesence, and is free from smell. It has been recommended for
                    medicinal use.</p>
                <p>Castor oil is one of the most extensively useful of purgative medicines known;
                    and the only one which, under certain circumstances, can with safety be
                    administered. Its purgative properties were supposed by Soubeiran to be due to
                    the presence of an acrid oleo-resin and to ricinolein, but the constituents of
                    the oil have not yet been satisfactorily studied in their physiological
                    relations. The seeds themselves, or the oil extracted by alcohol, owing to the
                    larger proportion of the drastic principle they contain, act much more
                    powerfully than the common oil. The nauseous taste of castor oil is the one
                    great impediment to its use, and many methods have been suggested for overcoming
                    its unpleasant flavour. The most common devices are—enclosing it in capsules,
                    floating it in various palatable liquids, or preparing emulsions of the oil with
                    such substances as dissolved gum-arabic and simple syrup.</p>
