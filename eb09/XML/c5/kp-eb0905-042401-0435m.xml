                    determination. He never forgot an injury. His passion was terrible and frequent.
                    His boldness amounted to the rashness of fury. He was careless of luxury,
                    though, in imitation of the ancient conquerors about whom he loved to read, he
                    delighted to surround himself with magnificent display; and he presented an
                    example of conjugal fidelity most remarkable in the society in which he
                    lived.</p>
                <p>As Charles rose to manhood, he found his father under the .control of the Croys,
                    whose usurpation of what he regarded as his own rightful function he deeply
                    resented; and he allowed himself to be banished rather than take one of the
                    family into his household. Soon after—he was at this time count of Charolais—he
                    joined the duke of Brittany in forming a great confederation of the French
                    nobles against King Louis. The confederates, calling themselves the League of
                    the Public Weal, declared that their object was to get rid of bad ministers, to
                    abolish taxes, and relieve the people from oppression. They maintained good
                    discipline, paid for all they consumed, and consequently were opposed neither by
                    the townsmen nor by the country-folk, while the gentry with their dependants
                    flocked to their standard. In 1465 Charles met the royal army in the battle of
                    Montlhéry, which was decided by the retreat of the latter during the following
                    night. Paris was besieged; and Louis was forced to surrender Normandy to the
                    duke of Berry, the towns on the Somme and the counties of Boulogne and Guienne
                    to the count of Charolais, and other territory to other of the nobles. Charles’s
                    next exploit was the conquest of Liège, which, hitherto ruled democratically
                    under the constitutional control of its bishop, was now struggling against the
                    encroachments of Burgundy. The town of Dinant alone he excepted from the peace
                    which he granted to the rest of the principality; and a year later he returned
                    to take vengeance upon it. Its crime was that some of its apprentices had
                    insulted himself and his mother by burning him in effigy as a bastard, and its
                    punishment was an extravagant revenge. It was burned to the ground; of its men
                    numbers were butchered, and the rest remained the unfortunate prisoners of the
                    rude soldiery. The women were spared to be exposed to the extremes of cold and
                    hunger, but were saved from worse treatment by the stern regard for female
                    honour, which was Charles’s most admirable characteristic.</p>
                <p>At the age of thirty-four (1467) Charles became duke of Burgundy. Immense changes
                    were at once effected. He permitted none of the gay festivity and wasteful
                    profusion which had been common in his father’s time, but the court was directed
                    with a stately and splendid ceremony, in which the duke took his full share.
                    Everything was arranged, though liberally, yet with strict order and economy;
                    the state of the finances was carefully examined, and the amount in the treasury
                    was largely increased by unusu⅛l demands from the Estates. Every petitioner,
                    however humble, was heard; the duke shirked no details of business, was present
                    at every council, and sharply rebuked or punished with a fine any absence or
                    inattention on the part of the courtiers. A strict system of administering
                    justice was instituted, and the law was carried out impartially even in the case
                    of the most popular of the nobles.</p>
                <p>Soon after his accession Charles increased his political influence by taking as
                    his second wife Margaret the sister of Edward IV. of England. It was not long
                    before he required all his power; for soon Louis again took possession of
                    Normandy, and contrived to detach the duke of Brittany from his alliance with
                    Burgundy. But Charles at once made ready for war, and the king in alarm took the
                    daring step of requesting a meeting, and placing himself in the duke’s hands at
                    Peronne. Unfortunately for Louis, he had been for some time inciting the people
                    of Liège to rebellion, and they chose this moment for an outbreak. Charles was
                    mad with indignation, and with great difficulty restrained himself from taking
                    vengeance upon the person of the king. After three days of irrepressible passion
                    his wrath was so far spent that he contented himself with requiring Louis to
                    undergo the ignominy of witnessing the punishment of the revolt which he had
                    himself instigated, and with extracting from him a treaty, which, among other
                    most important concessions, confirmed to the duke the possession of the
                    territory which he then held, sanctioned the alliance with England, and took
                    away the right ot appeal from the courts of Flanders to the Parliament of Paris.
                    In case of violation of this compact, the king invoked upon himself the curse of
                    excommunication and the loss of the fealty of Burgundy; and a letter, signed by
                    Louis, was despatched to each of the princes of the blood, requiring them in
                    that event to take up arms against him.</p>
                <p>Soon after this Liège was burned, like Dinant, and its inhabitants nearly
                    exterminated, the fighting-men being mostly butchered, and the aged, the women,
                    and the children exposed to the terrible cold; and the powerful city of Ghent,
                    whose mob had forced from the duke the abolition of the hated cueillote and
                    certain other concessions during his passage through the city before his
                    coronation, was fain to avert his anger by giving up all, and allowing its
                    charter to be annulled.</p>
                <p>Charles had now reached the height of his power, but his greatness was
                    unsubstantial. His subjects were becoming much estranged from him. The placid
                    trade-loving Netherlanders found it hard to bear his arbitrary and haughty
                    passion. The courtiers became weary of the stiff ceremonial of the court and the
                    constant toil they were <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n436/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0436-0425"/> obliged to undergo. Coniines (seeing, as he tells
                    us, that his master was madly rushing to destruction, but, as we can perceive,
                    also affected by the promises of Louis) went over to the court of France. The
                    king was now bold enough to reverse his hypocritical policy, and deny the
                    validity of the treaty which he had signed under constraint at Peronne; and the
                    towns on the Somme, never loyal to Burgundy, were reattached to France. The
                    consequent war was, however, carried on by Charles with his usual success and
                    his usual extravagance of severity.</p>
                <p>His ambition and his policy were now changed. He cared no longer to make the
                    lords independent of the king, but aimed at erecting a kingdom with himself as
                    independent sovereign. Circumstances enabled him to obtain the reversion of
                    Gueldres; and he entered into negotiations with the Emperor Frederick, to whose
                    son he agreed to marry his daughter on condition that he should himself be
                    elected king of the Romans. The emperor proposed instead to crown him king of
                    Burgundy. A meeting, enlivened by a protracted round of gorgeous jousts and
                    feasts, was held at Trêves (1473), in order to carry out the latter proposal;
                    but the electors made a protest to Frederick, who was not remarkable for
                    decision, and persuaded him to flee secretly by night.</p>
                <p>In 1469 Sigismund, duke of Austria, being in great financial difficulty, had sold
                    Alsaoe to Charles. The governor appointed by the latter was Peter von Hagenbach.
                    His boldness as a soldier, his rough shrewdness, and his capacity for strong
                    government had recommended him; hut horrible stories were told of his brutality,
                    his licence, and his blasphemies, He did indeed terrify the country into order,
                    but his severity at length excited people and nobles alike against him, and he
                    was tortured and condemned to death by a court of deputies, representing the
                    Alsatian towns, with Bern, and one or two others. Charles did not fail to take
                    signal vengeance, and the country was given up to indiscriminate slaughter and
                    devastation. But he was now surrounded by powerful and determined enemies. He
                    had himself refused to renew the treaty with Louis, who had on his part
                    purchased the alliance of the Swiss. Sigismund of Austria, now desirous of
                    redeeming Alsace, but having no objection to save his money, had been concerned
                    in the rebellion of that province, and afterwards openly joined the French. But,
                    notwithstanding all this, and in spite of the prohibitions and threats of the
                    emperor, Charles prepared for the invasion of Cologne, in support of its
                    bishopruler, by whose means he expected to bring the city under his own control.
                    As a preliminary he attacked the strong town of Neuss. For eleven months it
                    appeared that nothing could tear him from the siege. The Swiss routed his army,
                    and ravaged Franche-Comté; the French army laid waste his territory and pillaged
                    his towns; the emperor opposed him with a large force; the Pope commanded him to
                    desist. At length he came to an understanding with the emperor. Neuss was put
                    under a papal legate, and the fate of Cologne was left in the hands of the Holy
                    Father (June 1475).</p>
                <p>Immediately after this the English landed at Calais, but only to sign a treaty of
                    peace with Louis at Picquigny. Yet Charles did not give up heart; and an
                    important acquisition was made in the conquest of Lorraine. Again the Swiss took
                    the aggressive, and possessed themselves of the Pays de Vaud. Notwithstanding
                    his capture of Grandson, Charles was plainly overmatched; and, in 1476, he was
                    utterly routed by them at Morat with immense slaughter. Still with no thought of
                    yielding, he devoted himself with all his energy to raise and organize a fresh
                    army. In a few months he was once more ready for war. René had meanwhile
                    recovered Nancy; but soon, through the cowardice of the Alsatians, he was
                    deserted, and his capital was invested by Charles. But René’s triumph was at
                    hand. The assistance of the Swiss was gained, and the Burgundians were attacked
                    by an enemy they could not resist. On the 5th of January 1477 the battle took
                    place. The Burgundians were scattered, and next day the massive body of Charles
                    the Bold was found in a ditch, mutilated by several deadly wounds. It was buried
                    at Nancy, but in 1550 his remains were removed to Bruges by Charles V.</p>
