                <p><label type="entry">CARDAN</label> (or, in the Italian form of the name, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cardano), Girolamo</hi> (1501-1576), famous as a mathematician,
                    a physician, and an astrologer, born at Pavia, September 24, 1501, was the
                    illegitimate son of Fazio Cardano, a learned jurist of Milan, himself
                    distinguished by a taste for mathematics. After a sickly childhood and a stormy
                    boyhood, during which he received a very irregular education, he was sent to the
                    university of Pavia, and subsequently to that of Padua, where he graduated in
                    medicine. He was, however, excluded from the College of Physicians at Milan on
                    account of his illegitimate birth, and his first endeavours to establish himself
                    in practice had so little success that he and his young wife were at one time
                    compelled to take refuge in the workhouse. It is not surprising that his first
                    book should have been an exposure of the fallacies of the faculty. A fortunate
                    cure of the child of the Milanese senator Sfondrato now brought him into notice,
                    and the interest of his patron procured him admission into the medical body.
                    About this time (1539) he obtained additional celebrity by the publication of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Practice of Arithmetic,</hi> a work of great merit for the
                    time, which indirectly led to his renown as a mathematician by engaging him in a
                    correspondence with Nicolo Tartaglia, an ingenious calculator who had discovered
                    an important improvement in the method of cubic equations. This discovery
                    Tartaglia had kept to himself, but he was ultimately induced to communicate it
                    to Cardan under a solemn promise that it should never be divulged. Cardan
                    observed this promise in publishing his arithmetic, but when, several years
                    afterwards, the isolated rule of Tartaglia had developed itself in his mind into
                    a principle capable of transforming algebraical science, he thought himself
                    justified in disclosing it as the groundwork of his own comprehensive treatise
                    on algebra, which appeared at Nuremberg in 1545. This memorable volume marks an
                    era in the history of mathematics, being the first in which the principle of
                    cubic equations was fully ex plained, and the first example of the application
                    of algebraical reasoning to geometrical problems. Its publication naturally
                    involved Cardan in a violent controversy with Tartaglia, and it must be admitted
                    that his conduct cannot be strictly justified, notwithstanding his ample
                    acknowledgment of his obligations to his original instructor. Two years
                    previously he had published a work even more highly regarded by his
                    contemporaries, his celebrated treatise on astrology. This will hardly be
                    enumerated in our day among his titles to fame, but it would be exceedingly
                    unjust to regard it as a proof of superstition or weakness of mind. As a
                    believer in astrology Cardan was on a level with the best minds of his age; the
                    distinction consisted in the comparatively cautious spirit of his inquiries and
                    his disposition to confirm his assertions by an appeal to facts, or what he
                    believed to be such. A very considerable part of his treatise is based upon
                    observations carefully collected by himself, and, it must in candour be owned,
                    seemingly well calculated to support his theory so far as they extend. If the
                    testimony is nevertheless quite inadequate to its purpose, it must in fairness
                    be considered that the proposition of the influence of the heavenly bodies on
                    human affairs appeared to Cardan’s contemporaries almost a truism. From this
                    point of view it may be understood that the book should have been intended by
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n102/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0102-0091"/> the author as a contribution to natural science,
                    and should be almost entirely free from the superstitious whims and
                    hallucinations which, while leaving his faculties as a thinker and a natural
                    philosopher almost unaffected, frequently misled him in the affairs of practical
                    life. Numerous instances of his belief in dreams and omens may be collected from
                    his writings, and he especially valued himself on being one of the five or six
                    celebrated men to whom, as to Socrates, had been vouchsafed the assistance of a
                    guardian daemon.</p>
                <p>Cardan’s authorship may have interferedwith his medical practice, and he himself
                    ingenuously confesses that he aud his family were mainly supported during a
                    considerable part of this period by the complaisance of a Milanese patrician,
                    who allowed him to win of him at play. The sudden loss of this resource reduced
                    him for a time to penury, from which he was extricated by receiving the
                    appointment of professor of medicine at Pavia. The publication of his works on
                    algebra and astrology at this juncture gave him a European renown, and procured
                    him flattering offers from Pope Paul III and the king of Denmark, both of which
                    he declined. In 1551 his reputation was crowned by the publication of his great
                    work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Subtilitate</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Rerum,</hi> which, crude and fanciful as it may now appear, in his
                    own age embodied the soundest physical learning of the time and simultaneously
                    represented its most advanced spirit of speculation. It was followed some years
                    later by a similar treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Varietate</hi><hi rend="italic">Rerum,</hi> the two making in effect but one
                    book. A great portion of this is occupied by endeavours, commonly futile, to
                    explain ordinary natural phenomena, but its chief interest for us consists in
                    the hints and glimpses it affords of principles beyond the full comprehension of
                    the writer himself, and which the world was then by no means ready to entertain.
                    The inorganic realm of Nature he asserts to be animated no less than the
                    organic; all creation is progressive development; all animals were originally
                    worms; the inferior metals must be regarded as <hi rend="italic">conatus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">naturae</hi> towards the production of gold. The indefinite
                    variability of species is implied in the remark that Nature is seldom content
                    with a single variation from a customary type. The oviparous habits of birds are
                    explained by their tendency to favour the perpetuation of the species, precisely
                    in the manner of modern naturalists. Animals were not created for the use of
                    man, but exist for their own sakes. The origin of life depends upon cosmic laws,
                    which Cardan naturally connects with his favourite study of astrology. The
                    physical divergencies of mankind arise from the effects of climate, and the
                    variety of human circumstances in general. Cardan’s views on the dissimilarity
                    of languages are much more philosophical than usual at his time; and his
                    treatise altogether, though weak in particular details, is strong in its
                    pervading sense of the unity and omnipotence of natural law, which renders it in
                    some degree an adumbration of the course of science since the author’s day. It
                    was attacked by J. C. Scaliger, whom Cardan refuted without difficulty.</p>
                <p>The celebrity which Cardan had acquired led in the same year (1551) to one of the
                    most interesting episodes of his life, his journey to Scotland as the medical
                    adviser of Archbishop Hamilton of St Andrews. The archbishop was supposed to be
                    suffering from consumption, a complaint which Cardan, under a false impression,
                    as he frankly admits, had represented himself as competent to cure. Failing to
                    meet his patient at Lyons as had been arranged, he was induced to continue his
                    journey to Scotland. He was of great service to the archbishop, whose complaint
                    proved to be asthmatical; but the principal interest attaching to his expedition
                    is derived from his account of the disputes of the medical faculty at Paris, and
                    of the court of Edward VI. of England, particulars which he had an opportunity
                    of observing in going and returning. The Parisian doctors were disturbed by the
                    heresies of Vesalius, who was beginning to introduce anatomical study from the
                    human subject. Cardan’s liberality of temper led him to sympathize with the
                    innovator. His account of Edward VI.’s disposition and understanding is
                    extremely favourable, and is entitled to credit as that of a competent observer
                    without bias towards either side of the religious question. He cast the king’s
                    nativity, and indulged in a number of predictions which were effectually
                    confuted by the royal youth’s death in the following year. His impressions of
                    England seem to have been very pleasant.</p>
                <p>Cardan had now attained the summit of his prosperity, and the rest of his life
                    was little but a series of disasters. His principal misfortunes arose from the
                    crimes and calamities of his sons, one of whom was an utter reprobate, while the
                    tragic fate of the other overwhelmed the father with anguish. This son, Giovanni
                    Battista, also a physician, had contracted an imprudent marriage with a girl of
                    indifferent character, Brandonia Seroni, who subsequently proved unfaithful to
                    him. The injured husband revenged himself in the Italian fashion with poison;
                    the deed was detected, and the exceptional severity of the punishment seems to
                    justify Cardan in attributing it to the rancour of his medical rivals, with whom
                    he had never at any time been on good terms. He exerted himself greatly as his
                    son’s advocate, but to no purpose. The blow all but crushed him; his reputation
                    and his practice waned; he addicted himself to gaming, a vice to which he had
                    always been prone; his mind became unhinged, and filled with distempered
                    imaginations. He was ultimately banished from Milan on some accusation not
                    specified, and although the decree was ultimately rescinded, he found it
                    advisable to accept a professorship at Bologna (1563). While residing there in
                    moderate comfort, and mainly occupied with the composition of supplements to his
                    former works, he was suddenly arrested on a charge not stated, but in all
                    probability heresy. Though he had always been careful to keep on terms with the
                    .Church, the bent of his mind had been palpably towards free thought, and the
                    circumstance had probably attracted the attention of Pius V., who then ruled the
                    Church in the spirit, as he had formerly exercised the functions, of an
                    inquisitor. Through the intercession, as would appear, of some influential
                    cardinals, Cardan was released, but was deprived of his professorship,
                    prohibited from teaching and publishing any further, and removed to Rome, where
                    he spent his remaining years in receipt of a pension from the Pope. It seems to
                    have been urged in his favour that his intellect had been disturbed by grief for
                    the loss of his son,—an assertion to which his frequent hallucinations lent some
                    countenance, though the existence of any serious derangement is disproved by the
                    lucidity and coherence of his last writings. He occupied his time at Rome in the
                    composition of his commentaries <hi rend="italic">De Vita Propria,</hi> which,
                    along with a companion treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Libris Propriis,</hi> is our principal authority for his biography. Though he
                    had burned much, he left behind him more than a hundred MSS., not twenty of
                    which have been printed. He died on September 20, 1576.</p>
                <p>Alike intellectually and morally, Cardan is one of the most interesting
                    personages connected with the revival of science in Europe. He had no especial
                    bent towards any scientific pursuit, but appears as the man of versatile
                    ability, delighting in research for its own sake, and capable of prosecuting it
                    to great lengths by dint of perseverance and sagacity. He possessed the true
                    scientific spirit in perfection; nothing, he tells us, among the king of
                    France’s treasures appeared to him so worthy of admiration as a certain natural
                    curiosity which he took for the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n103/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0103-0092"/> horn of a unicorn. It has been injurious to his
                    fame to have been compelled to labour, partly in fields of research where no
                    important discovery was then attainable, partly in those where his discoveries
                    could only serve as the stepping-stones to others, by which they were inevitably
                    eclipsed. His^medical career serves as an illustration of the former case, and
                    his mathematical of the latter. His medical knowledge was wholly empirical;
                    restrained by the authority of Galen, and debarred from the practice of anatomy,
                    nothing more could be expected than that he should stumble on some fortunate
                    nostrums. As a mathematician, on the other hand, he effected most important
                    advances in science, but such as merely paved the way for discoveries which have
                    obscured his own. From his astrology no results could be expected; but even here
                    the scientific character of his mind is displayed in his common sense treatment
                    of what usually passed for a mystical and occult study. His prognostications are
                    as strictly empirical as his prescriptions, and rest quite as much upon the
                    observations which he supposed himself to have made in his practice. As
                    frequently is the case with men incapable of rightly ordering their own lives,
                    he is full of wisdom and sound advice for others; his ethical precepts and
                    practical rules are frequently excellent. To complete the catalogue of his
                    accomplishments, he is no contemptible poet.</p>
                <p>The work of Cardan’s, however, which retains most interest for this generation is
                    his autobiography, <hi rend="italic">De Vita Propria.</hi> In its clearness and
                    frankness of self revelation this book stands almost alone among records of its
                    class. It may be compared with the autobiography of another celebrated Italian
                    of the age, Benvenuto Cellini, but is much more free from vanity and
                    self-consciousness, unless the extreme candour with which Cardan reveals his own
                    errors is to be regarded as vanity in a more subtle form. The general impression
                    is highly favourable to the writer, whose impetuosity and fits of reckless
                    dissipation appear as mere exaggerations of the warmth of heart which imparted
                    such strength to his domestic affections, and in the region of science imparted
                    that passionate devotion to research which could alone have enabled him to
                    persevere so resolutely, and effect such marked advances in such multifarious
                    fields of inquiry.</p>
                <p>Cardan’s autobiography has been most ably condensed, and at the same time
                    supplemented by information from the geneι∙al body of his writings and other
                    sources, by Professor Henry Morley <hi rend="italic">{Jerome Cardan,</hi> 1854,
                    2 vols.). His capital treatises <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Subtilitate</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Varietate
                    Rerum</hi> are combined and fully analyzed in vol. ii. of Rixner and Siber's <hi

                    >Jahrhunderts</hi> (Sulzbach, 1820). Cardan’s works were edited in ten volumes
                    bySponius (Lyons, 1663). A biography was prefixed by Gabriel Naudé, whose
                    unreasonable depreciation has unduly lowered Cardan’s character with posterity.
