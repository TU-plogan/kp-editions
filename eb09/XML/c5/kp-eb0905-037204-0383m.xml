                    (1691-1781), an eminent Roman Catholic prelate, born at Lewes, Sussex, 29th
                    September 1691. After the death of his father, who was a rigid Dissenter, his
                    mother sought refuge with some Roman Catholic families, the consequence being
                    that the son was brought up in their religion, chiefly at the seat of Mr Holman
                    at Warkworth, Northamptonshire, where the Rev. John Gother, a celebrated
                    controversialist, officiated as chaplain. In 1704 he was sent to the English
                    College at Douay, where he was ordained a priest, took his degrees in divinity,
                    and was appointed professor in that faculty. In 1730 he was sent on the English
                    mission and stationed in London. The controversial treatises that he now
                    published in rapid succession attracted much attention, particularly his <hi
                    rend="italic">Catholic Christian Instructed,</hi> which was prefaced by a witty
                    reply to Dr Conyers Middleton’s <hi rend="italic">Letter from Rome, showing an
                    exact conformity between Popery and Paganism.</hi> Middleton is said to have
                    been so irritated that he endeavoured to put the penal laws in force against his
                    antagonist, who prudently withdrew from London until the commotion subsided. On
                    29th January 1741, Challoner was raised to the episcopal dignity at Hammersmith,
                    by the title of bishop of Debra, <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >partibus infidelium,</hi> and nominated coadjutor, <hi rend="italic">cum
                    jure</hi><hi rend="italic">successionis,</hi> to Bishop Petre, Vicar-Apostolic
                    of the London district. Accordingly, on the decease of that prelate in 1758,
                    Challυner succeeded to the Vicariate-Apostolic. He resided principally in
                    London, but was obliged to retire into the country during the “No Popery” riots
                    of 1780. Soon afterwards he died, on January 12, 1781, and was buried at Milton,
                    Berkshire. Bishop Chailoner was the author of numerous controversial and
                    devotional works, which have been frequently reprinted and translated into
                    various languages. He compiled the <hi rend="italic">Garden of the Soul,</hi>
                    which continues to this day to be the most popular manual of devotion among
                    English-speaking Roman Catholics; and he revised an edition of the Douay version
                    of the Scriptures <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n384/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0384-0373"/> (1749-50), correcting the language and
                    orthography, which in many places had become obsolete. Of his historical works
                    the most valuable is one which was intended to be a Roman Catholic antidote to
                    Foxe’s well-known martyrology. īt is entitled <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    Missionary Priests and other Catholidcs of both Sexes who suffered Death or
                    Imprisonment in England on account of their Religion, from the year</hi> 1577

                    reprinted in 1803. Bishop Challoner also published anonymously, in 1745, the
                    lives of English, Scotch, and Irish saints, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
