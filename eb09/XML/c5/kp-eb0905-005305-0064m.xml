                    Ireland. The word is frequently spelt otherwise, as Capercalze, Capercailzie
                    (the z, a letter unknown in Gaelic, being pronounced like <hi rend="italic"
                    >y),</hi> and Capercaillie, and the English name of Wood-Grouse or
                    Cock-of-the-wood has been often applied to the same bird. The earliest notice of
                    it as an inhabitant of North Britain seems to be by Hector Boethius, whose works
                    were published in 1526 <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> and it can then be traced
                    through various Scottish writers, to whom however it was evidently but little
                    known, for about 200 years, or may be more, and by one of them only, Bishop
                    Lesly in 1578, was a definite <hi rend="italic">habitat</hi> assigned to it
                    :—“In Rossia quoque Louguhabria [Lochaber], atque aliis montanis locis’ <hi
                    rend="italic">(De Origine Moribus de rebus gestis Scotorum.</hi> Romae: ed.
                    1675, p. 24). Pennant, during one of his tours in Scotland, found that it was
                    then (1769) still to be met with in Glen Moriston and in the Chisholm’s country,
                    whence he saw a cock-bird. We may infer that it became extinct about that time,
                    since Mr Gray <hi rend="italic">(Birds of the West of Scotland,</hi> p. 229)
                    quotes the Rev. John Grant as writing in 1794 :— “The last seen in Scotland was
                    in the woods of Strathglass about thirty-two years ago.” Of its existence in
                    Ireland we have scarcely more details. If we may credit the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pavones</hi><hi rend="italic">sylvestres</hi> of Giraldus Cambrensis with being
                    of this species, it was once abundant there, and Willughby (1678) was told that
                    it was known in that kingdom as the “Cock-of-the-wood.” A few other writers
                    mention it by the same name, and Rutty, in 1772, says <hi rend="italic">(Nat.
                    Hist. Dublin,</hi> i. p. 302) that “one was seen in the county of Leitrim about
                    the year 1710, but they have entirely disappeared of late, by reason of the
                    destruction of our woods.” Pennant also states that about 1760 a few were to be
                    found about Thomastown in Tipperary, but no later evidence is forthcoming, and
                    thus it would seem that the species was exterminated at nearly the same period
                    both in Ireland and Scotland.</p>
                <p>When the practice of planting was introduced, the restoration of this fine bird
                    to both countries was attempted. In Ireland the trial, of which some particulars
                    are given by Thompson <hi rend="italic">(Birds of Ireland,</hi> ii. p. 32), was
                    made at Glengariff, but it seems to have utterly failed, whereas in Scotland,
                    where it was begun at Taymouth, it finally succeeded, and the species is now not
                    only firmly established, but is increasing in numbers and range. The late Mr
                    Lloyd, author of several excellent works on the wild sports and natural history
                    of Scandinavia, supplied the stock from Sweden, but it must be always borne in
                    mind that the original British race was wholly extinct, and no remains of it are
                    known to exist in any museum.</p>
                <p>This species is widely, though intermittently, distributed on the continent of
                    Europe, from Lapland to the northern parts of Spain, Italy, and Greece, but is
                    always restricted to pine-forests, which alone afford it food in winter. Its
                    bones have been found in the kitchen-middens of Denmark, proving that country to
                    have once been clothed with woods of that kind. More lately its remains have
                    been recognized from the caves of Aquitaine. Its eastern or southern limits in
                    Asia cannot be precisely given, but it certainly inhabits the forests of a great
                    part of Siberia. On the Stannovoi Mountains, however, it is replaced by a
                    distinct though nearly allied species, the <hi rend="italic">T.
                    urogalloides</hi> of Dr von Middendorff<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Not to be confounded with the bird so named previously by
                    Prof. Ni!≡son, which is an hybrid.</p></note> which is smaller with a slenderer
                    bill but longer tail.</p>
                <p>The Cock-of-the-wood is remarkable for his large size and glossy-black plumage.
                    He is polygamous, and in spring mounts to the topmost bough of a tall tree,
                    whence he challenges all comers by extraordinary sounds and gestures; while the
                    hens, which are much smaller and mottled in colour, timidly abide below the
                    result of the frequent duels, patiently submitting themselves to the victor.
                    While this is going on it is the practice in many countries, though generally in
                    defiance of the law, for the so-called sportsman stealthily to draw nigh, and
                    with well-aimed rifle to murder the principal performer in the scene. The hen
                    makes an artless nest on the ground, and lays therein from seven to nine or even
                    more eggs. The young are able to fly soon after they are hatched, and towards
                    the end of summer and beginning of autumn, from feeding on the fruit and leaves
                    of the bilberries and other similar plants, which form the undercovert of the
                    forests, get into excellent condition and become good eating. With the first
                    heavy falls of snow they betake themselves to the trees, and then, feeding on
                    the pine-leaves, their flesh speedily acquires so strong a flavour of turpentine
                    as to be distasteful to most palates. The usual method of pursuing this species
                    on the Continent is by encouraging a trained dog to range the forest and spring
                    the birds, which then perch on the trees; while he is baying at the foot theiι
                    attention is so much attracted by him that they permit the near approach of his
                    master, who thus obtains a more or less easy shot. A considerable number,
                    however, are also snared. Hybrids are very frequently produced between the
                    Capercally and the Black Grouse <hi rend="italic">(T. tetrix),</hi> and the
