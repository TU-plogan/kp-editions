                    (1675-1729), a celebrated English philosopher and divine, was the son of Edward
                    Clarke, alderman of Norwich, who had represented that city in parliament for
                    several years. He was born October 11, 1675; and having finished his education
                    at the free school of Norwich in 1691, removed thence to Caius College,
                    Cambridge, where his uncommon abilities soon began to display themselves. Though
                    the philosophy of Descartes was at that time the reigning system at the
                    university, yet Clarke easily mastered the new system of Newton, and contributed
                    greatly to the spread of the Newtonian philosophy by publishing an excellent
                    translation of Rohault’s <hi rend="italic">Physics</hi> with notes, which he
                    finished before he was twenty-two years of age. The system of Rohault was
                    founded entirely upon Cartesian principles, and was previously known only
                    through the medium of a rude Latin version. Clarke not only gave a new
                    translation, but added to it such notes as were calculated to lead students
                    insensibly to other and truer notions of science. “The success,” says Bishop
                    Hoadley, “answered exceedingly well to his hopes; and he may justly be styled a
                    great benefactor to the university in this attempt.” It continued to be used as
                    a text-book in the university till supplanted by the treatises of Newton, which
                    it had been designed to introduce. Whiston relates that, in 1697, he met young
                    Clarke (at that time chaplain to Moore, bishop of Norwich), then wholly unknown
                    to him, at a coffee-house in that city, where they entered into conversation
                    about the Cartesian philosophy, particularly Rohault’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Physics,</hi> which Clarke’s tutor, as he tells us, had put him upon
                    translating, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> The result of this conversation
                    was,” says Whiston, “that I was greatly surprised that so young a man as Clarke
                    then was should know so much of those sublime discoveries, which were then
                    almost a secret to all but to a few particular mathematicians. Nor do I
                    remember,” continues he, “above one or two at the most, whom I had then met
                    with, that seemed to know so much of that philosophy as Clarke.” This
                    translation of Rohault was first printed in 1697, 8vo. There have been four
                    editions of it: the last and best is that of 1718, which has the following title

                    translated into English by Dr John Clarke, dean of Sarum, and published in two
                    vols. 8vo.</p>
                <p>Clarke afterwards turned his thoughts to divinity, and in order to qualify
                    himself for the sacred office, devoted himself to the study of Scripture in the
                    original, and of the primitive Christian writers. Having taken holy orders, he
                    became chaplain to Moore, bishop of Norwich, who was ever afterwards his
                    constant friend and patron. In 1699 he published two treatises,—one entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Three Practical Essays on Baptism, Confirmation, and</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Repentance,</hi> and the other, <hi rend="italic">Some
                        Reflections on that part of a book called A rnyntor, or a Defence of
                        Milton’s Life, which relates to the Writings of the Primitive Fathers, and
                        the Canon of the New Testament.</hi> In 1701 he published <hi rend="italic"
                        >A Paraphrase upon the Gospel of St Matthew,</hi> which was followed, in
                    1702, by the <hi rend="italic">Paraphrases upon the Gospels of St Mark and St
                        Luke,</hi> and soon afterwards by a third volume upon St John. They were
                    subsequently printed together in two volumes 8vo, and have since passed through
                    several editions. He intended to have treated in the same manner the remaining
                    books of the New Testament, but something accidentally interrupted the execution
                    of his design.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Bishop Moore gave him the rectory of Drayton, near Norwich, and
                    procured him a parish in the city. In 1704 he was appointed to the Boyle
                    lectureship, and chose for his subject the Being and Attributes of God. Having
                    been appointed to the same office in the following year, he chose for his
                    subject the Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion. These lectures were
                    first printed in two distinct volumes, but were afterwards collected together,
                    and published under the general title of <hi rend="italic">A Discourse
                        concerning the Being and Attributes of God, the Obligations of Natural
                        Religion, and the Truth and Certainty of the Christian Revelation, in
                        opposition to Hobbes, Spinoza, the author of the Oracles of Reason, and
                        other Deniers of Natural and Revealed Religion.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1706 he wrote a refutation of some positions which had been maintained by Dr
                    Dodwell on the immortality of the soul, and this drew him into controversy with
                    Collins. He also at this time wrote a translation of Newton’s Optics, for which
                    the author presented him with £500. In the same year also, through the influence
                    of Bishop Moore, he obtained the rectory of St Bennet’s, Paul’s Wharf, Loudon;
                    and he soon afterwards appeared at the court of Queen Anne, who appointed him
                    one of her chaplains in ordinary, and afterwards, in 1709, presented him to the
                    rectory of St James’s, Westminster. On his elevation to this latter office, he
                    took the degree of doctor in divinity, defending as his thesis the two
                    propositions :—“1. <hi rend="italic">Nullum</hi><hi rend="italic">fidei</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Christianoe dogma, in</hi><hi rend="italic">Sacris Scripturis

                    delivered in the Holy Scriptures, is disagreeable to right reason, and 2. <hi

                        rend="italic">nulla potest esse</hi><hi rend="italic">religio,</hi> without
                    the liberty of human actions, there can be no religion. During the same year, at
                    the request of the author, he revised and corrected Whiston’s English
                    translation of the <hi rend="italic">Apostolical Constitutions.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1712 he published a carefully punctuated and annotated edition of Caesar’s
                    Commentaries, adorned with elegant engravings. It was printed in folio, 1712,
                    and afterwards in 8vo, 1720, and dedicated to the duke of Marlborough. During
                    the same year he published his celebrated treatise on <hi rend="italic">The
                        Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity.</hi> It is divided into three parts. The
                    first contains a collection and exegesis of all the texts in the New Testament
                    relating to the doctrine of the Trinity; in the second the doctrine is set forth
                    at large, and explained in particular and distinct propositions; and in the
                    third the principal passages in the liturgy of the Church of England relating to
                    the doctrine of the Trinity are considered. WTιiston informs us that, some time
                    before the publication of this book, a message was sent to him from Lord
                    Godolphin and other ministers of Queen Anne, importing “that the affairs of the
                    public were with difficulty then kept in the hands of those that were for
                    liberty; that it was therefore an unseasonable time for the publication of a
                    book that would make a great noise and disturbance; and that therefore they
                    desired him to forbear till a fitter opportunity should offer itself,”—a message
                    that Clarke of course entirely disregarded. The ministers were right in their
                    conjectures; and the work not only provoked a great number of replies, but
                    occasioned a formal complaint from the Lower House of Convocation. Clarke, in
                    reply, drew up an apologetic preface, and afterwards gave several explanations,
                    which satisfied the Upper House; and on his pledging himself that his future
                    conduct would occasion no trouble, the matter dropped.</p>
                <p>In 1715 and 1716 he had a discussion with Leibnitz relative to the principles of
                    natural philosophy and religion, which was at length cut short by the death of
                    his antagonist. A collection of the papers which passed between them was
                    published in 1717. In 1719 he was presented by Lord Lechmere to the mastership
                    of Wigston’s hospital in Leicester. In 1724 he published seventeen sermons,
                    eleven of which had not before been printed. In 1727, upon the death of Sir
                    Isaac Newton, he was offered by the court the place of Master of the Mint, worth
                    on an average from £1200 to £1500 a year. This secular preferment, however, he
                    absolutely refused,—a circumstance which Whiston regards as “one of the most
                    glorious actions of his life, and affording undeniable conviction that he was in
                    earnest in his religion.” In 1728 was published “A Letter from Dr Clarke to
                    Benjamin Hoadley, F.R.S., occasioned by the controversy relating to the
                    Proportion of Velocity and Force in Bodies in Motion,” printed in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi> In 1729 he published the
                    first twelve books of Homer’s <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> This edition was
                    printed in quarto, and dedicated to the duke of Cumberland. “The translation of
                    Homer, who was Clarke’s favourite author,” says Bishop Hoadley, “with his
                    corrections, may now be styled accurate; and his notes, as far as they go, are
                    indeed a treasury of grammatical and critical knowledge. He was called to his
                    task by royal command, and he has performed it in such a manner as to be worthy
                    of the young prince for whom it was laboured.” The year of its publication was
                    the last of Clarke’s life. Hitherto, though not robust, he had always enjoyed a
                    firm state of health; but on the morning of Sunday, 11th May 1729, when going
                    out to preach before the judges at Sergeant’s Inn, he was seized with a sudden
                    illness, which caused his death on the Saturday morning following. He died, May
                    17, 1729, in the 54th year of his age.</p>
                <p>Soon after his death were published, from his original manuscripts, by his
                    brother Dr John Clarke, dean of Sarum, <hi rend="italic">An Exposition of the
                        Church Catechism,</hi> and ten volumes of sermons, in 8vo. His <hi
                        rend="italic">Exposition</hi> is composed of the lectures which he read
                    every Thursday morning, for some months in the year, at St James’s church. In
                    the latter part of his life he revised them with great care, and left them
                    completely prepared for the press. Three years after his death appeared also the
                    last twelve books of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> published in 4to by his
                    son Mr Samuel Clarke, the first three of these books and part of the fourth
                    having, as he states, been revised and annotated by his father.</p>
                <p>Clarke was of a cheerful and even playful disposition. An intimate friend relates
                    that happening to call for him he found him swimming upon a table. At another
                    time, when Clarke and several other men of ability and learning were indulging
                    in diversion, on looking out at the window he saw a grave blockhead approaching
                    the house; upon which <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n825/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0825-0812"/> hø cried out, “Boys, boys, be wise; here
                    comes a 1‘ooL” This turn of his mind is confirmed by Dr Warton, who, in his
                    observations upon the line of Mr Pope,</p>
                <p>“Unthought-of frailties cheat us in the wise,” says, “Who could imagine that
                    Locke was fond of romances; that Newton once studied astrology; that Dr Clarke
                    valued himself on his agility, and frequently amused himself in a private room
                    of his house in leaping over the tables and chairs; and that our author himself
                    was a great epicure 1”</p>
                <p>[Clarke, although in no department a genius of the first order, was a man of
                    great general ability. He was eminent as a theologian, a mathematician, a
                    metaphysician, and a philologist. His chief strength lay in his logical power.
                    He was so disciplined and skilful a reasoner as to be able to contend on equal
                    terms even with a Butler or a Leibnitz. Few have defended so well so many good
                    causes. The materialism of Hobbes, the pantheism of Spinoza, the empiricism of
                    Locke, the determinism of Leibnitz, Collins’s necessitarianism, Dodwell’s denial
                    of the natural immortality of the soul, rationalistic attacks on Christianity,
                    and the selfish morality of the sensationalists,— all found in him a formidable
                    opponent, possessed of great strength of mind, extraordinary dialectic skill,
                    and a thorough conviction of the importance and truth of the principles which he
                    advocated.</p>
                <p>His fame as a theologian and philosopher rests to a large extent on his
                    demonstration of the existence of God and his theory of the foundation of
                    rectitude. The former is not, as it is often described, a purely <hi
                        rend="italic">a priori</hi> argument, nor is it presented as such by its
                    author. It starts from a fact, aud it often explicitly appeals to facts. The
                    intelligence, for example, of the self-existence and original cause of all
                    things—the main question between theists and atheists—is admitted to be “not
                    easily proved <hi rend="italic">a priori,”</hi> but argued to be “demonstrably
                    proved <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> from the variety and degrees of
                    perfection in things, and the order of causes and effects, from the intelligence
                    that created beings are confessedly endowed with, and from the beauty, order,
                    and final purpose of things.” The propositions maintained in the argument
                    are—“1. That something has existed from eternity; 2. That there has existed from
                    eternity some one immutable and independent being; 3. That that immutable and
                    independent being, which has existed from eternity, without any external cause
                    of its existence, must be self-oxistent, that is, necessarily existing; 4. What
                    the substance or essence of that being, which is self-existent or necessarily
                    existing, is, we have no idea, neither is it at all possible for us to
                    comprehend it; 5. That though the substance or essence of the self-existent
                    being is itself absolutely incomprehensible to us, yet many of the essential
                    attributes of his nature are strictly demonstrable, as well as his existence,
                    and, in the first place, that he must be of necessity eternal; 6. That the
                    self-existent being must of necessity be infinite and omnipresent, 7. Must be
                    but one, 8. Must be an intelligent being, 9. Must be not a necessary agent, but
                    a being indued with liberty and choice, 10. Must of necessity have infinite
                    power, 11. Must be infinitely wise, and 12. Must of necessity be a being of
                    infinite goodness, justice, and truth, and all other moral perfections, such as
                    become the supreme governor and judge of the world.”</p>
                <p>In order to establish his sixth proposition, Dr Clarke contends that time and
                    space, eternity and immensity, are not substances but attributes,—the attributes
                    of a self-existent being. Edmund Law, Dugald Stewart, Lord Brougham, and many
                    other writers, have, in consequence, represented Clarke as arguing from the
                    existence of time and space to the existence of Deity. This is a serious
                    mistake. The existence of an immutable, independent, and necessary being is
                    supposed to be proved before any reference is made to the nature of time and
                    space. Clarke has been generally supposed to have derived the opinion that time
                    and space are attributes of an infinite immaterial and spiritual being from the
                        <hi rend="italic">Scholium,</hi><hi rend="italic">Generale,</hi> first
                    published in the second edition of Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi>
                    (1714). The truth is that his work on the Being and Attributes of God appeared
                    nine years before that <hi rend="italic">Scholium.</hi> The view propounded by
                    Clarke may have been derived from the Midrasb, the Kabbalah, Philo, Henry More,
                    or Cudworth, but not from Newton. It is a view difficult to prove, and probably
                    few will acknowledge that Clarke has conclusively proved it.</p>
                <p>His theory as to the nature, foundation, and obligation of virtue is to the
                    following effect. Things differ from one another in their natures. They
                    necessarily, therefore, stand in different relations to one another. From these
                    different relations of things there must arise an agreement or disagreement of
                    some things to others, a fitness or unfitness of the application of different
                    things one to another. Thus there is a fitness or suitableness of certain acts
                    in certain circumstances to certain persons and an unsuitableness of others
                    founded on the nature of things and persons, apart from all positive appointment
                    whatsoever. It is only imperfection or perversion of intelligence which can make
                    the relations of things, and the fitness and unfitness involved in them, appear
                    to be other than what they are. The fundamental truths of morals are absolutely
                    and in themselves what they seem, no less than the truths of geometry. The
                    obligation to virtue is involved in the very recognition of the moral relations
                    which arise out of the necessary and eternal differences of things. It is
                    impossible for us to apprehend them otherwise than as laws of reason which ought
                    to guide our actions. Prior to all consideration of the divine will or law there
                    is obligation; and God, although under no necessity to create, must, having
                    resolved to create, have respect to certain proportions, abstractly of eternal
                    necessity, and, having resolved to act, must determine His will according to
                    eternal reason. His own law to himself is the law which He has given to every
                    rational being, and which He has sanctioned by rewards and punishments. These
                    are a secondary source of obligation.</p>
                <p>This theory has been misunderstood and misrepresented in various ways. Jouffroy,
                    Amédée Jacques, Sir James Mackintosh, Dr Thomas Brown, &amp;c., criticise it on
                    the assumption that Clarke made virtue consist in conformity to the relations of
                    things universally, although the whole tenor of his argument shows him to have
                    had in view only conformity to such relations as belong to the sphere of moral
                    agency. We may admit, however, that he might have profitably insisted more on
                    the fact that the relations and fitnesses spoken of are those which afford a
                    reason and rule of action to the will. In this respect the doctrine of the
                    distinguished German philosopher Herbart, which, while resolving morality into
                    relations, lays stress on the fact that these relations are relations of will,
                    may be regarded as an improvement of that of Clarke. It is erroneous to
                    represent Clarke as confounding mathematical and moral relations, as overlooking
                    that the relations involved in morality must be distinct from those involved in
                    mere truth, or as meaning by the “fitness” which is constitutive of morality the
                    adaptation of means and ends. In reality, he simply-states an analogy between
                    mathematical and moral truths, assigns to moral principles the distinctive
                    peculiarity of being related to the will, and being liable to be set aside,-and
                    denotes by fitness the accordance of things with a standard by which they can be
                    judged.</p>
                <p>When Clarke’s doctrine, that rectitude is a conformity to certain relations, has
                    been accurately understood, it cannot fail to be obvious that, although it must
                    be vindicated from <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0826-0813"/> many of the objections which have been urged
                    against it, no one can justly regard it as more than the mere starting-point of
                    a theory. It must be followed up by a great amount of research before it can
                    approximate to what a theory should be. But there is no reason why it should not
                    be followed up by research in various directions, nor why it should not be made
                    much more precise and definite than it has yet been. The relations involved in
                    morality may be compared with those involved in pure science, in utility both
                    personal and general, and in beauty, and ought to be, for it is only thus that
                    what is distinctive of them can be brought clearly and completely out. More,
                    perhaps, than any other theory on the nature of virtue, the theory of relations
                    suggests and implies the necessity of a minute scientific inquiry into how
                    truth, beauty, utility, and goodness are connected and distinguished. By
                    Socrates and Wollaston truth and goodness, by Plato, Shaftesbury, and Herbart
                    beauty and goodness, and by the selfish school and the utilitarian school of
                    moralists, utility and goodness, have been, if not identified, too nearly so,
                    while there have been held errors as great although directly contrary to these,
                    separating unnaturally goodness from truth, or from beauty, or from utility; and
                    it lies directly in the way of those who adopt the theory of relations to
                    institute an investigation into the whole subject of the connection of truth,
                    beauty, utility, and goodness, so thorough and comprehensive as to show what is
                    true and what erroneous in all these views, and what are the resemblances and
                    differences, the identities and distinctions, in the things themselves.</p>
