                <p><label type="entry">CHARLES II</label>. (1G30-1685), king of England, born in
                    1630, though the second son of Charles I., was Prince of Wales from his birth.
                    In the earlier and more important campaigns of the Civil War he held a nominal
                    command in the west, but he was too young to take any real part in the conflict.
                    After the battle of Naseby he passed by way of Scilly and Jersey to join his
                    mother at St Germain Till 1649 he spent his time either at Paris or at the
                    Hague, without interfering in public affairs, except when he attempted to save
                    his father’s life by forwarding a signed <hi rend="italic">carte blanche</hi> to
                    the Parliament to be filled up with any terms which they would accept as the
                    price of his safety. On the execution of Charles I., he immediately assumed the
                    title of king. The Scotch Government offered to place him on the throne by
                    force, and sent a deputation to the Hague. For a time Charles protracted the
                    négociations, meanwhile urging Montrose to make him independent of the
                    Presbyterians. But when the rising was crushed, and Montrose himself executed,
                    he accepted their invitation. In June 1650 he landed in Scotland; and he was
                    crowned at Scone on the 1st January 1651. Butas he had been obliged to sign the
                    Covenant, and conform to the austere manners of the Covenanters, he soon began
                    to feel the price of their assistance intolerably heavy. The secret efforts
                    which, during the whole time he was treating with the Presbyterians, he had been
                    making to bring together a sufficient force of Highlanders proved unsuccessful;
                    and, on the defeat of Leslie at Dunbar, he was glad to march south, with the
                    hope of arousing the loyalty of the English. The appeal failed; and the royalist
                    forces were again routed by Cromwell at Worcester (1651). Thanks to his own
                    great coolness and address, and the fidelity of those in whom he confided,
                    Charles contrived to reach France. Here he remained till 1654, when, having
                    received a pension from the French king, he retired to Cologne. Thence he
                    removed to Bruges, where he principally resided till the death of Cromwell. For
                    the most part, notwithstanding the smallness of his means and the wretchedness
                    of his circumstances, he passed his time in careless dissipation, surrounded by
                    a little court in which the few old cavaliers, like Clarendon, who maintained
                    the dignified manners which had adorned the court of Charles L, were lost in a
                    crowd of gay young libertines and sprightly women of disreputable character. His
                    applications for assistance to France and Rome were all unheeded; and he was
                    equally unsuccessful in his attempts to contract an advantageous marriage. At
                    length, through the contrivance of General Monk, but still more through the open
                    and enthusiastic wish of a large portion of the people, he was recalled to
                    England; his conciliatory declaration from Breda was well received; and he
                    entered London amid sincere public rejoicings on his thirtieth birthday, May 29,
                    1660.</p>
                <p>Charles’s course was at first attended by no difficulty. The loyalty of the
                    Convention summoned by Monk was sufficient for the time. It sympathized in the
                    one desire for vengeance in which he was earnest; it was resolved on the
                    punishment of the regicides. Thirteen were executed, some in direct opposition
                    to the apparent intention of the king’s declaration of oblivion; the bodies of
                    Cromwell and Ireton were hung in chains; and even the coffin which contained the
                    ashes of Blake was cast out of Westminster Abbey, and thrown into a common
                    churchyard. And, finally, though some of the measures of the Convention prove
                    that it had not lost all the spirit of the Long Parliament which preceded it, it
                    showed its enthusiastic loyalty in a manner very agreeable to Charles, viz., by
                    granting him the dangerous gift of £1,200,000 a year for life. But if the
                    Convention was sufficiently loyal, the royalism of the first regular Parliament
                    of the reign was extravagant. It insisted on the prerogative of the sovereign,
                    and abased itself before him. At his express request it repealed the Triennial
                    Act; and it allowed him to declare that he would not be forced by that Act to
                    summon frequent parliaments, if he believed that they would be disadvantageous
                    to the Crown. It showed much reluctance to confirm the Act of Indemnity. It
                    assisted him to complete his revenge by the sacrifice of Vane and Lambert, whom
                    he had pledged his word to spare. But its royalism was equalled by its
                    attachment to tho Church of England; and thus commenced its opposition to the
                    sovereign it professed to worship. Charles desired to tolerate the Catholics,
                    and accordingly issued a General Declaration of Indulgence. Its illegality,
                    however, raised so much opposition, even among the Protestant dissenters whom it
                    benefited, that he prudently recalled it, and even published a proclamation
                    banishing all Roman Catholic priests.</p>
                <p>It was, indeed, the Protestant temper of the nation which was the most powerful
                    influence against which Charles’s policy had to contend. Fortunately for himself
                    he was able to estimate its strength. Himself a Roman Catholic, he made several
                    attempts to grant toleration to his coreligionists; but he always gave way when
                    the anti-popish passion seized the people. Twice he yielded to a degree which
                    more than any other of his acts displays the utter selfishness of his character.
                    In order to blind the people, and prepare the way for the trial of Shaftesbury,
                    he sacrificed the Catholic Archbishop Plunkett, the accusation against whom was
                    supported only by the most worthless witnesses. But the basest compliance of
                    which he was guilty was in the case of the pretended Popish plot. He did nothing
                    to allay the popular frenzy; he allowed Oates to be handsomely pensioned, and
                    located at Whitehall; the only case in which he is reported to have interfered
                    was that of his wife, who was not, indeed, seriously threatened; and he calmly
                    signed the death-warrants of men whom he must have regarded as martyrs.</p>
                <p>It is remarkable that the matter in regard to which Charles most firmly withstood
                    opposition was one in which he was not personally concerned—the exclusion of his
                    brother, the duke of York, from the succession. This is the more remarkable as
                    there is good reason to believe that his affection was much stronger for the
                    duke of Monmouth, his own son by Lucy Walters. He treated him like a legitimate
                    prince, and permitted him to wear the royal arms without the bar sinister, and
                    to make progresses through the kingdom, on which he was received as if he had
                    been heir to the throne. Towards the end of his life (in 1682), however, he was
                    so seriously displeased with one of these progresses as to banish the duke to
                    Holland; possibly the licence which Monmouth assumed was only permitted by the
                    king; and we may, perhaps, give him credit for having all along unselfishly
                    desired that his brother and a Catholic king should succeed him.</p>
                <p>Concerning the character of Charles historians are in general agreement. His
                    selfishness, which was of the sensual, indolent, good-humoured type, was such
                    that he was incapable of understanding motives different from his own. His chief
                    aim was to support, without trouble or censure, his own gay and dissipated life,
                    and his troop of mistresses. This was no easy matter; his mistresses were
                    numerous, and he was fond of indulging them to the utmost of his power. One was
                    raised to the rank of duchess of Portsmouth, another to that of duchess of
                    Cleveland; six of the sons they brought him were created dukes )<note

                    the court of Charles was the most scandalous which England has seen. Yet, being
                    affable and witty, and free from all vindictiveness, Charles enjoyed a good deal
                    of popularity, if nothing of respect.</p>
                <p>In 1662 Charles married Catherine, princess of Portugal, who brought him half a
                    million of money, Bombay, and the fortress of Tangiere. He died, probably of
                    apoplexy, without legitimate issue—for there is no evidence to support the
                    popular belief in the legitimacy of Monmouth— on the 6th February 1685, after
                    receiving extreme unction from a Roman Catholic priest named Huddlestone.</p>
                <p>Throughout his whole reign, and especially by his secret négociations with Louis
                    XIV. of France, whose pensioner he was not ashamed to be, Charles exerted a
                    powerful and harmful influence on English politics; but his political action is
                    matter of history, and is treated elsewhere.</p>
