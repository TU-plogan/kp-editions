                        rend="italic">i,e.,</hi> “Heron’s Neck,” was born in Spanish Galicia, in the
                    earlier years of the 14th century. Tradition asserts that her father, Don Pedro
                    Fernandez de Castro, and her mother, Doña Aldonça Soares de Villadares, a noble
                    Portuguese lady, were unmarried, and that Inez and her two brothers were
                    consequently of bastard birth. Educated at the semi-Oriental provincial court of
                    Juan Manuel, duke of Peñafiel, Inez grew up side by side with Costança, the
                    duke’s daughter by a scion of the royal house of Aragon, and her own cousin.
                    After refusing several crowned heads in marriage, Costança was at last persuaded
                    to accept the hand of the Infante Dorn Pedro, son of Alphonse the Proud, king of
                    Portugal. In 1341 the two girls left Peñafiel; Costança’s marriage was
                    celebrated in the same year, and the young Infanta and her cousin went to reside
                    at Lisbon, ør at Coimbra, where Dorn Pedro conceived that luckless and furious
                    passion for Inez which has immortalized them.</p>
                <p>Morganatic marriages among the great were rather the rule than the exception in
                    those times. The only person, therefore, who suffered in the contemplation of
                    the lawless alliance between the Infante and Inez was Costança. In 1345,
                    however, the Infanta died in childbed, and the widower was left in undisturbed
                    possession of his mistress. A wayward violent man, bold and irresolute, of
                    terrible passions, but subject to strange lapses of will, Dorn Pedro, doubtful,
                    perhaps, of the illegitimacy of Inez, which debarred her from succession to the
                    throne, took no steps to improve her position in the world’s eye till 1354, nine
                    years after Costança’s death, when he married her in presence of the bishop of
                    Guarda, and of several of the members of their household. No contract of
                    marriage, however, nor documentary proof of any kind was created for this
                    extraordinary occasion. In 1361 Dorn Pedro, then king of Portugal, swore
                    solemnly to Castanhede, that he had been lawfully wedded to Inez; but in 1385
                    João De Regras had no difficulty whatever, in the absence of written evidence,
                    in setting aside the title of her descendants to the throne.</p>
                <p>Alphonso the Proud feared for his grandchild and his kingdom’s peace. The Castro
                    family, as much dreaded in Spain as in Portugal, with Inez ready to mount the
                    throne and her brother Pedro Fernandez de Castro rising daily higher in
                    popularity and importance, had many enemies,— among others, three gentlemen,
                    Alvaro Gonçalves, Pedro Coelho, and Diogo Lopes Pacheco. These men, hateful to
                    and fearful of Pedro Fernandez, are said to have used their influence with
                    Alphonso to persuade him to strike down the family through Inez. The old king
                    listened, refused, wavered, and ended by yielding. He went in secret to the
                    palace at Coimbra, where Inez and the Infante resided, accompanied by his three
                    familiars, and by others who agreed with them. The beauty and tears of Inez
                    disarmed his resolution, and he turned to leave her; but the gentlemen about him
                    had gone too far to recede. Inez was stabbed to death, and was buried
                    immediately in the Church of Santa Clara.</p>
                <p>The Infante raised at once the flag of revolt against his father, and was only
                    appeased by the concession of a large share in the government. The three
                    murderers of Inez were sent out of the kingdom by Alphonso, who knew his son too
                    well not to be aware that the vengeance Would be tremendous as the crime. They
                    took refuge in Castile. In 1357, however, Alphonso died, and the Infante was
                    crowned king of Portugal. Pedro the Cruel, his nephew, reigned over Castile; and
                    the murderers were given up as soon as required. Diogo Lopes escaped through the
                    gratitude of a beggar to whom he had formerly done a kindness; but Coelho and
                    Gonçalves were executed, with horrible tortures, in the very presence of the
                    king.</p>
                <p>The story of the exhumation and coronation of the corpse of Inez has often been
                    told. It is said that to the dead body, crowned and robed in royal raiment, and
                    enthroned beside the king, the assembled nobility of Portugal paid homage as to
                    its queen, swearing fealty on the withered hand of the corpse. The gravest
                    doubts, however, exist as to the authenticity of this story; Fernão Lopes, the
                    Portuguese Froissart, who is the great authority for the details of the tragedy
                    of the death of Inez, with some of the actors in which he was personally
                    acquainted, says nothing of the ghastly and fantastic ceremony, though he tells
                    at length the tale of the funeral honours that Pedro the king bestowed upon his
                    wife. Inez was buried at Alcobaça with extraordinary magnificence, in a tomb of
                    white marble, surmounted by her crowned statue; and near her sepulchre Pedro
                    caused his own to be placed. The monument, after repeatedly resisting the
                    violence of curiosity, was broken into in 1810 by the French soldiery; the
                    statue was mutilated, and the yellow hair was cut from the broken skeleton, to
                    be preserved in reliquaries and blown away by the wind. The children of Inez
                    shared her habit of misfortune. From her brother, however, Alvaro Perez de
                    Castro, the house regnant of Portugal directly descends.</p>
