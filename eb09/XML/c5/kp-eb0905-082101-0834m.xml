                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> II. (Suidger, a Saxon, bishop of Bamberg) was
                    chancellor to the Emperor Henry III., to whom he was indebted for his elevation
                    to the Papacy upon the abdication of Gregory VI. (December 1046). His short
                    pontificate was only signalized by the convocation of a council in which decrees
                    were enacted against simony. He died in October 1047, and was interred at
                    Bamberg.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> III. (Paulino Scolari, bishop of Praeneste) was
                    elected Pope in December 1187, and died in March 1191. He succeeded shortly
                    after his accession in allaying the discords which had prevailed for half a
                    century between the Popes and the citizens of Rome, in virtue of an agreement by
                    which the latter were allowed to elect their magistrates, while the nomination
                    of the governor of the city remained in the hands of the Pope. He incited Henry
                    II. of England and Philip Augustus to undertake the third crusade, and
                    introduced several minor reforms in ecclesiastical matters.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> IV. (Gui Foulques, archbishop of Narbonne) was
                    elected Pope in February 1265. Before taking orders he had been successively a
                    soldier and a lawyer, and in the latter capacity had acted as secretary to Louis
                    IX. of France, to whose influence he was chiefly indebted for his elevation. At
                    this time the Holy See was engaged in a conflict with Manfred, the usurper of
                    Naples; and Clement, whose election had taken place in his absence, was
                    compelled to repair to Italy in disguise. He immediately took steps to ally
                    himself with Charles of Anjou, the French pretender to the Neapolitan throne,
                    who marched into Naples, and having defeated and slain Manfred in the great
                    battle of Benevento, established himself firmly in the kingdom. Clement is said
                    to have disapproved of the cruelties committed by Charles, and there seems no
                    foundation for the charge of his having advised the latter to execute the
                    unfortunate Conradin, the last of the church’s hereditary antagonists of the
                    house of Hohenstaufen. His private character was unexceptionable, and he is
                    especially commended for his indisposition to promote and enrich his own
                    relatives. He also did himself great honour by his encouragement and protection
                    of Roger Bacon. He died in November 1268, and was buried at Viterbo, where he
                    had resided throughout his pontificate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> V. (Bertrand de Goth, archbishop of Bordeaux)
                    is memorable in history for his suppression of the order of the Templars, and as
                    the Pope who removed the seat of the Roman see to Avignon. He was elected in
                    June 1305, after a year’s interregnum occasioned by the disputes between the
                    French and Italian cardinals, who were nearly equally balanced in the conclave.
                    According to Villani he had bound himself to subserviency towards the Freuch
                    monarch by a formal agreement previous to his elevation; however this may be, it
                    is unquestionable that he conducted himself throughout his pontificate as the
                    mere tool of that monarch. His first act was to create nine French cardinals.
                    The removal of the seat of the Papacy to Avignon (1308) might seem palliated by
                    the factious and tumultuary condition of Rome at the period, but it proved the
                    precursor of a long “Babylonish captivity,” in Petrarch’s phrase, and marks the
                    point from which the decay of the strictly Catholic conception of the Pope as
                    universal bishop is to be dated. The guilt or innocence of the Templars is one
                    of the most difficult of historical problems, the discussion of which belongs,
                    however, to the history of the order.</p>

                <p>Clement may have acted conscientiously in his suppression of an order which had
                    heretofore been regarded as a main bulwark of Christianity, but there can be
                    little doubt that his principal motive was complaisance towards the king of
                    France, or that the latter was mainly actuated by jealousy and cupidity.
                    Clement’s pontificate was also disastrous for Italy. The Emperor Henry VII.
                    entered the country, established the Visconti in Milan, and was crowned by
                    Clement’s legates in Rome, but was unable to maintain himself there, and died
                    suddenly, leaving great part of Italy in a condition of complete anarchy. The
                    dissensions of the Roman barons reached their height, and the Lateran palace was
                    destroyed in a conflagration. Other remarkable incidents of Clement’s reign are
                    his sanguinary repression of the heresy of Fra Dolcino in Lombardy and his
                    promulgation of tl ιe Clementine Constitutions in 1313. He died, leaving an
                    inauspicious character for nepotism, avarice, and cunning, in April 1314. He was
                    the first Pope who assumed the triple crown.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> VI. (Pierre Roger, archbishop of Rouen), the
                    fourth of the Avignon popes, was elected in May 1342. Like his immediate
                    predecessors, he was devoted to France, and he further evinced his French
                    sympathies by refusing a solemn invitation to return to Rome, and by purchasing
                    the sovereignty of Avignon from Joanna, queen of Naples, for 80,000 crowns. The
                    money was never paid, but Clement may have deemed that he gave the queen a full
                    equivalent by absolving her from the murder of her husband. The other chief
                    incidents of his pontificate were his disputes with Edward III. of England on
                    account of the latter’s encroachments on ecclesiastical jurisdiction, his
                    excommunication of the Emperor Louis of Bavaria, his negotiations for reunion
                    with the Eastern Church, and the commencement of Rienzi’s agitation at Rome. He
                    died in December 1352, leaving the reputation of “a fine gentleman, a prince
                    munificent to profusion, a patron of the arts and learning, but no saint”
                    (Gregorovius; see also Gibbon, chap. 66).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> VII. (Giulio de’ Medici), the most unfortunate
                    of the Popes, was the son of Giuliano de’ Medici, assassinated in the conspiracy
                    of the Pazzi, and consequently nephew of Lorenzo the Magnificent and cousin of
                    Pope Leo X. Upon the latter’s accession to the Papacy, Giulio became his
                    principal minister and confidant, especially in the maintenance of the Medici
                    interest at Florence. At Leo’s death, Cardinal Medici, though unable to gain the
                    Papacy for himself or his ally Farnese, took a leading part in determining the
                    unexpected election of Adrian VI., to whom he succeeded in the next conclave
                    (November 1523). He brought to the Papal throne a high reputation for political
                    ability, and possessed in fact all the accomplishments of a wily diplomatist,
                    but the circumstances of the times required a man of far different mould. His
                    worldliness and lack of insight into the tendencies of his age disqualified him
                    from comprehending the great religious movement which then convulsed the church;
                    while his timidity and indecision no less disabled him from following a
                    consistent policy in secular affairs. At first attached to the imperial
                    interest, he was terrified by the overwhelming success of the emperor in the
                    battle of Pavia in to joining the other Italian princes in a league with France.
                    This policy in itself was sound and patriotic, but Clement’s zeal soon cooled;
                    by his want of foresight and unseasonable economy he laid himself open to an
                    attack from the turbulent Roman barons which obliged him to invoke the mediation
                    of the emperor. When this danger seemed over he veered back to his former
                    engagements, and ended by drawing down upon himself the host of the imperialist
                    general, the Constable Bourbon, who, compelled to satisfy his clamorous
                    mercenaries by pillage, embraced the opportunity of leading them against Rome.
                    The city was assaulted and sacked on May 5, 1527, and Clement, who had displayed
                    no more resolution in his military than in his political conduct, was shortly
                    afterwards obliged to surrender himself together with the castle of St Angelo,
                    where he had taken refuge. After six months’ captivity he was released upon very
                    onerous conditions, and for some years subsequently followed a policy of
                    subserviency to the emperor, endeavouring on the one hand to induce him to act
                    with severity against the Lutherans in Germany, and on the other to elude his
                    demands for a general council. One momentous consequence of this dependence on
                    Charles V. was the breach with England occasioned by Clement’s refusal,
                    justifiable in point of principle, but dictated by no higher motive than his
                    fear of offending the emperor, to sanction Henry VIII.’s divorce from Catherine
                    of Aragon. Towards the end of his reign Clement once more gave indications cf a
                    leaning towards a French alliance, which was prevented by his death in September
                    1534. As a man he possessed few virtues and few vices; as a pontiff he did
                    nothing to disgrace the church and nothing to restore its lustre; his adroitness
                    and dexterity as a statesman were counteracted by his suspicion and
                    irresolution; his administration affords a proof that at eventful crises of the
                    world’s history mediocrity of character is more disastrous than mediocrity of
                    talent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> VIII. (Ippolito Aldobrandini) was elected in
                    January 1592. The most remarkable event of his reign was the reconciliation to
                    the church of Henry IV. of France after long negotiations carried on with great
                    dexterity by Cardinal D’Ossat. Europe is principally indebted to this Pope for
                    the peace of Vervins (1598), which put an end to the long contest between France
                    and Spain. Clement also annexed Ferrara to the States of the Church upon the
                    failure of the line of Este, the last addition of importance to the Pope’s
                    temporal dominions. The execution of Giordano Bruno, February 17, 1600, is a
                    blot upon an otherwise exemplary pontificate. Clement was an able ruler and a
                    sagacious statesman, the general object of whose policy was to free the Papacy
                    from its undue dependence upon Spain. The conferences to determine the questions
                    of grace and free will, controverted between the Jesuits and Dominicans, were
                    commenced under him, but he wisely abstained from pronouncing a decision. He
                    died in March 1605, leaving a high character for prudence, munificence, and
                    capacity for business. His reign is especially distinguished by the number and
                    beauty of his medals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> IX. (Giulio Rospigliosi) was elected Pope in
                    June 1667. Nothing remarkable occurred under his short administration beyond the
                    temporary adjustment of the disputes between the Roman see and those prelates of
                    the Gallican church who had refused to join in condemning the writings of
                    Jansenius. He died in December 1669.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> X. (Emilio Altieri) was elected in April 1670,
                    at the age of eighty. His years and infirmities led him to devolve the charge of
                    the government upon his nephew, Cardinal Altieri, whose interference with the
                    privileges of ambassadors occasioned disputes in which the Pope was obliged to
                    yield. Little else of importance occurred during his reign, which terminated in
                    July 1676.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> XI. (Giovanni Francesco Albani) was elevated to
                    the pontificate in November 1700, and died in March 1721. The most memorable
                    transaction of his administration was the publication in 1713 of the bull <hi
                    rend="italic">Unigenitus,</hi> which so greatly disturbed the peace of the
                    Gallican church. By this famous document 101 propositions extracted from the
                    works of Quesnel were condemned as heretical, and as identical with propositions
                    already condemned in the writings of Jansenius. The resistance of many French
                    ecclesiastics and the refusal of the French parliaments to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0836-0823"/> register the bull led to controversies extending
                    through the greater part of the 18th century. Another important decision of this
                    Pope’s was that by which the Jesuit missionaries were forbidden to take a part
                    in idolatrous worship, and to accommodate Christian language to pagan ideas
                    under plea of conciliating the heathen. The political troubles of the time
                    greatly embarrassed Clement’s relations with the leading Catholic powers, and
                    the moral prestige of the Holy See suffered much from his compulsory recognition
                    of the Archduke Charles of Austria as king of Spain. His private character was
                    irreproachable; he was also an accomplished scholar, and a patron of letters and
                    science.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> XII. (Lorenzo Corsini) was Pope from July 1730
                    to February 1740. His first act was the trial and condemnation of Cardinal
                    Coscia, guilty of malversation under his predecessor. Nothing else of importance
                    occurred under his administration, during the greater part of which, according
                    to some historians, he was afflicted with blindness. He was the first pontiff
                    who condemned the Freemasons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> XIII. (Carlo Rezzonico, bishop of Padua) was
                    elected in July 1758. Notwithstanding the meekness and affability of his
                    character, his pontificate was disturbed by perpetual contentions respecting the
                    investiture of Parma, and subsequently by the demands of France, Spain, and
                    Portugal for the suppression of the Jesuits. Clement warmly espoused the cause
                    of the order in an apostolical brief issued in 1765. The pressure put upon him
                    by the Catholic powers, however, was so strong that he seemed about to give way,
                    when, having convoked a consistory to receive his decision, he died suddenly,
                    February 3, 1769, not without suspicion of poison.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> XIV. (Giovanni Vincenzo Antonio Ganganelli),
                    the best and most calumniated of the popes, was born in 1705, and was originally
                    a Franciscan monk. Having acquired a great reputation as a preacher, he became
                    the friend and confidant of Pope Benedict XIV., and was created a cardinal by
                    his successor. He was elected Pope on May 19, 1769, after a conclave extremely
                    agitated by the intrigues and pretensions of the Catholic sovereigns, who were
                    resolved to exclude every candidate favourable to the Jesuits. Theiner has
                    satisfactorily vindicated Ganganelli from the charge of having given a formal
                    pledge on this subject. He may probably have leant to the views of the Catholic
                    powers, but if so his motive was widely different from the subservience which
                    had induced his predecessor Clement V. to gratify Philip the Fair by the
                    suppression of the Templars. The breach between the temporal and the spiritual
                    authorities had become threatening, and the guiding principle of Clement’s
                    policy was undoubtedly the reconciliation of the European sovereigns, whose
                    alienation threatened to produce the results which we have seen accomplished in
                    our own times. By yielding the Papal pretensions to Parma, he obtained the
                    restitution of Avignon and Benevento, and in general he succeeded in placiqg the
                    relations of the spiritual and the temporal authorities on a satisfactory
                    footing. Whether from scruple or policy he proceeded with great circumspection
                    in the suppression of the Jesuits, the decree to this effect not being framed
                    until November 1772, and not signed until July in the following year. This
                    memorable measure, which takes rank in history as the most remarkable, perhaps
                    the only really substantial, concession ever made by a Pope to the spirit of his
                    age, has covered Clement’s memory with obloquy in his own communion. There
                    cannot be any reasonable doubt of the integrity of his conduct, and the only
                    question is whether he acted from a conviction of the pernicious character of
                    the Society of Jesus, or merely from a sense of expediency. In either case his
                    action was abundantly justified, and to allege that though beneficial to the
                    world it was detrimental to the church is merely to insist that the interests of
                    the Papacy are not the interests of mankind. His work was hardly accomplished
                    ere Clement, whose natural constitution was exceedingly vigorous, fell into a
                    languishing sickness, generally and plausibly attributed to poison. No
                    conclusive evidence of this, however, has been produced; and it is but just to
                    remark that poison would more probably have been administered before the
                    obnoxious measure had been taken than when it was already beyond recall. Clement
                    expired on September 22, 1774, execrated by the Ultramontane party, but
                    regretted by his subjects for his excellent temporal administration. No Pope has
                    better merited the title of a virtuous man, or has given a more perfect example
                    of integrity, unselfishness, and aversion to nepotism. Notwithstanding his
                    monastic education, he approved himself a statesman, a scholar, an amateur of
                    physical science, and an accomplished man of the world. As Leo X. indicates the
                    manner in which the Papacy might have been reconciled with the Renaissance had
                    the Reformation never taken place, so Ganganelli exemplifies the type of Pope
                    which the modern world might have learned to accept if the movement towards free
                    thought could, as Voltaire wished, have been confined to the aristocracy of
                    intellect. In both cases the requisite condition was unattainable; neither in
                    the 16th nor in the 18th century has it been practicable to set bounds to the
                    spirit of inquiry otherwise than by fire and sword, and Ganganelli’s successors
                    have been driven into assuming a position analogous to that of Paul IV. and Pius
                    V. in the age of the Reformation. The estrangement between the secular and the
                    spiritual authority which Ganganelli strove to avert is now irreparable, and his
                    pontificate remains an exceptional episode in the general history of the Papacy,
                    and a proof how little the logical sequence of events can be modified by the
                    virtues and abilities of an individual. The history of Clement’s administration
                    has been written in a spirit of the most violent detraction by Cretineau-Joly,
                    and perhaps too unreservedly in the opposite spirit by Father Theiner, the
                    custodian of the archives of the Vatican. Theiner calls attention to the
                    disappearance of many documents which have apparently been abstracted by
                    Clement’s enemies. Ganganelli’s familiar correspondence has been frequently
                    reprinted and is much admired for its elegance and urbanity. <hi
