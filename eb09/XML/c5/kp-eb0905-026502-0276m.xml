                <p><label type="entry">CAVE</label> (Latin <hi rend="italic">cavea),</hi> a hollow
                    extending beneath the surface of the earth. Caves have excited the awe and
                    wonder of mankind in all ages, and have been the centres round which have
                    clustered many legends and superstitions. They were the abode of the sibyls and
                    the nymphs in Roman mythology, and in Greece they were the temples of Pan,
                    Bacchus, Pluto, and the Moon, as well as the places where the oracles were
                    delivered at Delphi, Corinth, and Mount Cithaeron. In Persia they were connected
                    with the obscure worship of Mithras. Their names frequently are survivals of the
                    superstitious ideas of antiquity, as for example, the Fairy, Dragon’s, or
                    Devil’s Caves of France and Germany. Long after the Fairies and Little Men had
                    forsaken the forests and glens of Germany, they dwelt in their palaces deep in
                    the Hartz Mountains, in the Dwarfholes, &lt;kc., whence they came from time to
                    time into the upper air.</p>
                <p>The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus slept their long sleep in a cave. The hills of
                    Granada are still believed by the Moorish children to contain the great Boabdil,
                    and his sleeping host, who will awake, when an adventurous mortal invades their
                    repose, to restore the glory of the Moors in Spain.</p>
                <p>Caves have been used in all ages by mankind for habitation, refuge, and burial.
                    In the Old Testament we read that when Lot went up out of Zoar he dwelt in a
                    cave with his two daughters. The five kings of the Canaanites took refuge from
                    Joshua, and David from Saul, in the caves of Palestine, just as the Aquitani
                    fled from Caesar to those of Auvergne, and the Arabs of Algeria to those of
                    Dahra, where they were suffocated by Marshal Pelissier in 1845. In Central
                    Africa Dr Livingstone tells us that there are vast caves in which whole tribes
                    find security with their cattle and household stuff.</p>
                <p>The cave of Machpelah may be quoted as an example of their use as sepulchres, and
                    the rock-hewn tombs of Palestine and of Egypt, and the Catacombs of Rome
                    probably owe their existence to the ancient practice of burial in natural
                    hollows in the rock. We might therefore expect to find in them most important
                    evidence as to the ancient history of mankind, which would reach long beyond
                    written record; and since they have always been used by wild beasts as lairs we
                    might reasonably believe also that their exploration would throw light upon the
                    animals which have in many cases disappeared from the countries which they
                    formerly inhabited. The labours of Buckland, Pengelly, Falconer, Lartet, and
                    Christy, and Dawkins, carried on during the last fifty years in the caves, have
                    added an entirely new chapter to the history of man in Europe, as well as
                    established the changes that have taken place in the European fauna. The
                    physical history of caves will be taken first, and we shall then pass on to the
                    discoveries relating to man and the lower animals which have been made in them
                    of late years.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical History.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The most obvious
                    agent in hollowing out caves is the sea. The set of the currents, the force of
                    the breakers, the grinding of the shingle inevitably discover the weak places in
                    the cliff, and leave caves as one of the results of their work, modified in each
                    case by the local conditions of the rock. Those formed in this manner are easily
                    recognized from their floors being rarely much out of the horizontal; their
                    entrances are all in the same plane, or in a succession of horizontal and
                    parallel planes, if the land has been elevated at successive times. From their
                    inaccessible position they have been rarely occupied by man. Among them Fingal’s
                    Cave, on the island of Staffa, off the south-west coast of Scotland, hollowed
                    out of columnar basalt, is perhaps the most remarkable in Europe. In volcanic
                    regions also there are caves formed by the passage of lava to the surface of the
                    ground, or by the expansion of steam and gases in the lava while it was in a
                    molten state. They have been observed in the regions round Vesuvius and Etna, in
                    Iceland and Teneriffe. We may take as an example the Grotto del Cane (cave of
                    the dog), near Pozzuoli, a few miles to the south-west of Naples, remarkable for
                    the flow of carbonic acid from crevices in the floor, which fills the lower part
                    of the cave and suffocates any small animal, such as a dog, immersed long enough
                    in it.</p>
                <p>The most important class of caves, however, and that which immediately demands
                    our notice, is that composed of those which have been cut out of calcareous
                    rocks by the action of carbonic acid in the rain-water, combined with the
                    mechanical friction of the sand and stones set in motion by the streams which
                    have, at one time or another, flowed through them. They occur at various levels,
                    and are to be met with wherever the strata are sufficiently compact to support a
                    roof. Those of Brixham and Torquay, and of the Eifel are in the Devonian
                    limestone; those of Wales, Somerset, the central and northern counties of
                    Belgium, Saxony, and Westphalia, of Maine and Anjou, of Virginia and Kentucky,
                    are in that of the Carboniferous age. The cave of Kirkdale in Yorkshire, and
                    most of those in Franconia and Bavaria, penetrate Jurassic limestones. The
                    compact Neocomian and cretaceous limestones of Central France contain most of
                    the caverns of Perigord, rendered famous by the discovery of the remains of the
                    Eskimos along with the animals which they hunted; as well as those of Northern
                    Italy,’ Sicily, Greece, Dalmatia, Carniola, and Palestine. The cave of Lunelviel
                    near Montpellier is the most important of those which have been hollowed in
                    limestones of the Tertiary age. They are also met with in rocks composed of
                    gypsum; in Thuringia, for example, they occur in the saliferous and gypseous
                    strata of the Zechstein, and in the gypseous Tertiary rocks of the neighbourhood
                    of Paris, as for example at Montmorency.</p>
                <p>Caves formed by the action of carbonic acid, and the action of water are
                    distinguished from others by the following characters. They open on the abrupt
                    sides of valleys and ravines at various levels, and are arranged round the main
                    axes of erosion, just as the branches are arranged round the trunk of a tree. In
                    a great many cases the relation of the valley to the ravine, and of the ravine
                    to <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n277/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0277-0266"/> the cave, is so intimate that it is impossible to
                    deny that all three have been produced by the same causes. The caves themselves
                    ramify in the same irregular fashion as the valleys, and are to be viewed merely
                    as the capillaries in the general valley system through which the rain passes to
                    join the main channels. Sometimes, as in the famous caves of Adelsberg,
                    Kentucky, Wookey Hole in Somersetshire, the Peak in Derbyshire, and in many in
                    the Jura, they are still the passages of subterranean streams; but very
                    frequently the drainage has found an outlet at a lower level, and the ancient
                    watercourses have been deserted. These in every case present unmistakable proof
                    that they have been traversed by water in the sand, gravel, and clay which they
                    contain, as well as in the worn surfaces of the sides and bottom. In all
                    districts where there are caves there are funnel-shaped depressions of various
                    sizes called pot-holes or swallow-holes, or bêtoires, “chaldrons du diable,”
                    “marmites des géants,” or “kata-vathra,” in which the rain is collected before
                    it disappears into the subterranean passages. They are to be seen in all stages,
                    some being mere hollows which only contain water after excessive rain, while
                    others are profound vertical shafts into which the water is continually falling.
                    That known as Helln Pot in Yorkshire, 300 feet deep, is an example of the latter
                    class. The cirques described by Μ. Desnoyers belong to the same class as the
                    swallow-holes.</p>
                <p>The history of swallow-holes, caves, ravines, and valleys in calcareous strata
                    may be summed up as follows. The calcareous rocks are invariably traversed by
                    joints or lines of shrinkage, which are lines of weakness by which the direction
                    of the drainage is determined; and they are composed to a large extent of
                    carbonate of lime, which is readily exchanged into soluble bicarbonate by the
                    addition of carbonic acid. The rain in its passage through the air takes up
                    carbonic acid, and it is still further charged with it in percolating through
                    the surface soil in which there is decomposing vegetable matter. As the rain
                    drops converge towards some one point, determined by some local accident on the
                    surface, and always in a line of joint, the carbonic acid attacks the carbonate
                    of lime with which it comes into contact, and thus a funnel is gradually formed
                    ending in the vertical joint below. Both funnel and vertical joint below are
                    being continually enlarged by this process. This chemical action goes on until
                    the free carbonic acid is used up. The subterranean passages are enlarged in
                    this manner, and what was originally an insignificant net-work of fissures is
                    developed into a series of halls, sometimes as much as from 80 to 100 feet high.
                    These results are considerably furthered by the mechanical friction of the
                    pebbles and sand hurried along by the current, and by falls of rock from the
                    roof produced by the removal of the underlying strata. In many cases the results
                    of this action have produced a regular subterranean river system. The thick
                    limestones of Kentucky, for example, are traversed by subterranean waters which
                    collect in large rivers, and ultimately appear at the surface in full power. The
                    River Axe, near Wells, the stream flowing out of the Peak Cavern at Castleton,
                    Derbyshire, that at Adelsberg (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Adelsberg,</hi> vol. i.
                    p. 151) in Carniola, flow out of caverns in full volume. The River Styx and the
                    waters of Acheron disappear in a series of caverns which were supposed to lead
                    down to the infernal regions.</p>
                <p>If the direction of the drainage in the rock has been altered, either by
                    elevations such as those with which the geologist is familiar, or by the opening
                    out of new passages at a lower level, these watercourses become dry, and present
                    us with the caves which have afforded shelter to man and the wild animals from
                    the remotest ages, sometimes high up on the side of a ravine, at other times
                    close to the level of the stream at the bottom.</p>
                <p>Caves, as a general rule, are as little effected by disturbances of the rock as
                    the ravines and valleys, which have been formed, in the main, irrespective of
                    the lines of fault or dislocation.</p>
                <p>We must now examine what happens to the bicarbonate of lime which has been formed
                    by the action of the acid on the limestone. If a current of air play upon the
                    surface of the water, the carbonic acid, which floats up the lime, so to speak,
                    is given off and the insoluble carbonate is deposited, and as a result of this
                    action we have the elaborate and fantastic stony incrustations termed
                    stalactites and stalagmites. The water percolating through the rock covers the
                    sides of the cavern with a stalactitic drapery, and if a line of drops
                    persistently falls from the same point to the floor, the calcareous deposit
                    gradually descends from the roof, forming in some cases stony tassels, and in
                    others long columns which are ultimately united to the calcareous boss, formed
                    by the plash of the water on the floor. The surface also of the pools is
                    sometimes covered over with an ice-like sheet of stalagmite, which shoots from
                    the sides, and sometimes forms a solid and firm floor when the water on which it
                    was supported has disappeared. Sometimes the drops form a little calcareous
                    basin, beautifully polished inside, which contains small pearl-like particles of
                    carbonate of lime, polished by friction one against the other. The most
                    beautiful stalactitic caves in Great Britain are those of Cheddar in Somerset,
                    Caldy Island, and Poole’s Cavern at Buxton. A portion only of the carbonate of
                    lime is thus deposited in the hollows of the rock from which it was taken; the
                    rest is carried into the open air by the streams, in part deposited on the sides
                    and bottom, forming tufa and the so-called petrifactions, and partly being
                    conveyed down to the sea to be ultimately secreted in the tissues of the
                    Mollusca, Echinodermata, and Foraminifera. Through these it is again collected
                    in a solid form, and in the long course of ages it is again lifted up above the
                    level of the water as limestone rock, and again undergoes the same series of
                    changes. Thus the cycle of carbonate of lime is a never-ending one from the land
                    to the ocean, from the ocean to the land, and so it has been ever since the
                    first stratum of limestone was formed out of the exuviae of the inhabitants of
                    the sea. The rate of the accumulation of stalagmite in caverns is necessarily
                    variable, since it is determined by the presence of varying currents of air. In
                    the Inglebor∩ugh cavern a stalagmite, measured in 1839 and in 1873, is growing
                    at the rate of ’ 2946 inches per annum. It is obvious, therefore, that the vast
                    antiquity of deposits containing remains of man underneath layers of stalagmite
                    cannot be inferred from a thickness of a few inches or even of a few feet.</p>
                <p>The intimate relation which exists between caves and ravines renders it extremely
                    probable that many of the latter have been originally subterranean watercourses,
                    which have been unroofed by the degradation of the rock. In all limestone
                    districts ravines are to be found continued in the same direction as the caves,
                    and the process of atmospheric erosion may be seen in the fallen blocks of stone
                    which generally are to be met with at the mouths of the caverns. In illustration
                    of this the valley and caves of Weather-cote, in Yorkshire, may be quoted, or
                    the source of the Axe at Wookey; and the ravine formed in this way has very
                    frequently been widened out into a valley by the action of subaerial waste, or
                    by the grinding of glaciers through it during the glacial stage of the
                    Pleistocene period.</p>

                    unicorns’ horn, or in other words the fossil bones which ranked high in the

                    ossiferous caverns of the Hartz Mountains, and of Hungary and Franconia. The
                    famous cave of Gailenreuth in the last of these districts was explored by Dr
                    Goldfuss in 1810. The bones of the hyaena, lion, wolf, fox, and stag, which it
                    contained, were identified by Baron Cuvier, and some of the skulls have been
                    recently proved by Professor Busk to belong to the grizzly bear. They were
                    associated with the bones of the reindeer, horse, and bison, as well as with
                    those of the great cave bear. These discoveries were of very great interest,
                    because they established the fact that the above animals had lived in Germany in
                    ancient times. The first bone cave systematically explored in England was one at
                    Orreston near Plymouth in the year 1816, which proved that an extinct species of
                    rhinoceros <hi rend="italic">(R. Megarhinus)</hi> lived in that district. Four
                    years later the famous hyaena den at Kirkdale in Yorkshire was explored by Dr
                    Buckland. He brought forward proof that it had been inhabited by hyaenas, and
                    that the broken and gnawed bones of the mammoth, rhinoceros, stag, bison, and
                    horse belonged to animals which had been dragged in for food. He pointed out
                    that all these animals had lived in Yorkshire in ancient times, and that it was
                    impossible for the carcases of the rhinoceros, hyaena, and mammoth to have been
                    floated from tropical regions into the places where he found their bones. He
                    subsequently investigated bone caves in Derbyshire, South Wales, and Somerset,
                    as well as in Germany, and published his <hi rend="italic">Religuiae
                    Diluvianae</hi> in 1822, a work which laid the foundations of the new science of
                    cave-hunting in this country. The well-known cave of Kent’s Hole near Torquay,
                    furnished the Rev. J. McEnery, between the years 1825 and 1841, with the first
                    flint implements discovered in intimate association with the bones of extinct
                    animals. He recognized the fact that they proved the existence of man in
                    Devonshire while those animals were alive, but the idea was too novel to be
                    accepted by his contemporaries. His discoveries have since been verified by the
                    subsequent investigations carried on by Mr Godwin Austen, and ultimately by the
                    committee of the British Association, which has been at work for several years
                    under the guidance of Mr Pengelly. There are four distinct strata in the cave.
                    1sZ, The surface is composed of dark earth, and contains mediaeval remains,
                    Roman pottery, and articles which prove that it was in use during the Iron,
                    Bronze, and Neolithic ages. <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> Below this is a
                    stalagmite floor, varying in thickness from 1 to 3 feet, and covering (3cZ) the
                    red earth, which contained bones of the hyaena, lion, mammoth, rhinoceros, and
                    other animals, in association with flint implements and an engraved antler,
                    which proved man to have been an inhabitant of the cavem during the time of its
                    deposition. <hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> Filling the bottom of the cave is a hard
                    breccia, with the remains of bears and flint implements, in the main ruder than
                    those found above; in some places it was no less than 12 feet thick. The most
                    remarkable animal found in Kent’s Hole is the sabre-toothed carnivore, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mackairodus latidens</hi> of Owen. While the value of Mr McEnery’s
                    discoveries was in dispute the exploration of the cave of Brixham near Torquay
                    in 1858 proved that man was coeval with the extinct mammalia, and in the
                    following year additional proof was offered by the implements that were found in
                    Wookey Hole. Similar remains have been met with in the caves of Wales, and in
                    England as far north as Derbyshire (Creswell), proving that over the whole of
                    southern and middle England men, in precisely the same stage of rude
                    civilization, hunted the mammoth and rhinoceros and other extinct animals.</p>

                    The caves and rock shelters of Perigord, explored by the late Μ. Lartet and our
                    countryman Mr Christy, in 1863-4, have not only afforded accumulative proof of
                    the co-existence of man with the extinct mammalia, but have given us a clue as
                    to the race that so existed. They penetrate the sides of the valleys of the
                    Dordogne and Vezère, and offer as vivid a picture of the life of the period as
                    that revealed of Italian manners in the 1st century by the buried cities of
                    Herculaneum and Pompeii. The old floors of human occupation consist of broken
                    bones of animals killed in the chase, mingled with rude implements and weapons
                    of bone and unpolished stone, and with charcoal and burnt stones, which indicate
                    the position of the hearths. Flakes without number, awls, lance-heads, hammers,
                    and saws made of flint rest <hi rend="italic">pele-mele</hi> with bone needles,
                    sculptured reindeer antlers, arrowheads, and harpoons, and bones of the
                    reindeer, bison, horse, ibex, Saiga antelope, and musk sheep. These singular
                    accumulations of <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> mark the places where the ancient
                    hunters lived, and are merely the refuse cast aside. The reindeer formed by far
                    the greater portion of the food, and must have lived in enormous herds at that
                    time in the centre of France. From this, as well as from the presence of the
                    most arctic of the herbivores, the musk sheep, we may infer the severe climate
                    of that portion of France at that time. Besides these animals the cave bear and
                    lion have been met with in one, and the mammoth in five localities, and their
                    remains bear marks of cutting or scraping which showed they fell, a prey to the
                    hunters. The most remarkable remains left behind in these refuse heaps are the
                    sculptured reindeer antlers and figures engraved on fragments of schist and on
                    ivory. A well-defined outline of an ox stands out boldly from one piece of
                    antler; a second represents a reindeer kneeling down in an easy attitude with
                    his head thrown up in the air so that the antlers rest on the shoulders, and the
                    back forms an even surface for a handle, which is too small to be grasped by an
                    ordinary European hand; in a third a man stands close to a horse’s head, and on
                    the other side of the same cylinder are two heads of bisons drawn with
                    sufficient clearness to ensure recognition by any one who has seen that animal.
                    On a fourth the natural curvature of one of the tines has been taken advantage
                    of by the artist to engrave the head and the characteristic recurved horns of
                    the ibex; and on a fifth horses are represented with large heads, upright
                    dishevelled manes, and shaggy ungroomed tails. The most striking figure is that
                    of the mammoth engraved on a fragment of its own tusk; the peculiar spiral
                    curvature of the tusk and the long mane, which are now not to be found in any
                    living elephant, prove that the original was familiar to the eye of the artist.
                    These drawings probably employed the idle hours of the hunter, and hand down to
                    us the scenes which he witnessed in the chase. They are full of artistic feeling
                    and are evidently drawn from fife. The mammoth is engraved in its own ivory, and
                    the reindeer and the stag on their respective antlers. The general idea which we
                    are justified in forming of these ancient dwellers in Aquitaine is that they
                    lived by hunting and fishing, and that they were clad with skins sewn together
                    with sinews or strips of intestines. They possessed no domestic animals, nor
                    were they acquainted with spinning or with the potter’s art. We have no evidence
                    that they <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n279/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0279-0268"/> buried their dead,—the interments, such as those
                    of Aurignac, Les Eyzies, Mentone, as well as of Belgium and Germany, most
                    probably belonging to a later age. Caves containing their implements occur
                    throughout these regions as well as in Switzerland.</p>
                <p>These traces of the most ancient men as yet discovered in Europe, may with a high
                    degree of probability be referred to the Eskimos. The bone needles, and many of
                    the harpoons, as well as the flint spearheads, arrowheads, and scrapers, are of
                    precisely the same form as those now in use amongst the Eskimos. The artistic
                    designs from the caves of France, Belgium, and Switzerland, are identical in
                    plan and workmanship with those of the Eskimos, with this difference only, that
                    the hunting scenes familiar to the Palaeolithic cave-dwellers were not the same
                    as those familiar to the inhabitants of the shores of the Arctic Ocean. Each
                    represented the animals which he knew, and the whale, walrus, and seal were
                    unknown to the inland dwellers of Aquitaine, just as the mammoth, bison, and
                    wild horse are unknown to the Eskimos. The reindeer, which they both knew, is
                    represented in the same way by both. The practice of accumulating large
                    quantities of the bones of animals round their dwelling-places, and the habit of
                    splitting the bones for the sake of the marrow, are the same in both. The hides
                    were prepared with the same sort of instruments, and the needles with which they
                    were sewn together are of the same pattern. In both there was the same disregard
                    of sepulture. All these facts can hardly be mere coincidences caused by both
                    peoples leading a savage life under similar conditions. The conclusion,
                    therefore, seems inevitable that, so far as we have any evidence of the race to
                    which the cave-dwellers belong, that evidence points only in the direction of
                    the Eskimos. It is to a considerable extent confirmed by a consideration of the
                    animals found in the caves. The reindeer and musk sheep afford food to the
                    Eskimos now in the Arctic Circle, just as they afforded it to the Palaeolithic
                    hunters in Europe; and both these animals have been traced by their remains from
                    the Pyrenees to the north-east, through Europe and Asia as far as the very
                    regions in which they now live. The mammoth and bison also have been tracked by
                    their remains in the frozen river gravels and morasses through Siberia as far as
                    the American side of the Straits of Behring. Palaeolithic man appeared in Europe
                    with the arctic mammalia, lived in Europe with them, and in all human
                    probability retreated to the north-east along with them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ancient Geography of Europe.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    remains of man and the animals described in the preceding paragraphs have been
                    introduced into the caves either by man or the wild beasts, or by streams of
                    water, which may or may not now occupy their ancient courses; and the fact that
                    the same species are to be met with in the caves of France, Switzerland and
                    Britain implies that our island formed part of the Continent, and that there
                    were no physical barriers to prevent their migration from the Alps as far to the
                    northwest as Ireland.</p>
                <p>The same conclusion may be gathered from the exploration of caves in the south of
                    Europe, which has resulted in the discovery of African species, in Gibraltar,
                    Sicily, and Malta. In the first of these the spotted hyaena, the serval,
                    andKaffre cat lie sidebyside with the horse, grizzly bear, and slender
                    rhinoceros <hi rend="italic">(R. Hemitoechus),</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> see
                    Falconer’s <hi rend="italic">Paloe-ontographical Memoirs.</hi> To these African
                    animals inhabiting the Iberian peninsula in the Pleistocene age, Μ. Lartet has
                    added the African elephant and striped hyaena, found in a stratum of gravel near
                    Madrid, along with flint implements. The hippopotamus, spotted hyaena, and
                    African elephant occur in the caves of Sicily, and imply that in ancient times
                    there was a continuity of land between that spot and Africa, just as the
                    presence of the <hi rend="italic">Elephas antiquus</hi> proves the non-existence
                    of the Straits of Messina during a portion, to say the least, of the Pleistocene
                    age. A small species of hippopotamus <hi rend="italic">(II. Pentlandi)</hi>
                    occurs in incredible abundance in the Sicilian caves. It has also been found in
                    those of Malta along with an extinct pigmy elephant species <hi rend="italic"
                    >(E. Melitensis).</hi> It has also been discovered in Candia and in the
                    Peloponnese. For these animals to have found their way to these regions, a
                    continuity of land is necessary. The view advanced by Dr Falconer and Admiral
                    Spratt, that Europe was formerly connected with Africa by a bridge of land
                    extending southwards from Sicily, ü fully borne out by these considerations. The
                    present physical geography of the Mediterranean has been produced by a
                    depression of land to the amount of about 400 fathoms, by which the
                    Sicilo-African and Ibero-African barriers have been submerged, and Crete and
                    Malta separated from the South-European continent. It is extremely probable that
                    this submergence took place at the same time that the adjoining sea bottom was
                    elevated to about the same amount to constitute that region now known as the
                    Sahara.</p>

                    contain the progenitors of the animals now to be found in some parts of the Old
                    World, the extinct forms being closely allied to those now living in the same
                    geographical provinces. Those of Brazil and of Pennsylvania present us with
                    animals whose nearest analogues are to be found in North and South America, such
                    as sloths, armadillos, and agoutis. Those, again, of Australia present us with
                    marsupials only, allied to, or identical with, those of that singular
                    continent.</p>
                <p>The extinct forms in each case are mainly those of the larger animals, which,
                    from their large size, and the fact of their only bearing one at a birth, would
                    be specially liable to be beaten in the battle for life by their smaller and
                    more fertile contemporaries, and less likely to survive those changes in their
                    environment which have undoubtedly taken place in the long lapse of ages. It is,
                    therefore, certain that the mammalian life in the Old, New, and Australian
                    worlds was as well marked out into geographical provinces in the Pleistocene age
                    as at the present time, and that it has been continuous in these areas from that
                    remote time to the present day.</p>

                    obviously an accumulation which resulted from these caves having been used as
                    dwellings. They had subsequently been used for burial. The human skeletons in
                    them were of all ages, from infancy to old age; and the interments had been
                    successive until each became filled. The bodies were buried in the contracted
                    posture which is so characteristic of Neolithic interments generally. The men to

                    6 inches, and the shortest 4 feet 10 inches; their skulls are orthognathic, or
                    not presenting jaws advancing beyond a vertical line dropped from the forehead,
                    in shape long or oval, and of fair average capacity. The face was oval, and the
                    cheek bones were not prominent. Some of the individuals were characterized by a
                    peculiar flattening of the shinbone (platycnemism), which probably stood in
                    relation to the free action of the foot that was not hampered by the use of a
                    rigid sole or sandal. This, however, cannot be looked upon as a race character,
                    or as a tendency towards a simian type of leg. These Neolithic cave-dwellers
                    have been proved to be identical in physique with the builders of the cairns and
                    tumuli which lie scattered over the face of Great Britain and Ireland. (See
                    Thurnam, <hi rend="italic">Crania Britannica.)</hi> They have also been met with
                    abundantly in France. In the Caverne de ΓHomme Mort, for example, in the
                    department of Lozère, explored in 1871, the association of remains was of
                    precisely the same nature as those mentioned above, and the human skeletons were
                    of the same small type. The same class of remains has also been discovered in
                    Gibraltar, in the caves of Windmill Hill, and some others. The human remains
                    examined by Professor Busk are of precisely the same type as those of
                    Denbighshire. In the work of Don Manuel Gongora J. Martinez <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Antiguedades Prehistoricas de Andalusia,</hi> 1868), several interments are
                    described in the cave of Murcielagos, which penetrates the limestone out of
                    which the grand scenery of the southern Sierra Nevada has been to a great extent
                    carved. In one place a group of three skeletons was met with, one of which was
                    adorned with a plain coronet of gold, and clad in a tunic made of esparto grass
                    finely-plaited, so as to form a pattern like that on some of the gold ornaments
                    in Etruscan tombs. In a second spot further within, twelve skeletons formed a
                    semicircle round one covered with a tunic of skin, and wearing a necklace of
                    esparto grass, earrings of black stone, and ornaments of shell and wild boar
                    tusk. There were other articles of plaited esparto grass, such as baskets aud
                    sandals. There were also flint flakes, polished-stone axes, implements of bone
                    and wood, together with pottery of the same type as that from Gibraltar. The
                    same class of remains have been discovered in the Woman’s Cave, near Alhama in
                    Granada. From the physical identity of the human remains in all these cases it
                    may be inferred that in the Neolithic age a long-headed, small race inhabited
                    the Iberian peninsula, extending through France, as far north as Britain, and to
                    the northwest as far as Ireland,—a race considered by Professor Busk “to be at
                    the present day represented by at any rate a part of the population now
                    inhabiting the Basque provinces.” This identification of the ancient Neolithic
                    cave-dwellers with the modern Basque-speaking inhabitant of the Western Pyrenees
                    is corroborated by the elaborate researches of Μ. Brocas, Professor Virchow, and
                    Dr Thumam into modern Basque skulls. It may therefore be concluded that in the
                    Neolithic age an Iberian population occupied the whole of the area mentioned
                    above, inhabiting caves and burying their dead in caves and chambered tombs, and
                    possessed of the same habits of life. The remains of the same small,
                    oval-featured, long-headed race have been found in Belgium in the cave of
                    Chauvaux.</p>
                <p>There is no evidence that any other race except the Iberic buried their dead in
                    the caves of Britain. In Belgium, however, the exploration of the cave of
                    Sclaig-neaux by Μ. Soreil proves that broad-headed men of the type defined by
                    Professor Huxley and Dr Thurnam as brachycephalic, and characterized by high
                    cheek bones, projecting muzzles, and large stature, the average height being 5
                    ft. 8 ’ 4 inches (Thurnam), inhabited and buried their dead in the caves of that
                    region. In France they occur in the sepulchral cave of Orrouy (Oise) in
                    association with those of the Iberic type. They have also been met with in
                    Gibraltar. This type is undistinguish able from the Celtic or Gaulish, found so
                    abundantly in the chambered tombs of the Neolithic age in France. Both these
                    ancient races are represented at the present day by the Basques and Aquitanians
                    of France and Spain, and by the Celts or Gauls of France, Britain, and the
                    Mediterranean border of Spain, their relative antiquity being proved by an
                    appeal to their history and geographical distribution. For just as the earliest
                    records show that the Iberic power extended as far north as the Loire, and as
                    far east as the Rhone, so we have proof of the gradual retrocession of the
                    Iberic frontier southwards, under the attacks of the successive Celtic hordes,
                    until ultimately we find the latter in possession of a considerable part of
                    Southern Spain, forming by their union with the conquered the powerful nation of
                    Celtiberi. The Iberians were in possession of the Continent before they were
                    dispossessed by the Celts; they are recognized by Tacitus in Britain in the
                    Silures of Wales; and they are still to be seen in the small, dark, lithe
                    inhabitants of North Wales (see Dawkins, <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly
                    Bevieu),</hi> October 1874). From the present distribution of this non-Aryan
                    race it is obvious that they were gradually pushed back westward by the advance
                    of tribes coming from the East, and following those routes which were
                    subsequently taken by the Low and High Germans.</p>
                <p>The exploration of the Grotta dei Colombi, in the island of Palmaria overlooking
                    the Gulf of Spezzia, in 1873, proves that the stories scattered through the
                    classical writers, that the caves on the Mediterranean shores were inhabited by
                    cannibals, are not altogether without foundation. In it broken and cut bones of
                    children and young adults were found along with those of the goat, hog, fox,
                    wolf, wild cat, flint flakes, bone implements, and shells perforated for
                    suspension.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prehistoric Caves of Bronze and Iron Ages.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> The extreme rarity of articles of bronze in the European
                    caves implies that they were rarely used by the Bronze folk for habitation or
                    burial. Bronze weapons mingled with gold ornaments have, however, been
                    discovered in the Heatheryburn Cave near Stanhope, Durham, as well as in those
                    of Kirkhead in Cartmell, in Thor’s Cave in Staffordshire, and the Cat Hole in
                    Gower in Glamorganshire. In the Iberian peninsula the Cave of Cesareda, explored
                    by Signor Delgado, in the valley of the Tagus, contained bronze articles,
                    associated with broken and cut human bones, as well as those of domestic
                    animals, rendering it probable that cannibalism was practised in early times in
                    that region. Professor Busk believes, however, that the facts are insufficient
                    to support the charge of cannibalism against the ancient Portuguese.</p>
                <p>Caves containing articles of iron, and therefore belonging to that division of
                    the prehistoric age, are so unimportant that they do not deserve notice in this
                    place. As man increased in civilization he preferred to five in bouses of his
                    own building, and he no longer buried his dead in the natural sepulchres
                    provided for him in the rock.</p>

                <p>Prehistoric caves have been rarely explored in extraEuropean areas. Among those
                    which abound in Palestine, one in Mount Lebanon, examined by the Rev. Canon
                    Tristram, contained flint implements along with charcoal and broken bones and
                    teeth, some of which may be referred to a small ox, undistinguishable from the
                    small short-horn, <hi rend="italic">Bos longifrons.</hi> In North America the
                    remains found by Mr. F. W. Putnam in the caves of Kentucky, consisting of
                    moccasins, rudely plaited cloth, and other articles, may be referred to the same
                    division.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Historic Caves in Britain.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    historic caves have only attracted notice during the last few years, and in
                    Britain alone, principally through the labours of the Settle Cave Committee from
                    the year 1869 to the present day. To them is due the exploration of the Victoria
                    Cave, which had been discovered and partially investigated as early as the year
                    1838. It consists of three large ill-defined chambers opening on the face of the
                    cliff 1450 feet above the sea, and filled with <hi rend="italic">debris</hi>
                    very nearly up to the roof. It presented three distinct eras of occupation,—one
                    by hyaenas, which dragged into it rhinoceroses, bisons, mammoths, horses,
                    reindeer, and bears. This was defined from the next occupation, which is
                    probably of the Neolithic age, by a layer of grey clay, on the surface of which
                    rested a bone harpoon and a few flint flakes and bones. Then after an interval
                    of <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> at the entrance was a layer of charcoal, broken
                    bones, fragments of old hearths, and numerous instruments of savage life
                    associated with broken pottery, Roman coins, and the rude British imitations of
                    them, various articles of iron, and elaborate personal ornaments, which implied
                    a considerable development of the arts. The evidence of the coins stamps the
                    date of the occupation of the cave to be between the first half of the 5th
                    century and the English invasion. Some of the brooches present a peculiar
                    flamboyant and spiral pattern in relief, of the same character as the art of
                    some of the illuminated manuscripts, as for example one of the Anglo-Saxon
                    gospels at Stockholm, and of the gospels of St Columban in Trinity College,
                    Dublin. It is mostly allied to that work which is termed by Mr Franks late
                    Celtic. From its localization in Britain and Ireland, it seems to be probable
                    that it is of Celtic derivation; and if this view be accepted, there is nothing
                    at all extraordinary in its being recognized in the illuminated Irish gospels.
                    Ireland, in the 6th and 7th centuries, was the great centre of art,
                    civilization, and literature; and it is only reasonable to suppose that there
                    would be intercourse between the Irish Christians and those of the west of
                    Britain, during the time that the Romano-Celts, or Brit-Welsh, were being slowly
                    pushed westwards by the heathen English invader. Proof of such an intercourse we
                    find in the brief notice of the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cambrioe,</hi> in which Gildas, the Brit-Welsh historian, is stated to have
                    sailed over to Ireland in the year 565 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> It is by
                    no means improbable that about this time there was a Brit-Welsh migration into
                    Ireland, as well as into Brittany. Objects with these designs found in Germany
                    are probably directly or indirectly due to the Irish missionaries, who spread
                    Christianity through those regions. The early Christian art in Ireland grew out
                    of the late Celtic, and is to a great extent free from the influence of Rome,
                    which is stamped on the Brit-Welsh art of the same age in this country.</p>
                <p>Several other ornaments with enamel deserve especial notice. The enamel composed
                    of red, blue and yellow has been inserted into the hollows in the bronze, and
                    then heated so as to form a close union with it. They are of the same design as
                    those which have been met with in late Roman tumuli in this country, and in
                    places which are mainly in the north. They all belong to a class named late
                    Celtic by Mr Franks, and are considered by him to be of British manufacture.
                    This view is supported by the only reference to the art of enamelling furnished
                    by the classical writers. Philostratus, a Greek sophist in the court of Julia
                    Domna, the wife of the Emperor Severus, writes, “It is said that the barbarians
                    living in the ocean pour these colours (those of horse-trappings) on heated
                    bronze, and that these adhere, grow as hard as stone, and preserve the designs
                    that are made in them.” It is worthy of remark that, since the Emperor Severus
                    built the wall which bears his name, marched in person against the Caledonians,
                    and died at York, the account of the enamels may have reached Philostratus from
                    the very district in which the Victoria Cave is situated.</p>
                <p>Associated with these were bronze ornaments inlaid with silver, and miscellaneous
                    iron articles, among which was a Roman key. Remains of this kind have been met
                    with in the Albert and Keiko caves in the neighbourhood, in that of Dowkerbottom
                    near Arncliffe, in that of Kirkhead on the northern shore of Morecombe Bay, in
                    Poole’s Cavern near Buxton, and in Thor’s Cave near Ashbourne.</p>

                <p>It is obvious in all these cases that men accustomed to luxury and refinement
                    were compelled, by the pressure of some great calamity, to flee for refuge to
                    caves with whatever they could transport thither of their property. The number
                    of spindle-whorls and personal ornaments imply that they were accompanied by
                    their families. We may also infer that they were cut off from the civilization
                    to which they had been accustomed, because in some cases they extemporized
                    spindle-whorls out of fragments of Samian ware, instead of using those which
                    were expressly manufactured for the purpose. Why the caves were inhabited is
                    satisfactorily explained by an appeal to contemporary history. In the pages of
                    Gildas, in the <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,</hi> and in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">Cambrioe,</hi> we have a graphic
                    picture of that long war of invasion by which the inhabitants of the old Roman
                    province of Britannia were driven back by the Jutes, Angles, and Saxons, who
                    crossed over with their families and household stuff. Slowly, and in the chances
                    of a war which extended through three centuries, they were gradually pushed back
                    into Cumberland, Wales, and West Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall. While this war
                    was going on the coinage became debased, and Roman coins afforded the patterns
                    for the small bronze minimi, which are to be met with equally in these caves <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n282/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0282-0271"/> and in the ruins of Roman cities. As the tide of
                    war rolled to the west, the English tongue and, until towards the close of the
                    struggle, the worship of Thor and Odin supplanted the British tongue and the
                    Christian faith, and a rude barbarism replaced what was left of the Roman
                    civilization in the island. It is to this period that relics of this kind in the
                    caves must be assigned. They are traces of the anarchy of those times, and
                    complete the picture of the desolation of Britain, revealed by the ashes of the
                    cities and villas that were burnt by the invader. They prove that the vivid
                    account given by Gildas of the straits to which his countrymen were reduced were
                    literally true. The historic caves of the Continent have not as yet been
                    explored.</p>
