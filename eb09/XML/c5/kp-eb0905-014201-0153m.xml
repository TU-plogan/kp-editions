                <p>BY Cartesianism is here meant the philosophy developed principally in the works
                    of Des Cartes, Malebranche, and Spinoza. It is impossible to exhibit the full
                    meaning of these authors except in connection, for they are all ruled by one and
                    the same thought in different stages of its evolution. It may be true that
                    Malebranche and Spinoza were prepared, the former by the study of Augustine, the
                    latter by the study of Jewish philosophy, to draw from Cartesian principles
                    consequences which Des Cartes never anticipated. But the foreign light did not
                    alter the picture on which it was cast, but only let it be seen more clearly.
                    The consequences were legitimately drawn. It may be shown that they lay in the
                    system from the first, and that they were evolved by nothing but its own
                    immanent dialectic. At the same time it is not likely that they would ever have
                    been brought into such clear consciousness, or expressed with such consistency,
                    except by a philosopher whose circumstances and character had completely
                    detached him from all the convictions and prejudices of the age. In Malebranche,
                    Cartesianism found an interpreter whose meditative spirit was fostered by the
                    cloister, but whose speculative boldness was restrained by the traditions of the
                    Catholic church. In Spinoza it found one who was in spirit and position more
                    completely isolated than any monk, who was removed from the influence of the
                    religious as well as the secular world of his time, and who in his solitude
                    seemed scarcely ever to hear any voice but the voice of philosophy. It is
                    because Cartesianism found such a pure organ of expression that its development
                    is, in some sense, complete and typical. Its principles have been carried to
                    their ultimate result, and we have before us all the data necessary to determine
                    their value.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Des Cartes</hi> was, in the full sense of the word, a
                    partaker of the modern spirit. He was equally moved by the tendencies that
                    produced the Reformation, and the tendencies that produced the revival of
                    letters and science. Like Erasmus and Bacon, he sought to escape from a
                    transcendent and unreal philosophy of the other world, to the knowledge of man,
                    and the world he lives in. But like Luther, he found within human experience,
                    among the matters nearest to man, the consciousness of God, and therefore his
                    renunciation of scholasticism did not end either in materialism, or in that
                    absolute distinction between faith and reason which inevitably leads to the
                    downfall of faith. What was peculiar to Des Cartes, however, was the speculative
                    interest which made it impossible for him to rest in mere experience, whether of
                    things spiritual or things secular, which made him search, both in our
                    consciousness of God and our consciousness of the world, for the links by which
                    they are bound to the consciousness of self. In both cases it is his aim to go
                    back to the beginning, to retrace the unconscious process by which the world of
                    experience was built up, to discover the hidden logic that connects the
                    different parts of the structure of belief, to substitute a reasoned system, all
                    whose elements are interdependent, for an unreasoned congeries of opinions.
                    Hence his first step involves reflection, doubt, and abstraction, Turning the
                    eye of reason upon itself, he tries to measure the value of that collection of
                    beliefs of which he finds himself possessed; and the first thing that reflection
                    seems to discoveι is its accidental and unconnected character. It is a mass of
                    incongruous materials, accumulated without system and untested. Its elements
                    have been put together under all kinds of influences, without any conscious
                    intellectual process, and therefore we can have no assurance of them. In order
                    that we may have such assurance we must unweave the web of experience and
                    thought which we have woven in our sleep, that we may begin again at the
                    beginning and weave it over again with “clear and distinct” consciousness of
                    what we are doing. <hi rend="italic">De omnibus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dubitandum</hi><hi rend="italic">est.</hi> We must free ourselves by one
                    decisive effort from the weight of custom, prejudice, and tradition with which
                    our consciousness of the world has been overlaid, that in that consciousness in
                    its simplest and most elementary form we may find the true beginning of
                    knowledge. The method of doubt is at the same time a method of abstraction, by
                    which Des Cartes rises above the thought of the particular objects of knowledge,
                    in order that he may find the primary truth in which lies the very definition of
                    knowledge, or the reason why anything can be said to be true. First disappears
                    the whole mass of dogmas and opinions as to God and man which are confessedly
                    received on mere authority. Then the supposed evidence of sense is rejected, for
                    external reality is not immediately given in sensation. It is acknowledged by
                    all that the senses often mislead us as to the nature of things without us, and
                    perhaps they may also mislead us as to there being anything without us at all.
                    Nay, by a stretch of effort, we can even carry doubt beyond this point, we can
                    doubt even mathematical truth. When, indeed, we have our thoughts directed to
                    the geometrical demonstration, when the steps of the process are immediately
                    before our minds, we cannot but assent to the proposition that the angles of a
                    triangle are equal to two right angles; but when we forget or turn away our
                    thoughts from such demonstration, we can imagine that God or some powerful
                    spirit is playing upon our minds to deceive them, so that even our most certain
                    judgments may be illusory. In this naïve manner does Des Cartes express the idea
                    that there are necessities of thought prior to, and presupposed in the truth of
                    geometry. He is seeking to strip thought of all the “lendings” that seem to come
                    to it from anything but itself, of all relation to being that can be supposed to
                    be given to it from without, that he may discover the primary unity of thought
                    and being on which all knowledge depends. And this he finds in pure
                    self-consciousness. Whatever I abstract from, I cannot abstract from self, from
                    the “I think” that, as Kant puts it, accompanies all our ideas; for it was in
                    fact the very independence of this universal element on the particulars that
                    made all our previous abstraction possible. Even doubt rests on certitude; alone
                    with self I cannot get rid of this self. By an effort of thought I separate my
                    thinking self from all that I think, but the thinking self remains, and in
                    thinking I am. <hi rend="italic">Cogito</hi><hi rend="italic">ergo sum.</hi> The
                    objective judgment of self-consciousness is bound up with or involved in the
                    very faculty of judging, and therefore remains when we abstract from all other
                    objective judgments It is an assertion involved in the very process by which we
                    dismiss all other assertions. Have we not then a right to regard it as a
                    primitive unity of thought and being, in which is contained, or out of which may
                    be developed, the very definition of truth <hi rend="italic">1</hi></p>
                <p>The sense in which Des Cartes understood his first principle becomes clearer when
                    we look at his answers to the objections made against it. On the one hand it was
                    challenged by those who asked, like Gassendi, why the argument should be based
                    especially on thought, and why w e might not say with as good a right <hi
                    rend="italic">ambulo</hi><hi rend="italic">ergo sum.</hi> Des Cartes explains
                    that it is only as referred to consciousness that walking is an evidence of my
                    existence; but if I say “I am conscious of w alking, therefore I exist,” this
                    is.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n154/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0154-0143"/>
                <p>equivalent to saying, “I think in one particular way, therefore I exist.” But it
                    is not thinking in a particular way, but thinking in general that is
                    co-extensive with my existence. I am not always conscious of walking, or of any
                    other special state or object, but I am always conscious, for except in
                    consciousness there is no ego or self, and where there is consciousness there is
                    always an ego. Do I then always think, even in sleep, asks the objector; and Des
                    Cartes exposes himself to the criticisms of Locke, by maintaining that it is
                    impossible that there should ever be an interval in the activity of
                    consciousness, and by insisting that as man is essentially a thinking substance,
                    the child thinks, or is self-conscious, even in its mother’s womb. The
                    difficulty disappears when we observe that the question as to the conditions
                    under which self-consciousness is developed in the individual human subject,
                    does not affect the nature of self-consciousness in itself, or in its relation
                    to knowledge. The force of Des Cartes’s argument really lies in this, that the
                    world as an intelligible world exists only for a conscious self, and that
                    therefore the unity of thought and being in self-consciousness is presupposed in
                    all knowledge. Of this self it is true to say that it exists only as it thinks,
                    and that it thinks always. <hi rend="italic">Coglto ergo sum</hi> is, as Des
                    Cartes points out, not a syllogism, but the expression of an identity which is
                    discerned by the simple intuition of the mind.<note anchored="true"

                    on the contrary it is from the immediate consciousness of being as contained in
                    self-consciousness that that major can alone be derived. Again, when Hobbes and
                    others argued that thinking is or may be a property of a material substance, Des
                    Cartes answers that the question whether the material aud the thinking substance
                    are one does not meet us at the outset, but can only be solved after we have
                    considered what is involved in the conception of these different substances
                    respectively.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">* Resp. ad</hi><hi rend="italic">tertias</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >object.,</hi> p. 94.</p></note> In other words, to begin by treating thinking
                    as a quality of a material substance, is to go outside of the intelligible world
                    for an explanation of the intelligible world. It is to ask for something prior
                    to that which is first in thought. If it be true that the consciousness of self
                    is that from which we cannot abstract, that which is involved in the knowledge
                    of anything, then to go beyond it and seek for a reason or explanation of it in
                    anything else is to go beyond the beginning of knowledge; it is to ask for a
                    knowledge before knowledge.</p>
                <p>Des Cartes, however, is himself unfaithful to this point of view; for,strictly
                    taken, it would involve the consequence, not only that there is nothing prior to
                    the pure consciousness of self, but that there can be no object which is not in
                    necessary relation to it. Hence there can be no absolute opposition between
                    thought and anything else, no opposition which thought itself does not
                    transcend. But Des Cartes commits the error of making thought the property of a
                    substance, a <hi rend="italic">res</hi><hi rend="italic">cogitans,</hi> which as
                    such can immediately or directly apprehend nothing but thoughts or ideas; while,
                    altogether outside of these thoughts and ideas, there is another substance
                    characterized by the property of extension, and with which thought has nothing
                    to do. Matter in space is thus changed, in Kantian language, into a “thing in
                    itself,” an object out of all relation to the subject; and on the other hand,
                    mind seems to be shut up in the magic circle of its own ideas, without any
                    capacity of breaking through the circle or apprehending any reality but itself.
                    Between thought and being, in spite of their <hi rend="italic">subjective</hi>
                    unity in self-consciousness, a great gulf seems still to be fixed, which cannot
                    be crossed unless thought should become extended, or matter think. But to Des
                    Cartes the dualism is absolute, because it is a presupposition with which he
                    starts. Mind cannot go out of itself, cannot deal with anything but thought,
                    without ceasing to be mind; and matter must cease to be matter ere it can lose
                    its absolute externality, its nature as having <hi rend="italic">partes extra
                    partes,</hi> and acquire the unity of mind. They are opposed as the divisible
                    and the indivisible, and there is no possible existence of matter in thought
                    except a representative existence. The ideal (or, as Des Cartes calls it,
                    objective) existence of matter <hi rend="italic">in</hi> thought and the real
                    (or, as Des Cartes calls it, formal) existence of matter <hi rend="italic">out
                    of</hi> thought are absolutely different and independent things.</p>
                <p>It was, however, impossible for Des Cartes to be content with a subjective
                    idealism that confined all knowledge to the tautological expression of
                    self-consciousness “I am I,” “What I perceive I perceive.” If the individual is
                    to find in his self-consciousness the principle of all knowledge, there must be
                    something in it which transcends the distinction of self and not self, which
                    carries him beyond the limit of his own individuality. What then is the point
                    where the subjective consciousness passes out into the objective, from which it
                    seemed at first absolutely excluded? Des Cartes answers that it is through the
                    connection of the consciousness cf self with the consciousness of God. It is
                    because we find God in our minds that we find anything else. The proof of God’s
                    existence is therefore the hinge on which the whole Cartesian philosophy turns,
                    and it is necessary to examine the nature of it somewhat closely.</p>
                <p>Des Cartes, in the first place, tries to extract a criterion of truth out of the
                    <hi rend="italic">cogito</hi><hi rend="italic">ergo sum.</hi> Why am I assured
                    of my own existence? It is because the conception of existence is at once and
                    immediately involved in the consciousness of self. I can logically distinguish
                    the two elements, but I cannot separate them; whenever I clearly and distinctly
                    conceive the one, I am forced to think the other along with it. But this gives
                    me a rule for all judgments whatever, a principle which is related to the <hi
                    rend="italic">cogito ergo sum</hi> as the formal to the material principle of
                    knowledge. Whatever we cannot separate from the clear and distinct conception of
                    anything, necessarily belongs to it in reality; and on the other hand, whatever
                    we can separate from the clear and distinct conception of anything, does not
                    necessarily belong to it in reality. Let us therefore set an object clearly
                    before us, let us sever it in thought so far as is possible from all other
                    objects, and we shall at once be able to determine what properties and relations
                    are essential, and what are not essential to it. And if we find empirically that
                    any object manifests a property or relation not involved in the clear and
                    distinct conception of it, we can say with certainty that such property or
                    relation does not belong to it except by arbitrary arrangement, or, in other
                    words, by the external combination of things which in their own nature have no
                    affinity or connection.</p>
                <p>Now, by the application of this principle, we might at once assure ourselves of
                    many mathematical truths; but, as has been already shown, there is a point of
                    view from which we may doubt even these, so long as the idea of a God that
                    deceives us is not excluded. If it is not certain that there is a God that
                    cannot lie, it is not certain that there is an objective matter in space to
                    which mathematical truth applies. But the existence of God may be proved in two
                    ways. In the first place it may be proved through the principle of causality,
                    which is a self-evident truth. We have in our mind many ideas, and according to
                    the principle of causality, all these ideas must be derived from something that
                    contains a “formal” reality which corresponds to their “objective” reality, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> which contains at least as much reality in its
                    existence out of thought as they contain in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n155/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0155-0144"/> their existence in thought. Now we might derive
                    from ourselves not only the ideas of other minds like ourselves, but possibly
                    also of material objects, since these are lower in the scale of existence than
                    ourselves, and it is conceivable that the idea of them might be got by omitting
                    some of the qualities which distinguish ourselves. But the idea of God, of a
                    being who is eternal and immutable, all powerful, all wise, and all good, cannot
                    be derived from our own limited and imperfect existence. The origin, therefore,
                    must be sought in a being who contains actually in himself all that is contained
                    in our idea of him.</p>
                <p>To this argument it was objected by some of the critics of Des Cartes that the
                    idea of God as the infinite Being is merely negative, and that it is derived
                    from the finite simply by abstracting from its conditions. Des Cartes answers
                    that the case is just the reverse—the infinite is the positive idea, and the
                    finite is the negative, and therefore the former is the presupposition of the
                    latter. As Kant, at a later date, pointed out that space is not a general
                    conception, abstracted from the ideas of particular spaces, and representing the
                    common element in them, but that, on the contrary, the ideas of particular
                    spaces are got by the limitation of the one infinite space that is prior to
                    them, so Des Cartes maintains in general that the idea of the finite is had only
                    by limitation of the infinite, and not the idea of the infinite by abstraction
                    from the particular determiuations of the finite. It is a necessary consequence
                    of this that the self-consciousness of a finite being is bound up with the
                    consciousness of the infinite. Hence the idea of God is not merely one among
                    other ideas which we have, but it is the one idea that is necessary to our very
                    existence as thinking beings, the idea through which alone we can think
                    ourselves, or anything else. “I ought never to suppose,” says Des Cartes, “that
                    my conception of the infinite is a negative idea, got by negation of the finite,
                    just as I conceive repose to be merely negation of movement, and darkness merely
                    the negation of light. On the contrary, I see manifestly that there is more
                    reality in the infinite than in the finite substance, and that therefore I have
                    in me the notion of the infinite, <hi rend="italic">even in some sense prior to
                    the notion of the finite,</hi> or, in other words, that the notion of myself in
                    some sense presupposes the notion of God; for how could I doubt or desire, how
                    could I be conscious of anything as a want, how could I know that I am not
                    altogether perfect, if I had not in me the idea of a being more perfect than
                    myself, by comparison with whom I recognize the defects of my own existence
                    î”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Meditatio tertia,</hi> p. 21.</p></note> Des Cartes then goes on in various
                    ways to illustrate the thesis that the consciousness of a defective and growing
                    nature cannot give rise to the idea of infinite perfection, but on the contrary,
                    presupposes it. We could not think of a series of approximations, unless there
                    were somehow present to us the idea of the completed infinite as the goal we aim
                    at. If we had not the consciousness of ourselves as finite <hi rend="italic">in
                    relation</hi> to the infinite, either we should not be conscious of ourselves at
                    all, or we should be conscious of ourselves as infinite. The image of God is so
                    impressed by Him upon us, that we “conceive that resemblance wherein the idea of
                    God is contained by the same faculty whereby we are conscious of ourselves.” In
                    other words, our consciousness of ourselves is at the same time consciousness of
                    our finitude, and hence of our relation to a being who is infinite.</p>
                <p>The principle which underlies the reasoning of Des Cartes is, that to be
                    conscious of a limit, is to transcend it. We could not feel the limits either
                    upon our thought or upon our existence, we could not doubt or desire, if we did
                    not already apprehend something beyond these limits. Nay, we could not be
                    conscious of our existence as individual selves, if we were not conscious of
                    that which is not ourselves, and of a unity in which both self and not-self are
                    included. Our individual life is therefore to us as self-conscious beings a part
                    of a wider universal life. Doubt and aspiration are but the manifestation of
                    this essential division and contradiction of a nature, which, as conscious of
                    itself, is at the same time conscious of the whole in which it is a part. And as
                    the existence of a self and its consciousness are one, so we may say that a
                    thinking being is not only an individual, but always in some sense identified
                    with that universal unity of being to which it is essentially related.</p>
                <p>If Des Cartes had followed out this line of thought, he would have been led at
                    once to the pantheism of Spinoza, if not beyond it. As it is, he is on the verge
                    of contradiction with himself when he speaks of the consciousness of God as <hi
                    rend="italic">in some sense</hi> prior to the consciousness of self. How can
                    anything be prior to the first principles of knowledge î It is no answer to say
                    that the consciousness of God is the <hi rend="italic">principium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">essendi</hi> while the consciousness of self is the <hi
                    rend="italic">principium cognoscendi.</hi> For, if the idea of God is prior to
                    the idea of self, knowledge must begin where existence begins, with God. The
                    words “in some sense,” with which Des Cartes qualifies his assertion of the
                    priority of the idea of God, only betray his hesitation and his partial
                    consciousness of the contradiction in which he is involved. Some of Des Cartes’s
                    critics 'presented this difficulty to him in another form, and accused him of
                    reasoning in a circle when he said that it is because God cannot lie that we are
                    certain that our clear and distinct ideas do not deceive us. The very existence
                    of the conscious self, the <hi rend="italic">cogito</hi><hi rend="italic">ergo
                    sum,</hi> which is the first of all truths and therefore prior in certitude to
                    the existence of God, is believed only because of the clearness and distinctness
                    with which we apprehend it. How then, they argued, could God’s truthfulness be
                    our security for a principle which we must use in order to prove the being of
                    God î The answer of Des Cartes is somewhat lame. We cannot doubt any
                    self-evident principle, or even any truth based on a self-evident principle,
                    when we are directly contemplating it in all the necessity of its evidence; it
                    is only when we forget or turn away from this evidence, and begin to think of
                    the possibility of a deceitful God, that a doubt arises which cannot be removed
                    except by the conviction that God is true.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Resρ.</hi><hi rend="italic">quartae,</hi>
                    p. 234.</p></note> It can scarcely be said that this is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >dignus vindice</hi><hi rend="italic">nodus,</hi> or that God can fitly appear
                    as a kind of second-best resource to the forgetful spirit that has lost its
                    direct hold on truth and its faith in itself. God, truth, and the human spirit
                    are thus conceived as having merely external and accidental relations with each
                    other. What Des Cartes, however, is really expressing in this exoteric way, is
                    simply that beneath and beyond all particular truths lies the great general
                    truth of the unity of thought and existence. In contemplating particular truth,
                    we may not consciously relate it to this unity, but when we have to defend
                    ourselves against scepticism, we are forced to realize this relation. The
                    ultimate answer to any attack upon a special aspect or element of truth must be
                    to show that the fate of truth itself, the possibility of knowledge is involved
                    in the rejection of it, and that we cannot doubt it without doubting reason
                    itself. But to doubt reason is, in the language of Des Cartes, to doubt the
                    truthfulness of God, for, in his view, the idea of God is involved in the very
                    constitution of reason. Taken in this way then, the import of Des Cartes’s
                    answer is, that the consciousness of self, like every other particular truth, is
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n156/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0156-0145"/> not at first seen to rest on the consciousness of
                    God, but that when we realize what it means we see that it does so rest. But if
                    this be so, then in making the consciousness of self his first principle of
                    knowledge, Des Cartes has stopped short of the truth. It can only be the first
                    principle if it is understood not as the consciousness of the individual self,
                    but in a sense in which the consciousness of self is identical with the
                    consciousness of God.</p>
                <p>Des Cartes, however, is far from a clear apprehension of the ultimate unity of
                    thought and being, which nevertheless he strives to find in God. Beginning with
                    an absolute separation of the <hi rend="italic">res</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cogitans</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">res</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >extensa,</hi> he is continually falling back into dualism just when he seemed
                    to have escaped from it. Even in God the absolute unity, idea and reality fall
                    asunder; our idea of God is not God in us, it is only an idea of which God’s
                    existence is the cause. But the category of causality, if it forms a bridge
                    between different things, as here between knowing and being, at the same time
                    repels them from each other. It is a category of external relation which may be
                    adequate to express the relation of the finite to the finite, but not the
                    relation of the finite to the infinite. We cannot conceive God as the cause of
                    our idea of him, without making God a purely objective and therefore finite
                    existence. Nor is the case better when we turn to the so-called ontological
                    argument,—that existence is necessarily involved in the idea of God, just as the
                    property of having its angles equal to two right angles is involved in the idea
                    of a triangle. If indeed we understood this as meaning that thought transcends
                    the distinction between itself and existence, and that therefore existence
                    cannot be a thing in itself out of thought, but must be an intelligible world
                    that exists as such only for the thinking being, there is some force in the
                    argument. But this meaning we cannot find in Des Cartes, or to find it we must
                    make him inconsistent with himself. He was so far from having quelled the
                    phantom “thing in itself,” that he treated matter in space as such a thing, and
                    thus confused externality of space with externality to the mind. On this
                    dualistic basis, the ontological argument becomes a manifest paralogism, and
                    lies open to all the objections that Kant brought against it. That the idea of
                    God involves existence proves only that God, if he exists at all, exists by the
                    necessity of his being. But the link that shall bind thought to existence is
                    still wanting, and, in consistency with the other presuυoositions of Des Cartes
                    it cannot be supplied.</p>
                <p>But again, even if we allow to Des Cartes that God is the unity of thought and
                    being, we must still ask what kind of unity 1 Is it a mere generic unity,
                    reached by abstraction, and therefore leaving out all the distinguishing
                    characteristics of the particulars under it l Or is it a concrete unity to which
                    the particular elements are subordinated, but in which they are nevertheless
                    included? To answer this question, we need only look at the relation of the
                    finite to the infinite, as it is expressed in the passage already quoted, and in
                    many others. Des Cartes always speaks of the infinite as a purely affirmative or
                    positive existence, and of the finite in so far as it is distinguished from the
                    infinite, as purely negative, or in other words as a nonentity. “I am,” he says,
                    “a mean between God and nothing, between the Supreme Being and not-being. In so
                    far as I am created by God, there is nothing in me that can deceive me or lead
                    me into error. But on the other hand, if I consider myself as participating in
                    nothingness, or not-being, inasmuch as I am not myself the Supreme Being, but in
                    many ways defective, I find myself exposed to an infinity of errors. Thus error
                    as such is not something real that depends on God, but simply a defect; I do not
                    need to explain it by means of any special faculty bestowed on me by God, but
                    merely by the fact that the faculty for discerning truth from error with which
                    he has endowed me, is not infinite.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Meditatio quarta,</hi> p. 26.</p></note>
                    But if we follow out this principle to its logical result, we must say not only
                    that error is a consequence of finitude, but also that the very <hi
                    rend="italic">existence</hi> of the finite as such is an error or illusion. All
                    finitude, all determination, according to the well-known Spinozistic aphorism,
                    is negation, and negation cannot constitute reality. To know the reality of
                    things, therefore, we have to abstract from their limits, or in other words, the
                    only reality is the infinite. Finite being, <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> finite,
                    has no existence, and finite self-consciousness, consciousness of a self in
                    opposition to, or limited by, a not-self is an illusion. But Des Cartes does not
                    thus reason. He does not see “anything in the nature of the infinite which
                    should exclude the existence of finite things.” “What” he asks “would become of
                    the power of that imaginary infinite if it could create nothing I Perceiving in
                    ourselves the power of thinking, we can easily conceive that there should be a
                    greater intelligence elsewhere. And even if we should suppose that intelligence
                    increased <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum,</hi> we need not fear that our own
                    would be lessened. And the same is true of all other attributes which we ascribe
                    to God, even of his power, provided only that we do not suppose that the power
                    in us is not subjected to God’s will. In all points, therefore, He is infinite
                    without any exclusion of created things.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    view we need not dispute; the question is as to its consistency with Cartesian
                    principles. It may be a higher idea of God to conceive him as revealing himself
                    in and to finite creatures; but it is a different idea from that which is
                    implied in Des Cartes’s explanations of error. It is an inconsistency that
                    brings Des Cartes nearer to Christiantity, and nearer it may also be said, to a
                    true metaphysic; but it is not the less an inconsistency with his fundamental
                    principles which necessarily disappears in their subsequent development. To
                    conceive the finite as not constituted merely by the absence of some of the
                    positive elements of the infinite, but as in necessary unity with the infinite;
                    to conceive the infinite as not merely that which has no limits, or
                    determinations, but as that which is self-determined and self-manifesting, which
                    through all finitude and manifestation returns upon itself, may not be
                    erroneous. But it would not be difficult to show that the adoption of such a
                    conception involves the rejection or modification of almost every doctrine of
                    the Cartesian system.</p>
                <p>In connection with this inconsistency we may notice the very different relations
                    in which Des Cartes conceives mind on the one side and matter on the other, to
                    stand towards God, who yet is the cause of both, and must therefore, by the
                    principle of causality, contain in himself all that is in both. Matter and mind
                    are to Des Cartes absolute opposites. Whatever can be asserted of mind can be
                    denied of matter, whatever can be asserted of matter can be denied of mind.
                    Matter is passive, mind is active; matter is extended, and therefore divisible
                    <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum;</hi> mind is an indivisible unity. In fact,
                    though of this Des Cartes is not conscious, the determination of the one is
                    mediated by its opposition to the other; the ideas of object and subject, the
                    self and not-self, are terms of a relation distinguishable but inseparable. But
                    in the idea of God we must find a unity which transcends this difference in one
                    way or another, whether by combining the two under a higher notion, or, as it
                    would be more natural to expect on Cartesian principles, by abstracting equally
                    from the particular characteristics of both. Des Cartes really does neither, or
                    rather he acts par,tly on the one principle and partly on the other. In his idea
                    of God he abstracts from the properties of matter but not from those of mind.

                    elsewhere expresses it more popularly, he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> mind, but he
                    is only the creator of matter. And for this he gives as his reason, that matter
                    as being divisible and passive is essentially imperfect. <hi rend="italic"

                    more analogy between sounds and colours than there is between material things
                    and God.” But the real imperfection here lies in the abstractness of the
                    Cartesian conception of matter as merely extended, merely passive; and this is
                    balanced by the equal abstractness of the conception of mind or self
                    consciousness as an absolutely simple activity, a pure intelligence without any
                    object but itself. If matter as absolutely opposed to mind is imperfect, mind as
                    absolutely opposed to matter is equally imperfect. In fact they are the elements
                    or factors of a unity, and lose all meaning when -severed from each other, and
                    if we are to seek this unity by abstraction, we must equally abstract from
                    both.</p>
                <p>The result of this one-sidedness is seen in the fact that Des Cartes, who begins
                    by separating mind from matter, ends by finding the essence of mind in pure
                    will, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in pure formal self-determination. Hence
                    God’s will is conceived as absolutely arbitrary, not determined by any end or
                    law, for all laws, even the necessary truths that constitute reason,’ spring
                    from God’s determination, and do not precede it. “He is the author of the
                    essence of things no less than their existence,” and his will has no reason but
                    his will. In man there is an intelligence with eternal laws or truths involved
                    in its structure, which so far limits his will. “He finds the nature of good and
                    truth already determined by God, and his will cannot be moved by anything else.”
                    His highest freedom consists in having his will determined by a clear perception
                    of the nature of good and truth, and “he is never indifferent except when he is
                    ignorant of it, or at least does not see it so clearly as to be lifted above the
                    possibility of doubt.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    will is to him “the lowest grade of liberty,” yet, on the other hand, in nothing
                    does the image of God in him show itself more clearly than in the fact that his
                    will is not limited by his clear and distinct knowledge, but is “in a manner
                    infinite.” For “there is no object of any will, even the infinite will of God,
                    to which our will does not extend.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    is a free act, for as we can yield our assent to the obscure conceptions
                    presented by sense and the imagination, and thus allow ourselves to be led into
                    error, so on the other hand we can refuse to give this assent, or allow
                    ourselves to be determined by anything but the clear and distinct ideas of
                    intelligence. That which makes it possible for us to err is that also in which
                    the divine image in us is most clearly seen. We cannot have the freedom of God
                    whose will creates the object of his knowledge; but in reserving our assent for
                    the clear and distinct perceptions of intelligence, we, as it were, re-enact for
                    ourselves the divine law, and repeat, so far as is possible to finite beings,
                    the transcendent act of will in which truth and good had their origin</p>
                <p>The inherent defect of this view is the divorce it makes between the form and the
                    matter of intelligence. It implies that reason or self-consciousness is one
                    thing, and that truth is another and quite different thing, which has been
                    united to it by the arbitrary will of God. The same external conception of the
                    relation of truth to the mind is involved in the doctrine of innate ideas. It is
                    true that Des Cartes did not hold that doctrine in the coarse form in which it
                    was attributed to him by Locke, but expressly declares that he has “never said
                    or thought at any time that the mind required innate ideas which were separated
                    from the faculty of thinking. He had simply used the word innate to distinguish
                    those ideas which are derived from that faculty, and not from external objects
                    or the determination of the will. Just as when we say generosity is innate in
                    certain families, and in certain others diseases, like the gout or the stone, we
                    do not mean to imply that infants in their mother’s womb are affected with these
                    complaints.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Yet Des Cartes, as we have seen, does not hold that these truths are involved in
                    the very nature of intelligence as such, so that we cannot conceive a
                    self-conscious being without them. On the contrary we are to regard the divine
                    intelligence as by arbitrary act determining that two and two should be four, or
                    that envy should be a vice. We are “<hi rend="italic">not</hi> to conceive
                    eternal truth flowing from God as rays from the sun.”<note anchored="true"

                    HO.</p></note> In other words, we are not to conceive all particular truths as
                    different aspects of one truth. It is part of the imperfection of man’s finite
                    nature that he “finds truth and good determined for him.” It is something
                    given,—given, indeed, along with his very faculty of thinking, but still <hi
                    rend="italic">given</hi> as an external limit to it. It belongs not to his
                    nature as spirit, but to his finitude as man.</p>
                <p>After what has been said, it is obvious that the transition from God to matter
                    must be somewhat arbitrary and external. God’s truthfulness is pledged for the
                    reality of that of which we have clear and distinct ideas; and we have clear and
                    distinct ideas of the external world so long as we conceive it simply as
                    extended iñatter, infinitely divisible, and moved entirely from without,—so
                    long, in short, as we conceive it as the direct opposite of mind, and do not
                    attribute to it any one of the properties of mind. <hi rend="italic">Omnes

                    modes of thought which arise whenever we attribute any of the secondary
                    qualities, which exist merely in our sensations, to the objects that cause these
                    sensations. The subjective character of such qualities is proved by the constant
                    change which takes place in them, without any change of the object in which they
                    are perceived. A piece of wax cannot lose its extension; but its colour, its
                    hardness, and all the other qualities whereby it is presented to sense, may be
                    easily altered. What is objective in all this is merely an extended substance,
                    and the modes of motion or rest through which it is made to pass. In like manner
                    we must separate from our notion of matter all ideas of <hi rend="italic">actio
                    in</hi><hi rend="italic">distans,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> we must explain weight not as a tendency to the centre of the earth
                    or an attraction of distant particles of matter, but as a consequence of the
                    pressure of other bodies, immediately surrounding that which is felt to be
                    heavy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    conceivable <hi rend="italic">actio in</hi><hi rend="italic">distans</hi> is
                    that which is mediated by thought, and it is only in so far as we suppose matter
                    to have in it a principle of activity like thought, that we can accept such
                    explanations of its motion. Again, while we must thus keep our conception of
                    matter clear of all elements that do not belong to it, we must also be careful
                    not to take away from it those that <hi rend="italic">do</hi> belong to it. It
                    is a defect of distinctness in our ideas when we conceive an attribute as
                    existing apart from its substance, or a substance without its attribute; for
                    this is to treat elements that are only separated by a “distinction of reason,”
                    as if they were distinct things. The conception of the possibility of a vacuum
                    or empty space·arises merely from our confusing the possible separation of any
                    mode or form of matter from matter in general with the impossible separation of
                    matter in general <pb break="no"

                    his physical philosophy, Des Cartes attempts to explain everything on mechanical
                    principles, starting with the hypothesis that a certain quantity of motion has
                    been impressed on the material universe by God at the first, a quantity which
                    can never be lost or diminished, and that space is an absolute plenum in which
                    motion propagates itself in circles. It is unnecessary to follow Des Cartes into
                    the detail of the theory of vortices. It is more to the purpose to notice the
                    nature of the reasons by which he is driven to regard such a mechanical
                    explanation of the universe as necessary. A real or substantive existence is, in
                    his view, a <hi rend="italic">res</hi><hi rend="italic">completa,</hi> a thing
                    that can be conceived as a whole in itself without relations to any other thing.
                    Now matter and mind are, he thinks, such complete existences, so long as we
                    conceive them, as pure intelligence must conceive them, as abstract opposites of
                    each other; and do not permit ourselves to be confused by those mixed modes of
                    thought which are due to sense or imagination. Des Cartes does not see that in
                    this very abstract opposition there is a bond of union between mind and matter,
                    that they are correlative opposites, and therefore in their separation <hi
                    rend="italic">res</hi><hi rend="italic">incomplètes.</hi> In other words, they
                    are merely elements of reality substantiated by abstract thought into
                    independent realities. He indeed partly retracts his assertion that mind and
                    matter severed from each other are <hi rend="italic">res complete,</hi> when he
                    declares that neither can be conceived as existing apart from God, and that
                    therefore, strictly speaking, God alone is a substance. But as we have seen, he
                    avoids the necessary inference that in God the opposition between mind and
                    matter is reconciled or transcended, by conceiving God as abstract
                    self-consciousness or will, and the material world not as his necessary
                    manifestation, but simply as his creation,—as having its origin in an act of
                    bare volition, and that only. His God is the God of monotheism and not of
                    Christianity, and therefore the world is to God always a foreign matter which he
                    brings into being, and acts on from without, but in which he is not
                    revealed.</p>
                <p>It is a natural consequence of this view that nature is essentially <hi
                    rend="italic">dead matter,</hi> that beyond the motion it has received from God
                    at the beginning, and which it transmits from part to part without increase or
                    diminution, it has no principle of activity in it. Every trace of vitality in it
                    must be explained away as a mere false reflection upon it of the nature of mind.
                    The world is thus “cut in two with a hatchet,” and there is no attraction to
                    overcome the mutual repulsion of its severed parts. Nothing can be admitted in
                    the material half that savours of self-determination, all its energy must-be
                    communicated, not selforiginated; there is no room for gravitation, still less
                    for magnetism or chemical affinity, in this theory. <hi rend="italic">A
                    fortiori,</hi> animal life must be completely explained away. The machine may be
                    very complicated, but it is still, and can be nothing but, a machine. If we once
                    admitted that matter could be anything but mechanical, we should be on the way
                    to admit that matter could become mind. When a modern physical philosopher
                    declares that everything, even life and thought, is ultimately reducible to
                    matter, we cannot always be certain that he means what he seems to say. Not
                    seldom the materialist <hi rend="italic">soi-disaιd</hi> when we hear his
                    account of the properties of matter, turns out to be something like a
                    spiritualist in disguise; but when Des Cartes asserted that everything <hi
                    rend="italic">but</hi> mind is material, and that the animals are automata,
                    there is no such dubiety of interpretation. He said what he meant, and meant
                    what he said, in the hardest sense his words can bear. <hi rend="italic"
                    >His</hi> matter was not even gravitating, much less living; it had no property
                    except that of retaining and transmitting the motion received from without by
                    pressure and impact. And <hi rend="italic">his</hi> animals were automata, not
                    merely in the sense of being governed by sensation and instinct, but precisely
                    in the sense that a watch is an automaton. Henry More cries out against the
                    ruthless consequence with which he develops his principles to this result. “In
                    this,” he says, “I do not so much admire the penetrative power of your genius as
                    I tremble for the fate of the animals. What I recognize in you is notonly
                    subtlety of thought, but a hard and remorseless logic with which you arm
                    yourself as with a sword of steel, to take away life and sensation with one
                    blow, from almost the whole animal kingdom.” But Des Cartes was not the man to
                    be turned from the legitimate result of his principles by a scream. “Nec moror
                    astutias et sagacitates canum et vulpium, nec quaecunque alia propter cibum,
                    venerem, aut metum a brutis fiunt. <hi rend="italic">Profiteor enim me posse

                <p>The difficulty reaches its height ∖vhen Des Cartes attempts to explain the union
                    of the body and spirit in man. Between two substances which, when clearly and
                    distinctly conceived, do not imply each other, there can be none but -an
                    artificial unity,—a unity of composition that still leaves them external to each
                    other. Even God cannot make them one in any higher sense.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Ptìm.,</hi> i.
                    60.</p></note> And as it is impossible in the nature of mind to see any reason
                    why it should be embodied, or in the nature of matter to see any reason why it
                    should become the organ of mind, the union of the two must be taken as a mere
                    empirical fact. When we put on the one side all that belongs to intelligence,
                    and on the other all that belongs to matter, there is a residuum in our ideas
                    which we cannot reduce to either head. This residuum consists of our appetites,
                    our passions, and our sensations, including not only the feelings of pain and
                    pleasure, but also the perceptions of colour, smell, taste, of hardness and
                    softness, and all the other qualities apprehended by touch. These must be
                    referred to the union of mind with body. They are subjective in the sense that
                    they give us no information either as to the nature of things or of mind. Their
                    function is only to indicate what things are useful or hurtful to our composite
                    nature as such, or in other words what things tend to confirm or dissolve the
                    unity of mind and body. They indicate that <hi rend="italic">something</hi> is
                    taking place in our body, or without it, and so stimulate us to some kind of
                    action, but <hi rend="italic">what</hi> it is that is taking place they do not
                    tell us. There is no resemblance in the sensation of pain produced by great heat
                    to the rending of the fibres of our body that causes it. But we do not need to
                    know the real origin of our sensation to prevent us going too near the fire.
                    Sensation leads us into error only when we are not conscious that its office is
                    merely practical, and when we attempt to make objective judgments by means of
                    its obscure and confused ideas, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> when we say that
                    there is heat in our hands or in the fire. And the remedy for this error is to
                    be found simply in the clear conviction of the subjectivity of sensation.</p>
                <p>These views of the nature of sense, however, at once force us to ask how Des
                    Cartes can consistently admit that a subjective result such as sensation, a
                    result in mind, should be produced by matter, and on the other hand how an
                    objective result, a result in matter, should be effected by mind. Des Cartes
                    explains at great length, according to his modification of the physiology of the
                    day, that the pineal gland, which is the immediate organ of the soul, is acted
                    on by the nerves through the “animal spirits,” and again by reaction upon these
                    spirits produces motions in the body. It is an obvious remark that this
                    explanation either materializes mind, or else puts for the solution the very
                    problem to be solved. It was therefore in the spirit of Des Cartes, it was only
                    making explicit what <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0159-0148"/> is involved in many of his expressions when
                    Geulincx, one of his earliest followers, formulated the theory of occasional
                    causes. The general approval of the Cartesian school proved that this was a
                    legitimate development of doctrine. Yet it tore away the last veil from the
                    absolute dualism of the system, which had so far stretched the antagonism of
                    mind and matter that no mediation remained possible, or what is the same thing,
                    remained possible only through an inexplicable will of God. The intrusion of
                    such a <hi rend="italic">Deus ex</hi><hi rend="italic">machina</hi> into
                    philosophy only showed that philosophy by its violent abstraction had destroyed
                    the unity of the known and intelligible world, and was, therefore, forced to
                    seek that unity in the region of the unknown and unintelligible. If our light be
                    darkness, then in our darkness we must seek for light; if reason be
                    contradictory in itself, truth must be found in unreason. The development of the
                    Cartesian school was soon to show what is the necessary and inevitable end of
                    such worship of the unknown.</p>
                <p>To the ethical aspect of his philosophy, Des Cartes, unlike his great disciple,
                    only devoted a subordinate attention. In a short treatise, however, he discussed
                    the relation of reason to the passions. After we have got over the initial
                    difficulty, that matter should give rise to effects in mind, and mind in matter,
                    and have admitted that in man the unity of mind and body turns what in the
                    animals is mere mechanical reception of stimulus from without and reaction upon
                    it into an action and reaction mediated by sensation, emotion, and passion,
                    another question presents itself. How can the mere natural movement of passion,
                    the nature of which is fixed by the original constitution of our body, and of
                    the things that act upon it, be altered or modified by pure reason! For while it
                    is obvious that morality consists in the determination of reason by itself, it
                    is not easy to conceive how the same being who is determined by passion from
                    without should also be determined by reason from within. How, in other words,
                    can a spiritual being maintain its character as self-determined, or at least
                    determined only by the clear and distinct ideas of the reason which are its
                    innate forms, in the presence of this foreign element of passion that seems to
                    make it the slave of external impressions? Is reason able to crush this
                    intruder, or to turn it into a servant î Can the passions be annihilated, or can
                    they be spiritualized î Des Cartes could not properly adopt either alternative;
                    he could not adopt the ethics of asceticism, for the union of body and mind is,
                    in his view, natural; and hence the passions which are the results of that union
                    are in themselves good. They are provisions of nature for the protection of the
                    unity of soul and body, and stimulate us to the acts necessary for that purpose.
                    Yet, on the other hand, he could not admit that these passions are capable of
                    being completely spiritualized; for so long as the unity of body and soul is
                    regarded as merely external and accidental, it is impossible to think that the
                    passions which arise out of this unity can be transformed into the embodiment
                    and expression of reason. Des Cartes, indeed, points out that every passion has
                    a lower and a higher form, and while in its lower or primary form it is based on
                    the obscure ideas produced by the motion of the animal spirits, in its higher
                    form it is connected with the clear and distinct judgments of reason regarding
                    good and evil. If, however, the unity of soul and body be a unity of
                    composition, there is an element of obscurity in the judgments of passion which
                    cannot be made clear, an element in desire that cannot be spiritualized. If the
                    mind be external to the passions it can only impose upon them an external rule
                    of moderation. On such a theory no <hi rend="italic">ideal</hi> morality is
                    possible to man in his present state; for, in order to the attainment of such an
                    ideal morality, it would be necessary that the accidental element obtruded into
                    his life as a spiritual being by his connection with the body should be
                    expelled. What can be attained under present conditions is only to abstract so
                    far as is possible from external things, and those relations to external things
                    into which passion brings us. Hence the great importance which Des Cartes
                    attaches to the distinction between things in our power, and things not in our
                    power. What is not in our power includes all outward things, and therefore it is
                    our highest wisdom to regard them as determined by an absolute fate, or the
                    eternal decree of God. We cease to wish for the impossible; and therefore to
                    subdue our passions we only need to convince ourselves that no effort of ours
                    can enable us to secure their objects. On the other hand that which is within
                    our power, and which therefore we cannot desire too earnestly, is virtue. But
                    virtue in this abstraction from all objects of desire is simply the harmony of
                    reason with itself, the αταραξία of the Stoic under a slight change of aspect.
                    Thus in ethics, as in metaphysics, Des Cartes ends not with a reconciliation of
                    the opposed elements, but with a dualism, or at best, with a unity which is the
                    result of abstraction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Malebranche</hi> was prepared, by the ascetic training of
                    the cloister and the teaching of Augustine, to bring to clear consciousness and
                    expression many of the tendencies that were latent and undeveloped in the
                    philosophy of Des Cartes. To use a chemical metaphor, the Christian Platonism of
                    the church father was a medium in which Cartesianism could precipitate the
                    product of its elements. Yet the medium was, as we shall see, not a perfect one,
                    and hence the product was not quite pure. Without metaphor, Malebranche, by his
                    previous habits of thought, was well fitted to detect and develop the
                    pantheistic and ascetic elements of his master’s philosophy. But he was not well
                    fitted to penetrate through the veil of popular language under which the
                    discordance of that philosophy with orthodox Christianity was hidden. On the
                    contrary, the whole training of the Catholic priest, and especially his
                    practical spirit, with that tendency to compromise which a practical spirit
                    always brings with it, enabled him to conceal from himself as well as from
                    others the logical result of his principles. And we do not wonder even when we
                    find him treating as a “miserable” the philosopher who tore away the veil.</p>
                <p>Malebranche saw “<hi rend="italic">all things in God.”</hi> In other words, he
                    taught that knowledge is possible only in so far as thought is the expression,
                    not of the nature of the individual subject as such, but of a universal life in
                    which he and all other rational beings partake. “No one can feel my individual
                    pain; every one can see the truth which I contemplate—why is it so l The reason
                    is that my pain is a modification of my substance, but truth is the common good
                    of all spirits.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Morale,</hi> i. 1, § 2.</p></note> This idea is ever present to
                    Malebranche, and is repeated by him in an endless variety of forms of
                    expression. Thus, like Des Cartes, but with more decision, he tells us that the
                    idea of the infinite is prior to the idea of the finite. “We conceive of the
                    infinite being by the very fact that we conceive of being without thinking
                    whether it be finite or no. But in order that we may think of a finite being, we
                    must necessarily cut off or deduct something from the genera] notion of being,
                    which consequently we must previously possess. Thus the mind does not apprehend
                    anything whatever, except in and through the idea that it has of the infinite;
                    and so far is it from being the case that this idea is formed by the confused
                    assemblage of all the ideas of particular things as the philosophers maintain,
                    that, on the contrary, all these particular ideas are only participations in the
                    general idea of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0160-0149"/> infinite, just as God does not derive His being
                    from the creatures, but all the creatures are imperfect participations of the
                    divine Being.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Recherche,</hi> iii. pt. ii. ch. 6.</p></note> Again, he tells us,
                    iιf the same chapter, that “when we wish to think of any particular thing, we
                    first cast our view upon all being, and then apply it to the consideration of
                    the object in question. We could not desire to see any particular object unless
                    we saw it already in a confused and general way, and as there is nothing which
                    we cannot desire to see, so all objects must be in a manner present to our
                    spirit.” Or, as he puts it in another place, “our mind would not be capable of
                    representing to itself the general ideas of genera and species if it did not see
                    all things as contained in one; for every creature being an individual we cannot
                    say that we are apprehending any created thing when we think the general idea of
                    a triangle” The main idea that is expressed in all these different ways is
                    simply this, that to determine any individual object as such, we must relate it
                    to, and distinguish it from, the whole of which it is a part; and that,
                    therefore, thought could never apprehend anything if it did not bring with
                    itself the idea of the intelligible world as a unity. Des Cartes had already
                    expressed this truth in 1rs <hi rend="italic">Meditations,</hi> but he had
                    deprived it of its full significance by making a distinction between the being
                    and the idea of God, the former of which, in his view, was only the cause of the
                    latter. Malebranche detects this error, and denies that there is any idea of the
                    infinite, which is a somewhat crude way of saying that there is no division
                    between the idea of the infinite and its reality. What Reid asserted of the
                    external world, that it is not represented by an idea in our minds, but is
                    actually present to them, Malebranche asserted of God. No individual thing, he
                    tells us—and an idea is but an individual thing—could represent the infinite. On
                    the contrary, all individual things are represented through the infinite Being,
                    who contains them all in His substance <hi rend="italic">très efficace,
                    et</hi><hi rend="italic">par</hi><hi rend="italic">conséquence très

                    We know God by himself, material things only by their ideas in God, for they are
                    “unintelligible in themselves, and we can see them only in the being who
                    contains them in an intelligible manner.” And thus, unless we in some way “saw
                    God, we should be able to see nothing else.” The vision <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> God or <hi rend="italic">in</hi> God, therefore, is an “intellectual
                    intuition” in which seer and seen, knower and known, are one. Our knowledge of
                    things is our participation in God’s knowledge of them. When we have gone so far
                    with Malebranche, we are tempted to ask why he does not follow out his thought
                    to its natural conclusion. If the idea of God is not separable from His
                    existence, if it is through the idea of Him that all things are known, and
                    through His existence that all things are, then it would seem necessarily to
                    follow that our consciousness of God is but a part of God’s consciousness of
                    Himself, that our consciousness of self and other things is but God’s
                    consciousness of them, and lastly, that there is no existence either of
                    ourselves or other things except in this consciousness. To understand
                    Malebranche is mainly to understand how he stopped short of results that seemed
                    to lie so directly in the line of his thought.</p>
                <p>To begin with the last point, it is easy to see that Malebranche only asserts
                    unity of idea and reality in God, to deny it everywhere else, which with him is
                    equivalent to asserting it in general and denying it in particular. To him, as
                    to Des Cartes, the opposition between mind and matter is absolute. Material
                    things cannot come into our minds nor can our minds go out of themselves <hi
                    rend="italic">pour se promener</hi><hi rend="italic">dans les cieux.</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">*
                    Ibid.,</hi> ch. 1.</p></note> Hence they are in themselves absolutely unknown;
                    they are known only in God. in whom are their ideas, and as these ideas again
                    are quite distinct from the reality, they “might be presented to the mind
                    without anything existing.” That they exist <hi rend="italic">out of</hi> God in
                    another manner than the intelligible manner of their existence <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi> God, is explained by a mere act of His will, that is, it is not
                    explained at all. Though we see all things in God, therefore, there is no
                    connection between His existence and theirs. The “world is not a necessary
                    emanation of divinity; God is perfectly self-sufficient, and the idea of the
                    infinitely perfect Being can be conceived quite apart from any other. The
                    existence of the creatures is due to the free decrees of God.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Morale,</hi> i. 1, § 5.</p></note> Malebranche, therefore, still treats of
                    external things as “things in themselves,” which have an existence apart from
                    thought, even the divine thought, though it is only in and through the divine
                    thought they can be known by us. “To see the material world, or rather to judge
                    that it exists (since in itself it is invisible), it is necessary that God
                    should reveal it to us, for we cannot see the result of His arbitrary will
                    through necessary reason.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Entretien,</hi> i. § 5.</p></note></p>
                <p>But if we know external things only through their idea in God, how do we know
                    ourselves! Is it also through the idea of us in God! Here we come upon a point
                    in which Malebranche diverges very far from his master. We do not, he says,
                    properly <hi rend="italic">know</hi> ourselves at all, as we know God or even
                    external objects. We are conscious of ourselves by inner sense <hi rend="italic"
                    >(sentiment intérieur),</hi> and from this we know <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
                    we are, but we do not know <hi rend="italic">what</hi> we are. “We know the
                    existence of our soul more distinctly than of our body, but we have not so
                    perfect a knowledge of our soul as of our body.” This is shown by the fact that
                    from our idea of body as extended substance, we can at once see what are its
                    possible modifications. In other words, we only need the idea of extended
                    substance to see that there is an inexhaustible number of figures and motions of
                    which it is capable. The whole of geometry is but a development of what is given
                    already in the conception of extension. But it is not so with our consciousness
                    of self, which does not enable us to say prior to actual experience what
                    sensations or passions are possible to us. We only know what heat, cold, light,
                    colour, hunger, anger, and desire are by feeling them. Our knowledge extends as
                    far as our experience and no further. Nay, we have good reason to believe that
                    many of these modifications exist in our soul only by reason of its accidental
                    association with a body, and that if it were freed from that body it would be
                    capable of far other and higher experiences. “We know by feeling that our soul
                    is great, but perhaps we know almost nothing of what it is in itself.” The
                    informations of sense have, as Des Cartes taught, only a practical but no
                    theoretical value; they tell us nothing of the external world, the real nature
                    of which we know not through touch and taste and sight, but only through our
                    idea of extended substances; while of the nature of the soul they do not tell us
                    much more than that it exists and that it is not material. And in this latter ,
                    case we have no idea, nothing better than sense to raise us above its illusions.
                    It is clear from these statements that by self-consciousness Malebranche means
                    consciousness of desires and feelings, which belong to the individual as such,
                    and not consciousness of self as thinking. He begins, in fact, where Des Cartes
                    ended, and identifies the consciousness of self as thinking, and so transcending
                    the limits of its own particular being, with the consciousness or idea of God.
                    And between the consciousness of the finite in sense, and the consciousness of
                    the infinite in thought, or in other words, between the consciousness of the
                    universal and the consciousness of the individual, he sees no connection.
                    Malebranche is just one step from the pantheistic conclusion that the
                    consciousness <pb break="no"

                    that as all bodies are but modes of one infinite extension, so all souls are but
                    modes of one infinite thought. But while he willingly accepts this result in
                    regard to matter, his religious feelings prevent him from accepting it in
                    relation to mind. He is driven, therefore, to the inconsistency of holding that
                    sense and feeling, through which in his view we apprehend the finite as such,
                    give us true though imperfecl knowledge of the soul, while the knowledge they
                    give us of body is not only imperfect but false.<note anchored="true"

                    substance, distinct from the infinite, though it holds its substantial existence
                    on a precarious tenure. It is left hanging, we may say, on the verge of the
                    infinite, whose attraction must soon prove too strong for it. Ideas are living
                    things, and often remould the minds that admit them in spite of the greatest
                    resistance of dead custom and traditionary belief In the grasp of a logic that
                    overpowers him the more easily that he is unconscious of its tendency,
                    Malebranche is brought within one step of the pantheistic conclusion, and all
                    his Christian feeling and priestly training can do, is <hi rend="italic"
                    >just</hi> to save him from denial of the personality of man.</p>
                <p>But even this denial is not the last word of pantheism. When the principle that
                    the finite is known only in relation to the infinite, the individual only in
                    relation to the universal, is interpreted as meaning that the infinite and
                    universal is complete in itself without the finite and individual, when the
                    finite and individual is treated as a mere accidental existence due to the
                    “arbitrary will of God,” it ceases to be possible to conceive even God as a
                    spirit. Did Malebranche realize what he was saying when he declared that God was
                    “being in general,” but not any particular being 1 At any rate we can see that
                    the same logic that leads him almost to deny the reality of finite beings, leads
                    him also to seek the divine nature in something more abstract and general even
                    than thought If we must abstract from all relation to the finite in order to
                    know God as he is, is it not necessary for us also to abstract from
                    self-consciousness, for self-consciousness has a negative element in it that is
                    something definite and therefore limited? We do not wonder, therefore, when we
                    find Malebranche saying that reason does not tell us that God is a spirit, but
                    only that He is an infinitely perfect being, and that he must be conceived
                    rather as a spirit than as a body simply because spirit is more perfect than
                    body. “When we call God a spirit, it is not so much to show positively what he
                    is, as to signify that he is not material.” But as we ought not to give him a
                    bodily form like man’s, so we ought not to think of his spirit as similar to our
                    own spirits, although we can conceive nothing more perfect. “It is necessary
                    rather to believe that as he contains in himself the properties of matter
                    without being material, so he comprehends in himself the perfections of created
                    spirits without being a spirit as we alone can conceive spirits, and that his
                    true name is “He who is,” <hi rend="italic">i,e.,</hi> Being without
                    restriction, Being infinite and universal.’’<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    essentially self-revealing God of Christianity gives way to pure spirit, and
                    pure spirit in its turn to the eternal and incomprehensible substance of which
                    we can say nothing but that it is. The divine substance contains irfTt, indeed,
                    everything that is in creation, but it contains them <hi rend="italic"
                    >eminenter</hi> in some incomprehensible form that is reconcilable with its
                    infinitude^ But we have no adequate name by which to call it except Being. The
                    curious metaphysic of theology by which, in his later writings, Malebranche
                    tried to make room for the incarnation by supposing that the finite creation,
                    which <hi rend="italic">as</hi> finite is unworthy of God, was made worthy by
                    union with Christ, the divine Word, shows that</p>
                <p>Malebranche had some indistinct sense of the necessity of reconciling his
                    philosophy with his theology; but it shows also the necessarily artificial
                    nature of the combination. The result of the union of such incongruous elements
                    was something which the theologians at once recognized as heterodox and the
                    philosophers as illogical.</p>
                <p>There was another doctrine of Malebranche which brought him into trouble with the
                    theologians, and which was the main subject of his long controversy with
                    Arnauld. This was his denial of particular providence. As Leibnitz maintained
                    that this is the best of all possible worlds, and that its evils are to be
                    explained by the negative nature of the finite, so Malebranche,with a slight
                    change of expression, derived evil from the nature of particular or individual
                    existence. It is not conformable to the nature of God to act by any but
                    universal laws, and these universal laws necessarily involve particular evil
                    consequences, though their ultimate result is the highest possible good. The
                    question why there should be any particular existence, any existence but God,
                    seeing such existence necessarily involves evil, remains insoluble so long as
                    the purely pantheistic view of God is maintained; and it is this view which is
                    really at the bottom of the assertion that he can have no particular volitions.
                    To the coarse and anthropomorphic conception of particular providence
                    Malebranche may be right in objecting, but on the other hand, it cannot be
                    doubted that any theory in which the universal is absolutely opposed to the
                    particular, the infinite to the finite, is unchristian as well as
                    unphilosophical. For under this dualistic presupposition, there seem to be only
                    two possible alternatives open to thought; either the particular and finite must
                    be treated as something independent of the universal and infinite, which
                    involves an obvious contradiction, or else it must be regarded as absolute
                    nonentity. We find Malebranche doing the one or the other as occasion requires.
                    Thus he· vindicates the freedom of man’s will on the ground that the universal
                    will of God does not completely determine the particular volitions of man; and
                    then becoming conscious of the difficulty involved in this conception, he tries,
                    like Des Cartes, to explain the particular will as something merely negative, a
                    defect, and not a positive existence.</p>
                <p>But to understand fully Malebranche’s view of freedom and the ethical system
                    connected with it, we must notice an important alteration which he makes in the
                    Cartesian theory of the relation of will and intelligence. To Des Cartes, as we
                    have seen, the ultimate essence of mind lay in pure abstract self-determination
                    or will, and hence he based even moral and intellectual truth on the arbitrary
                    decrees of God. With Malebranche, on the other hand, abstraction goes a step
                    further; and the absolute is sought not in the subject as opposed to the object,
                    not in pure formal self-determination as opposed to that which is determined,
                    but in a unity that transcends this difference. With him, therefore, will ceases
                    to be regarded as the essence of intelligence, and sinks into a property or
                    separable attribute of it. As we can conceive an extended substance without
                    actual movement, so, he says, we can conceive a thinking substance without
                    actual volition. But “matter or extension without motion would be entirely
                    useless and incapable of that variety of forms for which it is made; and we
                    cannot, therefore, suppose, that an all-wise Being would create it in this way.
                    In like manner, if a spiritual or thinking substance were without will, it is
                    clear that it would be quite useless, for it would not be attracted towards the
                    objects of its perception, and would not love the good for which it is made. We
                    cannot therefore conceive an intelligent being so to fashion it.”<note

                    create them for himself. “God cannot will that there should exist a spirit that

                    alike love God with this love.” Out of this love of God arises the love we have
                    to ourselves and to others, which are the <hi rend="italic">natural
                    inclinations</hi> that belong to all created spirits. For these inclinations are
                    but the elements of the love which is in God, and which therefore he inspires in

                    theological vesture, what is expressed here is simply that as a spiritual being
                    each man is conscious of his own limited and individual existence, as well as of
                    the limited and individual existence of other beings like himself, only in
                    relation to the whole in which they are parts, so he can find his own good only
                    in the good of the whole, and he is in contradiction with himself so long as he
                    rests in any good short of that. His love of happiness, his natural inclinations
                    both selfish and social, may be therefore regarded as an undeveloped form of the
                    love of God; and the ideal state of his inclinations is that in which the love
                    of self and of others are explicitly referred to that higher affection; or in
                    which his love does not proceed from a part to the whole, but from the whole to
                    the parts.</p>
                <p>The question of morals to Malebranche is the question how these <hi rend="italic"
                    >natural inclinations</hi> are related to the particular passions. Sensation and
                    passion arise out of the connection of body and soul, and their use is only to
                    urge us to attend to the wants of the former. We can scarcely hear without a
                    smile the simple monastic legend which Malebranche weaves together about the
                    original nature of the passions and their alteration by the Falk “It is visibly
                    a disorder that a spirit capable of knowing and loving God should be obliged to
                    occupy itself with the needs of the body.” “A being altogether occupied with
                    whai passes in his body and with the infinity of objects that surround it,
                    cannot be thinking on the things that are truly good.”<note anchored="true"

                    iv.</p></note> Hence the necessity of an immediate and instinctive warning from
                    the senses in regard to the relations of things to our organism, and also j&gt;f
                    pains and pleasures which may induce us to attend to this warning. “Sensible
                    pleasure is the mark that nature has attached to the use of certain things in
                    order that without having the trouble of examining them by reason, we may employ
                    them for the preservation of the body, but not in order that we may love
                    them.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Recherche,</hi> bk. v. ch. 4.</p></note> Till the Fall the mind was merely
                    united to the body, not subjected to it, and the influence of these pleasures
                    and pains was only such as to make men attend to their bodily wants, but not to
                    occupy the mind, or fill it with sensuous joys and sorrows, or trouble its
                    contemplation of that which is really good. Our moral aim should therefore be to
                    restore this state of things, to weaken our union with the body and strengthen
                    our union with God. And to encourage us in pursuing this aim we have to remember
                    that union with God is natural to the spirit, and that, while even the condition
                    of union with the body is artificial, the condition of subjection to the body is
                    wholly unnatural to it. Our primary tendency is towards the supreme good, and we
                    only love the objects of our passions in so far as we “determine towards
                    particular, and therefore false goods, the love that God gives us for himself.”
                    The search for happiness is really the search for God in disguise, and even the
                    levity and inconstancy with which men rush from one finite good to another, is a
                    proof that they were made for the infinite. Furthermore, this natural love of
                    God, or inclination for good in general, “gives us the power of suspending our
                    consent in regard to those particular goods which do not satisfy it.”<note

                    and confused voice of instinctive feeling, which arises from and always tends to
                    confirm our union with the body, and wait for the light of reason which arises
                    from and always tends to confirm our union with God, we have done all that is in
                    our power, the rest is God’s work. “If we only judge precisely of that which we
                    see clearly, we shall never be deceived. For then it will not be we that judge,
                    but the universal reason that judges in us.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    And as our love, even of particular goods, is a confused love of the supreme
                    good, so the clear vision of God inevitably brings with it the love of Him. “We
                    needs must love the highest when we see it.” When it is the divine reason that
                    speaks in us it is the divine love that moves us, “the same love wherewith God
                    loves himself and the things he has made.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The general result of the ethics of Malebranche is ascetic. The passions like the
                    senses have no relation to the higher life of the soul; their value is only in
                    relation to the union of soul and body, a union which is purely accidental or
                    due to the arbitrary will of God. As Pericles said of women that the less they
                    were heard of in public for good or evil the better, so Maîebranche would say of
                    the sensations and passions, that the more silently they discharge their
                    provisional function, and the less they disturb or interfere with the pure
                    activity of spirit, the more nearly they approach to the only perfection that is
                    possible for them. Their ideal state is to remain or become again simple
                    instincts that act mechanically like the circulation of the blood. Universal
                    light of reason casts no ray into the obscurity of sense; its universal love
                    cannot embrace any of the objects of particular passion. It is indeed recognized
                    by Malebranche that sensation in man is mixed with thought, that the passions in
                    him are forms of the love of good in general. But this union of the rational
                    with the sensuous nature is regarded merely as a confusion which is to be
                    cleared up, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in a higher unity of the two elements,
                    but simply by the withdrawal of the spirit from contact with that which darkens
                    and defiles it. Of a transformation of sense into thought, of passion into
                    duty,— an elevation of the life of sense till it becomes the embodiment and
                    expression of the life of reason,—Malebranche has no conception. Hence the life
                    of reason turns with him to mysticism in theory and to asceticism in practice.
                    His universal is abstract and opposed to the particular; instead of explaining
                    it, it explains it away. A certain tender beauty as of twilight is spread over
                    the world as we view it through the eyes of this cloistered philosopher, and we
                    do not at first see that the softness and ideality of the picture is due to the
                    gathering darkness. Abstraction seems only to be purifying, and not destroying,
                    till it has done its perfect work. Malebranche conceived himself to be
                    presenting to the world only the purest and most refined expression of Christian
                    ethics and theology. But if we obey his own continual advice to think clearly
                    and distinctly, if we divest his system of all the sensuous and imaginative
                    forms in which he has clothed it, and reduce it to the naked simplicity of its
                    central thought, what we find is not a God that reveals Himself in the finite
                    and to the finite, but the absolute substance which has no revelation, and whose
                    existence is the negation of all but itself. Thus to tear away the veil,
                    however, there was needed a stronger, simpler, <pb break="no"

                    opinion, less inclined to practical compromise, and gifted with a stronger
                    “faith in the whispers of the lonely muse” of speculation than Malebranche.</p>
                <p>It is a remark of Hegel’s that <hi rend="smallcaps">Spinoza,</hi> as a Jew, first
                    brought into European thought the idea of an absolute unity in which the
                    difference of finite and infinite is lost. Some later writers have gone further,
                    and attempted to show that the main doctrines by which his philosophy is
                    distinguished from that of Des Cartes were due to the direct influences of
                    Jewish writers like Maimonides, Gersonides, and Chasdai Creskas, rather than to
                    the necessary development of Cartesian ideas. And it is undoubtedly true that
                    many points of similarity with such writers, reaching down even to verbal
                    coincidence, may be detected in the works of Spinoza, although it is not so easy
                    to determine how much he owed to their teaching. His own view of his obligations
                    is sufficiently indicated by the fact, that while in his ethics he carries on a
                    continual polemic against Des Cartes, and strives at every point to show that
                    his own doctrines are legitimately derived from Cartesian principles, he only
                    once refers to Jewish philosophy as containing an obscure and unreasoned
                    anticipation of these doctrines.” <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    be that the undeveloped pantheism and rationalism of the Jewish philosophers had
                    a deeper influence than he himself was aware of, in emancipating him from the
                    traditions of the synagogue, and giving to his mind its first philosophical
                    bias. In his earlier work there are Neo-Platonic ideas and expressions which in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi> are rejected or remoulded into a form more
                    suitable to the spirit of Cartesianism. But the question, after all, has little
                    more than a biographical interest. In the Spinozistic philosophy there are few
                    différences from Des Cartes which cannot be traced to the necessary development
                    of Cartesian principles; and the comparison of Malebranche shows that the
                    development might take place under the most diverse intellectual conditions.
                    What is most remarkable in Spinoza is just the freedom and security with which
                    these principles are followed out to their last result. His Jewish origin and
                    his breach with Judaism completely isolated him from every influence but that of
                    the thought that possesses him. And no scruple or hesitation, no respect for the
                    institutions or feelings of his time interferes with his speculative
                    consequence. He exhibits to us the almost perfect type of a mind without
                    superstitions, which has freed itself from all but reasoned and intelligent
                    convictions, or, in the Cartesian phrase, “clear and distinct ideas;” and when
                    he fails, it is not by any inconsistency, or arbitrary stopping short of the
                    necessary conclusions of his logic, but by the essential defect of his
                    principles.</p>
                <p>Spinoza takes his idea of method from mathematics, and after the manner of
                    Euclid, places at the head of each book of his <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi> a
                    certain number of definitions, axioms, and postulates which are supposed to be
                    intuitively certain, and to form a sufficient basis for all that follows.
                    Altogether there are twenty-seven definitions, twenty axioms, and eight
                    postulates. If Spinoza is regarded as the most consequent of philosophers it
                    cannot be because he has based his system upon so many fragmentary views of
                    truth; it must be because a deeper unity has been discerned in the system than
                    is visible on the first aspect of it. We must, therefore, to a certain extent
                    distinguish between the form and the matter of his thought, though it is also
                    true that the defective form itself involves a defect in the matter.</p>
                <p>What in the first instance recommends the geometrical method to Spinoza is, not
                    only its apparent exactness and the necessity of its sequence, but, so to speak,
                    its disinterestedness. Confusion of thought arises from the fact that we put
                    ourselves, our desires and feelings and interests, into our view of things; that
                    we do not regard them as they are in themselves, in their essential nature, but
                    look for some final cause, that is some relation to ourselves by which they may
                    be explained. For this reason, he says, “the truth might for ever have remained
                    hid from the human race, if mathematics, which looks not to the final cause of
                    figures, but to their essential nature and the properties involved in it, had
                    not set another type of knowledge before them.” To understand things is to see
                    how all that is true of them flows from the clear and distinct idea expressed in
                    their definition, and ultimately, it is to see how all truth flows from the <hi
                    rend="italic">essentia Dei</hi> as all geometrical truth flows from the idea of
                    quantity. To take a mathematical view of the universe, therefore, is to raise
                    ourselves above all consideration of the end or tendency of things, above the
                    fears and hopes of mortality into the region of truth and necessity. “When I
                    turned my mind to this subject,” he says in the beginning of his treatise on
                    politics, “I did not propose to myself any novel or strange aim, but simply to
                    demonstrate by certain and indubitable reason those things which agree best with
                    practice. And in order that I might inquire into the matters of this science
                    with the same freedom of mind with which we are wont to treat lines and surfaces
                    in mathematics, I determined not to laugh or to weep over the actions of men,
                    but simply to understand them; and to contemplate their affections and passions,
                    such as love, hate, anger, envy, arrogance, pity, and all other disturbances of
                    soul not as vices of human nature, but as properties pertaining to it in the
                    same way as heat, cold, storm, thunder pertain to the nature of the atmosphere.
                    For these, though troublesome, are yet necessary, and have certain causes
                    through which we may come to understand them, and thus, by contemplating them in
                    their truth, gain for our minds as much joy as by the knowledge of things that
                    are pleasing to the senses.” All our errors as to the nature of things arise
                    from our judging them from the point of view of the part and not of the whole,
                    from a point of view determined by their relation to our own individual being,
                    and not from a point of view determined by the nature of the things themselves;
                    or, to put the same thing in another way, from the point of view of sense and
                    imagination, and not from the point of view of intelligence. Mathematics shows
                    us the inadequacy of such knowledge when it takes us out of ourselves into
                    things, and when it presents these things to us as objects of universal
                    intelligence apart from all special relation to our individual feelings. And
                    Spinoza only wishes that the same universality and freedom of thought which
                    belongs to mathematics, because its objects <hi rend="italic">do not</hi>
                    interest the passions, should be extended to those objects that <hi
                    rend="italic">do</hi> interest them. Purity from interest is the first condition
                    of the philosopher’s being; he must get beyond the illusion of sense and passion
                    that makes our own lives so supremely important and interesting to us simply
                    because they are our own. He must look at the present as it were through an
                    inverted telescope of reason, that will reduce it to its due proportion and
                    place in the sum of things. To the heat of passion and the higher heat of
                    imagination, Spinoza has only one advice,—“Acquaint yourself with God and be at
                    peace.” Look not to the particular but to the universal, view things not under
                    the form of the finite and temporal, but <hi rend="italic">sub quadam specie
                    oeternitatis.</hi></p>
                <p>The illusion of the finite,—the illusion of sense, imagination, and passion,
                    which, in Bacon’s language, tends to make men judge of things <hi rend="italic"

                    raises the individual life, and even the present moment of the individual life,
                    with its passing feelings, into the standard for measuring the universe,— this,
                    in the eyes of Spinoza, is the source of all error and evil to man. On the other
                    hand, his highest good is to live the universal life of reason, or what is the
                    same thing, to view all things from their centre in God, and to be moved only by
                    the passion for good in general, “the intellectual love of God.” In the treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Emendatione Intellectus,</hi> Spinoza
                    takes up this contrast in the first instance from its moral side. “All our
                    felicity or infelicity is founded on the nature of the object to which we are
                    joined by love.” To love the things that perish is to be in continual trouble
                    and disturbance of passion; it is to be full of envy and hatred towards others
                    who possess them; it is to be ever striving after that which, when we attain it,
                    does not satisfy us; or lamenting over the loss of that which inevitably passes
                    away from us; only “love to an object that is infinite and eternal feeds the
                    soul with a changeless and unmingled joy.” But again our love rests upon our
                    knowledge; if we saw things as they really are we should love only the highest
                    object. It is because sense and imagination give to the finite an independence
                    and substantiality that do not belong to it, that we waste our love upon it as
                    if it were infinite. And as the first step towards truth is to understand our
                    error, so Spinoza proceeds to explain the defects of common sense, or in other
                    words, of that first and unreflected view of the world, which he, like Plato,
                    calls opinion. Opinion is a kind of knowledge derived partly from hearsay, and
                    partly from <hi rend="italic">experientia</hi><hi rend="italic">vaga.</hi> It
                    consists of vague and general conceptions of things, got either from the report
                    of others or from an experience which has not received any special direction
                    from intelligence. The mind that has not got beyond the stage of opinion takes
                    things as they present themselves in its individual experience; and its beliefs
                    grow up by association of whatever happens to have been found together in that
                    experience. And as the combining principle of the elements of opinion is
                    individual and not universal, so its conception of the world is at once
                    fragmentary and accidental. It does not see things in their connection with the
                    unity of the whole, and hence it cannot see them in their true relation to each
                    other. “I assert expressly,” says Spinoza, “that the mind has no adequate
                    conception either of itself or of external things, but only a confused knowledge
                    of them, so long as it perceives them only in the common order of nature, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> so long as it is <hi rend="italic">externally
                    determined</hi> to contemplate this or that object by the accidental concourse
                    of things, and so long as it is not <hi rend="italic">internally</hi> determined
                    by the unity of thought in which it considers a number of things to understand
                    their agreements, differences, and contradictions.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Elh..</hi> L schol.
                    29.</p></note></p>
                <p>There are two kinds of errors which are usually supposed to exclude each other,
                    but which Spinoza finds to be united in opinion. These are the errors of
                    abstraction and imagination; the former explains its vice by defect, the latter
                    its vice by excess. On the one hand, opinion is abstract and one-sided; it is
                    defective in knowledge and takes hold of things only at one point. On the other
                    hand, and just because of this abstractness and one-sidedness, it is forced to
                    give an artificial completeness and independence to that which is essentially
                    fragmentary and dependent. The word abstract is misleading, in so far as we are
                    wont to associate wdth abstraction the idea of a mental effort by which parts
                    are separated from a given whole; but it may be applied without violence to any
                    imperfect conception, iu which things that are really elements of a greater
                    whole are treated as if they were <hi rend="italic">res</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >comj)letce,</hi> independent objects, complete in themselves. And in this sense
                    the ordinary consciousness of man is often the victim of abstractions when it
                    supposes itself most of all to be dealing with realities. The essences and
                    substances of the schoolman may delude him, but he cannot think these notions
                    clearly without seeing that they are only abstract elements of reality, and that
                    they have a meaning only in relation to the other elements of it. But common
                    sense remains unconscious of its abstractness because imagination gives a kind
                    of substantiality to the fragmentary and limited, and so makes if possible to
                    conceive it as an independent reality. Pure intelligence seeing the part as it
                    is in itself could never see it but as a part. Thought, when it rises to
                    clearness and distinctness in regard to any finite object, must at once discern
                    its relation to other finite objects and to the whole,—must discern, in
                    Spinozistic language, that it is “modal” and not “real.” But though it is not
                    possible to <hi rend="italic">think</hi> the part as a whole it is possible to
                    picture it as a whole. The limited image that fills the mind’s eye seems to need
                    nothing else for its reality. We cannot think a house clearly and distinctly in
                    all the connection of its parts with each other, without seeing its necessary
                    relation to the earth on which it stands, to the pressure of the atmosphere,
                    &lt;fcc. The very circumstances by which the possibility of such an existence is
                    explained make it impossible to conceive it apart from other things. But nothing
                    hinders me to rest on a house as a complete picture by itself. Imagination
                    represents things in the externality of space and time, and is subjected to no
                    other conditions but those of space and time. Hence it can begin anywhere, and
                    stop anywhere. For the same cause it can mingle and confuse together all manner
                    of inconsistent forms—can imagine a man with a horse’s head, a candle blazing in
                    vacuo, a speaking tree, a man changed into an animal. There may be elements in
                    the nature of these things that would prevent such combinations; but these
                    elements are not necessarily present to the ordinary consciousness, the
                    abstractness of whose conceptions leaves it absolutely at the mercy of
                    imagination or accidental association. To thought in this stage anything is
                    possible that can be pictured. On the other hand, as knowledge advances, this
                    freedom of combination becomes limited, “the less the mind understands and the
                    more it perceives, the greater is its power of fiction, and the more it
                    understands, the narrower is the limitation of that power. For just as in the
                    moment of consciousness we cannot imagine that we do not think, so after we have
                    apprehended the nature of body, we cannot conceive of a fly of infinite size,
                    and after we know the nature of a soul we cannot think of it as a square, though
                    we may use the words that express these ideas.”<note anchored="true"

                    knowledge widens, until to perfected knowledge possibility is lost in
                    necessity.</p>
                <p>From these considerations, it follows that all thought is imperfect that stops
                    short of the absolute unity of all things. Our first imperfect notion of things
                    as isolated from each other, or connected only by co-existence and succession,
                    is a mere imagination of things. It is a fictitious substantiation of isolated
                    moments in the eternal Being. Knowledge, so far as it deals with the finite, is
                    engaged in a continual process of self-correction which can never be completed,
                    for at every step there is an element of falsity, in so far as the mind rests in
                    the contemplation of a certain number of the elements of the world, as if they
                    constituted a complete whole by themselves, whereas they are only a part, the
                    conception of which has to be modified at the next step of considering its
                    relation to the other parts. Thus we rise from individuals of the first to
                    individuals of <pb break="no"

                    idea of “all nature as one individual whose parts vary through an infinite
                    number of modes, without change of the whole individual.”<note anchored="true"

                    schol.</p></note> At first we think of pieces of matter as independent
                    individuals, either because we can picture them separately, or because they
                    preserve a certain proportion or relation of parts through their changes. But on
                    further consideration, these apparent substances sink into modes, each of which
                    is dependent on all the others. All nature is bound together by necessary law,
                    and not an atom could be other than it is without the change of the whole world.
                    Hence it is only in the whole world that there is any true individuality or
                    substance. And the same principle applies to the minds of men. Their
                    individuality is a mere semblance caused by our abstraction from their
                    conditions. Isolate the individual man, and he will not display the character of
                    a thinking being at all. His whole spiritual fife is bound up with his relations
                    to other minds, past and present. He has such a life, only in and through that
                    universal life of which he is so infinitesimal a part that his own contribution
                    to it is as good as nothing. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Vis qua

                    a false abstraction, above which he must rise ere he can know himself as he
                    really is.</p>
                <p>“Let us imagine,” says Spinoza in his fifteenth letter, “a little worm living in
                    blood which has vision enough to discern the particles of blood, lymph,
                    &lt;fcc., and reason enough to observe how one particle is repelled by another
                    with which it comes into contact, or communicates a part of its motion to it.
                    Such a worm would live in the blood as we do in this part of the universe, and
                    would regard each particle of it, not as a part, but as a whole, nor could it
                    know how all the parts are influenced by the universal nature of the blood, and
                    are obliged to accommodate themselves to each other as is required by that
                    nature, so that they co-operate together according to a fixed law. For if we
                    suppose that there are no causes outside of the blood which could communicate
                    new motions to it, and no space beyond the blood, nor any other bodies to which
                    its particles could transfer their motion, it is certain that the blood as a
                    whole would always maintain its present state, and its particles would suffer no
                    other variations than those which may be inferred from the given relation of the
                    motion of blood to lymph, chyle, &lt;fcc. And thus in that case the blood would
                    require to be considered always as a whole and not as a part. But since there
                    are many other causes which influence the laws of the nature of blood, and are
                    in turn influenced thereby, other motions and other variations must arise in the
                    blood which are not due to the proportion of motion in its constituents but also
                    to the relation between that motion and external causes. And therefore we cannot
                    consider the blood as a whole, but only as a part of a greater whole.”</p>
                <p>“Now we can think, and indeed ought to think, of all natural bodies in the same
                    manner in which we have thought of this blood, for all bodies the surrounded by
                    other bodies, and reciprocally determine and are determined by them, to exist
                    and operate in a fixed and definite way, so as to preserve the same ratio of
                    motion and rest in the whole universe. Hence it follows that every body, in so
                    far as it exists under a certain definite modification, ought to be considered
                    as merely a part of the whole universe, which agrees with its whole, and thereby
                    is in intimate union with all the other parts; and since the nature of the
                    universe is not limited like that of the blood, but absolutely infinite, it is
                    clear that by this nature with its infinite powers, the parts are modified in an
                    infinite number of ways, and compelled to pass through an infinity of
                    variations. Moreover, when I think of the universe as a substance, I conceive of
                    a still closer union of each part with the whole; for, as I have elsewhere
                    shown, it is the nature of substance to be infinite, and therefore every single
                    part belongs to the nature of the corporeal substance, so that apart therefrom
                    it neither can exist nor be conceived. And as to the human mind, I think of it
                    also as of part of nature, for I think of nature as having in it an infinite
                    power of thinking, which, as infinite, contains in itself the idea of all
                    nature, and whose thoughts run parallel with all existence.”</p>
                <p>From this point of view it is obvious that our knowledge of things cannot be real
                    and adequate, except in so far as it is determined by the idea of the whole, and
                    proceeds from the whole to the parts. A knowledge that proceeds from part to
                    part must always be imperfect; it must remain external to its object, it must
                    deal in abstractions or mere <hi rend="italic">entia rationis,</hi> which it may
                    easily be led to mistake for realities. Hence Spinoza, like Plato, distinguishes
                    reason whose movement is regressive (from effect to cause, from variety to
                    unity) from <hi rend="italic">scientia</hi><hi rend="italic">intuitiva,</hi>
                    whose movement is progressive, which “proceeds from the 'adequate idea of
                    certain of God’s attributes to an adequate knowledge of the nature of
                    things.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    alone deserves to be called science in the highest sense of the term. For in
                    order that our mind may correspond to the exemplar of nature, it must develop
                    all its ideas from the idea that represents the origin and source of nature, so
                    that that idea may appear as the source of all other ideas.” <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi> The regressive mode of knowledge has its highest
                    value in preparing for the progressive. The knowledge of the finite, ere it can
                    become perfectly adequate, must be absorbed and lost in the knowledge of the
                    infinite. In a remarkable passage in the <hi rend="italic">Ethics,</hi> Spinoza
                    declares that the defect of the common consciousness of men lies not so much in
                    their ignorance, either of the infinite or of the finite, as in their incapacity
                    for bringing the two thoughts together, so as to put the latter in its proper
                    relation to the former. All are ready to confess that God is the cause both of
                    the existence and of the nature of things created, but they do not realize what
                    is involved in this confession—and hence they treat created things as if they
                    were substances, that is, as if they were Gods. “Thus while they are
                    contemplating finite things, they think of nothing less than of the divine
                    nature; and again when they turn to consider the divine nature, they think of
                    nothing less than of their former fictions on which they have built up the
                    knowledge of finite things, as if these things could contribute nothing to our
                    understanding of the divine nature. Hence it is not wonderful that they are
                    always contradicting themselves.” <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> As Spinoza says
                    elsewhere, it belongs to the very nature of the human mind to know God, for
                    unless we know God, we could know nothing else. The idea of the absolute unity
                    is involved in the idea of every particular thing, yet the generality of men,
                    deluded by sense and imagination, are unable to bring this implication into
                    clear consciousness, and hence their knowledge of God does not modify their view
                    of the finite. It is the business of philosophy to correct this defect, to
                    transform our conceptions of the finite by relating it to the infinite, to
                    complement and complete the partial knowledge <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n166/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0166-0155"/> produced by individual experience by bringing it
                    into connection with the idea of the whole. And the vital question which Spinoza
                    himself prompts us to ask is how far and in what way this transformation is
                    effected in the Spinozistic philosophy.</p>
                <p>There are two great steps in the transformation of knowledge by the idea of unity
                    as that idea is conceived by Spinoza. The first step involves a change of the
                    conception of individual finite things by which they lose their individuality,
                    their character as independent substances, and come to be regarded as modes of
                    the infinite. But secondly, this negation of the finite as such is not conceived
                    as implying the negation of the distinction between mind and matter. Mind and
                    matter still retain that absolute opposition which they had in the philosophy of
                    Des Cartes, even after all limits have been removed. And therefore in order to
                    reach the absolute unity, and transcend the Cartesian dualism, a second step is
                    necessary, by which the independent substantiality of mind and matter is
                    withdrawn, and they are reduced into attributes of the one infinite substance.
                    Let us examine these steps successively.</p>
                <p>The method by which the finite is reduced into a mode of the infinite has already
                    been partially explained. Spinoza follows to its legitimate result the
                    metaphysical or logical principles of Des Cartes and Malebranche. According to
                    the former, as we have seen, the finite presupposes the infinite, and, indeed,
                    so far as it is real, it is identical with the infinite. The infinite is
                    absolute reality, because it is pure affirmation, because it is that which <hi
                    rend="italic">negationem nullam involvit.</hi> The finite is distinguished from
                    it simply by its limit, ⅛.e., by its wanting something which the infinite has.
                    At this point Spinoza takes up the argument. If the infinite be the real, and
                    the finite, so far as it is distinguished therefrom, the unreal, then the
                    supposed substantiality or individuality of finite beings is an illusion. In
                    itself the finite is but an abstraction, to which imagination has given an
                    apparent independence. All limitation or determination is negative, and in order
                    to apprehend positive reality, we must abstract from limits. By denying the
                    negative, we reach the affirmative; by annihilating finitude in our thought, and
                    so undoing the illusory work of the imagination, we reach the indeterminate or
                    unconditioned being which alone truly is. All division, distinction, and
                    relation are but <hi rend="italic">entia rationis.</hi> Imagination and
                    abstraction can give to them, as they can give to mere negation and nothingness,
                    “a local habitation and a name,” but they have no objective meaning, and in the
                    highest knowledge, in the <hi rend="italic">scientia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >intuitiva,</hi> which deals only with reality, they must entirely disappear.
                    Hence to reach the truth as to matter, we must free ourselves from all such
                    ideas as figure or number, measure or time, which imply the separation and
                    relation of parts. Thus in his 50th letter, in answer to some question about
                    figure, Spinoza says, “to prove that figure is negation, and not anything
                    positive, we need only consider that the whole of matter conceived indefinitely,
                    or in its infinity, can have no figure; but that figure has a place only in
                    finite or determinate bodies. He who says that he perceives figure, says only
                    that he has before his mind a limited thing and the manner in which it is
                    limited. But this limitation does not pertain to a thing in its <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> esse,’ but contrariwise in its ‘ non-esse, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(z.λ,</hi> it signifies, not that
                    some positive quality belongs to the thing, but that something is wanting to
                    it). Since, then, figure is but limitation, and limitation is but negation, we
                    cannot say that figure is anything.” The same kind of reasoning is elsewhere <hi
                    rend="italic">(Epist.</hi> 29) applied to solve the difficulties connected with
                    the divisibility of space or extension. Really, according to Spinoza, extension
                    is indivisible, though modally it is divisible. In other words, parts <hi
                    rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi> may be taken in space by the abstracting mind,
                    but these parts have no separate existence. You cannot rend space, or take one
                    part of it out of its connection with other parts. Hence arises the
                    impossibility of asserting either that there is an infinite number of parts •in
                    space, or that there is not. The solution of the antinomy is that neither
                    alternative is true. There are many things <hi rend="italic">quoe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nullo numero explicari possunt,</hi> and to understand these
                    things we must abstract altogether from the idea of number. The contradiction
                    arises entirely from the application of that idea to the infinite. We cannot say
                    that space has a finite number of parts, for every finite space must be
                    conceived as itself included in infinite space. Yet, on the other hand, an
                    infinite number is an absurdity; it is a number .which is not a number. We
                    escape the difficulty only when we see that number is a category inapplicable to
                    the infinite, and this to Spinoza means that it is not applicable to reality,
                    that it is merely an abstraction, or <hi rend="italic">ens
                    imaginationis.</hi></p>
                <p>The same method which solves the difficulties connected with the nature of matter
                    is applied to mind. Here also we reach the reality, or thing in itself, by
                    abstracting from all determination. All conceptions, therefore, that involve the
                    independence of the finite, all conceptions of good, evil, freedom, and
                    responsibility disappear. When Blyenburg accuses Spinoza of making God the
                    author of evil, Spinoza answers that evil is an <hi rend="italic">ens
                    rationis</hi> that has no existence for God. “Evil is not something positive,
                    but a state of privation, and that not in relation to the divine, but simply in
                    relation to the human intelligence. It is a conception that arises from that
                    generalizing tendency of our minds, which leads us to bring all beings that have
                    the external form of man under one and the same definition, and to suppose that
                    they are all equally capable of the highest perfection we can deduce from such a
                    definition. When, therefore, we find an individual whose works are not
                    consistent with this perfection, straightway we judge that he is deprived of it,
                    or that he is diverging from his own nature,—a judgment we should never make if
                    we had not thus referred him to a general definition, and supposed him to be
                    possessed of the nature it defines. But since God does not know things
                    abstractly, or through such general definitions, and since there cannot be more
                    reality in things than the divine intelligence and power bestows upon them, it
                    manifestly follows that the defect which belongs to finite things, cannot be
                    called a privation in relation to the intelligence of God, but only in relation
                    to the intelligence of man.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Eρist.,</hi> 32.</p></note> Thus evil and
                    good vanish when we consider things <hi rend="italic">sub specie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aeternitatis,</hi> because they are categories that imply a
                    certain independence in finite beings. For the idea of a moral standard implies
                    a relation of man to the absolute good, a relation of the finite to the
                    infinite, in which the finite is not simply lost and absorbed in the infinite.
                    But Spinoza can admit no such relation. In the presence of the infinite the
                    finite disappears, for it exists only by abstraction and negation; or it <hi
                    rend="italic">seems</hi> to us to exist, not because of what is present to our
                    thoughts, but because of what is not present to them. As we think ourselves free
                    because we are conscious of our actions but not of their causes, so we think
                    that we .have an individual existence only because the infinite intelligence is
                    not wholly but only partially realized in us. But as we cannot really divide
                    space, though we can think of a part of it, so neither can we place any real
                    division in the divine intelligence. In this way we can understand how Spinoza
                    is able to speak of the human mind as part of the infinite thought of God, and
                    of the human body as part of the infinite extension of God, while yet he asserts
                    that the divine substance is simple, and not <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0167-0156"/> made up of parts. So far as they exist, they must
                    be conceived as parts of the divine substance, but when we look directly at that
                    divine substance, their separate existence altogether disappears.</p>
                <p>It has, however, been already mentioned that this ascending movement of
                    abstraction, does not at once and directly bring Spinoza to the absolute unity
                    of substance. The principle that “determination is negation,” and that therefore
                    the absolute reality is to be found only in the indeterminate, would lead us to
                    expect this conclusion; but the Cartesian dualism prevents Spinoza from reaching
                    it. Mind and matter are so absolutely opposed, that even when we take away all
                    limit and determination from both, they still retain their distinctness. Raised
                    to infinity, they still refuse to be identified. We are forced, indeed, to take
                    from them their substantial or substantive existence, for there can be no other
                    substance but God, who includes all reality in himself. But though reduced to
                    attributes of a common substance, the difference of thought and extension is
                    insoluble. The independence of individual finite things disappears whenever we
                    substitute thought for imagination, but even to pure intelligence, extension
                    remains extension, and thought remains thought. Spinoza seems therefore reduced
                    to a dilemma; he cannot surrender either the unity or the duality of things, yet
                    he cannot relate them to each other. The only course left open to him is to
                    conceive each attribute in its turn as the whole substance, and to regard their
                    difference as the difference of expression As the patriarch was called by the
                    two names of Jacob and Israel, under different aspects, each of which included
                    the whole reality of the man, so our minds apprehend the absolute substance in
                    two ways, each of which expresses its whole nature.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Eρist,,</hi> 27∙</p></note>
                    In this way the extremes of absolute identity and absolute difference seem to be
                    reconciled. There is a complete parallelism of thought and extension, <hi
                    rend="italic">ordo et connexio idearum</hi><hi rend="italic">idem</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">est ac ordo et connexio rerum,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Etħ.,</hi> ii.
                    7.</p></note> yet there is also a complete independence and absence of relation
                    between them, for each is the whole. A thing in one expression cannot be related
                    to itself in another expression. Hence in so far as we look at the substance
                    under the attribute of thought, we must take no account of extension, and in so
                    far as we look at it under the attribute of extension, we must equally refuse to
                    take any account of thought. This parallelism may be best illustrated by
                    Spinoza’s account of the relation of the human soul and body. The soul is the
                    idea of the body, and the body is the object of the soul, whatever is in the one
                    really is in the other ideally; yet this relation of object and subject does not
                    imply any connexion The motions and changes of the body have to be accounted for
                    partly by itself, partly by the influence of other bodies; and the thoughts of
                    the soul in like manner have to be accounted for partly by what God thinks as
                    constituting the individual mind, and partly by what he thinks as constituting
                    the minds of other individuals. But to account for thought by the motions of the
                    body, or for the motions of the body by thought, is to attempt to bridge the
                    impassable gulf between thought and extension. It involves the double absurdity
                    of accounting for a thing by itself, and of accounting for it by that which has
                    nothing in common with it. .</p>
                <p>In one point of view, this theory of Spinoza deserves the highest praise for that
                    very characteristic which probably excited most odium against it at the time it
                    was first published, namely, its exaltation of matter. It is the mark of an
                    imperfect spiritualism to hide its eyes from outward nature, and to shrink from
                    the material as impure and defiling. But its horror and fear are proofs of
                    weakness; it flies from an enemy it cannot overcome. Spinoza’s bold
                    identification of spirit and matter, God and nature, contains in it the germ of
                    a higher idealism than can befound in any philosophy that asserts the claims of
                    the former at the expense of the latter. A system that begins by making nature
                    godless, will inevitably end, as Schelling once said, in making God unnatural.
                    The expedients by which Des Cartes keeps matter at a distance from God, were
                    intended to maintain his pure spirituality; but their ultimate effect was seen
                    in his reduction of the spiritual nature to mere will. As Christianity has its
                    superiority over other religions in this, that it does not end with the
                    opposition of the human to the divine, the natural to the spiritual, but
                    ultimately reconciles them, so a true idealism must vindicate its claims by
                    absorbing materialism into· itself. It was therefore a true instinct of
                    philosophy that led Spinoza to raise matter to the co-equal of spirit, and at
                    the same time to protest against the Cartesian conception of matter as mere
                    inert mass, moved only by impulse from without. “What were a God that only
                    impelled the world from without <hi rend="italic">1</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi>
                    says Goethe. “It becomes him to stir it by an inward energy, to involve nature
                    in himself, himself in. nature, so that that which lives and moves and has a
                    being in him can never feel the want of his power or his spirit.”</p>
                <p>While, however, Spinoza thus escapes some of the inconsequences of Des Cartes,
                    the contradiction that was <hi rend="italic">implicit</hi> in the Cartesian
                    system between the duality and the unity, the attributes and the substance, in
                    his system becomes <hi rend="italic">explicit.</hi> When so great emphasis is
                    laid upon the unity of substance, it becomes more difficult to explain the
                    difference of the attributes. The result is, that Spinoza is forced to account
                    for it, not by the nature of substance itself, but by the nature of the
                    intelligence to which it is revealed. “By substance,” he says, “I understand
                    that which is in itself, and is conceived through itself. By attribute I
                    understand the same thing, <hi rend="italic">nisi quod,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >attributum dicatur respectu intellectus substantiae certum talem naturam
                    tribuentis.”</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Episi.,</hi> 27.</p></note> Hence we are naturally led with
                    Erdmann to think of the intelligence dividing the substance as a kind of prism
                    that breaks the white light into different colours, through each of which the
                    same world is seen, only with a different aspect. But if the intelligence in
                    itself is but a mode of one of the attributes,, how can it be itself the source
                    of their distinction î</p>
                <p>The key to this difficulty is that Spinoza has really, and almost in spite of his
                    logical principles, two opposite conceptions of substance, between which he
                    alternates without ever bringing them to a unity. Ou the one hand, in accordance
                    with the principle that determination is negation, substance-must be taken as
                    that which is utterly indeterminate, like the Absolute of the Buddhist, which we
                    can characterize only by denying of it everything that we assert of the finite.
                    In this view, no predicate can be applied univocally to God and to the
                    creatures; he differs from them, not only in existence, but in essence.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Etħ.,</hi>
                    i. schol. 17.</p></note> If we follow out this-view to its legitimate result,
                    God is withdrawn into his own absolute unity, and no difference of attributes
                    can be ascribed to him, except in respect of something else than himself. It is
                    owing to the defects of our intelligence· that he appears under different forms
                    or expressions; in himself he is pure being, without form or expression, at all.
                    But, on the other hand, it is to be observed, that while Spinoza really proceeds
                    by abstraction and negation,, he does not <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> to do so.
                    The abstract is to him the unreal and imaginary, and what he means by substance
                    is not simply Being in general, the conception that remains when we omit all
                    that distinguishes the particulars, but the absolute totality of things
                    conceived as a unity in whick all particular existence is included and
                    subordinated..</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n168/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0168-0157"/>
                <p>Hence at a single stroke the indeterminate passes into the most determinate
                    Being, the Being with no attributes at all into the Being constituted by an
                    infinite number of attributes. And while, under the former conception, the
                    defect of our intelligence seemed to be that it divided the substance, or saw a
                    difference of attributes in its absolute unity, under the second conception its
                    defect lies in its apprehending only two out of the infinite multitude of these
                    attributes. To do justice to Spinoza, therefore, we must distinguish between the
                    actual effect of his logic and its effect as he conceived it. The actual effect
                    of his logic is to dissolve all in the ultimate abstraction of Being, from which
                    we can find no way back to the concrete. But his intent was simply to relate all
                    the parts to that absolute unity which is the presupposition of all thought and
                    being, and so to arrive at the most concrete and complete idea of the reality of
                    things. He failed to see what is involved in his own principle that
                    determination is negation; for if affirmation is impossible without negation,
                    then the attempt to divorce the two from each other, the attempt to find a
                    purely affirmative being, must necessarily end in the barest of all abstractions
                    being confused with the unity of all things. But even when the infinite
                    substance is defined as the negative of the finite, the idea of the finite
                    becomes an essential element in the conception of the infinite. Even the
                    Pantheist, who says that God is what finite things are not, in spite of himself
                    recognizes that God has a relation to finite things. Finite things may in his
                    eyes have no positive relation to God, yet they have a negative relation; it is
                    through their evanescence and transitoriness, through their nothingness, that
                    the eternal, the infinite reality alone is revealed to him. Spinoza is quite
                    conscious of this process, conscious that he reaches the affirmation of
                    substance by a negation of what he conceives as the purely negative and unreal
                    existence of finite things, but as he regards the assertion of the finite as
                    merely an illusion due to <hi rend="italic">our</hi> imagination, so he regards
                    the correction of this illusion, the negation of the finite as a movement of
                    reflection which belongs merely to our intelligence, and has nothing to do with
                    the nature of substance in itself. We find the true affirmation by the negation
                    of the negative, but in itself affirmation has no relation to negation. Hence
                    his absolute being is the dead all-absorbing substance and not the
                    self-revealing spirit. It is the being without determination, and not the being
                    that determines itself. There is no reason in the nature of substance why it
                    should have either attributes or modes; neither individual finite things nor the
                    general distinction of mind and matter can be deduced from it. The descending
                    movement of thought is not what Spinoza himself said it should be, an evolution,
                    but simply an external and empirical process by which the elements dropped in
                    the ascending movement of abstraction are taken up again with a merely nominal
                    change. For the sole difference in the conception of mind and matter as well as
                    in the conception of individual minds and bodies which is made by their
                    reference to the idea of God, is that they lose their substantive character and
                    become adjectives. Aristotle objected to Plato that his ideas were merely <hi
                    rend="italic">οXσQrγτα</hi> αiδια, that is, that his idealization of the world
                    was merely superficial, and left the things idealized very much what they were
                    before to the sensuous consciousness; and the same may be said of Spinoza’s
                    negation of finite things. It was an external and imperfect negation, which did
                    not transform the idea of the finite, but merely substituted the names of
                    attributes and modes for the names of general and individual substances.</p>
                <p>The same defective logic, by which the movement of thought in determining the
                    substance is regarded as altogether external to the substance itself, is seen
                    again in Spinoza’s conceptions of the relations of the attributes to each other.
                    Adopting the Cartesian opposition of mind and matter, he does not see, any more
                    than Des Cartes, that in their opposition they are correlative. Or if he did see
                    it (as seems possible from a passage in his earliest treatise),<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tractatus</hi><hi rend="italic">de Deο</hi><hi rend="italic">et homine,</hi>
                    ii. 19.</p></note> he regarded the correlation as merely subjective, merely
                    belonging to our thought. They are to him only the two attributes which we
                    happen to know out of the infinite number belonging to God. There is no
                    necessity that the substance should manifest itself in just these attributes and
                    no others, for abstract substance is equally receptive of all determinations,
                    and equally indifferent to them alb Just because the unity is merely generic,
                    the differences are accidental, and do not form by their union any complete
                    whole. If Spinoza had seen that matter in itself is the correlative opposite of
                    mind in itself, he need not have sought by abstracting from the difference of
                    these elements to reach a unity which is manifested in that very difference, and
                    his absolute would, have been not substance but spirit. This idea he never
                    reached, but we find him approxinating to it in two ways. On the one hand, he
                    condemns the Cartesian conception of matter as passive and self-external, or
                    infinitely divisible—as, in short, the mere opposite of thought.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Epist.,</hi> 29, 70.</p></note> And sometimes he insists on the parallelism of
                    extension and thought at the expense of their opposition in a way that almost
                    anticipates the assertion by Leibnitz of the essential identity of mind and
                    matter. On the other hand, he recognizes that this parallelism is not complete.
                    Thought is not like a picture; it is conscious, and conscious not only of
                    itself, but of extension. It transcends therefore the absolute distinction
                    between itself and the other attributes. It is only because he cannot rid
                    himself of the phantom of an extended matter as a thing in itself, which is
                    entirely different from the idea of it, that Spinoza is prevented from
                    recognizing in mind that unity that transcends all distinctions, even its own
                    distinction from matter. As it is, his main reason for saying that intelligence
                    is not an attribute of God, but merely a mode, seems to be this, that the
                    thought of God must be conceived as producing its own object, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.</hi> as transcending the distinction of subject and object which is
                    necessary to our intelligence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Eth.,</hi> i. schol. 17.</p></note> But
                    this argument of itself points to a concrete quite as much as to an abstract
                    unity. It is as consistent with the idea of absolute spirit as with that of
                    absolute substance. Spinoza’s deliberate and formal doctrine is undoubtedly the
                    latter; but he constantly employs expressions which imply the former, as when he
                    speaks of God as <hi rend="italic">causa sui.</hi> The higher idea inspires him,
                    though his consciousness only embraces the lower idea.</p>
                <p>The ethical philosophy of Spinoza is determined by the same principles and
                    embarrassed by the same difficulties as his metaphysics. In it also we find the
                    same imperfect conception of the relation of the positive to the negative
                    elements, and as a consequence, the same confusion of the highest unity of
                    thought, the affirmation that subordinates and transcends all negation with mere
                    abstract affirmation. Or, to put the same thing in ethical language, Spinoza
                    teaches a morality which is in every point the opposite of asceticism, a
                    morality of self-assertion or self-seeking, and not of self-denial. The <hi

                    of reason, to identify itself with the love of man and the love of God, and to
                    find blessedness not in the reward of virtue, but in virtue itself. It is only
                    confusion of thought and false mysticism that could object to this result on the
                    ground of the element of self still preserved in the <hi rend="italic">amor

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0169-0158"/> it is just the power of identifying himself with
                    that which is wider and.higher than his individual being that makes morality
                    possible to man. But the difficulty lies in this, that Spinoza will not admit
                    the negative element, the element of mortification or sacrifice, into morality
                    at all, even as a moment of transition. For him there is no dead self, by which
                    we may rise to higher things, no losing of life that we may find it. For the
                    negative is nothing, it is evil in the only sense in which evil exists, and
                    cannot be the source of good. The higher affirmation of our own being, the
                    higher seeking of ourselves which is identical with the love of God, must
                    therefore be regarded as nothing distinct in kind from that first seeking of our
                    natural self which in Spinoza’s view belongs to us in common with the animals,
                    and indeed in common with all beings whatever. It must be regarded merely as a
                    direct development and extension of the same thing. The main interest of the
                    Spinozistic ethics therefore lies in observing by what steps he accomplishes
                    this transition, while excluding altogether the idea of a real division of the
                    higher and the lower life, the spirit and flesh, and of a conflict in which the
                    former is developed through the sacrifice of the latter.</p>
                <p>Finite creatures exist only as modes of the divine substance, only so far as they
                    partake in the infinite, or what is the same thing with Spinoza, in the purely
                    affirmative or self-affirming nature of God. They therefore must also be
                    self-affirming. They can never limit themselves; their limit lies in this, that
                    they are not identified with the infinite substance which expresses itself also
                    in other modes. In other words, the limit of any finite creature, that which
                    makes it finite, lies without it, and its own existence, so far as it goes, must
                    be pure self-assertion and self-seeking. <hi rend="italic">Pnajquoeqw res

                    constitutes no essential difference between appetite and desire, for “whether a

                    thing.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    animals, is purely self-asserting and self-seeking. He can neither know nor will
                    anything but his own being, or if he knows or wills anything else, it must be
                    something involved in his own being. If he knows other beings, or seeks their
                    good, it must be because their existence and their good are involved in his own.
                    If he loves and knows God it must be because he cannot know himself without
                    knowing God, or find his supreme good anywhere but in God.</p>
                <p>What at first makes the language difficult to us is the identification of will
                    and intelligence. Both are represented as affirming their objects. Des Cartes
                    had prepared the way for this when he treated the will as the faculty of judging
                    or giving assent to certain combinations of ideas, and distinguished it from the
                    purely intellectual faculties by which the ideas are apprehended. By this
                    distinction be had, as he supposed, secured a place for human freedom. Admitting
                    that intelligence is under a law of necessity, he claimed for the will a certain
                    latitude or liberty of indifference, a power of giving or withholding assent in
                    all cases where the relations of ideas were not absolutely clear and distinct.
                    Spinoza points out that there is no ground for such a distinction, that the acts
                    of apprehension and judgment cannot be separated, from each other.' “In the mind
                    there is no volition, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> no affirmation or negation
                    which is not immediately involved in the idea it apprehends” and therefore
                    “intellect and will are one and the same thing.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Eih.,</hi> ii.
                    49.</p></note> If then there is no freedom except the liberty of indifference,
                    freedom is impossible. Man, like all other beings and things, is under an
                    absolute law of necessity. All the actions of his will, as well as of his
                    intelligence, are but different forms of the self-assertive tendency to which he
                    cannot but yield, because it is one with his very being, or only ideally
                    distinguishable therefrom. There is, however, another idea of liberty. Liberty
                    as the opposite of necessity is an absurdity—it is impossible for either God or
                    man; but liberty as the opposite of slavery is possible, and it is actually
                    possessed by God. The divine liberty consists in this, that God acts from the
                    necessity of his own nature alone, and is not in any way determined from
                    without. And the great question of ethics is, How far can man partake in this
                    liberty î At first it would seem impossible that he should partake in it. He is
                    a finite being, whose power is infinitely surpassed by the power of other beings
                    to which he is related. His body acts only as it is acted, on, and his mind
                    cannot therefore apprehend his body, except as affected by other things. His
                    self-assertion and self-seeking are therefore confused with the asserting and
                    seeking of other things, and are never pure. His thought and activity cannot be
                    understood except through the influence of other things which lie outside of his
                    consciousness, and upon which his will has no influence. He cannot know clearly
                    and distinctly either himself or anything else; how then can he know his own
                    good or determine himself by the idea of it î</p>
                <p>The answer is the answer of Des Cartes, that the apprehension of any finite thing
                    involves the adequate idea of . the infinite and eternal nature of God.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Eth.,</hi>
                    ii. 45.</p></note> This is the primary object of intelligence, in which alone is
                    grounded the possibility of knowing either ourselves or anything else. In so far
                    as our knowledge is determined by this idea, or by the ideas of other things,
                    which are referred to this idea and seen in its light, in so far its action
                    flows from an internal and not an external necessity. In so far, on the other
                    hand, as we are determined by the affections of the body, ideas in which the
                    nature of our own body and the nature of other things are confused together, in
                    so far we are determined by an external necessity. Or to put the same thing in
                    what has been shown to be merely another way of expression, in so far as we are
                    determined by pure intelligence we are free, but in so far as we are determined
                    by opinion and imagination we are slaves.</p>
                <p>From these premises it is easy to see what form the opposition of reason and
                    passion must necessarily take with Spinoza. The passions belong to our nature as
                    finite; they are grounded on, or rather are but another form of inadequate
                    ideas; but we are free only in so far as our ideas either immediately are, or
                    can be made, adequate. Our idea of God is adequate <hi rend="italic">ex
                    vïtermini;</hi> our ideas of the affections cf our body are inadequate, but can
                    be made adequate in so far as they are referred to the idea of God. And as the
                    idea of God is purely affirmative, this reference to the idea of God implies the
                    elimination of the negative element from the ideas of the affections of the
                    body, “for nothing that is positive in a false idea is removed by the presence
                    of truth as such.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">* Eth.,</hi> iv. 1.</p></note> Brought into contact with the idea
                    of God, all ideas become true and adequate, by the removal of the negative or
                    false element in them. The idea of God is, as it were, the touch-stone which
                    distinguished the gold from the dross. It enables us to detect the higher
                    spiritual element in the natural passions, and to sever the element belonging to
                    that pure love of self which is identical with the love of perfection from the
                    elements belonging to that impure love of our own finite individuality as such
                    which is identical with the love of evil.</p>

                <p>The imperfection in Spinoza’s development of this principle has already been
                    indicated. It is in fact the same imperfection which runs through his whole
                    system. Just as he supposed that the ideas of finite things were at once made
                    consistent with the idea of the infinite when he had named them modes, so here
                    his conception of the change through which selfish natural desire must pass in
                    order to become spiritual is far too superficial and external. Hence he has no
                    sympathy with asceticism, but treats it, like Bentham, as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >torva et tristis superstitio.</hi> Joy is the “transition from less to greater
                    perfection,” and cannot be but good; pain is the “transition from greater to
                    less perfection,” and cannot be but evil. The revolt against the mediaeval
                    opposition of the nature and spirit is visible in many of his sayings. “No Deity
                    who is not envious can delight in my weakness or hurts, or can regard as virtues
                    those fears and sighs and tears which are the signs of the m⅛ιd <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s weakness; but contrariwise, the greater is our joy,
                    the greater is our progress to perfection, and our participation in the divine
                    nature.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    iv. 67.</p></note> The same idea, combining with the idea of necessity, leads
                    him to condemn repentance and pity, as well as pride and humility.
                    Unconsciously, Spinoza reproduces the principle of asceticism, while in words he
                    utterly rejects it. For though he tells us that pure self-complacency is the
                    highest thing we can hope, yet from this self-complacency all regard to the
                    finite individuality of the subject is eliminated. <hi rend="italic">Qui Deum
                    amat, conari non potest ut Deus ipsum contra amet.</hi> In like manner, he
                    absolutely condemns all hatred, envy, rivalry, and ambition, as springing out of
                    an over-estimate of those finite things which one only can possess, while the
                    highest good is that which is enjoyed the more easily and fully the greater the
                    number of participants. Yet Spinoza’s exaltation of the social life, and of the
                    love that binds it together, is too like the Buddhist’s universal charity that
                    embraces all creatures, and all creatures equally. Both are based on an
                    abstraction from all that is individual, only the Buddhist’s abstraction goes a
                    step further, and erases even the distinction between man and the animals.
                    Spinoza felt the pressure of this all-levelling logic when he said, “I confess I
                    cannot understand how spirits express God more than the other creatures, for I
                    know that between the finite and the infinite there is no proportion, and that
                    the distinction between God and the most excellent of created things differs not
                    a whit from the distinction between him and the lowest and meanest of
                    them.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    as a heart;” in all finite things there is a ray of divinity, and in nothing
                    more than a ray. Yet in another epistle, Spinoza contradicts this view, and
                    declares that, while he does not consider it necessary to “know Christ after the
                    flesh, he does think is it necessary to know the eternal Son of God, f.e., God’s
                    eternal wisdom, which is manifested in all things, but chiefly in the mind of
                    man, and most of all in Christ Jesus.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    human soul cannot all be destroyed along with the body, for that there is
                    something of it which is eternal. Yet from this eternity we must of course
                    eliminate all notion of the consciousness of the finite self as such. At this
                    point, in short, the two opposite streams of Spinoza’s thought, the positive
                    method he <hi rend="italic">intends</hi> to pursue, and the negative or
                    abstracting method he really <hi rend="italic">does</hi> pursue, meet in
                    irreconcilable contradiction. The finite must be related to the infinite so as
                    to preserve all that is in it of reality; and therefore its limit or the
                    negative element in it must be abstracted from. But it turns out that with this
                    abstraction from the existence of the finite, the positive also disappears, and
                    God is all in all in a sense that absolutely excludes the existence of the
                    finite. “The mind’s intellectual love of God,” says Spinoza, “is the very love
                    wherewith God loves himself, not in so far as he is infinite, but in so far as
                    he can be expressed by the essence of the human mind, considered under the form
                    of eternity; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the mind’s intellectual love of God is
                    part of the infinite love wherewith God loves himself.”<note anchored="true"

                    36.</p></note> This double “in so far,” which returns so frequently in Spinoza,
                    just conceals for a moment the contradiction of two streams of thought, one of
                    which must be swallowed up by the other, if they are once allowed to meet.</p>
                <p>We have now reviewed the main points of the system, which was the ultimate result
                    of the principles of Des Cartes. The importance of this first movement of modern
                    philosophy lies in its assertion and exhibition of the unity of the intelligible
                    world with itself and with the mind of man. In this point of view, it was the
                    philosophical counterpart of Protestantism; but like Protestantism in its
                    earliest phase, it passed rapidly from the doctrine that God is, without priest
                    or authority, present to man’s spirit, to the doctrine that man’s spirit is as
                    nothing before God. The object seemed too powerful for the subject, who effaced
                    himself before God that he might be strong towards men. But in this natural
                    movement of feeling and thought it was forgotten that the God that effaced the
                    world and the finite spirit by his presence could not be a living God. Spinoza
                    gives the ultimate expression to this tendency, and at the same time marks its
                    limit, when he says that whatever reality is in the finite is of the infinite.
                    But he is unsuccessful in showing that, on the principles on which he starts,
                    there can be any reality in the finite at alb Yet even if the finite be a
                    delusion, still more if it be better than a delusion, it requires to be
                    accounted for. Spinoza accounts for it neither as illusory nor as real. It was
                    reserved for the following generation of philosophers to assert, in different
                    ways, the reality of the finite, the value of experience, and the futility of
                    abstractions. Spinoza had declared that true knowledge consists in seeing things
                    under the form of eternity, but it is impossible that things can be seen under
                    the form of eternity unless they have been first seen under the form of time.
                    The one-sided assertion of individuality and difference in the schools of Locke
                    and Leibnitz, was the natural complement of the one-sided assertion of
                    universality and unity in the Cartesian school. But when the individualistic
                    tendency of the 18th century had exhausted itself, and produced its own
                    refutation in the works of Kant, it was inevitable that the minds of men should
                    again turn to the great philosopher, who, with almost perfect insight working
                    through imperfect logic, first formulated the idea of a unity presupposed in and
                    transcending the difference of matter and mind, subject and object.</p>
