                <p><label type="entry">CHESTER</label>, an ancient city of England in West Cheshire,
                    the capital of the county, situated on the river Dee, 20 miles from the open
                    sea, 16 miles S.E. of Liverpool, and 179 miles N.W. of London by rail. The city
                    is divided into four principal blocks by the four principal streets—Northgate
                    Street, Eastgate Street, Bridge Street, and Watergate Street, which radiate at
                    right angles from the Cross, and terminate in the four gates. These four streets
                    exhibit in what are called “the Rows” a characteristic feature of the city.
                    Their origin is a mystery, and has given rise to much controversy and
                    speculation. In Eastgate Street, Bridge Street, and Watergate Street, the Rows
                    exist on each side of the street throughout the greater part of their length,
                    and may be described as continuous galleries open to the street, over and under
                    which the houses lining the streets project, and which are formed as it were out
                    of the front first-floor of the houses, approached by flights of steps from the
                    roadway. The Rows are flagged or boarded under foot and ceiled above, thus
                    forming a covered way, standing in the same relation to the shops, which are at
                    their back, as the foot pavement does in other towns. In Northgate Street, on
                    the other hand, the Row on the west side is formed as it were out of the ground
                    floor of the houses, having cellars beneath, while on the east side the Row is
                    formed at the same elevation as in the other three principal streets. In these
                    streets are several examples of the old timbered houses of the 17th century, and
                    some good specimens of modern imitations of them,—all combining to give a
                    picturesque and foreign character to the town. There is also a chamber with
                    stone groined roof of the 14th century in the basement of a house in Eastgate
                    Street, and another of a similar character in Watergate Street. A mortuary
                    chapel of the early part of the 13th century exists in the basement of a house
                    in Bridge Street.</p>
                <p>Chester is the only city in England that still possesses its walls perfect in
                    their entire circuit of two miles. The gateways have all been rebuilt within the
                    last hundred years,—the north and east gates on the site of the Roman gates. The
                    Grosvenor Bridge, a single span of stone 200 feet in length, the largest, save
                    one over the Danube, it is believed, in Europe, carries the road to Wrexham and
                    Shrewsbury over the Dee on the south-west, while the old bridge of seven arches
                    is interesting on account of its antiquity and picturesque appearance. The city
                    possesses but few public buildings besides the cathedral and the churches. The
                    castle, with the exception of “Caesar’s Tower,” and a round tower with adjacent
                    buildings in the upper ward, was taken down towards the end of the last century,
                    and replaced by a gateway, a barracks, a county hall, a jail, and assize
                    courts,—all buildings of pure classic architecture after the design of Thomas
                    Harrison, a local architect, who was also the architect of the Grosvenor Bridge.
                    In Northgate Street stands the town hall, a handsome stone building of
                    Continental-Gothic design, which replaced the old Exchange, burnt down in 1862.
                    The market-place, a little to the south of it, was opened to the public in 1863.
                    Near the north-west angle of the city walls is the infirmary, founded in 1761,
                    capable of holding 100 beds, and furnished with a fever ward in a detached
                    building to the east of it. The savings-bank is a pretty Gothic structure in
                    Grosvenor Street, erected in 1853. The Grosvenor Hotel, rebuilt by its owner,
                    the late marquis of Westminster, is a handsome building near the east gate, the
                    upper stories being timbered in accordance with the style of the old houses in
                    the city. Besides these may be mentioned the general post-office, designed after
                    the Elizabethan style, the custom-house, the free library, the music hall, and
                    the training college. Among the most interesting of the ancient houses are Derby
                    House, bearing the date 1591, Bishop Lloyd’s House, and God’s Providence House
                    in Watergate Street, and the Bear and Billet in Lower Bridge Street; the three
                    last bear dates in the 17th century. The Natural Science Society, founded by
                    Canon Kingsley, and the Archaeological Society have their lecture-rooms and
                    museums at the Old Albion in Lower Bridge Street.</p>
                <p>Besides the Benedictine Abbey of St Werburgh, the Franciscans, the Dominicans,
                    and the Carmelites had houses in Chester, and the sites of the first and last
                    are still commemorated in the names of Grey Friars and White Friars; St John’s,
                    without the walls, was a collegiate church, with a dean, seven prebendaries, and
                    four vicars. Chester was for a time in the diocese of Lichfield and Coventry,
                    but in 1075, Peter, then bishop, restored the seat of the see to Chester, and
                    made St John’s his cathedral; his successor, however, removed the seat back to
                    Coventry, and in 1541 Henry VIII. erected Chester into an independent see, and
                    the abbey church of St Werburgh into the cathedral of the diocese. He richly
                    endowed the cathedral, and constituted in it a dean and six prebendaries, now
                    reduced to four, who are styled canons. The King’s School for public education
                    was founded by the same patron, and in it the king provided that 24 poor
                    scholars should be taught free of charge. The school has now, however, been
                    remodelled, and placed under a board of governors by the Endowed Schools
                    Commissioners. Within the walls are the parish churches of St Oswald, founded
                    about 1093; St Peter, founded before the Conquest; St Michael, probably founded
                    before 1118; St Bridget, founded prior to 1224; the Holy and Undivided Trinity,
                    founded in or before the 12th century; St Mary, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n616/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0616-0605"/> founded probably in the 12th century; St
                    Martin, founded prior to 1250; and St Olave, founded prior to the 12th century.
                    The two last-named parishes are amalgamated with St Bridget and St Michael
                    respectively. In the suburbs are St John’s, St Paul in Boughton, Christ Church
                    in Newton, All Saints in Hoole, and St Thomas. Among the Nonconformist places of
                    worship, which represent all the principal denominations, may be mentioned the
                    Unitarian Chapel in Crook Lane, built originally by the followers of Matthew
                    Henry, one of the ejected ministers. For the recreation of the inhabitants
                    provision is made by the New Grosvenor Park, presented to the town in 1867 by
                    the marquis of Westminster, and the Roodee, a level tract at the base of the
                    city walls appropriated as a race course.</p>
                <p>The original charter which the city received from Earl Ranulph was confirmed, and
                    the privileges extended, by many subsequent charters granted by different
                    sovereigns and princes. Of these the most important were that of Edward I.,
                    which granted the office of coroner, defined and extended the jurisdiction of
                    the courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and granted freedom from toll,
                    &amp;c., to the citizens throughout his dominions; that of Edward, the Black
                    Prince, which defined and particularized the boundaries of the city, giving it a
                    circuit of 12 or 14 miles, and granted jurisdiction of the river Dee to the
                    mayor and citizens from a spot then and still called “Iron Bridge” above the
                    city, to a point near Hoylake at the mouth of the river; and lastly, the charter
                    of Henry VII., which ordained that the corporation should consist of a mayor, 24
                    aidermen, and 40 common councilmen, to be elected annually, created the office
                    of recorder, regulated and gave exclusive jurisdiction to the mayor’s and
                    sheriff’s courts, empowered the mayor to have his sword of state carried (in the
                    absence of the king and his heirs) before all others with point upwards, and
                    finally erected the city into a county by itself with a separate commission of
                    the peace. The corporation thus constituted continued till the passing of the
                    Municipal Corporations Act, under which the government of the city is now vested
                    in the mayor, 10 aidermen, and 30 councilmen. The recorder is now a barrister
                    appointed by the Crown. He is the judge of the local courts, called the Portmote
                    (originally the mayor’s court), the Pentice (originally held before the two
                    sheriffs in a building now pulled down, called the Pentice), and the Passage
                    Courts now fallen into disuse. He also presides at the city court of quarter
                    sessions, which now alone retains a limited criminal jurisdiction, which once
                    the city courts possessed even to the infliction of capital punishment.</p>
                <p>The population of the municipal (as distinguished from the parliamentary) borough
                    was, according to the census of 1861, 31,110, and in 1871, 35,257 (16,910 males
                    and 18,347 females). The area of the municipal borough is 3437 acres, and that
                    of the parliamentary, which includes parts of Hoole, Saltney, Great Boughton,
                    and Newtown, 3455 acres, containing a population in 1871 of 38,390, and
                    returning two members to parliament. The trade of the town is nominally
                    represented by 23 guilds. Within the walls there is no extensive manufacture
                    carried on, save that of shoes and boots for exportation and the wholesale home
                    trade, and furniture and upholstery. In the suburbs shot and white and sheet
                    lead are very largely manufactured, and flour of superior quality is produced.
                    There are also several iron foundries, and the more humble manufacture of
                    pipe-making has been carried on from a remote period. As a port there can be
                    little doubt that Chester was at one time of importance, but the silting up of
                    the channel of the Dee affected its commerce injuriously as early as the 15th
                    century, and now the shipping trade is inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>The history of Chester reaches back to very early times. Higden ascribes the
                    foundation of the town to a very remote period; but the Welsh name by which it
                    was even in Higden’s day and is still known—Caerlleon Vawr or Caerlleon ar
                    Dyfyrdwy, which means the “great camp or station of the legion on Dee,”—points
                    to a Roman origin. It is the <hi rend="italic">Deva</hi> of the Roman
                    Itineraries, and from its position at the head of the then most important
                    estuary on this part of the coast, and at a point where several Roman roads
                    converged, it must soon have risen in prosperity and importance. The dignity of
                    a Roman <hi rend="italic">colonia</hi> has been claimed for it by some writers,
                    but there is no certain evidence on which such a claim can be grounded. The pick
                    and spade, however, have revealed numerous proofs that it was “no mean city.”
                    Among numerous altars from time to time exhumed is one of rare occurrence with a
                    Greek inscription, and dedicated by Hermogenes, a physician. Of the latest
                    discoveries the most remarkable was made in pulling down the Feathers Hotel on
                    the east side of Bridge Street, when the remains of a fine basilica were brought
                    to light, having a row of seven Corinthian pillars on either side once
                    supporting its roof, and a series of apartments on its south side,—probably in
                    connection with baths,—floored with tesselated and herring-bone tile pavements,
                    and warmed by an extensive hypocaust, a portion of which is still to be seen
                    underneath some adjoining houses.</p>
                <p>The town was walled, and in form was rectangular and equilateral or nearly so,
                    but was not co-extensive with the present city. The four principal streets
                    followed generally the line of the present streets running north and south and
                    east and west, crossing each other in the centre of the town. The southern wall
                    of the town, running from a point near the distance chair in the racecourse,
                    past St Bridget’s rectory eastwards, cut across the present city, about the top
                    of Lower Bridge Street, just below St Michael s Church, and joined the wall on
                    the eastern side somewhere a little to the north of what are now called “The
                    Wishing Steps,” and there was probably a tower at each angle of the wall. A
                    Roman arch, however, still existing and impinging upon the Keep or “Caesar's”
                    Tower in the Castle, and also another arch (now removed), incorporated into the
                    walls near the old bridge, and called “The Ship Gate,” attest the existence of
                    some outwork overhanging the river for the protection probably of the trajectus
                    by which the Roman roads to the south and west, emerging from the town by the
                    southern gate, crossed at a point just below. The renowned XXth Legion was
                    stationed here from an early period of the Roman occupation to as late as the
                    third century.</p>
                <p>After the departure of the Romans, Chester appears to have been possessed in turn
                    by Britons, Saxons, and Danes; in 894 it was found a deserted city by the Danes,
                    who then took possession, and were in turn starved out by a besieging Saxon
                    army. Earl Ethelred restored it in 908, extending its walls so as to embrace the
                    castle. After the defeat of the Danes by Edmund in 942, Chester for a time
                    enjoyed comparative repose. Athelstan revived its mint; Edgar received homage of
                    his vassals there; and Harold’s queen found a home there after the battle of
                    Hastings. Mercia had up to this time been governed by its earl. Beyond Chester
                    lay the still hostile Welsh, for the reduction of whom the place afforded an
                    important basis of operations, this led to the establishment after the Conquest
                    oftheNorman earldom of Chester, which was first granted to Gher-bod, a noble
                    Fleming. After him Hugh Lupus, the nephew of the Conqueror, was invested as earl
                    of Chester, with sovereign or palatinate authority over the tract of country now
                    represented by the county of Cheshire, and the coast-line of Flintshire, as far
                    as Rhuddlan, with Chester as the seat of his Government. In the castle, buflt,
                    or at least reconstructed by Earl Hugh, the earl assembled his court or council;
                    and here too sat the exchequer and other courts. Earl Hugh was the founder of
                    the Benedictine Abbey of St Werburgh, which he richly endowed. It was during the
                    rule of these Norman earls that Chester received at the hands of Earl Ranulph I.
                    its first charter, and took rank as a city, but the language of this charter
                    indicates that Chester already possessed some municipal privileges. Under this
                    charter were established local courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction, which
                    were the germs of the Portmote, Pentice, and Passage Courts. On the death of
                    Earl John in 1237, Henry III. seized the earldom and it has ever since been an
                    apanage of the Crown. The county, however, retained its palatinate character,
                    and Chester still continued to be the seat of its jurisdiction. Though no longer
                    the metropolis of an almost independent dominion, Chester still, as the capital
                    of the palatinate and the key to North Wales, yet unsubdued, ranked high among
                    the cities of the west of England, was often honoured by royal visits, and was
                    the object of attack and defence during the many civil wars. In 1256 she
                    narrowly escaped the fury of Llewelyn, who, we are told, carried fire and sword
                    to her very gates. Edward I. visited the city on several occasions; in 1276 he
                    summoned Llewelyn to do him homage here, and the next year he marched through
                    with a powerful army to Rhuddlan. In 1300 his son Edward, the first English
                    Prince of Wales, here received the final submission of the Welsh to the
                    sovereignty of England. Hither Henry of Lancaster led his captive sovereign,
                    Richard IL, from Flint Castle, and imprisoned him in a tower over the outer
                    gateway of the Castle. In 1459 queen Margaret <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0617-0606"/> visited the city, and Henry the VII.,
                    accompanied by his queen and mother in 1494. In 1507, 1517, and 1550, Chester
                    shared with other places the visitation of the sweating sickness, which carried
                    off many of its inhabitants. It was also so severely scourged by the plague,
                    1602 to 1605, that the city fairs were suspended, and the court of exchequer
                    removed to Tarvin, and the assizes to Nantwich. In 1647-48 this epidemic for the
                    last time raged with a terrible fatality; from June <hi rend="italic">22 to</hi>
                    April 20 it is said that 2099 persons perished of the plague in the several city
                    parishes. But of all the events in the history of Chester, there is none so
                    memorable as the protracted siege which the city endured in its loyalty to
                    Charles I. The king, having hoisted his standard at Nottingham, arrived at
                    Chester in the autumn of 1642, where he was enthusiastically received. The
                    sacrifices made by the citizens for the royal cause were great. In 1644, the
                    pecuniary levies upon them amounted to as much as £200 every fortnight. The
                    siege began in July 1643, and in the autumn of 1645 the assailants, despairing
                    of taking it by assault, converted the siege into a blockade. In 1646-7 the
                    citizens were in such extremities as to be in want of the commonest necessaries
                    of life. It was only after a tenth summons that, on February 3, 1646, they at
                    last agr eed to the articles of surrender, by which the garrison were allowed to
                    march out with all the honours of war, the safety of the persons and property of
                    the citizens with liberty to trade was secured, and the sanctity of the sacred
                    edifices and their title deeds preserved. In 1659 Sir George Booth and a large
                    party of the citizens seized the garrison for Charles II., then still an exile,
                    but they were afterwards repulsed in an action fought near Winnington bridge, by
                    Lambert, the Parliamentary general. In 1660 the joy felt by the citizens at the
                    Restoration, was expressed by the magnificent reception accorded to the learned
                    Dr Brian Walton, the new bishop of Chester, on his coming to take possession of
                    his see. The spirit of the inhabitants evinced, however, a change in 1683, when
                    the presence of the duke of Monmouth was the cause of a tumultuous mob, who,
                    after committing other acts of violence, forced the cathedral doors, destroyed
                    most of the painted glass, demolished the font, and did other damage there.
                    James II. visited the city in 1687, and his successor, William III., in 1690.
                    Coming to more modem times, the city accorded a hearty and brilliant welcome to
                    the Prince of Wales on the 14th October 1869, when he honoured them with his
                    presence to open the new Town Hall. (W. W. F. )</p>
