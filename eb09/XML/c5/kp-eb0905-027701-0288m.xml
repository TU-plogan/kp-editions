                <p><label type="entry">CAVY</label>, a name common to several species of Rodents
                    belonging to the family <hi rend="italic">Gavidoe,</hi> all of which, at least
                    in the wild state, are confined to the South American continent. They are small
                    creatures, seldom exceeding a foot in length, burrowing in the ground, and
                    feeding entirely on fruits and herbs. There are several species. (1.) The
                    Patagonian Cavy <hi rend="italic">{Dolixhotis patagonixa),</hi> larger than a
                    hare, but somewhat resembling that rodent in external appearance, inhabits the
                    dry sterile districts of Patagonia and La Plata, disappearing wherever the
                    country becomes more humid. It is a shy creature, forming burrows in the earth,
                    although in districts where the bizcacha is found, it is said to avail itself of
                    the subterranean works of the latter. It feeds by day, roaming in search of food
                    in small companies, “hopping,” says Darwin, “one after the other in a straight
                    line over the gravelly plain.” Unlike other cavies, its eyes, like those of the
                    kangaroo, are protected from the glare of the sun by prominent eyelashes. It is
                    covered with a long dense fur of a rusty colour, and has a short tail. It
                    produces two young at a birth. (2.) The Restless Cavy <hi rend="italic">(Cavia
                    aperea),</hi> found throughout Uruguay and Brazil, is supposed to be the wild
                    form of the Guineapig of Europe. It is about 10 inches long, is destitute of a
                    tail, and weighs a little over 1 B&gt;; its fur is long and of a nearly uniform
                    greyish-brown colour. The aperea is rarely found in dry sandy localities,
                    preferring marshes covered with aquatic plants, among which it lies concealed,
                    feeding in the early morning and after sunset in the evening, but when the soil
                    is dry it forms burrows like the other cavies. It is said to live in societies
                    of from six to eighteen individuals, to breed but once a year, and to have one
                    or at most only two young at a birth. The Guinea-pig <hi rend="italic">(Cavia
                    cobaya</hi> of some authors) was, according to the zoologists of the 16 th
                    century, unknown in Europe previous to the discovery of America, and there is
                    little doubt that it was introduced from the southern division of that
                    continent, the name of Guinea-pig being probably given by mistake for
                    Guiana-pig. It differs, however, in many important respects from the wild
                    aperea. It is somewhat larger, as might be expected in a cultivated form; the
                    colour of its fur is white, variegated with irregular patches of red and black.
                    It perishes on the marshy soil which the other prefers; it produces a numerous
                    progeny three times a year; and what is more important still, the two forms do
                    not couple together, a difference which among wild species is usually held as
                    indicating generic distinctness. It appears, from the drawing of Aldrovandus,
                    that the Guineapig had already attained its present variegated colouring fifty
                    years after the discovery of America, a fact which has led to the supposition
                    that it had been previously domesticated by the natives of South America. Mr
                    Waterhouse, however, thinks it more probable “that some pretty variety had
                    attracted the attention of the earliest European settlers in the New World, and
                    given rise to its capture and domestication, more especially as the harmless
                    disposition and pretty colouring of the common Guinea-pig appear to be the only
                    claims of interest which are attached to it” <hi rend="italic">(Natural History
                    of the Mammalia,</hi> vol. ii.) It is a singularly inoffensive and defenceless
                    creature, of a restless disposition, and greatly wanting in that intelligence
                    which usually characterizes domestic pets, although it is said to show some
                    discrimination. It is of no particular service to man, neither its flesh nor its
                    fur being put to use, while the statement that its presence is sufficient to
                    drive off rats and mice appears to be without foundation. It is exceedingly
                    prolific, beginning to breed at the age of two months; the number of young
                    varies, according to the age of the parent, from four to twelve. It has been
                    calculated that a single pair of Guinea-pigs may prove the parent stock of a
                    thousand individuals in a single year. (3.) The Bolivian Cavy <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cavia bolivensis),</hi> found throughout the higher regions of Bolivia,
                    usually at an elevation of 10,000 or 12,000 feet, is exceedingly shy, and lives
                    in burrows, these in some districts being so numerous as to have completely
                    undermined the soil. (4.) The Rock Cavy <hi rend="italic">(Cavia
                    rupestris),</hi> distinguished by its short, blunt nails, is found in rocky
                    situations throughout Brazil, and is much sought after for its flesh, which is
                    considered a dainty by the Indians. (5.) The Southern Cavy <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cavia australis),</hi> common along the coast of Patagonia, forms deep
                    burrows, with several outlets, in sandy declivities, and is said to climb trees
                    in search of the fruit on which it feeds.</p>
