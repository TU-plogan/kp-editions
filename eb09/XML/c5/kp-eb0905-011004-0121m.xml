                    bounded N. by Kildare and Wicklow, E. by Wicklow and Wexford, S. by Wexford, and
                    W. by Queen’s County and Kilkenny, Excepting Louth it is the smallest county in
                    Ireland.</p>
                <p>The surface of the county is in general level or gently undulating, and of
                    pleasing appearance, except the elevated tract of land known as the ridge of Old
                    Leighlin, forming the commencement of the coal measures of Leinster, and the
                    south-eastern portion of the county bordering on Wexford, where the wild and
                    barren granitic elevations of Knockroe (1746 feet) and Mount Leinster (2610
                    feet) present a bolder aspect.</p>
                <p>There are no lakes or canals in the county, neither does it contain the source of
                    any important river; but on its western side it is intersected from north to
                    south by the Barrow, which is navigable throughout the whole extent of the
                    county and affords means of communication with the <pb break="no"

                    the Slaney, which is not navigable in any part of its course through the county,
                    passes out of Carlow into Wexford at New-townbarry. Railway communication
                    connects the county with Dublin, with Wexford, and with Kilkenny and
                    Waterford.</p>
                <p>The geological formation of the county is mainly granitic, but the valley of the
                    Barrow north, of Goresbridge presents the three formations of limestone observed
                    in Ireland, and the great coal district of Leinster commences in the western
                    edge of the county at Gallows Hill Bog (974 feet). The sandstone is frequently
                    of such a nature as to split easily into layers, known in commerce as Carlow
                    flags. Porcelain clay exists in the neighbourhood of Tullow; but no attempt has
                    yet been made to turn this production to use.</p>
                <p>The soil is of great natural richness. Agriculture is the chief occupation of the
                    inhabitants, but is not so fully developed as the capabilities of the land would
                    suggest. It will be observed from the following table that no progress has been
                    made within the last twenty-two years in the acreage under tillage :—</p>

                <p>The staple trade of the county is in corn, flour, meal, butter, and provisions,
                    which are exported in large quantities. There are no manufactures.</p>
                <p>The peasantry dwell chiefly in detached cottages, or in small villages, there
                    being but three towns—Carlow, Bagenalstown, and Tuliow—in which the inhabitants
                    exceed 2000 persons.</p>
                <p>The population has decreased within the twenty years ending 1871, at a slightly
                    higher rate than that of the province of Leinster in general, owing probably to
                    the want of manufacturing and mining industries. In 1851 the population was
                    68,078, andin 1871,51,650 (males 25,464, females 26,186), showing an average
                    decrease of 1 ’ 2 per cent, per annum.</p>
                <p>In April 1871 there were 6 superior and 99 primary schools in operation, attended
                    by 6454 children, and at the same date the following was ascertained to be the
                    state of elementary instruction :—24,496 could read and write , 9286 could read
                    but could not write; and 17,868, or 34 per cent, of the population, could
                    neither read nor write.</p>
                <p>Of the whole inhabitants, 88 per cent, adhere to the Roman Catholic faith, the
                    number professing that religion in 1871 being 45,621, while 5656 were
                    Episcopalians, and 373 of various other denominations. As regards emigration the
                    county has contributed more than the average of Leinster. During the five years
                    1871 to 1875, there emigrated 3881 persons, a number equal to 7½ per cent, of
                    the population at the former date. The poor law union, which does not include
                    the whole county, relieved in 1874, 3030 persons or 6∣ per cent, of the
                    inhabitants. The county belongs to the diocese of Leighlin and to the military
                    district of Dublin. The assizes are held at Carlow, and quarter sessions at that
                    town and also at Bagenalstown and Tullow. Carlow returns three members to
                    parliament, two for the county and one for the borough of Carlow.</p>
                <p>Previous to the arrival of Strongbow, and for some time afterwards, what is now
                    the county of Carlow was divided into the districts of Hy Cabanagh and Hy Drone,
                    forming the northern portion of the principality of Hy Kinselagh. Its most
                    ancient Irish families were the Kavanaghs (descended from the celebrated
                    Macmurrough, king of Leinster), the O’Ryans, the O’Nolans, and the O’Mores,
                    After the English settlement, the families of St Aubin, De la Frayne,
                    Bermingham, Carew, De la Landes, Grace, and Butler, held extensive possessions
                    here. In the time of Queen Elizabeth appear the families of Bagnal, Eustace,
                    Burton, O’Brien, Ponsonby, Hamilton, Coke, Bernard, Vigors, Burdett, Bunbury,
                    Beresford, Bruen,Bagot, and Browne.</p>
                <p>Under the name of Catherlogh, the present county was made shireground in the
                    reign of King John. It is now divided into seven baronies,—Carlow, Forth, Idrone
                    East and West, Rathvιlly, and St Mullins Lower and Upper, and contains
                    forty-seven parishes and parts of parishes. The relics of antiquity in the
                    county comprise large cromlechs at Browne's Hill near Carlow and at Hacketstown,
                    and a rath near Leighlin Bridge, in which were found several urns of baked
                    earth, containing only small quantities of dust. Some ιelics of ecclesiastical
                    and monastic buildings exist, and also the remains of several castles built
                    after the English settlement. The ruins of a round tower existed at the
                    commencement of the present century near the church of Kellystown, but they are
                    not now visible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Carlow,</hi> a parliamentary borough, and the capital of the
                    county of Carlow, situated on the Rtver Barrow, which is navigable for small
                    craft to its junction with the Grand Canal at Athy, is 45 miles (56 by rail)
                    south-west of Dublin. It is a neat and in some parts a well-built town, of
                    modern aspect. The pnncipal buildings are—the Roman Catholic College of St
                    Patrick, a plain but spacious building , the parish church, an old building,
                    with a handsome steeple of modern erection; the Roman Catholic chapel or
                    cathedral, a large and elegant structure; the court-house where the assizes are
                    held, an octagonal stone building with a handsome Ionic portico; the lunatic
                    asylum for this and the adjoining counties; the county jail; the union
                    workhouse; and barracks for cavalry and infantry.. The Wellington bridge over
                    the River Barrow connects Carlow with the suburb of Graigue.</p>
                <p>The industries of the place consist of brewing and flourmilling, and a
                    considerable trade is carried on in the sale of butter and eggs.</p>
                <p>Carlow was formerly of considerable importance. In the reign of Edward III. the
                    king’s exchequer was removed thither, and £500, a large sum at that period,
                    applied towards surrounding the town with a strong wall. The castle (supposed to
                    have been founded by Hugh de Lacy, but sometimes attributed to King John),
                    situated on an eminence overlooking the River Barrow, is still a chief feature
                    of attraction in the general view of the town, although there is not much of the
                    original building left. It consisted of a hollow quadrangle, with a massive
                    round tower at each angle. In the early part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth it
                    was taken, and the town burned by the Irish chieftain Rory Oge O’More. When
                    summoned to surrender by Ireton, the Commonwealth general, during the disastrous
                    war of 1641, Carlow submitted without resistance. In the insurrection of 1798
                    the castle was attacked by an undisciplined body of insurgents, many of whom
                    were intoxicated. They were speedily repulsed, and suffered severe loss, no
                    quarter being given; and, in the confusion of their flight, many of the
                    insurgents took refuge in houses, which the king’s trocps immediately set on
                    fire. After the slaughter, about 420 bodies were collected and buried.</p>
                <p>The town obtained a charter of incorporation at an early period, and was
                    re-incorporated, with enlarged privileges, by James I. The corporation, which
                    was styled “The Sovereign, Free Burgesses, and Commonalty of the Borough of
                    Catherlogh,” and was authorized to return two members to the Irish parhament,
                    was extinguished by the Municipal Reform Act. The borough, which is under the
