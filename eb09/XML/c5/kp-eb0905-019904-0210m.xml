                    Sparta. We find also that the Dioscuri were specially reverenced among people of
                    Dorian race, and that they were said to have reigned at Sparta. Müller therefore
                    suggests that the myth arose from the apotheosis of certain human Tyn-daridae,
                    round whom gradually collected fables which originally referred to some ancient
                    Peloponnesian deities.</p>
                <p>The Dioscuri presided over public games, Castor being the god of equestrian
                    exercise, Pollux the god of boxing; but both are usually represented on fiery
                    steeds with spears and egg-shaped hel&amp;ets crowned with stars. They were,
                    besides, the patrons of hospitality; their willing and kindly aid was especially
                    sought by travellers; they were <hi rend="italic">θεol σωττj-ρε&lt;s,</hi> ever
                    ready to befriend all who paid them due honour. Their most important exploits
                    are their invasion of Attica, to rescue their sister Helen from Theseus; their
                    share in the hunting of the Calydonian boar, and in the Argonautic expedition,
                    during which they married the daughters of Leucippus; and, lastly, their battle
                    with the· sons of Aphareus, in which Castor, the mortal, fell by the hand of
                    Idas. Pollux, finding him dead after the battle, implored Jupiter to be allowed
                    to die with him; but the father of the gods (says Homer) gave his brother life,
                    on condition that both should, on alternate days, descend to Hades. According to
                    another fable, the god marked his approval of their love by placing them
                    together among the stars.</p>
                <p>Though their worship was perhaps most carefully observed among people of Dorian
                    origin, they were held in no small veneration at Rome. It was the popular belief
                    in that city from an early period that the battle of Lake Regillus had been
                    decided by their interposition. They had fought, it was said, armed and mounted,
                    at the head of the legions of the commonwealth, and had afterwards carried the
                    news of the victory with incredible speed to the city. The well in the Forum at
                    which they alighted was pointed out, and near it rose their ancient temple. A
                    great festival was kept in their honour on the Ides of Quintilis, believed to be
                    the anniversary of the battle, and sumptuous sacrifices were offered to them at
                    the public charge, It was further ordained that a grand muster and inspection of
                    the equestrian body should be part of the ceremonial. All the knights, clad in
                    purple and crowned with olive, were to meet at a temple of Mars in the suburbs.
                    Thence they were to ride in state to the forum, where stood the temple of the
                    twins. This pageant was during several <pb break="no"

                    Rome. In the time of Dionysius the cavalcade consisted of 5000 horsemen, all
                    persons of fair repute and independent fortune.</p>
