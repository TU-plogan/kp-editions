                    school, comprising a foundation for two masters and fifty scholars, with a few
                    exhibitions also. The cathedral library contains about 9000 volumes, and is rich
                    in ancient charters and registers of the monastery. Besides the cathedral there
                    are fifteen parish churches, and places of worship for Roman Catholics, Jews,
                    Unitarians, Independents, Baptists, Wesleyans, Lady Huntingdon’s congregation,
                    and the Society of Friends. In the crypt of the cathedral there is also a church
                    founded by Queen Elizabeth for French Protestant refugees, and still used by a
                    small French congregation. A college for the education of missionary clergy of
                    the Church of England was founded by Royal Charter in 1848 on the ruins of St
                    Augustine’s abbey; and on St Thomas Hill in the suburbs is the boys’ school of
                    the Clergy Orphan Corporation. The principal public buildings are the Guild
                    Hall, the Corn Exchange with market-place below, the Museum, the Kent and
                    Canterbury Hospital, an institution for upwards of 100 patients, and the gaol,
                    which is for the eastern division of the county, with the county court-hall
                    adjoining. The city contains barracks for horse, foot, and artillery,— that for
                    cavalry being used for depots of regiments on foreign service, and that for
                    infantry as the brigade depot of the 3rd regiment (Buffs) and the East Kent
                    regiment, and as the headquarters of the East Kent militia. The trade of
                    Canterbury comprises good markets for hops and corn, but has no other
                    speciality. There are some pleasant public gardens known as the Dane-John Walks.
                    The suburbs and neighbourhood are favourite spots for residence.</p>
                <p>Canterbury returns two members to Parliament, the constituency being 2794
                    (revision 1875). The population in 1871 was 20,962, and the number of houses
                    4102.</p>
                <p>Canterbury occupies the site of the Roman <hi rend="italic">Durovernum,</hi> a
                    city established upon that ford of the River Stour at which roads from the three
                    Kentish harbour-fortresses, <hi rend="italic">Rutupiae,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Dubrοe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lernanoe</hi> (now Richborough, Dover,
                    and Lymne) became united into the one great military way through Britain, known
                    in later days as Watling Street. From this ford the city apparently derived its
                    name, the first syllable of which is the Celtic <hi rend="italic">clwr,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">“</hi> water.” The Romans do not seem, at least towards the
                    end of their occupation, to have made it a military centre, or given it a
                    permanent garrison; but, as a halting-place for troops on the march, and
                    commercially, as lying in the direct path of all the Continental traffic of
                    Britain, its importance at this date must have been considerable. The city
                    reappears, under its new name of Cantwarabyrig (since shortened to the present
                    word), as the capital of Ethelbert, the fourth Saxon king of Kent, during the
                    latter part of whose reign it became in a manner the metropolis of England,—the
                    office of Bretwalda, or overlord, of the island to the Humber being held by
                    Ethelbert. It was in this reign (in 596) and under these circumstances that
                    Augustine and his fellow-missionaries arrived from Rome, and their settlement by
                    Ethelbert in his capital became the origin of its position, held ever since, as
                    the metropolis of the English Church. Its history from this time becomes chiefly
                    ecclesiastical. Here lived and ruled Augustins and the succeeding archbishops,
                    and here under their auspices, from the time of Ethelbert and Augustine
                    downwards, arose two of the principal monasteries of England, the abbey of St
                    Augustine and the priory of Christ Church, —the latter ruled by a prior only, as
                    acknowledging the archbishop for its abbot. These were long rivals in importance
                    and wealth, in which the abbey held for several centuries the advantage, as
                    possessing the shrines of the earlier archbishops, the chief saints of the
                    English Church, till the pre-eminence of the priory in turn became decidedly
                    established by the murder of Archbishop Becket (1170) in its cathedral church,
                    his canonization as St Thomas of Canterbury, and the resort of the Christian
                    world on pilgrimage to his shrine. Miracles were almost immediately said to be
                    worked at his grave in the crypt, and at the well in which his garments had been
                    washed; and from the time when Henry II. did his penance for the murder in the
                    church, and the battle of Alnwick was gained over the Scots a few days
                    afterwards—it was supposed as a result— the fame of the martyr’s power and the
                    popularity of his worship became an established thing in England. On the
                    rebuilding of the cathedral after a fire, in 1175, a magnificent shrine was
                    erected for him in a new chapel built for the purpose, which became thronged for
                    three centuries by pilgrims and worshippers of all classes, from kings and
                    emperors downwards. Henceforward the interests of the city became bound up in
                    those of the cathedral, and were shown in the large number of hostels for the
                    accommodation of the pilgrims, and of shops containing wares especially suited
                    to their tastes. A pilgrimage to Canterbury became not only a pious exercise,
                    but a fashionable summer excursion; and the poet Chaucer, writing in the 14th
                    century, has given us an admirable picture of such pilgrimages, with the manners
                    and behaviour of a party of pilgrims, leisurely enjoying the journey, and
                    telling stories to each other on the road. Our very language still contains two
                    words originating in these customs,—a “canterbury,” or a “canterbury tale,” a
                    phrase used for a fiction,—and a “canter,” which is a short íoim for a
                    “canterbury gallop,” an allusion to the easy pace at which these pilgrimages
                    were performed. The largely ecclesiastical character of the city may still be
                    seen in the numerous remains of buildings connected with the church with which
                    its streets abound to the present day. The shrine with its vast collected wealth
                    was destroyed, and every reminiscence connected with it as far as possible
                    effaced, by King Henry VIII.'s commissioners in 1538.</p>
                <p>In secular history Canterbury has been less remarkable. The castle was taken by
                    Louis, son of Philip Augustus of France, during his incursion into England in
                    1215. Here, in the cathedral, Edward I. was married in 1299 to his second queen,
                    Margaret of France, and Charles I. to Henrietta Mana in 1625. Hence started the
                    Kentish rebels under Wat Tyler on their march to London in 1381, taking with
                    them as prisoner Archbishop Sudbury, whom they beheaded later on Tower Hill,—in
                    this point curiously repeating the action of the Danes during their invasion of
                    1011, who seized Archbishop Elphege from this cathedral, and shortly afterwards
                    put him to death at Blackheath. The “Canterbury Christmas,” that of 1647, is
                    known for the resistance offered here to the attempt to carry out the decree of
                    Parliament against the observance of the day. Out of the rising that ensued grew
                    the “Kentish Petition” for the release of Charles I., supported, in the
                    following summer, by an armed gathering of the gentry and yeomanry of the
                    county, which was scattered by General Fairfax in the battle of Maidstone.</p>
                <p>The cathedra) stands on the site of a Roman church given by King Ethelbert,
                    together with his own palace adjoining, to Augustine and his monks. This early
                    church and its adjacent buildings were destroyed and entirely rebuilt by
                    Archbishop Lanfranc in 1070, and the choir <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n39/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0039-0030"/> was again rebuilt on a larger scale by his
                    successor Archbishop Anselm, whose work, in turn, on being restored after the
                    fire of 1172, was then considerably enlarged, especially by the addition of a
                    chapel and corona, both dedicated to St Thomas, at its eastern end. In this
                    state substantially the choir remains to the present day. Lanfranc’s nave
                    survived till the 14th century, when it was rebuilt, with the exception of one
                    western tower, taken down in 1834. The central tower was not completed till
                    about 1500. The most interesting parts remaining in the present church are—(1)
                    the site of the murder of Becket in the north-west transept, which still shows
                    the mark of the altar erected in its commemoration, though a prevalent story of
                    a stone in the pavement from which his bloodstain has been cut out, is a modern
                    fiction; (2) the site of the shrine itself, shown by the rough flooring in the
                    centre of its chapel, King Henry’s commissioners having destroyed the very
                    pavement on which it stood; (3) a few remaining windows of rich . 12th century
                    glass, unique in England and scarcely equalled on the Continent; (4) monuments
                    of the Black Prince, of Henry IV. and his queen, and of several of the
                    archbishops from Peckham to Pole; (5) fine remains of Norman fresco-painting in
                    the apse of St Gabriel in the crypt; and (6) the choir itself, built through the
                    ten years succeeding 1174, an interesting specimen of the gradual transition
                    from the Norman style progressing in England at the latter end of the 12th
                    century, and showing especially the first introduction of that Southern-French
                    variety of detail which gained a place in the new style now known as Early
                    English. Many of the monastic buildings still remain, as the cloisters, the
                    chapter-house, the treasury, the two entrance gateways, and the lavatory tower
                    now used as a baptistery; and scattered in the precincts are relics of the
                    infirmary, the dormitory, the prior’s house, and three sets of buildings for
                    hospitality to three different grades of pilgrims—all showing great beauty of
                    architecture. The chapter buildings, added in the last few years, are not so
                    praiseworthy.</p>
                <p>Of St Augustine’s Abbey the remains are fewer; but a beautiful gateway of the
                    14th century, the abbot’s hall, and some remains of the great church, attest its
                    former magnificence. Of the other religious foundations of the city, no remains
                    exist of St Gregory’s priory or St Sepulchre’s nunnery, but interesting parts
                    are left of the Grey or Franciscan Friars, the White or Augustinian, and the
                    Black or Dominican Friars (the latter the first friary of this order established
                    in England); also of the hospitals of St John, Northgate; St Nicholas,
                    Harbledown; St Thomas, Eastbridge; St Lawrence; and that of the Poor Priests,—of
                    which the first three still remain in use as almshouses. Of the fifteen parish
                    churches which exist the most remarkable is St Martin’s, the church frequented
                    by Bertha the queen of Ethelbert before Augustine’s arrival and thus the
                    earliest seat of English Christianity. In this church Ethelbert must have been
                    baptized, and the existing font has been supposed of that age; rude and archaic,
                    however, as it is, it is not earlier than a Norman date, though Saxon masonry
                    still exists in the church walls.</p>
                <p>Among the secular remains there are large portions of the city walls, mostly of
                    the 15th century, but connected in parts with an earthen bank of a very much
                    earlier date, and in one spot with a conical mound called the Dane-John or
                    Donjon, probably of Celtic origin. The Norman keep of the castle, one of Bishop
                    Gundulph’s works, still exists, but in a very mutilated condition, as well as a
                    fine gateway tower, the west gate of the city, built about the year 1380 by
                    Archbishop Sudbury. The Guild Hall is of old work, but has been refaced with
                    modern brick; and part remains of the Chequers Inn for pilgrims, built by Prior
                    Chillenden about the year 1400, and mentioned by Chaucer in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but much of this
                    was burnt down in 1865.</p>
                <p>There are slight remains also of the archbishop’s palace, built on the very
                    ground originally given by King Ethelbert before his conversion, and then known
                    as Staplegate; but the archbishops have ceased to reside in Canterbury since the
                    17th century.</p>
