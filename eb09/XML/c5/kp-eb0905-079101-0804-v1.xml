                <p><label type="entry">CIRCUS</label>, in Roman Antiquity, was a building for the
                    exhibition of horse and chariot racing. It consisted of tiers of seats running
                    parallel with the sides of the course, and forming a crescent round one of the
                    ends. The other end was straight and at right angles to the course, so that the
                    plan of the whole had nearly the form of an ellipse cut in half at its vertical
                    axis. Along the transverse axis ran a fence <hi rend="italic">(spina)</hi>
                    separating the return course from the starting one. The straight end had no
                    seats, but was occupied by the stalls <hi rend="italic">(carceres)</hi> where
                    the chariots and horses were held in readiness. This end constituted also the
                    front of the building with the main entrance. At each end of the course were
                    conical pillars <hi rend="italic">(metoe)</hi> to mark its limits.</p>
                <p>The oldest building of this kind in Rome was the <hi rend="smallcaps">Circus
                        Maximus,</hi> in the valley between the Palatine and Aventine hills, where
                    previous to any permanent structure races ap <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> pear
                    to have been held beside the altar of the god Consus. The first building is
                    assigned to Tarquin the younger, but for a long time little seems to have been
                    done to complete its accommodation, since it is not till 329 B.c. that we hear
                    of stalls being erected for the chariots and horses. It was not in fact till
                    under the empire that the circus became a conspicuous public resort. Caesar
                    enlarged it to some extent, and also made a canal 10 feet broad between the
                    lowest tier of seats and the course as a precaution for the spectators’ safety
                    when exhibitions of fighting with wild beasts, such as were afterwards confined
                    to the amphitheatre, took place. When these exhibitions were removed, and the
                    canal <hi rend="italic">(euripus)</hi> was no longer necessary, Nero filled it
                    up. Augustus is said to have placed an obelisk between the metae or goals, and
                    to have built a new <hi rend="italic">pulvinar,</hi> or state box; but if this
                    is taken in connection with the fact that the circus had been partially
                    destroyed by fire in 31 B.c., it may be supposed that besides this he had
                    restored it altogether. Only the lower tiers of seats were of stone, the others
                    being of wood, and this, from the liability to fire, may account for the
                    frequent restorations to which it was subject; it would also explain the falling
                    of the seats by which a crowd of people were killed in the time of Antoninus
                    Pius. In the reign of Claudius, apparently after a fire, the carceres of stone
                    (tufa) were replaced by marble, and the metoe of wood by bronze gilt. Under
                    Domitian, again, after a fire, the circus was rebuilt and the carceres increased
                    to 12 instead of 8 as before. The work was finished by Trajan. The number of
                    people it could seat is given at 150,000 and at 250,000, the latter being
                    supposed to be the more correct. This was the only public spectacle at which men
                    and women were not assigned to separate places. The lower seats were reserved
                    for persons of rank; the state box, <hi rend="italic">suggestus</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">cubiculum,</hi> was midway in the range of seats. The
                    principal object of attraction apart from the racing must have been the spina or
                    low wall which ran down the middle of the course, with its obelisks, images, and
                    ornamental shrines. On it also were seven figures of dolphins and seven oval
                    objects, one of which was taken down at every round made in a race, so that
                    spectators might see readily how the contest proceeded. The chariot race
                    consisted of seven rounds of the course. The chariots started abreast, but in an
                    oblique line, so that the outer chariot might ba compensated for the wider
                    circle it had to make at the other end. Such a race was called a <hi
                        rend="italic">missus,</hi> and as many as 24 of these would take place in a
                    day. The competitors <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0805-0792"/> wore different colours, originally white and
                    red <hi rend="italic">(albata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">russata)</hi>;
                    afterwards the colours green <hi rend="italic">(prasina)</hi> and blue <hi
                        rend="italic">(veneta)</hi> were added, and further, under Domitian, gold
                    and purple, but these last two were not long retained. To provide the horses and
                    large staff of attendants, it was necessary to apply to rich capitalists and
                    owners of studs, and from this there grew up in time four select companies <hi
                        rend="italic">(factiones)</hi> of circus purveyors which were identified
                    with the four colours, and with which those who organized the races had to
                    contract for the proper supply of horses and men. The drivers, who were mostly
                    slaves, were sometimes held in high repute for their skill. The horses most
                    valued were those of Sicily, Spain, and Cappadocia. Chariots with two horses <hi
                        rend="italic">(bigoe)</hi> or four <hi rend="italic">(quadrigae)</hi> were
                    most common, but sometimes also they had three <hi rend="italic">(trigae)</hi>
                    and exceptionally more than four horses. Occasionally there was combined with
                    the chariots a race of riders <hi rend="italic">(desultores),</hi> each rider
                    having two horses and leaping from one to the other during the race. At certain
                    of the races the proceedings were opened by a <hi rend="italic">pompa</hi> or
                    procession in which images of the gods and of the imperial family deified were
                    conveyed in cars drawn by horses, mules, or elephants, attended by the colleges
                    of priests, and led by the presiding magistrate seated in a chariot in the dress
                    and with the insignia of a triumphator. The procession passed from the capitol
                    along the forum, and on to the circus, where it was received by the people
                    standing and clapping their hands. The presiding magistrate gave the signal for
                    the races by throwing a white flag <hi rend="italic">(mappa)</hi> on to the
                    course. Next in importance to the Circus Maximus in Rome was the <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Circus</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Flaminius,</hi> erected 221
                    B.C., in the censorship of C. Flaminius, from whom it may have taken its name;
                    or the name may have been derived from Prata Flaminia, where it was situated,
                    and where also were held plebeian meetings. The only games that are positively
                    known to have been celebrated in this circus were the <hi rend="italic">Ludi
                        Taurii</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Plebeii.</hi> There is no mention of it
                    after the 1st century. Its ruins were identified in the 16th century at S.
                    Caterina de Funari and the Palazzo Mattei. A third circus in Rome was erected by
                    Caligula in the gardens of Agrippina, and was known as the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Circus</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Neronis,</hi> from the notoriety which it
                    obtained through the Circen sian pleasures of Nero. A fourth was constructed by
                    Maxentius outside the Porta Appia near the tomb of Caecilia Metella, where its
                    ruins are still, and now afford the only instance from which an idea of the
                    ancient circi in Rome can be obtained. It was traced to Caracalla, till the
                    discovery of an inscription showed it to be the work of Maxentius. Old
                    topographers speak of six circi, but two of these appear to be imaginary, the
                    Circus Florae and the Circus Salustii. There remain then the four described
                    above,—C. Maximus, Flaminius, Neronis, and Maxentii.</p>
                <p>Circus races were held in connection with the following public festivals, and
                    generally on the last day of the festival if it extended over more than one day
