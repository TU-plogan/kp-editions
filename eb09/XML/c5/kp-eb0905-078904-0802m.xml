                <p><label type="entry">CIRCUMCISION</label>. The importance of this rite is so
                    largely due to its quasi-sacramental character in Judaism, that any inquiry into
                    its history and meaning must be prefaced by a reference to the Old
                    Testament.</p>
                <p>I. There are three distinct narratives in the sacred literature of the Jews which
                    claim to be considered. It is related in Gen. xvii. that when Abram the Hebrew
                    was ninety-nine years of age, he became a party on behalf of himself and his
                    descendants to a covenant with his God. Of this covenant the sign and condition
                    was circumcision, which was directed to be performed (a peculiarity of Judaism)

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0803-0790"/> the eighth day after the child’s birth. Is this
                    account, we may ask, based on a historical tradition 1 If so, the circumcision
                    of the Israelites is entirely unconnected with that of other nations unless
                    indeed other nations have borrowed theirs from the Israelites. This has actually
                    been maintained in the case of the Egyptians by Archdeacon Hardwicke, but the
                    theory is not only improbable in itself, considering the imitative character of
                    the Israelites, and their low reputation in Egypt (Gen. xlvi. 34), but contrary
                    to the evidence of the Egyptian monuments (see below). If, as has been supposed
                    by some, the document to which Gen. xvii. belongs is of post-captivity origin,
                    this would put it out of court as a witness to the popular tradition of the
                    Hebrews. But there is another narrative, apparently of ∙ a more archaic
                    complexion, which leads to a directly opposite historical result. We read in
                    Exod. iv. 25, 26, that when Moses was returning from Midian to Egypt, he was in
                    danger of his life, owing to the neglect of the rite of circumcision in his
                    family. “And Zipporah,” his Midianitish wife, “took a sharp stone, and cut off
                    the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a <hi
                    rend="italic">khathan</hi> (Auth. Vers., ‘ husband ’) of blood art thou to me;
                    <hi rend="italic">so</hi> he (sc., the offended deity) desisted from him. At
                    that time she said, A <hi rend="italic">khathan</hi> of blood, with reference to
                    the circumcision.” The meaning of this story can still be discerned. <hi
                    rend="italic">Khathan,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">khatan,</hi> meant originally
                    not “husband” (as Auth. Vers, of Exodus), nor “son-in-law” (as in ordinary
                    Arabic), but “a newly-admitted member of the family.” This appears from the
                    sense of Arab, <hi rend="italic">khatana,</hi> “to provide a wedding-feast,” and
                    <hi rend="italic">khatana,</hi> “to give or receive a daughter in marriage.” So
                    that in the sense of the old Hebrew tradition, “a <hi rend="italic">khathan</hi>
                    of blood” meant “one who has become a <hi rend="italic">khathan,</hi> not by
                    marriage, but by circumcision,” a meaning which is still further confirmed by
                    the derived sense of Arab, <hi rend="italic">khatana</hi> “to circumcise,”
                    circumcision being performed in Arabia at the age of puberty. To sum up :—an
                    Arabian woman plays the chief part in the story, and her words are only
                    explicable from the Arabic; it is also far from improbable that Yahweh (or
                    Jehovah) was himself first made known to the Jews in Arabia (comp. Judg. v. 4,
                    Hab. iii. 3); putting all which together, we obtain a strong case for the
                    hypothesis of the Arabian origin of Jewish circumcision.</p>
                <p>The-third narrative is Josh. v. 2-9, where Joshua is said to have circumcised the
                    children of Israel a second time with “knives of stone,” and to have thus
                    “rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off them.” It is not unnatural that this
                    should have been used by some to confirm the view of an Egyptian origin of
                    circumcision, among others by Dr Ebers, who refers to the additional words in
                    the Septuagint, Josh, xxiv. 31, “There they buried with him the stone knives
                    with which he had circumcised the children of Israel in Gilgal.” But, first,
                    with regard to this singular statement of the Alexandrine version, it must
                    henceforth be abandoned by all scholars. It is simply an unscientific attempt to
                    account for the existence near Joshua’s supposed tomb of flint instruments, such
                    as those discovered by Μ. Guérin on this very site. It need hardly be added that
                    the flint instruments discovered by the French <hi rend="italic">savant</hi>
                    were really pre-historic; they consist not only of knives, but of saws, which
                    would hardly have been available for the purpose ascribed to Joshua (see Burton
                    and Drake’s <hi rend="italic">Unexplored Syria,</hi> ii. 295-300). And,
                    secondly, Bishop Colenso has shown some reason for the suspicion that verses 2
                    to 8 (not verse 9) are later additions to the narrative, in which case the
                    “reproach of Egypt” means, not the state of uncircumcision, but the contempt of
                    the Egyptians so forcibly expressed in Exod. xxxii. 12, Num. xiv. 13-16. As for
                    the “knives of stone” (comp. Josh, xxiv. 31, Sent.), on which Ebers has laid
                    some stress, such implements are not distinctively Egyptian, if they were even
                    employed at all by the Egyptians for the purpose of circumcision. It is true
                    that Herodotus (ii. 104, comp. Diod. Sic., i. 28) asserts the Egyptian origin of
                    circumcision to have been admitted in Palestine, but he is probably only right
                    so far as the Phoenicians or Canaanites are concerned.</p>
                <p>II. We may now proceed to consider circumcision from an ethnographical point of
                    view. It was not a specially Semitic rite, being only known to the southern and
                    western Semites, who probably derived it directly or indirectly from the
                    Egyptians, if not from some entirely non-Semitic source. Though not referred to
                    in the Koran, it was a primitive Arabian custom to circumcise youths at their
                    entrance on puberty (t.e., between their tenth and fifteenth year), as appears
                    not only from Gen. xvii. 25, Jos. <hi rend="italic">Antiq.,</hi> i. 12, 2, but
                    from the express statement of Ibn-al-Athír (quoted by Pococke, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Specimen Hist.</hi><hi rend="italic">Arabum,</hi> p. 319), which is confirmed
                    by a remarkable passage in the life of the old Arabian poet Dhû l-isba <hi
                    rend="italic">(Zeitschr. f. d. Kunde</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Morgenlandes,</hi> iii. 230). From Arabia it was carried by the preachers of
                    Islam to Persia, India, and Turkey; from Arabia, too, as we have seen, it
                    probably came in remote times to the Israelites. The circumcision of the
                    Phoenicians or Canaanites has been disputed, but is attested by Herodotus (ii.
                    104), and is confirmed by the story in Gen. xxxiv., as also by the fact that the
                    term of contempt, “the uncircumcised,” is reserved in the Old Testament for the
                    Philistines. The rite seems, however, to have fallen into disuse in later times
                    in Phoenicia as well as in Egypt (Dr Ebers refers to the uncircumcised figures
                    on the stele of Pianchi, comp, also Herod, <hi rend="italic">l.c.,</hi> Jos. <hi
                    rend="italic">Antiq.,</hi> viii. 10, 3, <hi rend="italic">Contr. Ap.</hi> i. 22,
                    and perhaps Ezek. xxxii. 24, 30), which may partly account for its being
                    afterwards regarded as distinctive of the Jews. The Egyptians, too, were
                    circumcised, and that prior to the immigration of the Hebrews (Wilkinson), as
                    appears from the representations on the very earliest monuments. The most
                    striking of these is the scene on a bas-relief discovered in the temple of
                    Chunsu at Karnak, a drawing of which is given by Μ. Chabas and Dr Ebers. The
                    subjects of the operation are apparently the two children of Rameses IL, the
                    founder of the temple. Their age, says Dr Ebers, must be between six and ten,
                    which agrees with the present custom in Egypt, where, as Mr Lane tells us,
                    circumcision is generally performed in the fifth or sixth year, though often
                    postponed by peasants to the twelfth, thirteenth, or even fourteenth year <hi
                    rend="italic">(Modern Egyptians,</hi> i. 71). It has often been asserted that
                    only the priests underwent the operation, but there is no earlier evidence for
                    this than that of Origen (ed. Lommatzsch, iv. 138), in whose time it is quite
                    possible that the Egyptians, like the later Jews, sought to evade a peculiarity
                    which exposed them to ridicule and contempt.</p>
                <p>But the rite of circumcision is known among nations which cannot be suspected of
                    communication with Egypt. Similar causes produce similar effects all the world
                    over. It was in use in some form among the ancient civilized peoples of Central
                    America, though this is better attested of the Nahua branch (including the
                    Aztecs) than of the Maya (Bancroft, <hi rend="italic">Native Races,</hi> vol.
                    iii.). It is still kept up among the Teamas and Manaos on the Amazon; also among
                    three distinct races in the South Seas, among most of the tribes of Australia,
                    among the Papuans, the New Caledonians, and the inhabitants of the New Hebrides.
                    It is widely spread in Africa, especially among the Kaffir tribes. Among the
                    Bechuanas the boys who are circumcised together form a sort of society, for
                    which among other reasons, Waitz conjectures that the Bechuanas communicated the
                    rite to the other Kaffirs. Prichard <hi rend="italic">(Physical</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n804/mode/1up"

                    287) rightly dismisses the idea that the Kaffirs borrowed the rite from
                    Mahometan nations, though the progress of Islam will help to account for its
                    prevalence in other parts of Africa.</p>
                <p>III. Very different views were held in antiquity as to the meaning of the rite of
                    circumcision. There was a myth common to Egypt and Phoenicia, though not of very
                    ancient &lt;late in its extant Egyptian form, which seems to bring circumcision
                    into connection with the Sun-god. In the <hi rend="italic">Book of ths
                    Dead,</hi> chap, xvii., we read of “the blood which proceeded from the limb of
                    the god Ra, when he wished to cut himself,” which the late Vicomte de Rougé
                    interpreted, with much plausibility, of circumcision <hi rend="italic">(Revue
                    archéologique,</hi> nouv. série, i. 244:). And in a fragment of the Philonian
                    Sanchoniathon <hi rend="italic">(Fragmenta Historicorum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Groecorum,</hi> ed. Müller, iii. 568, 569), we find a similar tale of El
                    circumcising his father Uranos, or, according to another version, himself, and
                    the blood flowing into the springs and rivers. Space forbids us to discuss the
                    bearings of this myth. Herodotus (it 37) ascribes the Egyptian custom to the
                    motive of cleanliness <hi rend="italic">(καθαριότητας</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >eινeκa).</hi> This is also one of the four causes reported on the authority of
                    tradition by Philo the Jew <hi rend="italic">(Opera,</hi> ed. Mangey, ii. 210),
                    the three others being the avoidance of carbuncle, the symbolizing of purity of
                    heart, and the attainment of a numerous offspring. Mere cleanliness, however,
                    seems hardly an adequate motive for the practice. Sanitary reasons seem much
                    more probable, judging from the well-ascertained physical advantages of
                    circumcision to the Jewish race. But even this is not a complete explanation.
                    Why was the practice adopted by some nations and not by others <hi rend="italic"
                    >ì</hi> The most scientific theory is that which refers it to a religious
                    instinct common to all nations, though not always expressing itself in the same
                    way, and this seems even to be at least obscurely indicated by the tradition of
                    the Israelities. The prophet Jeremiah (ix. 25, 26), too, puts it in the same
                    class with cutting off the hair (comp. Herod, iii. 8), which, like other bodily
                    mutilations, has been shown to be of the nature of a representative sacrifice
                    (Tylor ’ s <hi rend="italic">Primitive Culture,</hi> ii. 363, 364). The
                    principle of substitution was familiar to all ancient nations, and not least to
                    the Israelites. Witness the story of Gen.xxii.,tbe paschal lamb, and the
                    redemption of the first-born by an offering (Exod. xiii. 11-16), and compare the
                    singular phrase ascribed to Saul in 1 Sam. xviii. 25. On this principle
                    circumcision was an economical recognition of the divine ownership of human
                    life, a part of the body being sacrificed to preserve the remainder. But it was
                    more than this; otherwise it would scarcely have asserted its claim to existence
                    among the Jews, when all other mutilations were strictly forbidden as heathenish
                    (Lev. xix. 27, xxi. 5). It can scarcely be doubted that it was a sacrifice to
                    the awful power upon whom the fruit of the womb depended, and having once fixed
                    itself in the minds of the people, neither priest nor prophet could eradicate
                    it. All that these could do was to spiritualize it into a symbol of devotion to
                    a high religious ideal (comp. Jer. iv. 4; Deut. x. 16; Jer. ix. 25).</p>
                <p>In conclusion, we must briefly refer to an analogous rite, of which women are in
                    many countries the subjects. It is said to consist in mutilation of the
                    clitoris, which is sometimes connected with the degrading practice of
                    infibulation. It was prevalent in the time of Strabo (pp. 771, 824) in Arabia
                    and in Egypt, and, as Mr Lane attests, is still native to those regions <hi

                    de l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Arabis,</hi> p. 70). It appears in some parts of
                    West Africa, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Dahomey, but is said to be still more
                    common in the eastern part of that continent.</p>
