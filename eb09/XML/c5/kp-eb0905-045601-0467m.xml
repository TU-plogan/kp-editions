                    being only partially retractile, get blunted by exposure to the surface of the
                    ground, and so are less adapted to the purely feline mode of capturing prey. The
                    cheetah attains a length of 3 to 4 feet, is of a pale fulvous colour, marked
                    with numerous spots of a deep black on the upper surface and sides, and is
                    nearly white beneath. The fur is somewhat crisp, altogether lacking the
                    sleekness which characterizes the fur of the typical cats. Its tail is long and
                    somewhat bushy at the extremity. In confinement it soon becomes fond of those
                    who are kind to it, and gives evidence of its attachment in an open, dog-like
                    manner. According to Mr Bennet <hi rend="italic">(Tower Menageries)</hi> “the
                    character of the cheetah seems to be entirely free from that sly and suspicious
                    feeling of mistrust which is so strikingly visible iħ the manner and actions of
                    all the cats, and which renders them so little susceptible of real or lasting
                    attachment;” and it is the opinion of the same writer that the cheetah <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0468-0457"/> might be thoroughly domesticated and “rendered
                    nearly as familiar and faithful as the dog himself.” The cheetah is found
                    throughout Africa and Southern Asia, and has been employed for centuries in
                    India and Persia in hunting antelopes and other ruminant game. According to Sir
                    W. Jones, this mode of hunting originated with Hushing, king of Persia, 865
                    B.C., and afterwards became so popular that certain of the Mongol emperors were
                    in the habit of being accompanied in their sporting expeditions by a thousand
                    hunting leopards. In prosecuting this sport at the present day the cheetah is
                    conveyed to the field in a low car without sides, hooded and chained like
                    hunting-birds in Europe in the days of falconry. When a herd of deer or
                    antelopes is seen, the car, which bears a close resemblance to the ordinary
                    vehicles used by the peasants, is usually brought within 200 yards of the game
                    before the latter takes alarm; the cheetah is then let loose and the hood
                    removed from its eyes. No sooner does it see the herd, than dropping from the
                    car on the side remote from its prey, it approaches stealthily, making use of
                    whatever means of concealment the nature of the ground permits, until observed,
                    when making a few gigantic bounds, it generally arrives in the midst of the herd
                    and brings down its victim with a stroke of its paw. The sportsman then
                    approaches, draws off a bowl of the ruminant’s blood, and puts it before the
                    cheetah, which is again hooded and led back to the car. Should it not succeed in
                    reaching the herd in the first few bounds, it makes no further effort to pursue,
                    but retires seemingly dispirited to the car. In Africa the cheetah is only
                    valued for its skin, which is worn by chiefs and other people of rank. It forms
