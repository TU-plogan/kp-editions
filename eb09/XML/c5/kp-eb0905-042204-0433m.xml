                    Soon after he accompanied the king on a crusade, during which he fought with
                    bravery, but achieved no permanent success, and he was at last taken prisoner
                    with his brother. During his absence most of the towns of Provence formed
                    themselves into republics; but on his return they were quickly subdued, and,
                    among others, Marseilles lost the independence she had before enjoyed. Charles’s
                    power was now very considerable; but his ambition was far from being satisfied.
                    He therefore uns.crupulously lent his arms to Margaret of Flanders, who offered
                    him the province of Hainault in return for his assistance in setting aside her
                    husband’s children by a former wife in favour of her own; but this scheme was
                    crushed by Louis, who caused him to give up Hainault for a sum of money. Charles
                    had now, besides, conceived a loftier ambition. He had been requested to assume
                    the crown of the two Sicilies by Pope Urban IV., who desired to overthrow the
                    bastard Manfred, the Ghibelline king; and in 1265 he was crowned at Rome. A
                    crusade was preached against Manfred, who was defeated and slain. The legitimate
                    heir, Conradin, was also routed (1268), and being betrayed, was meanly tried and
                    executed; a similar fate befell a large number of Italian nobles; many fiefs
                    were confiscated to reward the French followers of the new king; and the rule of
                    the Provençale was often arbitrary and brutal. Charles’s ambition continued to
                    widen. He now designed to make himself the head of the Eastern empire. With this
                    end in view, he again accompanied his brother on a crusade; but the
                    accomplishment of his ultimate design was prevented by a terrible storm, and by
                    the outbreak of the plague. He also incurred the enmity of the Pope, Nicholas
                    HI., by haughtily refusing to accept the hand of his niece for his own grandson.
                    Nicholas joined the Ghibellines, and took from Charles, who offered no
                    resistance, his titles of senator of Rome and vicar-general of Italy. But in
                    1280 Nicholas died, and Charles, by means of many intrigues, and after
                    imprisoning two of the cardinals, effected the election of a Frenchman, Martin
                    IV. In return, he was made senator of Rome, and his rival, the Emperor Michael
                    Palaeologus, was excommunicated. Another expedition was already fitted out
                    against the East, when news was brought of the rebellion known as the Sicilian
                    Vespers. Aroused by the rough rule of the French, the people were also stirred
                    by the burning exhortations of John of Procida, a Calabrian doctor, formerly
                    friend of Frederick and of Manfred, who had been travelling in disguise through
                    Italy, Greece, and Spain, seeking assistance against the usurpation of Charles.
                    On Easter Monday, 1282, he collected a large assembly of the Sicilian nobles at
                    Palermo. An opportune pretext for a rising soon occurred. The viceroy had
                    forbidden the bearing of arms; and, on the pretext that weapons were concealed
                    under her dress, a Frenchman insulted a girl of noble family on her very passage
                    to the church where she was about to be married. He was killed on the spot, and
                    every Frenchman in the city soon shared his fate. Some of the other Sicilian
                    towns followed this example; others expelled the French more mildly. Charles at
                    once directed his fleet against Messina. He refused all offers of capitulation,
                    and Messina held out till aid was brought it by Don Pedro of Aragon, and
                    Charles’s fleet was burned by the famous sailor, Roger de Loria. Charles,
                    despairing of other means of success, now challenged Pedro to single combat.
                    Pedro accepted the challenge, but Charles alone entered the lists. It is said
                    that the former was dissatisfied with the arrangements, though others regard his
                    acceptance as a mere ruse. Soon after Charles’s son was defeated and taken
                    prisoner, and in 1285 Charles himself fell ill, and died at Foggia.</p>
