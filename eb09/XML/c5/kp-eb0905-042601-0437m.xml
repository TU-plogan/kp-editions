                    Chevalier St George. Grandson of James II. and nephew of Anne, he was heir of
                    line of both these sovereigns; but the hereditary rights of his father and
                    himself had been declared null under the Proclamation of Rights and other
                    parliamentary enactments which followed and completed the Revolution of
                    1688.</p>
                <p>The young prince was educated at Rome, his mother, by blood a Sobieski,
                    superintending his studies for some years. On the whole his education was good;
                    he became conversant with the French, Italian, and Latin languages, and his
                    religious training was watched with interest by the Pope. His father’s miniature
                    court was frequented by English and Scottish noblemen of Jacobite sympathies, by
                    foreign enemies of the house of Hanover, and by bigoted supporters of the Romish
                    faith; and the influence of this society is distinctly evident upon his after
                    life. In 1734, the duke of Livia, afterwards duke of Berwick, who was proceeding
                    to join Don Carlos in his struggle for the crown of Naples, passed through Rome.
                    He offered to the Pretender to take charge of his son, should Charles be willing
                    to accompany him in his expedition. This offer was accepted, and the youth of
                    fourteen, having been appointed general of artillery by Don Carlos, shared with
                    credit the dangers of the successful siege of Gaeta.</p>
                <p>The handsome and accomplished youth, whose doings were eagerly reported by the
                    English ambassador, was now introduced by his father and the Pope to the highest
                    Italian society, which he fascinated by the frankness of his manner and the
                    grace and dignity of his bearing. To these, more than to any power of his mind
                    or heroism of his career, are to be attributed the successes of his early life.
                    James despatched his son on a tour through the chief Italian cities, that his
                    education as a prince and man of the world might be completed. The distinction
                    with which he was received on his journey, the royal honours paid to him in
                    Venice, and the jealous interference of the English ambassador in regard to his
                    reception by the Grand Duke of Tuscany, show how great was the respect in which
                    the exiled house was held by foreign Catholic powers, as well as the watchful
                    policy of England in regard to its fortunes.</p>
                <p>The Pretender himself calculated upon foreign aid in his attempts to restore the
                    monarchy of the Stuarts; and the idea of rebellion unassisted by invasion or by
                    support of any kind from abroad was one which it was left for Charles Edward to
                    endeavour to realize. Of all the European nations France was the one on which
                    Jacobite hopes mainly rested, and the keen sympathy which Cardinal Tenein, who
                    had succeeded Fleury as French minister of war, felt for the Pretender resulted
                    in a definite arrangement for an invasion of England to be timed simultaneously
                    with a pre-arranged Scottish rebellion. Charles was secretly despatched to
                    Paris. A squadron under Admiral Roquefeuillβ sailed from the coast of France.
                    Transports containing 7000 troops, to be led by Marshal Saxe, accompanied by the
                    young prince, set sail for England. The sight of the English fleet and a severe
                    storm effected, however, a complete disaster without any actual engagement
                    having taken place. The loss in ships of the line, in transports, and in lives
                    was a crushing blow to the hopes of Charles, who remained in France in a
                    retirement which he keenly felt, and which he resolved to quit by a personal
                    visit to Scotland.</p>
                <p>He had at Rome made the acquaintance of Lord Elcho and of Murray of Broughton; at
                    Paris he had seen many supporters of the Stuart cause; he was aware that in
                    every European court the Jacobites were represented in earnest intrigue; and he
                    had now taken a considerable share in correspondence and other actual work
                    connected with the promotion of his own and his father’s interests. Although
                    dissuaded by every friend he had, he, on 13th July 1745, sailed for Scotland on
                    board the small brig “La Doutelle,” which was accompanied by a French
                    man-of-war, “The Elizabeth,” laden with arms and ammunition. “The Elizabeth”
                    fell in with an English man-of-war and had to return to France, while Charles
                    escaped during the engagement, and at length arrived on the 2d of August off
                    Erisca, a little island of the Hebrides. Receiving, however, but a cool
                    reception from Macdonald of Boisdale, he set sail again and arrived at the bay
                    of Lochnahuagh, on the west coast of Inverness-shire.</p>
                <p>The Macdonalds of Clanranald and Kinloch Moidart, along with other chieftains,
                    again attempted to dissuade him from the rashness of an unaided rising, but they
                    yielded at last to the enthusiasm of his manner, and Charles landed on Scottish
                    soil in the company of the “Seven Men of Moidart,” who had come with him from
                    France. Everywhere, however, he met with discouragement among the chiefs, whose
                    adherence he wished to secure; but at last, by enlisting the support of Cameron
                    of Lochiel, he gained a footing for more than a miniature rebellion. With
                    secrecy and speed communications were entered into with the known leaders of the
                    Highland tribes, and on the 19th of August, in the valley of Glenfinnan, the
                    standard of James III. and VIII. was raised in the midst of a motley but
                    increasing crowd.</p>
                <p>On the same day Sir John Cope, at the head of 1500 men, left Edinburgh in search
                    of Charles; but, fearing an attack in the Pass of the Corryarrick, he changed
                    his proposed route to Inverness, and Charles thus had the undefended south
                    country before him. In the beginning of September he entered Perth, having
                    gained numerous accessions to his forces on his march. Passing through Dunblane,
                    Stirling, Falkirk, and Linlithgow he arrived within a few miles of the
                    astonished metropolis, and on the 16th of September a body of his skirmishers
                    defeated the dragoons of Colonel Gardiner in what was known as the “Canter of
                    Coltbrig.” His success was still further augmented by his being enabled to enter
                    the city, a few of Cameron’s Highlanders having on the following morning, by a
                    happy ruse, secured the Netherbow Port. On the 18th he occupied Holyrood.</p>
                <p>Cope had by this time brought his disappointed forces by sea to Dunbar. On the
                    20th Charles met and defeated him at Prestonpans, and returned to prosecute the
                    siege of Edinburgh Castle, which, however, he raised on General Guest’s
                    threatening to lay the city in ruins. In the beginning of November Charles left
                    Edinburgh never to return. He was at the head of at least 6000 men; but the
                    ranks were speedily thinned by the desertion of Highlanders, whose experience
                    had led them to consider war merely as a raid and an immediate return with
                    plunder. Having passed through Kelso, he, on the 9th November, laid siege to
                    Carlisle, which capitulated in a week. On the 4th of December he had reached
                    Derby and was within, two days’ march of London, whose inhabitants were
                    terror-struck, and where a commercial panic immediately ensue&lt;L Two armies

                    had evaded by entering England from the west, and the other under the duke of
                    Cumberland, who had returned from the Continent. London was not to be supposed
                    helpless in such an emergency; Manchester, Glasgow, and Dumfries, rid of his
                    presence, had risen against him, and Charles paused. There was division among
                    his advisers and desertion among his men, and on the 6th of December he
                    commenced his retreat</p>
                <p>Closely pursued by Cumberland, he marched across the border, and at last stopped
                    to lay siege to Stirling. At Falkirk, on the 17th of January 1746, he defeated
                    General Hawley, who had marched from Edinburgh to intercept his retreat. A
                    fortnight later, however, Charles raised the siege of Stirling, and after a
                    weary though successful march, rested his troops at Inverness. Having taken
                    Forts George and Augustus, and had varying success against the supporters of the
                    Government in the north, he at last prepared to face the duke of Cumberland, who
                    had passed the early spring at Aberdeen. On the 8th of April the duke marched
                    thence to meet Charles, whose little army, exhausted with a futile night march,
                    half-starving, and broken by desertion, he engaged at Culloden on 16th April
                    1746. The decisive and cruel defeat sealed the fate of Charles Edward and the
                    house of Stuart.</p>
                <p>Charles fled. Accompanied by the faithful Ned Burke, and a few other followers,
                    he gained the western coast. Hunted hither and thither, the prince wandered on
                    foot or cruised restlessly in open boats among the many islands of the west. The
                    barren Benbecula sheltered him for a month. In lack of food, unsightly in
                    appearance, having a strange contentment under his misfortunes, and already
                    betraying his weakness for liquor, Charles, upon whose head a price of £30,000
                    had a year before been set, was relentlessly pursued by the spies of the
                    Government. Disguised in women’s clothes, and aided by a passport obtained by
                    the devoted Flora MacDonald, he passed through Skye, and parted from his
                    conductress at Portree. Shortly afterwards he was again on the mainland, and in
                    the end of July he took refuge with the “Seven men of Glenmoriston,” a body of
                    outlawed Jacobite freebooters, with whom for a time he was safe. Having joined
                    Lochiel and Cluny Macpherson, he at last heard that two French ships were in
                    waiting for him at the place of his first arrival in Scotland—Lochnahuagh.</p>
                <p>He embarked with speed, and sailed for France. Erelong he was again intriguing in
                    Paris, and even in Madrid. So far as political assistance went his efforts were
                    in vain; and he plunged eagerly into the gaieties of Parisian society, of which
                    he was the hero for some years.</p>
                <p>The enmity of the English Government to Charles Edward made peace with France an
                    impossibility, so long as she continued to harbour the young prince. A condition
                    of the treaty of Aix-la-ChapeŬe, concluded in October 1748, was that every
                    member of the house of Stuart should be expelled the French dominions. Charles
                    had forestalled the proclamation of the treaty by an indignant protest against
                    its injustice, and a declaration that he would not be bound by its provisions.
                    But his indignation and persistent refusal to comply with the request that he
                    should voluntarily leave France had to be met at last with force; he was
                    apprehended, imprisoned for a week at Vincennes, and on the 17th December
                    conducted to the French border. He lingered at Avignon; but the French,
                    compelled to hard measures by the English, refused to be satisfied; and the
                    Pope, under threat of a bombardment of Civita Vecchia, advised the prince to
                    withdraw. Charles simply and quietly disappeared; and for years Europe watched
                    for him in vain. It is now established, almost with certainty, that he returned
                    to the neighbourhood of</p>
                <p>Paris; and it is supposed that his residence was known to the French ministers,
                    who, however, firmly proclaimed their ignorance. In 1750, in 1752, and again, it
                    is thought, in 1754, he was even in London, hatching futile plots and risking
                    his safety for his hopeless cause.</p>
                <p>During the next ten years of his life Charles Edward had become a confirmed
                    profligate. His illicit connection with a Miss Walkenshaw, whom he had first met
                    at Bannockburn House while conducting the siege of Stirling, his imperious
                    fretful temper, his drunken habits and debauched life, could no longer be
                    concealed. He wandered over Europe in disguise, alienating the friends and
                    crushing the hopes of his party; and in 1766, on the death of his father, he was
                    treated even by the Pope with contempt, and his title as heir to the British
                    throne was openly repudiated by the great powers.</p>
                <p>It was in 1772 that France, still intriguing against England, arranged that
                    Louise, Princess of Stolberg, should marry the besotted prince (now passing
                    under the title of Count Albany) who twelve years before had so cruelly
                    maltreated his paramour that she had left him for ever. Six years afterwards,
                    however, the countess had to take refuge in a convent. Her husband’s conduct was
                    brutal, and her own life was in danger at his hands. Her suspected attachment to
                    Alfieri the poet and the persistent complaints of the prince at last brought
                    about a formal separation, and Charles Edward, lonely, ill, and evidently near
                    death, remained at Florence. In remorse he wrote for his daughter, the child of
                    Miss Walkenshaw, and she remained with him, under the name of duchess of Albany,
                    during the last two years of his life. He died at Rome on the 31st of January
                    1788, and was buried in the <hi rend="italic">Grotte</hi><hi rend="italic"
