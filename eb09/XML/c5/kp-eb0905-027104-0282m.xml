                    school at Hackney, and afterwards went to Cambridge. Probably his taste for
                    experimental research was mainly acquired from his father, who gave some
                    attention to meteorological observations, and whose very accurate determination
                    of the depression of mercury in barometrical tubes has formed the basis of some
                    of the most refined investigations of modern times. The morbid sensibility of
                    his nature, which led him to shrink from society, would also have an influence
                    in determining his choice of a scientific life; and he was free to follow his
                    bent, as his allowance from his father was amply sufficient for his wants, and a
                    large inheritance left him by one of his uncles put him in possession of
                    abundant means for prosecuting his scientific investigations. In the latter part
                    of his life, indeed, he was not less famed in his country for the great
                    accumulation of his property than for his intellectual and scientific treasures.
                    His merits in science were more generally understood on the Continent; and he
                    was made, though not till he had passed the age of seventy, one of the eight
                    foreign associates of the Institute of France. He resided principally at Clapham
                    Common, but his library was latterly at his house in Bedford Square; and after
                    the death of his librarian, he appointed a day on which he attended in person to
                    lend any work to such men of letters as were either personally known to him or
                    recommended by his friends. So methodical was he that he never took down a book
                    for his own use without entering it in the loan book. In 1760 he became a member
                    of the Royal Society. He was constantly present at the meetings of the society,
                    as well as at the conversations held at the house of the president; and he dined
                    every Thursday with the club composed of its members. Otherwise he had little
                    intercourse with society, even with his own family. He saw only once a year the
                    person whom he had made his principal heir. His dinner was ordered daily by a
                    note placed on the hall table, and his female domestics had orders to keep out
                    of his sight on pain of dismissal. His person was tall and rather thin; his
                    dress was singularly uniform, although sometimes a little neglected. He had a
                    slight hesitation in his speech, and an air of timidity and reserve that was
                    almost ludicrous. He died unmarried on the 24th of February 1810, leaving a
                    property in the funds of about £700,000, and a landed estate of £6000 a year.
                    Some of his warmest admirers have expressed regret that no portion of that vast
                    wealth was appropriated to scientific objects.</p>
                <p>For almost fifty years after Cavendish became a member of the Royal Society, he
                    continued to contribute to the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi>
                    some of the most interesting and important papers that have appeared in that
                    collection; in which the precision of experimental demonstration, no <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n283/mode/1up"

                    communicated, has been thought to have aided the further progress of chemical
                    discovery. He may almost be called the founder of pneumatic chemistry, which had
                    barely an existence when he began his researches. In a series of “Three papers,
                    containing Experiments on Factitious Air,” <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans,</hi>
                    1766, p. 141, he describes the apparatus used in processes of this kind, which
                    he had improved by the occasional employment of mercury. By weighing a bladder
                    filled with a known bulk of inflammable air (hydrogen), and then in a state of
                    collapse, and by examining the loss of weight during the solution of zinc in an
                    acid, he found the specific gravity of inflammable air to be about -j⅛th of that
                    of common air, a discovery which led to balloon experiments and projects for
                    aerial navigation. He also observed that the gas obtained during the solution of
                    copper in muriatic acid was rapidly absorbed by water, but did not inquire
                    further into its nature. The second paper refers to fixed air (carbonic acid),
                    which was found to undergo no alteration in its elasticity when kept a year over
                    mercury, to be absorbed by an equal bulk of water or of olive oil, and by less
                    than half its bulk of spirit of wine, to exceed the atmospheric air in specific
                    gravity by more than one-half, and to render it unfit for sipporting combustion
                    even when added to it in the proportion of only 1 to 9. In the third part, the
                    air produced by fermentation and putrefaction is examined, and is shown to be
                    identical with the fixed air obtained from marble. It is also shown that the
                    inflammable air emitted during putrefaction resembles that which is procured
                    from zinc, although it appears to be a little heavier.</p>
                <p>A paper on “Experiments on Air,” <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1784, p.
                    119, contains an account of two of the greatest discoveries that have ever been
                    made in chemistry,—the composition of water, and that of nitric acid. Cavendish
                    first establishes the radical difference of hydrogen from nitrogen, and then
                    relates his experiments on the combustion of hydrogen with oxygen, which had
                    partly been suggested by an observation of Mr Waltire, a lecturer on natural
                    philosophy, and which prove that pure water is the result of the process,
                    provided that no nitrogen be present. The second series of experiments shows
                    that when phlogisticated air (nitrogen) is present in the process, some nitric
                    acid is produced, and that this acid may be obtained from atmospheric air, by
                    the repeated operation of the electrical spark. In another paper on “Experiments
                    on Air,” <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1785, p. 372, the composition of
                    nitric acid is further established, and it is shown that nearly the whole of the
                    irrespirable part of the atmosphere is convertible into this acid, when it is
                    mixed with oxygen and an electric spark is passed through the mixture,—the fixed
                    air sometimes obtained being due to the presence of organic substances.</p>
                <p>Besides the above, Cavendish contributed a number of other papers to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi> In an “Account of a New
                    Eudiometer,” <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1783, p. 106, he attributes
                    the great difference in the results of eudiometrical experiments with nitrous
                    gas, or nitric oxide, to the different degrees of oxygenization of the acid that
                    is formed. But he found that when the method employed was the same, there was no
                    sensible difference in the constituent parts of the atmosphere under
                    circumstances the most dissimilar.—the air of London, with all its fires burning
                    in the winter, appearing as pure as the freshest breezes of the country. In “An
                    Attempt to explain some of the principal Phenomena of Electricity by means of an
                    Elastic Fluid,” <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans,</hi> 1771, p. 584, his theory of
                    electricity agrees with that which had been published a few years before by
                    Aepinus, but he has entered more minutely into the details of calculation. The
                    law of electric attraction and repulsion had not at that time been fully
                    ascertained, but Cavendish inclines to the true supposition, of forces varying
                    inversely as the square of the distance. In his “Observations on Mr Hutchin’s
                    Experiments for determining the degree of cold at which quicksilver freezes,”
                    <hi rend="italic">Phd. Trans.,</hi> 1783, p. 303, he denied to heat the
                    character of a substance, and. thought “Sir Isaac Newton’s opinion, that heat
                    consists in the internal motion of the particles of bodies, much the most
                    probable,”—a view which it was one of the first of Sir Humphrey Davy’s objects
                    to confirm. The apparatus which Cavendish employed in his “Experiments to
                    determine the density of the Earth,” <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1798,
                    p. 469, had been invented and constructed many years before by the Rev. John
                    Michell, who did not live to perform the experiments for which he intended it.
                    The method employed was to suspend by a vertical wire a horizontal bar, having a
                    leaden weight at each end; to determine the magnitude of the force of torsion by
                    the time occupied in the lateral vibrations of the bar; and to measure the
                    extent of the change produced in its situation by the attraction of two large
                    masses of lead placed on opposite sides of the case containing the apparatus, so
                    that this attraction might be compared with the weight of the balls, or, in
                    other words, with the attraction of the earth. In this manner the mean density
                    of the earth was found to be five and a half times as great as that of
                    water.</p>
                <p>There has been some difference of opinion as to the attitude of Cavendish towards
                    the antiphlogistic theory of Lavoisier. Cavendish by no means dissented from the
                    whole of that theory. In the “Experiments on Air,” <hi rend="italic">Phil.
                    Trans.,</hi> 1784, he quotes Lavoisier and Scheele with approbation, as having
                    suggested the opinion “that dephlogisticated air and ρhlogisticated air are
                    quite distinct substances, and that common air is a mixture of the two.”
                    Afterwards he says that “not only the foregoing experiments, but most other
                    phenomena of nature, seem explicable as well, or nearly as well, upon this as
                    upon the commonly believed principle of phlogiston.” Μ. Cuvier has even asserted
                    that the antiphlogistic theory derived its first origin from one great discovery
                    of Cavendish, that of the nature of hydrogen, and owed its complete
                    establishment to another, that of the composition of water.</p>
                <p>Cavendish possessed a clearness of comprehension, and an acuteness of reasoning,
                    which had been the lot of very few of his predecessors from the days of Newton.
                    The splendid career of chemical investigation, which has since been pursued with
                    a degree of success unprecedented in history, may be said to have been first
                    laid open to mankind by his labours.</p>
