                    by Shropshire and Denbighshire, on the W. by Flintshire, and on the N.W. by the
                    Irish Sea. Its greatest length from east to west is about 48 miles, and its
                    greatest breadth from south to north about 33 miles. It possesses an area of
                    705,493 statute acres, or 1102 square miles; and its population in 1871 was
                    561,201 persons (males, 271,033; females, 290,168). Since the first census in
                    1801, the population has increased by 368,396 persons, or 191 per cent, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n600/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0600-0589"/> since 1851 the increase has amounted to 105,476
                    persons, or 23 per cent, in twenty years.</p>
                <p>The formation of the county is generally flat, with some hills on the east on the
                    Derbyshire and Yorkshire boundary, which extend also to the Staffordshire side.
                    There are also lower hills near Chester and Flintshire, and at Alderley Edge and
                    Beeston insulated hills standing up out of the prevailing level. The principal
                    geological formation is the New Red Sandstone, which occupies nearly the whole
                    of the central and western part of the county. A small patch of lias occurs in
                    the south. The Coal Measures extend along the eastern side on the borders of
                    Staffordshire and Derbyshire, and also are worked on the banks of the Dee below
                    Chester. The principal mineral produce is salt, which is found as rock-salt in
                    mines at Northwich, and is manufactured there and at Winsford, Middlewich,
                    Sandbach, and Lawton, from the brine-springs overlying the rocksalt. Lead and
                    copper are also found, though not in great quantities. Copper was worked at
                    Alderley Edge at an early period, but the works were discontinued until lately,
                    when they have been recommenced.</p>
                <p>The flora of the central plain of Cheshire, which represents its most
                    characteristic vegetation, is intermediate between that of the northern and
                    southern counties of Britain. The botany of the high-lands east of Macclesfield
                    is nearly ericetal in its nature, akin to that of the West Riding of Yorkshire,
                    whilst in the west the botany of Wirral shows more variety than that of the
                    Midland region, and is more southern in its character. The curious system of
                    marl-pits, and the frequent inland meres, each of which has a vegetation of its
                    own, render Mid Cheshire pre-eminent among English counties for the development
                    of such species as Carex and Potamogeton. Two rare species may be cited to prove
                    the strong admixture of northern elements in the flora, viz., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arundo stricta</hi> at Oakmere and <hi rend="italic">Saxifraga Hirculus,</hi>
                    now unfortunately extinct, at Knutsford. As compared with one near or south of
                    London, a Cheshire arable field shows a lamentable paucity of species. A
                    botanist would only in a day’s walk mark 150 species of flowering plants, as
                    against 300 species marked in the same time in Kent or Sussex.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers in Cheshire are the Dee, which, rising in the Welsh
                    mountains, forms the boundary between the county and Denbighshire and
                    Flintshire, and ultimately, having formed a wide navigable estuary below
                    Chester, falls into the Irish Sea; the Mersey, which rises in the Yorkshire
                    hills, forms the county boundary along the whole of its northern side, and
                    having given the opportunity for the formation of the ports of Liverpool,
                    Birkenhead, and Runcorn, also fall into the Irish Sea; and the Weaver, which,
                    rising in the south-west of the county, traverses it in a north-westerly course,
                    and being joined by the Dane at Northwich, empties itself into the Mersey at
                    Weston Point. By means of a series of locks, the Weaver has been made navigable
                    for vessels of 200 tons as far as Winsford, and thus furnishes a means of
                    transportation for the salt produced in the locality. The profits of the
                    navigation, which was originally undertaken by a few Cheshire squires, belong to
                    the county, and are paid over annually to the relief of the county rates. At
                    present, in consequence of a large outlay in further deepening and improving the
                    navigation, all payments to the county treasury are suspended, but on an average
                    of late years from £16,000 to £20,000 has been paid over.</p>
                <p>Distributed over the surface of the county are small lakes or meres, and it seems
                    to have been a point of honour for the old houses of the gentry to have been
                    built on their banks. Combermere, Tatton, Rostherne, Tabley, Doddington,
                    Marbury, and Mere, with a host of smaller waters, are dotted over the county:
                    whilst nearly in every field are old marl-pits, whence in former days the sole
                    supply of manure for the permanent pastures was obtained.</p>
                <p>The climate is temperate and damp; the soil is varied and irregular, but a large
                    proportion of it is a thin-skinned clay. In only one spot of the county is the
                    soil said to be fertile enough to feed a bullock to the acre. The agriculture of
                    the county, which some twenty-five years ago was backward and discreditable, has
                    marvellously improved in the last quarter of the century. The land, which was
                    wet and full of rushes, has been drained; its fertility has been increased by
                    the periodical application of bone-dust; the old crooked fences have been
                    removed or straightened; and the farm-houses and buildings, which were
                    insufficient for the decent accommodation of man and beast, have been replaced
                    on many estates by modern structures well adapted for their purposes.
                    Dairy-farming is the description of agriculture still principally pursued, and
                    in March 1875 there were, according to the Board of Trade returns, 96,170 cows
                    in the county, whose milk if all converted into cheese would have yielded a
                    produce of about 16,000 tons of cheese. But though the tendency to make cheese
                    in some parts of the county still prevails, the influence of the larger
                    population gathered together round the purely agricultural part of the county
                    has greatly diminished the production of the staple article, whilst the
                    competition of American cheese has made the manufacture of all but the best
                    qualities unprofitable. Liverpool, Manchester, Stockport, Macclesfield, the
                    cotton districts in the north-east of the county, and the Staffordshire
                    Potteries on the south-west, all demand a supply of milk, meat, and garden
                    produce, and the facilities of transit afforded by the railways have in many
                    cases already changed, and gradually in many more will change, the character of
                    Cheshire agriculture. Although in some cases the Cheshire tenant-farmer is
                    little more than a labourer owning cows, working as hard as his own labourers,
                    and with as little or less education, yet there are now a large number of farms
                    as well and skilfully cultivated and producing as large produce to the acre
                    (thanks to the facilities of obtaining manure from the larger towns) as any in
                    the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>During the years 1865 and 1866 a mighty calamity swept over this county. The
                    cattle plague, which had in 1745 destroyed 30,000 head of cattle, appeared in
                    the second week of October 1865 on the southern border of the county. Spreading
                    itself there, and breaking out almost simultaneously on the north-west, west,
                    and east, it had by the 21st February 1866 destroyed 36,823 head of stock. On
                    that day an Act of Parliament was passed to authorize slaughter and to give
                    compensation, and in consequence 35,675 cattle were killed. A loan was granted
                    from the Treasury, on the security of the county rate, of £270,000 to pay the
                    compensation for losses after the 22d February, which entails an annual charge
                    on the county rates of £14,583, 14s. lOd. until the year 1896. Although by this
                    terrible loss many individuals were ruined, and for the time great distress was
                    caused, yet on the whole the agriculture of the district was benefited.
                    Landlords discovered that stringent clauses in their leases might safely be
                    modified; tenant-farmers became convinced that cheesemaking was not the whole
                    duty of the agriculturist, and the possibility and even the necessity of new
                    ways of farming, and of the introduction of sheep or feeding-stock, became
                    apparent.</p>
                <p>From the agricultural returns for 1875 (which, however, are not complete) it
                    appears that the average acreage devoted in Cheshire to corn crops is
                    exceptionally low, being 16 ’ 2, while the average of all England is 31 <hi

                <p>In the latter year there were 84,981 acres under corn crops, and 31,686 under
                    green crops, both showing a decrease as compared with 1872.</p>
                <p>The county is intersected by railways in every direction. At Crewe the London and
                    North-Western Railway divides into three sections, and takes its passengers or
                    goods to Manchester, Liverpool, Chester, and the North. From Stockport and
                    Manchester the Cheshire lines run into the centre of the county and across
                    Delamere Forest to Chester; and there are lines from Chester to Birkenhead, to
                    Manchester, to Shrewsbury, and into the different parts of North and South
                    Wales.</p>
                <p>The canals, too, still convey goods from Runcorn and Ellesmere-port to the
                    Staffordshire potteries, and afford means of communication between Manchester,
                    Liverpool, and the interior of the county.</p>
                <p>The principal towns are Chester, Birkenhead, Macclesfield, Stockport, Northwich,
                    Crewe, and Congleton. At Stockport the manufacture of hats and cotton is carried
                    on, and Macclesfield and Congleton are the seats of the silk manufacture. At
                    Crewe are situated the great workshops of the London and North Western Railway,
                    and round the station, where in 1841 there was a wooden box to take the tickets
                    and one solitary farmhouse, there is now crowded a population of nearly 30,000
                    inhabitants. The trade of Northwich and Winsford is the manufacture of salt, by
                    the evaporation of the water from the brine. During the year 1875 it is
                    calculated that 1,500,000 tons of salt were produced, of which 1,000,000 were
                    for export, 350,000 for chemical works, 100,000 for agricultural purposes, and
                    50,000 for domestic use. In that year there were in Cheshire 1261 salt-pans,
                    employing over 3000 men. About 150 men are engaged in rock-salt mining, and the
                    carriage of salt on the Mersey and Weaver employs at least 1000 men and 500
                    boys. Steamers are now largely employed in the inland navigation, between thirty
                    and forty being engaged in the carrying trade.</p>
                <p>Besides being in part a manufacturing and in part a purely agricultural county,
                    Cheshire, more perhaps than any place except the districts round the metropolis,
                    is the home of business men. The manufacturers of Manchester, the merchants of
                    Liverpool, the gentlemen employed in the pottery trade, all have their villas
                    here. At Alderley and Bowdon near Manchester, in the Wirrall hundred on the
                    banks of the Mersey, at Alsager on the Staffordshire border, are to be found
                    congeries of the dwellings of rich men, which vie in their appointments and
                    surroundings with the houses of the great landowners of the county. Perhaps no
                    stronger proof can be given of this fact than that, in the return lately
                    furnished to the House of Commons of a summary of the returns of owners of land,
                    the number of properties between 1 acre and 10 is reported to be 3166 out of a
                    total number of 23,720, add the average rental per acre is £24, 13s. These
                    proportions are in the whole return for England and Wales exceeded only in the
                    ex-metropolitan parts of Surrey and Middlesex, and in the mining and
                    manufacturing counties of Lancashire and Glamorganshire.</p>
                <p>Cheshire is emphatically a county full of large estates. In the return just
                    quoted may be found the fact that the rental of estates between 5000 and 10,000
                    acres amount to 20 ’ 4 of the total value of the county, a larger percentage
                    than in any English county save one. Of the owners of more than 10,000 acres
                    Lord Tollemache of Helmingham owns 25,380; the marquis of Cholmondeley, 16,842;
                    the duke of Westminster, 15,001; Sir Henry Delves Broughton, 13,832; the Rev. T.
                    France Hayhurst, 10,650; and Lord Crewe, 10,148; whilst Lord Egerton of Tatton,
                    Lord Harrington, Lord Stamford and Warrington, Lord Derby, Sir P. D. Μ, Grey
                    Egerton, Lord Haddington, Lord De Tabley, Lord Delamere, Lord Stanley of
                    Alderley, Lord Kilmorey, Lord Shrewsbury, Mr Legh of Lyme, Mr Leigh of
                    Adlington, Mr R. E. Warburton, Sir Charles Shakerley, and Mr Bromley Davenport
                    make up the seventeen who are returned as owning between 5000 and 10,000 acres
                    each. This list of landowners is composed of men whose names, with one
                    exception, are historic in Cheshire, so small, spite of the neighbourhood of
                    Liverpool and Manchester, have been the transfers of the large estates from
                    their original owners to the capitalists of the present day.</p>
                <p>For parliamentary representation the county is divided into East, West, and Mid
                    Cheshire, each of the three sections returning two members to the House of
                    Commons. In East Cheshire the registered electors in 1876 were 6,587; in Mid
                    Cheshire, 8241; and in West Cheshire, 10,178. There are besides represented
                    within the county the boroughs of Macclesfield and Birkenhead, part of the city
                    of Chester, the limits of which extend into Wales, and parts of the boroughs of
                    Warrington, Stockport, Ashton-under-Lyne, and Stalybridge, all of which extend
                    more or less into Lancashire. There is one court of quarter sessions in the
                    county, which holds its meetings alternately at Chester and Knutsford, and is
                    adjourned from one place to the other for the trial of prisoners at intermediate
                    sessions. The rateable value of the county as assessed to the county rates is
                    £2,690,701.</p>
                <p>Perhaps no county has advanced more in material prosperity than Cheshire has in
                    the last half-century. In none have more places of public worship, both of the
                    Church of England and of the various Nonconformist bodies, been erected. In none
                    have more schools been built. The wages of the agricultural labourers are high;
                    and from the ranks of that body has the army of engineers, porters, and
                    high-class artificers, who are employed in the manufacturing districts and at
                    Crewe, been largely recruited. Yet still the county is cursed with the sin of
                    drunkenness, and with the evil consequences of that sin, in a fearful degree.
                    Whilst serious crime has decreased steadily there has been an increase of all
                    the light offences.</p>
                <p>The history of Cheshire is intimately connected with that of the city of Chester.
                    In the time of King Alfred the present county formed part of the province of
                    Mercia, but it was afterwards separated, and by William the Conqueror it was
                    constituted a county-palatine. William bestowed the earldom on his nephew Hugo
                    Lupus, and the title has belonged since then to the heir-apparent of the English
                    Crown. The palatinate privileges existed intact until the reign of Henry VIII.,
                    when they were much curtailed in favour of the Crown, and after the Civil War of
                    the Commonwealth they were almost wholly removed. The county was first
                    represented in Parliament during the reign of Edward VI.</p>
                <p>Two Roman roads traversed Cheshire, the north-west branch of Watling Street,
                    running from Chester through Northwicb to Stratford, where it crossed the Mersey
                    into Lancashire, and the Via Devana which entered from Salop and extended to
                    Chester. Many handsome and interesting mansions exist in the county, some of
                    them being admirable specimens of Elizabethan architecture. Among the most
                    noteworthy may be mentioned Bramall Hall near Stockport, Brereton Hall near
                    Sandbach, Crewe Hall, the seat of Lord Crewe, and Eaton Hall, the seat of the
                    duke of Westminster. (a. w. L.)</p>
