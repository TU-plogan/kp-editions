                <p><label type="entry">CARVING AND GILDING</label> being two operations which
                    formerly were the most prominent features in the important industry of
                    frame-making, the craftsmen who pursued the occupation were known as carvers and
                    gilders. The terms still continue to be the recognized trade name of
                    frame-making, although very little of the ornamentation of frame-work is now
                    accomplished by carving, and a great deal of the so-called gilt ornament is
                    produced without the use of gold. The trade has to do primarily with the frames
                    of pictures, engravings, and mirrors, but many of the light decorative fittings
                    of houses, finished in “composition” and gilt work, are also entrusted to the
                    carver and gilder.</p>

                <p>Fashion in picture frames, like all fashions, fluctuates greatly. Mouldings of
                    the prevailing sizes and patterns are generally manufactured in special
                    factories, and supplied in lengths to carvers and gilders ready for use. A large
                    proportion of such mouldings, especially those of a cheaper and inferior
                    quality, are made in Germany. What is distinctively known as a “German” moulding
                    is a cheap imitation of gilt work made by lacquering over the surface of a white
                    metallic foil. German artisans are also very successful in the preparation of
                    imitation of veneers of rosewood, mahogany, walnut, and other ornamental woods.
                    The more expensive mouldings are either in wood (such as oak or mahogany), in
                    veneers of any expensive ornamental wood, or real gilt.</p>
                <p>A brief outline of the method of making a gilt frame, enriched with composition
                    ornaments, may be taken as a characteristic example of the operations of the
                    frame-maker. The foundation of such a frame is soft pine wood, in which a
                    moulding of the required size and section is roughly run. To prevent warping the
                    moulding is, or ought to be, made from two pieces of wood glued together. The
                    moulding is “whitened up,” or prepared for gilding by covering it with repeated
                    coatings of a mixture of finely powdered whiting and size. When a sufficient
                    thickness of the whitening mixture has been applied, the whole surface is
                    carefully smoothed off with pumice-stone and glasspaper, care being taken to
                    keep the angles and curves clear and sharp. Were a plain gilt moulding only
                    desired, it would now be ready for gilding; but when the frame is to be
                    enriched, it first receives the composition ornaments. Composition, or “compo,”
                    is a mixture of fine glue, white resin, and linseed oil well boiled together,
                    with as much rolled and sifted whiting added as makes the whole into a doughy
                    mass while hot. This composition is worked in a hot state into moulds of
                    boxwood, and so pressed in as to take up every ornamental detail. On its removal
                    from the mould all superfluous matter is trimmed away, and the ornament, while
                    yet soft and plastic, is laid on the moulding, and fitting into all the curves,
                    &lt;fcc., is fixed with glue. The ornamental surface so prepared quickly sets
                    and becomes very hard and brittle. When very larsre bold ornaments are wanted
                    for frames of unusual size they are moulded in <hi rend="italic">papier
                        mâché.</hi> Two methods of laying on gold —oil gilding and water gilding—are
                    practised, the former being used for frames broken up with enrichments. For
                    oil-gilding the moulding is prepared with two coats of fine thin size, and
                    afterwards it receives a coat of oil gold-size, which consists of a mixture of
                    boiled linseed oil and ochre. When this gold-size is in a “tackey” or “sticky”
                    condition, gold-leaf is laid on and carefully pressed over and into all parts of
                    the surface; and when covered with a coat of finish-size, the gilding is
                    complete. Water gilding is applied to plain mouldings and all considerable
                    unbroken surfaces, and is finished either “matt” or burnished. For these styles
                    of work the mouldings are properly sized, and after the size is dry the gold is
                    laid on with water. Matt-work is protected with one or two coats of finish-size;
                    but burnished gold is finished only by polishing with an agate burnisher,—no
                    size or water being allowed to touch such surfaces. The mitring up of frames,
                    the mounting and fitting up of paintings, engravings, &amp;c., involve too many
                    minor operations to be noticed here in detail; but these, with the cutting and
                    fitting of glass, cleaning and repairing pictures and prints, and similar
                    operations, all occupy the attention of the carver and gilder.</p>
