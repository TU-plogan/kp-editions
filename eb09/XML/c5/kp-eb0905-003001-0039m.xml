                    north to south. Of these the more westerly, which is considerably the larger, is
                    mountainous, sloping eastward into downs, while the other consists of a plain,
                    covering an area of 2,500,000 acres. To these two main divisions must be added
                    Banks Peninsula, an isolated hilly district on the eastern edge of the plain,
                    jutting into the sea, and with an area of 250,000 acres. Thus the surface of the
                    province is of the most diversified character, varying from the snow-clad peaks
                    of the Southern Alps, which culminate in Mount Cook (13,200.feet), the highest
                    mountain in New Zealand, to the dead level of the plain on which Christchurch
                    stands, only a few feet above the sea. In lakes Canterbury gives place to Otago
                    and Auckland, though Lakes Ohau and Coleridge are large sheets of water,
                    situated amid scenery of the most beautiful description. The rivers of
                    Canterbury are short and rapid, running with a direct course to the sea, and
                    quite useless for purposes of navigation. Apart from the Hurunui and Waitangi,
                    which divide Canterbury on the north-east and south-east from Nelson and Otago
                    respectively, and hence belong equally to those provinces, the principal rivers
                    of Canterbury are the Ashley, Waimakariri, Rakaia, Ashburton, and Rangitata.
                    They are all very liable to sudden and disastrous floods. The coast is poorly
                    supplied with good harbours, that of Akaroa, in Banks Peninsula, being the only
                    one safe in all kinds of weather. The harbour of Lyttelton is spacious, but
                    exposed to easterly winds. The capital of Canterbury is Christchurch, and the
                    other principal settlements are Lyttelton and Akaroa already mentioned, Kaiapoi
                    a few miles north of Christchurch, and Timaru, 110 miles south of the latter
                    place.</p>
                <p>The downs and great plain of Canterbury are devoid of forests, but the mountain
                    regions and Banks Peninsula yield abundance of excellent timber. The principal
                    trees are the totara <hi rend="italic">(Podocarpus Totara),</hi> rimu or red
                    pine <hi rend="italic">(Dacrydium</hi><hi rend="italic">cupressinum),</hi> and
                    kahikatea or white pine <hi rend="italic">(Podocarpus dacrydioides).</hi> Coal
                    well adapted for household and industrial purposes, though not of the first
                    quality, is found in the Malvern Hills, to the west of Christcl1ur3h, and beds
                    of clay ironstone exist in various localities, but are not yet worked. Gold is
                    found in the south-western angle of the province, near the Otago border, though
                    not in sufficient quantity to tempt many to search for it. The wealth of
                    Canterbury consists in its flocks and its yield of agricultural produce. In 1874
                    the province contained 2,965,000 sheep and 79,000 cattle. The number of
                    agricultural holdings was 3969, and the total area of land under crops of all
                    kinds, including cultivated grass, was about 390,000 acres, of which 112,000
                    acres were under cereals. The imports of Canterbury in 1874 amounted to
                    £1,568,826, and the exports to £1,108,531,—by far the greater proportion of the
                    latter consisting of wool, wheat, and oats. The export of phormium fibre (New
                    Zealand flax), from which much was at one time expected, has greatly declined,
                    but on the other hand the export of preserved meats is rapidly rising in
                    importance. The population of the province on 31st December 1874 was 71,316.
                    Besides possessing many good roads, Canterbury is fast being opened up by
                    railways. The first of these, from Lyttelton to Christchurch, a distance of
                    eight miles, was tunnelled at great expense through the hills at the back of the
                    former town. The line has since been continued on both sides of Christchurch—as
                    far south as the River Rangitata, and as far north as the River Ashley, while
                    branch lines have been, or are being, constructed to the settlements of
                    Southbridge, Malvern, and Oxford. The first railway having been of the 5-feet
                    3-inch gauge, the main line is for the most part of that width, while the
                    branches are of the narrow gauge of 3 feet 6 inches, which is almost universally
                    adopted in other parts of the colony.</p>
                <p>The educational system of Canterbury is comprehensive and efficient. In addition
                    to the New Zealand University (an examining institution, supported by the colony
                    as a whole, but having its headquarters at Christchurch), there are in the
                    capital several educational institutions of high standing. Spread over the
                    province there are also, in addition to schools maintained by private
                    enterprise, many Government schools. The number of these on 31st March 1875 was
                    93. They were conducted by 288 teachers and attended by 12,000 scholars.</p>
                <p>Canterbury was founded in December 1850 by an association headed by men of
                    influential position in England, and’ connected with the national church. It was
                    indeed sought for a time to prevent persons not members of the Church of England
                    from settling in Canterbury, but the attempt was a failure. In 1867 the portion
                    of the province west of the Southern Alps was formed into a separate province,
                    under the name of Westland. Further particulars regarding the history of
                    Canterbury will be found under the heading <hi rend="smallcaps">New
                    Zealand.</hi></p>
