                    though on the south side of the Maeander, were included in Ionia. Its precise
                    eastern limit is not so clearly fixed, but may be considered as an arbitrary
                    line drawn from the Maeander a little east of Antiochia to the lofty mountain
                    mass of Mount Cadmus (Baba-dagh), and thence along the great ridge of Salbacum
                    (Boz-dagh) in a direction nearly south to the sea, where the promontory on the
                    west of the Gulf of Macri constitutes the limit between it and Lycia. The
                    coast-line of Caria is very peculiar, being wholly formed by a succession of
                    great promontories advancing far out into the sea, and alternating with deep
                    inlets or gulfs, running far up into the mainland. The largest and most
                    important of these, known as the Ceramic Gulf or Gulf of Cos, extends inland for
                    fully 70 miles, between the great mountain promontory terminating at Myndus on
                    the north, and that which extends to Cnidus and the remarkable headland of Cape
                    Krio on the south. North of this is found the deep bay called in ancient times
                    the Gulf of Jasus (now known as the Gulf of Mendeliyah), and beyond this again
                    was the deeper inlet which formerly extended inland between Miletus and Priene,
                    but of which the outer part has been entirely filled up by the alluvial deposits
                    of the Maeander, while the innermost arm, called in ancient times the Latmic
                    Gulf, is thus converted into a lake. South of Cape Krio again is the gulf known
                    as the Gulf of Doris, with several minor arms and subordinate inlets, bounded on
                    the south by a mountainous and rugged promontory called by the ancients
                    Cynossema (now Cape Alupo) and erroneously regarded by them as forming the S.W.
                    angle of Asia Minor. Between this headland and the frontier of Lycia is the deep
                    and sheltered bay of Marmarice, noted in modern times as one of the finest
                    harbours in the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>Almost the whole of Caria has more or less of a mountain character. The two great
                    mountain masses of Cadmus (Baba-dagh) and Salbacum (Boz-dagh), which are in fact
                    portions of the great chain of Taurus (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Asia
                    Minor),</hi> form as it were the nucleus to which the whole physical framework
                    of the country is attached. From these lofty ranges there extends a broad
                    table-land in many part? retaining a height of more than 3000 feet, while it
                    sends down offshoots or arms of a rugged and mountainous character, on the north
                    towards the valley of the Maeander, and on the west towards the Aegean. None of
                    these ranges, however, attain a height of more than 4000 feet, with the
                    exception of Mount Latmus, of which the highest summit, now known as Besh
                    Parmak, rises to about 4500 feet.</p>
                <p>This deeply indented coast is accompanied, as in most similar cases, by numerous
                    islands, in some instances separated only by narrow straits from the mainland.
                    Of these the most celebrated are the two great islands of Rhodes and Cos. But
                    besides these there are Syme, Telos, Nisyros, Calymnos, Leros, and Patmos, all
                    of which have been inhabited, both in ancient and modern times, and some of
                    which contain excellent harbours. Of these Nisyros alone is of volcanic origin;
                    the others belong to the same limestone formation with the rocky headlands of
                    the coast, of which they are in fact mere detached portions.</p>
                <p>Like most of the provinces of Asia Minor, Caria was not merely a territorial
                    division, but an ethnographical district, and the Carians are spoken of by all
                    ancient writers as a distinct nation from their neighbours, the Lydians,
                    Phrygians, and Lycians. But their origin and early history is very uncertain.
                    According to a tradition generally adopted by the Greeks, they were originally
                    called Leleges, and inhabited the islands of the Aegean, where they were subject
                    to Minos, king of Crete, and formed the strength of his navy; and it was not
                    till they were driven out of the islands by the Greeks that they settled on the
                    mainland. It is much more probable that they were originally established on the
                    continent, and from thence extended their power over the islands of the Aegean.
                    That they were in very early times a powerful and warlikepeople, distinguished
                    for their maritime skill and enterprise, may be considered as clearly proved,
                    and was indeed a natural result of the peculiar configuration of their coasts.
                    But at the period when we first obtain definite historical information
                    concerning them, they had not only been expelled from the Cyclades and outlying
                    islands of the Aegean, but had been driven back into the interior, from the
                    coasts and islands of their own country, which had been occupied by Greeks of
                    Dorian race, who had formed a Hexapolis or league of six cities, including three
                    on the island of Rhodes, together with Cos, and Cnidus and Halicarnassus on the
                    mainland. Besides these principal settlements the Greeks gradually colonized the
                    whole of the coast region, which was hence sometimes designated by the name of
                    Doris.· But the Carians always maintained themselves in the interior of the
                    country, and continued to be recognized as a distinct race, like the Lydians and
                    Phrygians. Some writers indeed are inclined to believe that the people called
                    Zeybeks or Xebeks, who occupy the inland mountain districts of Caria, and are
                    distinguished from their neighbours by certain peculiarities, are lineal
                    descendants of the ancient Carians.</p>
                <p>Caria passed with little resistance under the Persian yoke, but afterwards joined
                    in the Ionic revolt, and fought hard against the Persian generals before it
                    again submitted. From this time till its conquest by Alexander, it continued to
                    be subject to Persia, but under princes or rulers of its own, who resided at
                    Halicarnassus, and were strongly imbued with the principles of Greek
                    civilization (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Halicarnassus).</hi> The last of these
                    native princes was named Pixodarus, and after his death the throne was usurped
                    by a Persian named Orontobates, who offered a vigorous resistance to Alexander
                    the Great. But after the capture of the capital, Halicarnassus, which sustained
                    a long siege, the rest of Caria was quickly subdued. Alexander at first bestowed
                    it upon Ada, a princess of the native dynasty, but it was soon incorporated with
                    the Macedonian kingdom by his successors, and in common with the adjoining dis

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0114-0103"/> tricts of Asia Minor passed successively under
                    the Syrian kings and those of Pergamus. It was united with the Roman empire
                    after the extinction of the latter dynasty, and became a part of the Roman
                    province of Asia. From this period it has no separate history of its own, and in
                    common with the rest of Asia Minor became a part of the monarchy, first of the
                    Seljukian and afterwards of the Ottoman Turks.</p>
                <p>The principal cities of Caria in ancient times were Cnidus and Halicarnassus on
                    the sea-coast, and Alabanda, Mylasa, and Stratonicea in the interior. At the
                    present day, Budrum, which occupies the site of Halicarnassus, is still a place
                    of some importance; while the two most considerable towns in the interior are
                    Melassa (the ancient Mylasa) and Mughla,in the centre of the high inland
                    plateau. The portions of the province adjoining the valley of the Maeander are
                    fertile, and produce excellent figs and raisins; while the mountains near the
                    sea-coast are for the most part clothed with forests, which render the scenery
                    of the district among the most beautiful in Asia Minor, <hi rend="smallcaps"
