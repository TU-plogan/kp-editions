                <p><label type="entry">CLAN</label>. The Goidelic word <hi rend="italic">eland</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">dann</hi> (in Welsh, <hi rend="italic">plant)</hi>
                    signifies seed, and in a general sense children, descendants. In the latter
                    sense it was used as one of many terms to designate groups of kindred in the
                    tribal system of government which existed in Ireland and the Highlands of
                    Scotland. Through the latter country the word passed into the English language,
                    first in the special sense of the Highland clan, afterwards as a general name
                    for a tribe or group of kinsmen. The results of inquiries into the tenure of
                    land in different countries and the ancient laws and institutions of Aryan
                    nations, and the publication of various Celtic documents, particularly the
                    ancient laws of Ireland and Wales, have thrown much light on the constitution of
                    the clan system, and given to it a wider and more important interest than it had
                    hitherto possessed.</p>
                <p>Before the use of surnames and elaborate written genealogies, a tribe in its
                    definite sense was called a <hi rend="italic">tuath,</hi> a word of wide
                    affinities, from a root <hi rend="italic">tu,</hi> to grow, to multiply,
                    existing in all European languages. When the tribal system began to be broken up
                    by conquest and by the rise of towns and of territorial government, the use of a
                    common surname furnished a new bond for keeping up a connection between kindred.
                    The head of a tribe or smaller group of kindred selected some ancestor and
                    called himself his <hi rend="italic">Ua,</hi> grandson, or as it has been
                    anglicized <hi rend="italic">O</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">, e.g., Ua
                    Coηchobair</hi> (O’ Conor), <hi rend="italic">Ua. Suilleabhain</hi> (O’
                    Sullivan). All his kindred adopted the same name, the chief using no fore-name
                    however. The usual mode of distinguishing a person before the introduction of
                    surnames was to name his father and grandfather, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    Owen, son of Donal, son of Dermot, This naturally led some to form their
                    surnames with <hi rend="italic">Max,</hi> son, instead of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ua,</hi> grandson, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Mac Gar-thaigh,</hi> son of <hi
                    rend="italic">Garthadι</hi> (Mac Carthy), <hi rend="italic">Mac Ruaidhri,</hi>
                    son of Rory (Macrory). Both methods have been followed in Ireland, but in
                    Scotland <hi rend="italic">Max</hi> came to be exclusively used. The adoption of
                    such genealogical surnames fostered the notion that all who bore the same
                    surname were kinsmen, and hence the genealogical term <hi rend="italic"
                    >dann,</hi> which properly means the descendants of some progenitor, gradually
                    became synonymous with <hi rend="italic">tuath,</hi> tribe. Like all purely
                    genealogical terms, <hi rend="italic">dann</hi> may be used in the limited sense
                    of a particular tribe governed by a chief, or in that of many tribes claiming
                    descent from a common ancestor. In the latter sense it was synonymous with <hi
                    rend="italic">sil, siol,</hi> seed, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Siοl Alpine,</hi> a
                    great clan which included the smaller clans of the Macgregors, Grants,
                    Mackinnons, Macnabs, Macphies, Macquarries, and Macaulays.</p>
                <p>The clan system in the most archaic form of which we have any definite
                    information can be best studied in the Irish <hi rend="italic">tuath,</hi> or
                    tribe. This consisted of two classes :—(1) tribesmen, and (2) a miscellaneous
                    class of slaves, criminals, strangers, and their descendants. The first class
                    included tribesmen by blood in the male line, including all illegitimate
                    children acknowledged by their fathers, and tribesmen by adoption or sons of
                    tribeswomen by strangers, foster-sons, men who had done some signal service to
                    the tribe, and lastly the descendants of the second class after a certain number
                    of generations. Each <hi rend="italic">tuath</hi> had a chief called a <hi
                    rend="italic">rig,</hi> king, a word cognate with the Gaulish <hi rend="italic"
                    >rigs</hi> or <hi rend="italic">riχ,</hi> the Latin <hi rend="italic">reg-s</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">rex,</hi> and the Old Norse <hi rend="italic">rik-ir.</hi>
                    The tribesmen formed a number of communities, each of which, like the tribe
                    itself, consisted of a head, <hi rend="italic">ceann fine,</hi> his kinsmen,
                    slaves, and other retainers. This was the <hi rend="italic">fine,</hi> or sept.
                    Each of these occupied a certain part of the tribe-land, the arable part being
                    cultivated under a system of co-tillage, the pasture land co-grazed according to
                    certain customs, and the wood, bog, and mountains forming the marchland of the
                    sept being the unrestricted common land of the sept. The sept was in fact a
                    village community like the</p>
                <p>Russian <hi rend="italic">mir,</hi> or rather like the German <hi rend="italic"
                    >gemeinde</hi> and Swiss <hi rend="italic">aimend,</hi> which Sir H. S. Maine,
                    Μ. de Laveleye, and others have shown to have preceded in every European country
                    the existing order of things as respects ownership of land.</p>
                <p>What the sept was to the tribe, the homestead was to the sept. The head of a
                    homestead was an <hi rend="italic">aire,</hi> a representative freeman capable
                    of acting as a witness, compurgator, and bail. These were very important
                    functions, especially when it is borne in mind that the tribal homestead was the
                    home of many of the kinsfolk of the head of the family as well as of his own
                    children. The descent of property being according to a gavel-kind custom, it
                    constantly happened that when an <hi rend="italic">aire</hi> died the share of
                    his property which each member of his immediate family was entitled to receive
                    was not sufficient to qualify him to be an <hi rend="italic">aire.</hi> In this
                    case the family did not divide the inheritance, but remained together as “a
                    joint and undivided family,” one of the members being elected chief of the
                    family or household, and in this capacity enjoyed the rights and privileges of
                    an <hi rend="italic">aire.</hi> Sir H. S. Maine has directed attention to this
                    kind of family as an important feature of the early institutions of all Aryan
                    nations. Beside the “joint and undivided family” there was another kind of
                    family which we might call “the joint family.” This was a partnership composed
                    of three or four members of a sept whose individual wealth was not sufficient to
                    qualify each of them to be an <hi rend="italic">aire,</hi> but whose joint
                    wealth qualified one of the co-partners as head of the joint family to be
                    one.</p>
                <p>So long as there was abundance of land each family grazed its cattle upon the
                    tribe-land without restriction; unequal increase of wealth and growth of
                    population naturally led to its limitation, each head of a homestead being
                    entitled to graze an amount of stock in proportion to his wealth, the size of
                    his homestead, and his acquired position. The arable land was no doubt applotted
                    annually at first; gradually, however, some of the richer families of the tribe
                    succeeded in evading this exchange of allotments and converting part of the
                    common land into an estate in sevralty. Septs were at first colonies of the
                    tribe which settled on the march-land; afterwards the conversion of part of the
                    common land, into an estate in sevralty enabled the family that acquired it to
                    become the parent of a new sept. The same process might, however, take place
                    within a sept without dividing it; in other words, several members of the sept
                    might hold part of the land of the sept as separate estate. The possession of
                    land in sevralty introduced an important distinction into the tribal system—it
                    created an aristocracy. An <hi rend="italic">aire</hi> whose family held the
                    same land for three generations was called <hi rend="italic">a flaith,</hi> or
                    lord, of which rank there were several grades according to their wealth in land
                    and chattels. The <hi rend="italic">aires</hi> whose wealth consisted in cattle
                    only were called <hi rend="italic">bb-aires,</hi> or cow-α⅛es, of whom there
                    were also several grades, depending on their wealth in stock. When a <hi
                    rend="italic">bo-aire</hi> had twice the wealth of the lowest class of <hi
                    rend="italic">flaith</hi> he might enclose part of the land adjoining his house
                    as a lawn; this was the first step towards his becoming a <hi rend="italic"
                    >flaith.</hi> The relations which subsisted between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >flaiths</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">bo-aires</hi> formed the most curious
                    part of the Celtic tribal system, and throw a flood of light on the origin of
                    the feudal system. Every tribesman without exception owed <hi rend="italic"
                    >ceilsinne</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">rig,</hi> or chief, that is, he was
                    bound to become his <hi rend="italic">cede,</hi> or vassal. This consisted in
                    paying the <hi rend="italic">rig</hi> a tribute in kind, for which the <hi
                    rend="italic">ceile</hi> was entitled to receive a proportionate amount of stock
                    without having to give any bond for their return, giving him service, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in building his <hi rend="italic">dun,</hi> or
                    stronghold, reaping his harvest, keeping his roads clean and in repair, killing
                    wolves, and especially service in the field, and doing him homage three times
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n813/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0813-0800"/> while seated every time he made his return of
                    tribute. Paying the “<hi rend="italic">calpe</hi>” to the Highland chiefs
                    represented this kind of vassalage, a <hi rend="italic">colpdach</hi> or heifer
                    being in many cases the amount of food-rent paid by a free or <hi rend="italic"
                    >saer cede.</hi> A tribesman might, however, if he pleased, pay a higher rent on
                    receiving more stock together with certain other chattels for which no rent was
                    chargeable. In this case he entered into a contract, and was therefore a bond or
                    <hi rend="italic">daer</hi><hi rend="italic">celle.</hi> No one need have
                    accepted stock on these terms, nor could he do so without the consent of his
                    sept, and he might free himself at any time from his obligation by returning
                    what he had received, and the rent due thereon.</p>
                <p>What every one was bound to do to his <hi rend="italic">rvg,</hi> or chief, he
                    might do voluntarily to the <hi rend="italic">flaith of</hi> his sept, to any
                    <hi rend="italic">flaith</hi> of the tribe, or even to one of another tribe. He
                    might also become a bond <hi rend="italic">celle.</hi> In either case he might
                    renounce his ceileship by returning a greater or lesser amount of stock than
                    what he had received according to the circumstances under which he terminated
                    his vassalage. In cases of disputed succession to the chiefship of a tribe the
                    rival claimants were always anxious to get as many as possible to become their
                    vassals. Hence the anxiety of minor chieftains, in later times in the Highlands
                    of Scotland, to induce the clansmen to pay the <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">calpe</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi> where there happened to be a
                    doubt as to who was entitled to be chief.</p>
                <p>The effect of the custom of gavel-kind was to equalize the wealth of each and
                    leave no one wealthy enough to be chief. The “joint and undivided family,” and
                    the formation of “joint families,” or gilds, was one way of obviating this
                    result; another way was the custom of tanistry. The headship of the tribe was
                    practically confined to the members of one family; this was also the case with
                    the headship of a sept. Sometimes a son succeeded his father, but the rule was
                    that the eldest and most capable member of the <hi rend="italic">geilfiιu,</hi>
                    that is the relatives of the actual chief to the fifth degree,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> It is right to mention that
                    the explanation here given of <hi rend="italic">geilfine</hi> is different from
                    that given in the introduction to the third volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ancient Laws of Ireland,</hi> which has been followed by Sir H. S. Maine in his
                    account of it in his <hi rend="italic">Early History of Institutions,</hi> and
                    which the present writer believes to be erroneous.</p></note> was selected
                    during his lifetime to be his successor,—generally the eldest surviving brother
                    or son of the preceding chief. The man selected as successor to a chief of a
                    tribe, or chieftain of a sept, was called the tanist, and should be “the most
                    experienced, the most noble, the most wealthy, the wisest, the most learned, the
                    most truly popular, the most powerful to oppose, the most steadfast to sue for
                    profits and [be sued] for losses.” In addition to these qualities he should be
                    free from personal blemishes and deformities, and of fit age to lead his tribe
                    or sept, as the case may be, to battle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> It should also be mentioned that illegitimacy was not a
                    bar. The issue of “handfast” marriages in Scotland were eligible to be chiefs,
                    and even sometimes claimed under feudal law.</p></note> So far as selecting the
                    man of the <hi rend="italic">geilfine</hi> who was supposed to possess all those
                    qualities, the office of chief of a tribe or chieftain of a sept was elective,
                    but as the <hi rend="italic">geilfine</hi> was represented by four persons
                    together with the chief or chieftain, the election was practically confined to
                    one of the four. In order to support the dignity of the chief or chieftain a
                    certain portion of the tribe or sept land was attached as an apanage to the
                    office; this land, with the <hi rend="italic">duns,</hi> or fortified residences
                    upon it, went to the successor, but a chiefs own property might be gavelled.
                    This custom of tanistry applied at first probably to the selection of the
                    successors of a <hi rend="italic">rig,</hi> but was gradually so extended that
                    even a <hi rend="italic">bo-aire</hi> had a tanist.</p>
                <p>A sept might have only one <hi rend="italic">flaith,</hi> or lord, connected with
                    it, or might have several. It sometimes happened, however, that a sept might be
                    so broken and reduced as not to have even one man qualified to rank as a <hi
                    rend="italic">flaith.</hi> The rank of a <hi rend="italic">flaith</hi> depended
                    upon the number of his <hi rend="italic">ceiles,</hi> that is, upon his wealth.
                    The of a sept, and the highest when there was more than one, was <hi
                    rend="italic">ceann fine,</hi> or head of the sept, or as he was usually called
                    in Scotland, the chieftain. He was also called the <hi rend="italic">flaith
                    geilfine,</hi> or head of the <hi rend="italic">geilfine,</hi> that is, the
                    kinsmen to the fifth degree from among whom should be chosen the tanist, and who
                    according to the custom of gavel-kind were the immediate heirs who received the
                    personal property and were answerable for the liabilities of the sept. The <hi
                    rend="italic">flaiths</hi> of the different septs were the vassals of the <hi
                    rend="italic">rig,</hi> or chief of the tribe, and performed certain functions
                    which were no doubt at first individual, but in time became the hereditary right
                    of the sept. One of those was the office of <hi rend="italic">rnaer, or</hi>
                    steward of the chiefs rents, &lt;fcc.;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This office is of considerable importance in connection with
                    early Scottish history. In the Irish annals the <hi rend="italic">rig,</hi> or
                    chief of a great tribe <hi rend="italic">(mor tuath),</hi> such as of Ross,
                    Moray, Marr, Buchan, c., is called a <hi rend="italic">mor moer,</hi> or great
                    <hi rend="italic">moer.</hi> Sometimes the same person is called king also in
                    these annals. Thus <hi rend="italic">Findloec,</hi> or Finlay, son of <hi

                    of Moray in the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Ulster,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >mor moer</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Tighemach.</hi> The term is
                    never found in Scottish charters, but it occurs in the Book of the Abbey of Deir
                    in Buchan, now in the library of the University of Cambridge. The Scotic kings
                    and their successors obviously regarded the chiefs of the great tribes in
                    question merely as their <hi rend="italic">moers,</hi> while their tribesmen
                    only knew them as kings. From these “mor-maerships,” which corresponded with the
                    ancient <hi rend="italic">mor tuatha,</hi> came most, if not all, the ancient
                    Scottish earldoms.</p></note> and another that of <hi rend="italic">aire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tuisi,</hi> leading <hi rend="italic">aire,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">taoιsech,</hi> a word cognate with the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >dues</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dux,</hi> and Anglo-Saxon here-toy, leader of
                    the “here,” or army. The <hi rend="italic">taoisech</hi> was leader of the tribe
                    in battle; in later times the term seems to have been extended to several
                    offices of rank. The cadet of a Highland clan was always called the <hi
                    rend="italic">taoisech,</hi> which has been translated captain; after the
                    conquest of Wales the same term, <hi rend="italic">tywysaug,</hi> was used for a
                    ruling prince. Slavery was very common in Ireland and Scotland; in the former
                    slaves constituted a common element in the stipends or gifts which the higher
                    kings gave their vassal <hi rend="italic">sub-reguH.</hi> Female slaves, who
                    were employed in the houses of chiefs and <hi rend="italic">flaiths</hi> in
                    grinding meal with the hand-mill or quern, and in other domestic work, must have
                    been very common, for the unit or standard for estimating the wealth of a <hi
                    rend="italic">bô-aire,</hi> blood-fines, &amp;c., was called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >cumhal,</hi> the value of which was three cows, but which literally meant a
                    female slave. The descendants of those slaves, prisoners of war, forfeited
                    hostages, refugees from other tribes, broken tribesmen, &lt;fcc,, gathered round
                    the residence of the <hi rend="italic">rig and flaiths,</hi> or squatted upon
                    their march-lands, forming a motley band of retainers which made a considerable
                    element in the population, and one of the chief sources of the wealth of chiefs
                    and <hi rend="italic">flaiths.</hi> The other principal source of their income
                    was the foodrent paid by <hi rend="italic">ceiles,</hi> and especially by the
                    <hi rend="italic">daer</hi> or bond <hi rend="italic">celles,</hi> who were
                    hence called <hi rend="italic">biathachs,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">biad,</hi>
                    food. A <hi rend="italic">flaith,</hi> but not a <hi rend="italic">rig,</hi>
                    might, if he liked, go to the house of his <hi rend="italic">ceile</hi> and
                    consume his food-rent in the house of the latter.</p>
                <p>Under the influence of feudal ideas and the growth of the modern views as to
                    ownership of land, the chiefs and other lords of clans claimed in modern times
                    the right of bestowing the tribe-land as <hi rend="italic">turcrec,</hi> instead
                    of stock, and receiving rent not for cattle and other chattels as in former
                    times, but proportionate to the extent of land given to them. The førcrec-land
                    seems to have been at first given upon the same terms as førcrec-stock, but
                    gradually a system of short leases grew up; sometimes, too, it was given on
                    mortgage. In the Highlands of Scotland <hi rend="italic">ceiles</hi> who
                    received rerec-land were called “taksmen.” On the death of the chief or lord,
                    his successor either bestowed the land upon the same person or gave it to some
                    other relative. In this way in each generation new families came into possession
                    of land, and others sank into the mass of mere <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n814/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0814-0801"/> tribesmen. Sometimes â “taksman” succeeded in
                    acquiring his land in perpetuity, by gift, marriage, or purchase, or even by the
                    “strong hand.” The universal prevalence of exchangeable allotments, or the
                    rundale system, shows that down to even comparatively modern times some of the
                    land was still recognized as the property of the tribe, and was cultivated in
                    village communities.</p>
                <p>The chief governed the clan by the aid of a council called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sabaid (sab,</hi> a prop), but the chief exercised much power, especially over
                    the miscellanous body of non-tribesmen who lived on his own estate. This power
                    seems to have extended to life and death. Several of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >flaiths,</hi> perhaps, all heads of septs, also possessed somewhat extensive
                    powers of the same kind.</p>
                <p>The Celtic dress, at least in the Middle Ages, consisted of a kind of shirt
                    reaching to a little below the knees called a <hi rend="italic">lenn,</hi> a
                    jacket called an <hi rend="italic">inar,</hi> and a garment called a <hi
                    rend="italic">brat,</hi> consisting of a single piece of cloth. This was
                    apparently the garb of the <hi rend="italic">aires,</hi> who appear to have been
                    further distinguished by the number of colours in their dress, for we are told
                    that while a slave had clothes of one colour, a <hi rend="italic">rig
                    tuatha,</hi> or chief of a tribe, had five, and an <hi rend="italic">ollamh</hi>
                    and a superior king, six. The breeches was also known, and cloaks with a cowl or
                    hood, which buttoned up tight in front. The <hi rend="italic">lenn</hi> is the
                    modern kilt, and the <hi rend="italic">brat</hi> the plaid, so that the dress of
                    the Irish and Welsh in former times was the same as that of the Scottish
                    Highlander.</p>
                <p>By the abolition of the heritable jurisdiction of the Highland chiefs, and the
                    general disarmament of the clans by the Acts passed in 1747 after the rebellion
                    of 1745, the clan system was practically broken up, though its influence still
                    lingers in the more remote districts. An Act was also passed in 1747 forbidding
                    the use of the Highland garb;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> The following oath was administered at Fort William and
                    other places in 1747 and 1748 :—</p><p>“I, [name], do swear, as I shall answer
                    to God at the great day of judgment, that I have not, nor shall have, in my
                    possession any gun, sword, pistol, or any arm whatsoever, and that I never use
                    tartan, plaid, or any part of the Highland garb; and if I do so, may I be cursed
                    in my undertakings, family, and property,—may I never see my wife and children,
                    father, mother, or relations,—may I be killed in battle as a coward, and lie
                    without Christian burial in a strange land, far from the graves of my
                    forefathers and kindred; may all this come across me if I break my
                    oath.”</p></note> but the injustice and impolicy of such a law being generally
                    felt it was afterwards repealed. (w. κ. s.)</p>
