                    >Castilla),</hi> an ancient kingdom of Spain occupying the central districts of
                    the peninsula. For its history as a separate kingdom see the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Spain.</hi> The name Castile is derived from the existence of
                    numerous forts <hi rend="italic">(cαstillos)</hi> erected on the frontiers to
                    afford protection from enemies. The northern part of the old kingdom, which was
                    first rescued from the Moors, is called <hi rend="italic">Castilla la
                    Vieja,</hi> or Old Castile; the southern, more recently acquired, is called <hi
                    rend="italic">Castilla la Nueva,</hi> or New Castile. The length of Castile from
                    north to south is about 300 miles; the breadth, about 160 miles; and the total
                    area about 45,000 square miles, or nearly one-fourth that of Spain.</p>
                <p>Old Castile is bordered on the N. by the Bay of Biscay, on the E. and N.E. by
                    Biscay, Alava, Navarre, and Aragon, on the S. by New Castile, and on the W. by
                    Leon and Asturias. It is divided into the provinces of Burgos, Logroño,
                    Santander, Soria, Segovia, Avila, Palencia, Valladolid, and has an area of
                    25,409 square miles, and a population estimated in 1870 at 1,689,864
                    inhabitants. The country consists of vast plains, which form, between the
                    Cantabrian chain in the north and the chain of Sierras stretching south-west
                    from Aragon to Estremadura, a great table-land, of a height between 2500 and
                    4000 feet above the sea. The principal rivers are the Douro and the Ebro. The
                    plains are barren and dry, with scarcely a tree, meadow, or spring of water; but
                    the hills bordering the mountain ranges are well clothed with oak-forests. The
                    climate is healthy, but subject to great extremes of cold and heat; frosts in
                    the higher regions may last three months at a time. The soil is productive, but
                    poorly cultivated; the harvests of wheat, however, are abundant. Wine and oil of
                    inferior quality, and madder, are produced in considerable quantity, but fruits
                    are scarce except at Bureba. The export trade is chiefly in wool, cattle, sheep,
                    and wheat. The bad state of the roads (which are often impassable for mules),
                    the insufficiency of railway communication, and the neglected condition of the
                    Port of Santander, are great obstacles to commerce.</p>
                <p>New Castile is bounded on the N. by Old Castile, on the E. by Aragon and
                    Valencia, on the S. by La Mancha, on the W. by Estremadura. It forms the
                    southern portion of the great central table-land of Spain, and comprises the
                    provinces of Madrid, Toledo, Guadalajara, and Cuenca. The total area is 20,178
                    square miles, inhabited by a population estimated in 1870 at 1,277,123. The
                    principal mountain ranges are the Sierra Guadarama in the north, and the Sierra
                    Morena in the south. The chief rivers are the Tagus, Guadiana, Guadalquiver,
                    Segura, and Xucar. The climate is more rigorous than that of Old Castile, and
                    the mean temperature, on account of the elevation of surface, is not more than
                    59°; but the heat in summer is extreme in the valleys. The rainfall is not more
                    then 10 inches in a year; the winds are dry and violent. The whole country
                    presents the aspect of a barren dusty steppe, with patches of olive-trees here
                    and there, and wheat, pea, and saffron fields. During the rainy season the
                    vegetation is very luxuriant; but agriculture is in a backward state; the soil
                    is fertile, but the rivers are not used for its irrigation. The total quantity
                    of wheat raised is barely sufficient for the wants of the population. Hemp and
                    flax and olive-trees are cultivated. Timber and fire-wood are becoming dearer,
                    as the country is very little wooded. Honey is gathered in considerable
                    quantities; and sheep, oxen, and mules are reared in great numbers. Iron, salt,
                    and quicksilver are worked; the mineral resources are good, but ill developed.
                    The manufactures are chiefly of woollen goods, plain and figured velvets, silks,
                    satins, calicoes, stockings, earthenware, and cutlery.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of both Old and New Castile are a loyal and manly race,
                    preserving the primitive simplicity and pure Spanish, as well as the pride, of
                    their forefathers. They are uneducated and inclined to bigotry, but naturally
                    shrewd and intelligent. The tillage of the land and the pasturing of sheep are
                    their chief employments.</p>
