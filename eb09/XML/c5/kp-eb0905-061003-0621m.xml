                <p><label type="entry">CHICAGO</label>, in Cook county, State of Illinois, is
                    probably the fourth city in size, and certainly the second in commercial
                    importance, in the United States of America. It is situated on the west shore of
                    Lake Michigan, 960 miles by rail from New York. Dearborn Observatory, 3 J miles
                    S. and f mile E. from the court-house, is in 41° 50' 1" N. lat. and 87° 34' 8"
                    W. long. The surrounding country is prairie land, with a loam soil, and a ridge
                    running north and south two miles or more west from the lake. The city is at an
                    elevation of nearly 600 feet above the sea level, but only 14 feet above the
                    lake. When it was originally settled, the elevation above the lake was not more
                    than 7 feet; the level was subsequently raised 7 feet, beginning about the year
                    1855; the streets were filled in, and the largest houses elevated by means of
                    jack-screws, without being vacated for purposes either of business or of
                    residence. The climate is healthful aud invigorating, and the city is kept
                    singularly clear of all forms of malaria by the prevailing winds. The average
                    death-rate for several years was 23T per thousand inhabitants, as compared with
                    25 ’ 3 in Philadelphia, 32 ’ 6 in New York, and 30 ’ 8 in Boston. The area of
                    the city comprises 23,000 acres, and extends over seven miles north and south
                    along the lake shore, and 5 miles east and west; there were 226,000 building
                    lots of 25 by 125 fget in 1875. The streets intersect each other at right
                    angles. There is an inlet called the Chicago River which runs from the lake
                    nearly a mile west, then separates into two branches, one running north-west,
                    the other south-west, thus dividing the city into three divisions, connected by
                    more than 35 bridges, and by two tunnels running under the bed of the river.
                    This river (“Chacaqua,” Indian for thunder, aud so called after the Indian Thor,
                    or thunder god) gave the city its name. Originally it emptied into the lake, but
                    a remarkable piece of engineering caused it to change its course, and, so to
                    speak, run “up-hill.” The Illinois and <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Michigan
                    canal, with which the main branch of the river is connected, was so deepened as
                    to draw the water out from the lake; the canal empties into the Illinois. River,
                    and the Illinois River into the Mississippi River, so that the water of Lake
                    Michigan flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The river has been so deepened that the
                    largest vessels may be towed into any of its branches, which are supplied with
                    docks and water-slips, affording a dockage capacity of nearly 40 miles, more
                    than 20 of which are already in use. The population, including the residents of
                    the suburban towns (of which there are more than 50, composed exclusively of
                    families of men doing business in Chicago), exceeds 500,000; but the population
                    of the city proper, as ascertained at different dates since its organization in
                    the year 1837, is as follows :—</p>

                    shingles. The value of the cattle, hogs, sheep, and horses received at the Union
                    Stock Yards during that year was $117,533,941. There is a growing direct trade
                    with Europe. The value of the importations for 1875 was estimated at
                    $10,000,000, meaning those alone which came to Chicago without being stopped for
                    duty at any seaport city; and the direct exportations increased from 7213 tons
                    in 1869 to 219,387 tons in 1875. The total volume of produce pouring through the
                    city was estimated that year at 7,000,000 tons, or 700,000 car-loads, if it had
                    all come by rail; or at the rate of 13½ tons for every minute in the year,
                    including nights, Sundays, and holidays. There are 18 grain elevators, withan
                    aggregate storage capacity of 14,650,000 bushels. These are vast store-houses
                    where the grain is elevated from cars and ships, and disposed according to
                    grades, then reloaded on cars and ships, all the work being done by machinery.

                    bushels of barley, and 310,609 bushels of rye. There was a total city
                    consumption of 67,825,311 bushels of grain. The shipments of provisions for that
                    year were 56,040 barrels of beef, 311,170 barrels of pork, 182,06δ tons of meat,
                    57,490 tons of lard, 3701 tens of tallow, 154,559 dressed hogs. The receipts of
                    live stock during that year were 920,843 cattle, 3,912,110 hogs, 418,948 sheep,

                    7½ per cent, over the previous year. The capital invested in wholesale houses

                    and steel, wood, brick, leather, chemicals, boots and shoes, and cigars and
                    tobacco. There is an annual industrial exhibition held in a building especially
                    erected for that purpose, 200 feet wide and 800 feet long, which attracts
                    exhibitors for one month from all parts of the north-west, and which was visited
                    in October 1875 by 276,000 persons. The shipping of Chicago for 1875 was as
                    follows :—number of vessels arrived, 10,488, with a tonnage of 3,122,004;
                    vessels cleared, 10,607, with a tonnage of 3,157,651. There are eighteen trunk
                    lines of railroads running from Chicago, five to the east, and the others west
                    aud south, viz.—The Baltimore and Ohio; Lake Shore and Michigan Southern;
                    Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and Chicago; Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and St Louis;
                    Michigan Central; Chicago and Michigan; Chicago and Alton; Chicago, Danville,

                    Quincy. The aggregate mileage of the railroads centring directly in Chicago is
                    nearly 10,000 miles, and 750 trains arrive and depart daily; but it is estimated
                    that Chicago has an uninterrupted connection with more than one-third of the
                    entire railroad mileage of the continent, which is more than 70,000 miles. A
                    notable peculiarity of the Chicago railway system is that it has been built
                    almost entirely by capita! outside of Chicago, and was centred in that city
                    because of its superior advantages as the entrepôt of the north-west The mails

                    Chicago was the destructive fire of 1871, the largest of modern times. The
                    conflagration commenced by the overturning of a lamp, in a district built up
                    almost exclusively of wood, about 9 o’clock in the evening of Sunday, October 8,
                    1871; it continued through that night and the greater part of the next day,
                    lapping up great blocks of houses, and growing by what it fed on. It was finally
                    checked by explosions of gunpowder in a line of houses on the south of the fire,
                    and exhausted itself on the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0623-0612"/> north by burning all there was to ignite. The
                    area burned over in each division of the city was as follows :—West division (in
                    which the fire originated), 194 acres; south division, 460 acres; north
                    division, 1470 acres. The total area burned was 2124 acres, or nearly 3½ square
                    miles, about 4 miles in length, and from 1 to 1 ½ miles in width. The season had
                    been excessively dry; the rainfall in Chicago for the summer had been only 28£
                    per cent, of the average. There was a strong south-west wind, made a very
                    sirocco by the heat, and taking irregular, fantastic, and uncontrollable
                    offshoots and eddies, which spread the fire in all directions except west. The
                    city fire department, though large and efficient, had been exhausted by an
                    unusually extended fire the Saturday preceding, and the flames outran even their
                    earliest efforts. Wooden buildings were scattered throughout the entire city,
                    acting as brands to spread the conflagration. These were the main conditions of
                    the fire. The total number of buildings destroyed was 17,450, and 98,860 people
                    were rendered homeless; of the latter 250 perished in the flames or lost their
                    lives from exposure. Thousands, flying before the flames, sought refuge in the
                    lake, and remained standing in the water for hours as the only means of
                    preservation against the intense heat and the shower of sparks and cinders.
                    Among the buildings destroyed were the custom-houses, post-office, court-house,
                    chamber of commerce, and nearly all the churches, railway stations, hotels,
                    banks, theatres, newspaper offices, and buildings of a quasi-public character.
                    It is estimated that 73 miles frontage of streets was burned over, most of which
                    had been improved with wood block pavements; these were partially destroyed. The
                    total loss has been estimated at $196,000,000,—of which $53,000,000 represented
                    the value of the buildings destroyed, $58,710,000 the personal effects, and the
                    remainder business stocks, produce, and manufactures of every description. On
                    the losses there was an insurance of $88,634,122, of which about one-half was
                    recovered. A vast system of relief was organized, which received the most
                    generous aid from all parts of the world. The money contributions from the
                    various States and from abroad were $4,996,782; of this England contributed
                    nearly $500,000. These funds, which were over and above the contributions of
                    food, clothing, and supplies, were made to last, under the careful and honest
                    administration of a society of citizens, till the close of the year 1876. Out of
                    them temporary homes were provided for nearly 40,000 people; barracks and
                    shelter-houses were erected, workmen were supplied with tools, and womenwith
                    sewing-machines; the sick were cared for and the dead buried; and the poorer
                    classes of Chicago were probably never so comfortable as within two or three
                    years after this fire. The work of rebuilding the city was accomplished with
                    marvellous rapidity. Immediately after the fire the most sanguine persons
                    predicted that it would require at least ten years to restore the buildings that
                    had been destroyed. But within three years the city was provided with buildings
                    equal in capacity, and of twofold value. The work was begun before the cinders
                    were cold, and the population seemed to gain new ambition and new energy from
                    the disaster. The “fire limits” were extended so as to exclude the erection of
                    other than stone, brick, or iron buildings within a large area, and subsequently
                    this prohibition was applied to the entire city. The result has been to make New
                    Chicago the most beautiful city in America in its business centres. Within the
                    first year after the fire, buildings had been erected or started covering a
                    frontage of 51,619 feet, and costing, when finished, $40,133,600. That the work
                    was not spasmodic is shown from the fact that, in the year 1874, the frontage of
                    new buildings was 33,065 feet, and the cost $5,785,441; and in 1875 the frontage
                    was 55,470 feet (about 10⅛ miles) and the cost $9,778,080. The materials used
                    were mostly brick, a pure white sandstone known as Athens (Illinois) marble, a
                    grey sandstone from Ohio and Michigan, and a brown sandstone from Lake Superior.
                    The business and population continued to increase in spite of the
                    disaster,—indeed the ratio of growth became larger. The solidity and permanence
                    of this prosperity were confirmed during the American panic of 1873, when the
                    Chicago banks alone, among those of all large cities, were not compelled to
                    issue certificates of deposit, but continued steadily to pay out current funds.
                    There were few mercantile failures, and the business of the year following the
                    panic still showed an increase. This superior resistance to the general
                    contraction has been attributed to Chicago’s position as the distributing point
                    of the breadstuff’s and provisions of the great North-West. The comparative
                    value of Chicago real-estate is an interesting illustration of its rapid growth.
                    An example case may be cited of one piece of ground in an outlying district
                    which sold in 1868 for $50 an acre, and was resold in 1873 for $1500 an acre.
                    Land obtained 40 years ago from the Government at $1 j¾⅛ an acre, is now worth
                    $10,000 an acre. Business property which was sold in 1865 for $250 a front foot
                    (with a depth of 125 feet), was resold in 1871 for $1500 a front foot. Another
                    piece of property which was valued at $3845 in 1866 was sold in 1872 for
                    $100,000. These instances are not exceptional, but represent fairly the increase
                    of values. The highest price ever paid for business property in Chicago was
                    $52^^· per square foot, but the average value of first-class business property
                    is $25 per square foot. The aggregate transfers of Chicago property in 1873
                    amounted to $78,427,391.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education, Religion, Chanties,</hi> dec.—The public school
                    system in Chicago is regarded as one of the most thorough in the United States.
                    In 1855 the first report of the Board of Education showed the enrolment of 3000
                    pupils; the report of 1875 gave the number as 49,121. There was then an annual
                    expenditure of $827,502 to sustain the schools; there were 57 school buildings;
                    700 teachers were employed; and the annual cost of tuition per pupil was $15j¾.
                    Of the 102,555 persons in Chicago between the ages of six and twenty-one,
                    besides the 49,121 in the public schools, there were 27,071 in private schools,
                    and 15,947 at work. There were 33,547 neither at work nor in school, but only
                    186 of all were found who could neither read nor write. The graded system of
                    study is used, and the schools are classified as follows :—1 high school, course
                    of study four years; 3 division high schools (one for each division in the
                    city), course of study two years; 1 normal school for the preparation especially
                    of teachers; the others are grammar schools and primary schools, the former
                    embracing the four highest grades, and the latter the four lowest grades. The
                    school year consists of ten months, divided into three terms; the hours of
                    attendance in the grammar and primary schools are 9 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.m.</hi> till noon, and 2 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> till 4 p.M. The
                    principal studies in the grammar schools are theory of arithmetic, problems in
                    arithmetic, geography, history of the United States, language, composition,
                    reading, spelling, penmanship; drawing and music are also taught, and the study
                    of German is optional. The course of studies in the high schools is that of the
                    higher academies. Corpora] punishment was abandoned altogether about the year
                    1865, and the reading of the Bible was discontinued in 1875, in deference to the
                    dogmatic differences among the religious sects, the theory of the schools being
                    free and secular. Of other educational institutions, besides 82 ordinary private
                    schools, there are a large number of “Kindergarten” schools, in imitation of the
                    favourite German system for elementary instruction. Among the higher
                    institutions is the university of Chicago, connected with which is the Dearborn
                    Observatory, which has a refracting <pb break="no"

                    Union Theological Seminary, Chicago Theological Seminary, St Ignatius College
                    (Catholic), College of Law, Chicago Musical College, and 7 medical colleges. The
                    principal charitable institutions are the Nursery and Half-Orphan Asylum,
                    Protestant Orphan Asylum, Reform and Industrial School, Erring Women’s Refuge,
                    Foundlings’ Home, Good Samaritan Industrial Home, Home for the Friendless, Old
                    People’s Home, Soldiers’ Home, St Joseph’s Orphan Asylum (Catholic), Lutheran
                    Orphan Asylum, Washingtonian Home (temperance reform), all liberally endowed,
                    and 10 hospitals. There are 83 benevolent and other open societies, 49 masonic
                    atíd other secret societies (exclusive of industrial unions), 14 theatres and
                    opera houses, 84 newspapers (daily and weekly), 25 large hotels, and numerous
                    smaller and private hotels. There are 8 libraries open to the public, of which
                    the Chicago Public Library (established in 1872, and supported by taxation) is
                    the largest; in 1875, three years after it was opened, there were more than
                    40,000 volumes, and the aggregate circulation of books during that year was
                    399,156 volumes, the whole number of visitors 236,021, and the total issue of
                    periodicals 135,355. There are 238 houses of public worship in Chicago,
                    including the mission churches. The churches are divided among the different
                    denominations as follows :—Roman Catholic, 28; Baptist, 25; Presbyterian, 24;
                    Methodist, 22; Episcopal, 18; Lutheran, 18; Congregational, 15; Jewish, 8; Free
                    Baptist, 2 , Christian, 4; Dutch Reformed, 2; Reformed Episcopal, 3;
                    Evangelical, 11; Coloured Methodist, 2; German Methodist, 2; Scandinavian
                    Methodist, 4; Swedenborgian, 5; Unitarian, 4; Universalist, 4; miscellaneous and
                    mission, 37. The value of church property in Chicago (exempt from taxation under
                    the law) is estimated at §12,000,000, of which §5,000,000 is owned by the Roman
                    Catholic Church.</p>

                    >—</hi> Of the public buildings destroyed by the fire, the custom-house and the
                    city hall were still in course of erection in 1876. The N ational Government
                    appropriated §4,000,000 for the f ormer, and the cost of the latter was
                    estimated at §2,500,000. Among the other public buildings are the county jail,
                    bridewell, the water-works, and a large number of enginehouses and
                    police-stations. The total cost of maintaining and enlarging the public works in
                    1875 was §9,368,649, the water system being self-sustaining. The water supply of
                    the city is drawn from two miles out in the lake. A large structure of iron and
                    heavy timber, loaded with stone, and called a “crib,” 98 feet in diameter, was
                    located at that distance from the shore. In the centre compartment an iron
                    cylinder is sunk 64 feet, of which 31 feet are below the bottom of the lake, the
                    water being 33 feet deep. Connected with it are two distinct tunnels leading to
                    two separate sets of pumping works. The tunnels are 66 feet below the level of
                    the shore, one with a diameter of 5, and the other of 10 feet. The latter
                    extends also three miles under the city, so that the two pumping works are
                    removed that distance, and along its line are located 17 large subterranean
                    wells or cisterns for use in case of fires. The cost of these tunnels was
                    §1,500,000. Their capacity is 150,000,000 gallons; the capacity of the pumping
                    engines is 80,000,000 gallons in 24 hours. Telegraphic communication is kept up
                    constantly by cables between the “crib” and pumping works. The water is always
                    pure, cold, and wholesome, and it may be raised to a height of 155 feet for
                    distribution. The consumption for 1875 was 1,449,825,000 gallons. There are over
                    3860 miles of Water pipe, varying from 4 to 24 inches in diameter, 2607 public
                    hydrants, and 2132 stop-cocks. There are over</p>
                <p>240 miles of sewers, which cost §4,236,769, and 609 miles of streets, of which
                    112 miles are paved; of the latter 87 miles are of the wooden block pavement.
                    The side walks of the city measure 725 miles; and there are nearly 60 miles of
                    horse-railways or tramways for intramural transit. The park system of Chicago is
                    one of the most extensive in the world. Two parks are in the south division, one
                    containing 372 acres, and the other 593 acres. The latter has a frontage on Lake
                    Michigan of 1 ⅛ miles, and the two embrace 14 miles of interior drives, and 30
                    miles of walks. The larger of the two is to have a series of interior lakes
                    connected with Lake Michigan, and protected by a pier several hundred feet long,
                    so that they may be reached by boats from the lake. The approaches to these two
                    parks are two roadways, each 200 feet wide, known as Grand and Drexel
                    Boulevards. The former may be compared to the Rotten Row in Hyde Park, London;
                    the latter is modelled after the Avenue 1’Impératrice, Paris, with a continuous
                    stretch of floral ornamentation in the centre. The west division parks, inside
                    the city limits, comprise Humboldt Park, 225 acres; Central Park, 185 acres; and
                    Douglas Park, 180 acres. The ornamentation is varied and elaborate. Lincoln
                    Park, within the northern limits of the city, contains 230 acres, and has a lake
                    shore drive of several miles. All these parks are connected by wide roadways,
                    varying from 150 to 300 feet in width, and giving a continuous drive of 35
                    miles. The parks are supplied with water from a number of Artesian wells.
                    Besides these principal parks, there are the following public places in the
                    different divisions of the city:—Lake Park, 42 acres; Union Park, 11 acres;
                    Jefferson Park, 6 acres; Washington Square, 2 acres; Union Square, 1 acre;
                    Dearborn Park, 1 acre; Ellis Park, 3 acres; Vernon Park, 3 acres; Wicker Park, 3
                    acres. There are thus 1856 acres set aside by Chicago for public grounds. <hi
