                    Zierikzee. At school he was an idle boy, and learned but little; removed,
                    however, to the young and thriving university of Leyden, he seems to have read
                    hard, and to have acquired a respectable knowledge of Greek and jurisprudence.
                    After a visit to France to learn the language, and a turn in Italy with the same
                    object, he returned to Holland, and settled at the Hague, where he began to
                    practise as an advocate. His pleading in defence of a <pb break="no"

                    many clients and some reputation. As Cats so far anticipated the common sense
                    line of argument afterwards adopted in cases of the sort as to be often referred
                    to later as an authority his success was by no means undeserved. A serious love
                    affair occurred about this time, which was broken off on the very eve of
                    marriage by a tertian fever in the bridegroom. The fever defied all attempts at
                    cure for some two years. For medical advice and change of air Cats betook
                    himself to England, where he consulted the highest authorities, and exhausted
                    their pharmacopoeia in vain. He resigned himself to his fate, returned to
                    Zeeland to die, and was cured mysteriously by a strolling quack. He then went to
                    Middleburgh, where (1602) he married a lady named Valkenburg, who bore him five
                    children. At Middleburgh he devoted himself to farming and poetry, retiring
                    gradually from the exercise of his profession, and producing his first great
                    works—the <hi rend="italic">Emblems of Fancy and Love,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Galatea</hi> (a pastoral romance), the <hi rend="italic">Mirror of
                    Past and Present,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Marriage,</hi> and others. In 1621,
                    on the expiration of the twelve years’ truce with Spain, the breaking of the
                    dykes drove him from his farm. He was made pensionary (stipendiary magistrate)
                    of Middleburgh; and two years afterwards he received the same distinction from
                    the larger city of Dort. His <hi rend="italic">Nuptial Ring</hi> was the result
                    of his leisure during this part of his career. In 1627 Cats came to England on a
                    mission to Charles I.; that prince made him a knight, but otherwise the poet’s
                    success as an ambassador was not indicated by any result. In 1635 he was made
                    grand pensionary of Holland; and in 1652, a year after his resignation of this
                    office, the second in the commonwealth, he again figured in England as an
                    unsuccessful envoy. His long Latin oration left Cromwell absolutely unmoved; and
                    Cats returned to Holland altogether to relinquish the practice of state affairs.
                    In the seclusion of his villa of Sorgvliet (Fly-from-Care), near the Hague, he
                    resided till his death, occupied in the composition of his autobiography <hi
                    rend="italic">(Eighty-two Years of My Life)</hi> and of many poems <hi
                    rend="italic">(Old Age and Country Life, Coffins for the Living,</hi> &amp;c.)
                    He was buried by torchlight, and with great ceremony, in the Klooster-Kerk at
                    the Hague, and is still spoken of as “Father Cats” by his countrymen.</p>
                <p>Cats, who lived and reigned with Hooft and Vondel in the golden age of Flemish
                    literature, was an exceedingly prolific writer. His versification is smooth and
                    regular; although somewhat monotonous; his style is homely and familiar; and the
                    naïveté and simplicity of most of that he says, and of his manner of saying it,
                    are peculiarly attractive. He never soared, or tried to soar; he was content to
                    plod on, scattering round him as he went the blunt straight maxims, the shrewd
                    little moralities, the excellent pieces of advice, which his countrymen—of whose
                    practical and prosaic genius he is the highest literary representative— have
                    found so pleasant and so full of profit. Hardly known outside of Holland, among
                    his own people for nearly two centuries he enjoyed an enormous popularity,— his
                    <hi rend="italic">Book of Emblems,</hi> a great favourite with Sir Joshua
                    Reynolds in his childhood, being often styled “The Household Bible.” Of late
                    years, however, his diffuseness and the antiquated character of his matter and
                    diction have come to be regarded as difficulties in the way of study, and he is
                    perhaps rather more renowned than read. A statue to him was erected at Ghent in
                    1829.</p>
