                    bounded on the N. by the feudatory state of Rewah, by the small native states of
                    Bundelkhand, and by the district of Lálatpur in the North-Western Provinces; on
                    the N. and E. by the Chhotá Nágpur division, the Orissa tributary states, and
                    the northern districts of Madras; on the S. by the Godávarí district; and on the
                    S.W., W., and N.W. by the Nizám’s dominions, the Berar districts, and the states
                    comprising the Central India Agency. The Central Provinces are divided into four
                    divisions or commissionerships,—Nágpur, Jabalpur,Nerbudda,and Chhatïsgarh,
                    comprising 19 British districts. Two districts, Ságar and Damoh, lie parallel to
                    each other upon the Vindhyan table-land. To the south of them, in the valley of
                    the Nerbudda and its tributaries, are the districts of Mandlá, Jabalpur,
                    Narsinhpur, Hoshangábád, and a part of Nimár, the rest of it being in the valley
                    of the Tapti. The next range of districts continuing southwards includes Betul,
                    Chhindwárá, Seoni, and Bálághát, occupying the Sátpurá table-land, and attaining
                    a height of about 2000 feet. Still further to the south is the great Nágpur
                    plain, formed by the valleys of the Wardhá and Waingangá, and comprising the
                    districts of Nágpur, Wardhá, Bhandárá, and Chándá. To the east is the
                    Chhatísgarh plain, a low plateau of red soil, containing the districts of
                    Ráipur, Biláspur, and Sambalpur. Last of all, in the extreme south, and almost
                    cut off by forests and wild semi-independent states, is a long strip of
                    territory lining the left bank of the Godávarí, and known as the Upper Godávarí
                    district.</p>

                    The official compiler of the statistical account of the Central Provinces thus
                    describes the physical aspects of the country :—“Within comparatively narrow
                    limits, a plateau and a plain follow each other, and again, in similar sequence,
                    a larger plateau and a larger plain, ending in a mass of hill and forest, which
                    is probably the wildest part of the whole Indian peninsula. Even the
                    continuously leveI portions of this area are broken by isolated peaks and
                    straggling hill ranges; while.its rugged formation and rapid slopes give to the
                    greatest rivers which rise in it, such as the Nerbudda and Tapti, something of
                    the character of mountain torrents. Though the scenery is on too small a scale
                    to compare in sublimity with that of the Himálayas, it is on the other hand as
                    far removed from the monotony of the plains of Hindustán. Not only is it
                    characterized by a constant variety of form and level, but it possesses a
                    diversity of colour peculiar to itself. In no other part of India are the
                    changes of soil and vegetation more rapid and marked than in theNerbudda
                    country. In the pleasant winter months, the eye may range over miles of green
                    corn lands, only broken by low, black, boundary ridges or dark twisting
                    footpaths. The horizon is bounded here and there by hill ranges, which seem to
                    rise abruptly from the plains, but on coming nearer to them, the heavy green of
                    their slopes is found to be divided from the softer hues of the young wheat by
                    broad belts of gravelly soil studded with fine trees. On the Sátpurá plateau the
                    alternations of scenery are even more frequent than in the low country. The
                    hills are higher and more abrupt, the black soil deposits are deeper, and the
                    water supply more abundant. Hence in the midst of the grim rolling plateaus of
                    basalt, there may often be found little valleys cultivated like gardens,—oases
                    of sugar-cane and opium, which, but for their inaccessibility, would tempt away
                    the best cultivators of the plains. It is thought that in some of these upland
                    basins, tea, coffee, and other delicate plants might be raised with success, but
                    the obstacles which have so long retarded the settlement of these plateaus,
                    though partially smoothed away, still exist, and can only be surmounted by
                    patient and continued energy. Much has been done to open out the country of late
                    years. Railways from both coasts now connect the plateau with the eastern and
                    western seaboards, and form the central link of communication between Calcutta
                    and Bombay.”</p>
                <p>The principal rivers of the Central Provinces are the Nerbudda, Tapti, Wardhá,
                    and Waingangá, but, owing to falls and rocky rapids, they are navigable only at
                    certain times of the year and for short distances, As a means of communication
                    they are practically useless. The chief lines of road are the following :—</p>
                <p>(1) From Jabalpur to Ságar <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Damoh, 116 miles; (2) from
                    Jabalpur to Ráipur <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Mandlá, 203 miles; (3) from Ságar
                    to Karell on the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, 76 miles; (4) from Narsinhpur
                    to Chhindwárá, 91 miles; (5) from Hoshangabad to Betul, 681 milθs; (6) from
                    Nágpur to Ráipur, J 74 miles; (7) from Nágpur to Chhindwárá, 78 miles; (8) from
                    Nágpur to Betul, 1041 miles; (9) from Nágpur to Chándá, 96 miles; (10) from
                    Ráipur to Sambalpur, 167 miles; (11) from Chándá to Sironchá, 121 miles.</p>
                <p>The country is intersected by the Great Indian Peninsular and East Indian
                    Railways. The Great Indian Peninsular Railway from Bombay enters the Central
                    Provinces near Barhanpur, and runs north-east to Jabalpur, where it joins the
                    East India line from Allahábád and Calcutta. A branch of the Great Indian
                    Peninsular Railway, which leaves the main line at Bhasáwal in Kandesh, enters
                    the Central Provinces at Wardhá, and runs to Nágpur. A state line is in course
                    of construction to connect this railway with the newly-opened coal-fields of
                    Chándá.</p>
                <p>The population of the 19 districts of the Central Provinces was returned by the
                    census of 1872 at 8,201,519, made up as follows:—Hindus 5,879,950, or 71*69 per

                    1872 returns 39 towns containing upwards of 5000 inhabitants. Of these 26 have

                <p>The improved means of communication afforded by the railways and roads have
                    rapidly developed the trade of the Central Provinces. In 1863-64 the imports and
                    exports were valued at about four millions sterling. In 1868-69 their value had
                    risen to six and three-quarter millions sterling. In 1873-74 the ascertained
                    imports of the Central Provinces amounted to 117,761 tons, value £4,399,134, and
                    the exports to 209,157 tons, value £3,148,598; total of imports and exports

                    derived from imperial, and £203,956 from provincial taxation. The civil
                    expenditure in the same year amounted to £904,670, of which £440,232 was on
                    imperial, and £464,438 on provincial account. Of the total revenue £603,056, or
                    just one-half, was derived from the land. There were 196 criminal and 119 civil
                    courts at work in 1873-74. The regular police consisted of a force of 7539
                    officers and men, besides a municipal police of 988. The total cost of the
                    regular and municipal police in 1873-74 amounted to £130,674. The troops
                    quartered in the Central Provinces are as follows Europeans—3 batteries of
                    artillery (with 18 guns), and 2 regiments and 1 company of infantry; natives—2
                    regiments of cavalry and 6∣∙ regiments of infantry. The European troops numbered
