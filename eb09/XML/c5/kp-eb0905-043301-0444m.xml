                <p><label type="entry">CHARTER-PARTY</label>, a written or partly written and partly
                    printed contract, by which a ship is let or hired for the conveyance of goods on
                    a specified voyage, or for a definite period. By the terms of this contract the
                    owners declare the ship to be “tight, stanch, strong, and every way fitted for
                    the voyage;” and they are accordingly liable in damages to the merchant or
                    charterer, if the ship be unseaworthy, or if they fail to provide her with any
                    necessary equipment or clearances. The shipowners are further bound to have the
                    vessel ready to receive her cargo at the stipulated time; and they are
                    responsible for the proper stowage of the goods received on board. On the
                    loading being completed, the vessel must proceed without delay to her appointed
                    destination; and should she unnecessarily deviate from the regular course of the
                    voyage (a proceeding which might vitiate the merchant’s insurances), the owners
                    are liable in damages to the merchant. On arrival at the port of destination the
                    goods are to be delivered “agreeably to bills of lading,” the responsibility of
                    the shipowners in this particular being limited by the usual exception against
                    loss or damage by “the act of God, the queen’s enemies, fire, and all and every
                    other dangers and accidents of the seas, rivers, and navigation of whatever
                    nature and kind soever.” The freight payable to the shipowners is the amount
                    specified in the charter-party, which may in certain cases be either more or
                    less than the rates mentioned in the bills of lading,—the charterer having
                    usually the right of sub-letting the ship in part or in whole to other shippers,
                    on terms agreed upon between themselves, which it is customary to specify in
                    their separate bills of lading, without prejudice to the original agreement. In
                    such cases, however, the shipowners’ lien on the goods for freight extends only
                    to the amount specified in the bills of lading; and they must look to the
                    charterer personally for any further sum which may be due to them.</p>
                <p>The charterer, on his part, is bound to furnish the cargo at the port of loading,
                    and to take delivery of the same at the port of discharge within specified
                    periods, which are usually called “laydays.” He may detain the vessel for a
                    certain fixed time beyond the stipulated laydays on payment of a specified sum
                    as “demurrage” for each day the ship is so detained. The laydays commence on the
                    ship being ready to load or to discharge, even although it may happen from the
                    port being crowded, or from similar causes, that she cannot at the time be
                    placed in a berth where it would be convenient or practicable for the merchant
                    to begin these operations.</p>
                <p>The vessel is not bound to proceed nearer to her port of loading and discharging
                    than “she may safely get;” and this generally means that she is not bound to go
                    nearer to a loading port than to the point from which she can safely get away
                    again with her cargo on board. The charterer, therefore, must pay the expense of
                    necessary lighterage in loading or discharging, unless there be a specific
                    agreement to the contrary.</p>
                <p>It is usual to insert in charter-parties a clause by which the parties bind
                    themselves to fulfil their contract under a specified sum as penalty for
                    non-performance; but the amount of this penalty is not the absolute limit of the
                    damages which either party may be entitled to recover under any of the other
                    conditions which may have been violated. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
