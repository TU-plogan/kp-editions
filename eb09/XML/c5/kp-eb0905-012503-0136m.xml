                    acquired more than a smattering of the English language. In his eighteenth year
                    he was seized with small-pox, and totally deprived of sight. This misfortune led
                    to his becoming a professional bard or itinerant minstrel. His benefactress
                    having provided him with a harp, a horse, and attendant, he began his avocation
                    in his twenty-second, year by visiting the houses of the surrounding gentry, his
                    wanderings being chiefly confined to Connaught. It is said, however, that he
                    never played for hire, and that at the houses where he visited he was welcomed
                    more as a friend than as an itinerant minstrel. To the family of M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> Dermott Roe he was attached by the tenderest ties of
                    gratitude and affection, and for them were composed some of his sweetest
                    strains. The number of Carolan’s musical pieces, to nearly all of which he
                    composed verses, is said to exceed 200. He died on the 25th March 1738, and was
                    buried at Kilronan. His poetical <hi rend="italic">Remains</hi> in the original
                    Irish, with English metrical translations by Thomas Furlong, are printed in
                    Hardiman’s <hi rend="italic">Irish Minstrelsy</hi> (1831). Many of his songs are
                    preserved among the Irish MSS. in the British Museum.</p>
