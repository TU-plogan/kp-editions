                    tested and approved, the Pope decrees the canonization.</p>
                <p>The term was not introduced till the 12th century. The first person who availed
                    himself of it was Udalric, bishop of Constance, in his letter to Pope Calixtus
                    II. relative to the canonization of Bishop Conrad. The act, however, dates from
                    a much more remote antiquity. The ceremony was originally only a commemoration
                    of the martyrs, whose assistance was invoked in the name of the church militant
                    to which they had belonged. Originally bishops decided whether or not the
                    candidate had fairly vindicated his claim to the honour; but they only acted as
                    the organ of public opinion. Orthodoxy was certainly considered of great
                    importance, as may be seen from the fact of the exclusion of Origen and
                    Tertullian, those great though erratic geniuses of the early church, from the
                    title. As soon as the power of Rome was once more upon the ascendant in Europe,
                    the popes naturally appropriated to themselves the important privilege of
                    canonization. None but martyrs were at first admitted into the category of
                    saints, but in course of time the privilege was extended to some of those pious
                    men who, without having sealed their testimony with their blood, had evinced the
                    sincerity of their belief by the purity of their practice. In later times,
                    however, the Pope assumed the right of admitting into the sacred catalogue
                    potentates whose claim seems to have largely consisted in their support of his
                    temporal interests. Notable instances of this are the names of the emperor Henry
                    I., canonized by Eugenius III., and Edward the Confessor of England, canonized
                    by Alexander III.</p>
                <p>So long as the right of according the honours of canonization was vested in the
                    bishops, there was no public guarantee that it had been exercised with rigour or
                    discretion. But when it passed into the hands of the popes, means were taken to
                    prevent any but really meritorious persons from being enrolled in the holy
                    category. Even then, however, a very simple ordeal sufficed. A few miracles
                    reported to have happened at a tomb were enough to give its inmate a claim to
                    have his name inscribed in the canon of the mass among the number of the happy.
                    A Roman Catholic writer, the editor of Butler’s <hi rend="italic">Lives of the
                    Saints</hi> (ed. 1866) states that “the proceedings of a beatification or
                    canonization are long, rigorous, and expensive.” It has been asserted that the
                    discovery of the last-named feature of the process prevented the somewhat
                    parsimonious Henry VII. of England from carrying out his desire for the
                    canonization of King Henry VI.; Bacon, however <hi rend="italic">(History of
                    Henry VJI.),</hi> inclines rather to the belief that the obstacle here was the
                    pope’s fear it would “diminish the estimation of that kind of honour” to give it
                    to such “a simple man.” At a later period, when the ceremony was only performed
                    after a considerable lapse of time, reasons were always hard to be found why the
                    saintly candidate should be rejected. In modern times the court of Rome has
                    shown itself extremely averse to promiscuous canonization; and since the days of
                    Benedict XIV., the promoter of the faith, popularly known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">advocatus diaboli,</hi> or devil’s advocate, has exercised extreme
                    severity in sifting the claims of aspirants. It is further necessary that a
                    period of a hundred years should elapse between the death of the saint and his
                    admission into the calendar. But the more pious men of every country in Europe
                    have of late evinced so little ambition to secure this posthumous compliment,
                    that it may now be considered to have gone fairly out of fashion. It is also
                    probable that the far more stringent rules of evidence and the growth of
                    physical science have tended to render proof of the supernatural much more
                    difficult than it seemed to be to our mediaeval forefathers. It may be observed
                    that the Lutheran divines of the century after the Reformer’s decease frequently
                    refer to him as B. (i.e., <hi rend="italic">Beatu«)</hi> Lutherus.</p>
                <p>On the day of canonization the Pope and cardinals officiate in white; while St
                    Peter’s church is illuminated and hung with rich tapestry, upon which the arms
                    of the Pope, and of the prince or state requiring the canonization, are
                    embroidered in gold and silver.</p>
                <p>Beatification, which frequently precedes canonization, gives an inferior <hi
                    rend="italic">status</hi> to the deceased person, and appears rather to
                    recommend him as a fit object for the <hi rend="italic">cultus</hi> of his
                    co-religionists than to enjoin it.</p>
