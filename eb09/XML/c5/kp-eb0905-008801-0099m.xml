                    this century. Secret societies, calling themselves by this or a similar name,
                    had indeed previously existed in various parts of Europe; but it was in Italy,
                    towards the close of the Napoleonic wars, that these first began to assume an
                    historic importance. In 1808 many republicans, discontented alike with the
                    Bourbon and the Bonapartist government in Naples, had retired to the mountain
                    recesses of the Abruzzi and Calabria. At first engaged only in an isolated
                    resistance to the authorities, they began to organize themselves. They took the
                    name of Carbonari, a name suggested by the trade of charcoal-burning extensively
                    pursued in those regions, in which many of them were engaged. From this trade,
                    too, but especially from the Christian religion, and above all from the
                    crucifixion of Christ, they adopted a system of mystic rites and a symbolic
                    phraseology, by which they concealed from the uninitiated, but all the more
                    vividly expressed to the initiated, the real political aims of the society,
                    while its apparently religious character served to attract many whom its
                    revolutionary secrecy might have repelled. A lodge of Carbonari was <hi
                    rend="italic">baracca</hi> (a hut); an ordinary meeting, <hi rend="italic"
                    >vendita</hi> (a sale); a meeting of importance, <hi rend="italic">alta
                    vendita</hi><hi rend="italic">;—</hi> these terms being borrowed from the trade
                    of charcoal-burning. But for words to express the inner purpose of the society
                    they borrowed from religion. Christ, as the highest victim of tyranny, was the
                    lamb that had been put to death by the wolf; they were sworn to avenge his
                    death; and so the destruction of the wolf to avenge the slaughter of the lamb
                    became the symbolic watchword of the society. There were four grades in the
                    society; and the ceremonies of initiation were characterized by many mystic
                    rites, through which the real meaning began only gradually to appear. Many
                    efforts were made to bring about a complete organization of the Carbonari in
                    Italy, by the institution of a central power which should control the separate
                    societies of the various provinces, but they failed. Politicians soon discovered
                    how easily capital could be made of such societies, and negotiations were
                    entered into by the Bourbons to unite the Carbonari in an effort to overthrow
                    the French Government in Naples. Accordingly, for two years they carried on a
                    desultory warfare with King Murat, who at last, taking the matter thoroughly in
                    hand, drove them into the mountains, from which they had emerged, and suppressed
                    them for a time. Capobianco, their leader, was treacherously arrested and put to
                    death. Ere long, the Carbonari reappeared and helped towards the final overthrow
                    of the French power in Naples. But Ferdinand, who had courted them during his
                    misfortunes, proved false to them on his return to power, though they were
                    moderate enough in their political aims, being ready to content themselves with
                    the establishment in Naples of the constitution that had been enjoyed in Sicily
                    under English supremacy. Henceforward they began to conspire against the Bourbon
                    Government, and indeed soon spread over the whole of Italy, being more and more
                    regarded as the champions of the liberal and national cause. They were the
                    principal authors of the Neapolitan revolution of 1820, of the disturbances in
                    the Papal States of the same year, and of the Piedmontese revolution of 1821.
                    Previously recruited chiefly from the lower classes, the Carbonari now counted
                    in their ranks almost all the intelligent and patriotic population of Italy, <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0100-0089"/> especially the middle classes, the officers of
                    the army, the students at the universities, the artists, and even the
                    priests,—to the number, it is said, of nearly 700,000. Unable, however, to
                    resist the military power of Austria, backed by a European congress, the
                    revolution and the Carbonari along with it were crushed, and many, such as
                    Silvio Pellico, implicated or supposed to be implicated in their conspiracies,
                    perished or languished in Austrian dungeons. They never quite revived in Italy;
                    though active again in 1830 and 1831, they were forthwith superseded by the more
                    energetic and more extreme “young Italy” of Mazzini.</p>
                <p>It was about 1820 that Carbonarism began to take root in France. There the
                    organization was more perfect, as in addition to what had been attained in
                    Italy, there was a supreme board, presided over by the veteran Lafayette, and a
                    complete hierarchy of societies, by which the will of the chief was
                    communicated, from higher to lower, to the smallest lodges in the extremities of
                    France; these were <hi rend="italic">ventes particulières, ventes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">centrales,</hi><hi rend="italic">hautes ventes, ventes
                    suprêmes.</hi> It made great progress in France, especially among the students
                    and sub-officers of the army. The example of Spain and Italy having incited the
                    French Carbonari to immediate action, attempts to raise an insurrection were
                    made in 1821 at Belfort, Thouars, La Rochelle, and other towns. They were all
                    immediately suppressed, but not without revealing to what extent the Carbonari
                    had spread over France. It was at the trial of Boriès, one of those concerned in
                    the rising at La Rochelle, that the nature and organization of the Carbonari in
                    France became publicly known, and attention was drawn to the mutual fidelity
                    prevalent among them, as none but those immediately concerned in the
                    insurrection could be brought to trial. Though completely defeated in 1821,
                    French Carbonarism did not die out, but continued to be an active centre of
                    revolutionary discontent till 1830, when, after contributing to the July
                    revolution, most of the members adhered to the government of Louis Philippe For
                    several years after, traces of it existed in some French towns, but these are of
                    no importance.</p>
