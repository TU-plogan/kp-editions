                        >Cytlιera</hi><hi rend="italic">(Κύθηρα),</hi> one of the Ionian islands,
                    situated at a distance of not less than 150 miles from Zante, but only about 8
                    miles from Cape Malea on the southern coast of Greece. Its length from N. to S.
                    is nearly 20 miles, and its greatest breadth about 12; its area is 114 square
                    miles. The general character of the surface is rocky and broken; but streams
                    abound, and there are various parts of considerable fertility. Two caves, of
                    imposing dimensions, and adorned with stalactites of great beauty, are the most
                    notable among its natural peculiarities; one is situated at the seaward end of
                    the glen of the Mylopotamus, and the other, named Santa Sophia, about two hours
                    ride from Capsali. Less of the ground is cultivated and more of it is in pasture
                    land than in any other of the seven islands. Some wine and corn are produced,
                    and the quality of the olive oil is good. The honey is still highly prized, as
                    it was in remote antiquity; and a considerable quantity of cheese is
                    manufactured from the milk of the goat. Salt, flax, cotton, and currants are
                    also mentioned among the produce. The people are industrious, and many of them
                    go to seek employment as labourers in the Morea and Asia Minor. Unfortunately
                    the island has hardly a regular harbour on any part of the coast; and from its
                    situation at the meeting as it were of seas, the currents in the neighbourhood
                    are strong, and storms are very frequent. The best anchorage is at San Nicolo,
                    at the middle of the eastern side of the island. The principal village is
                    Capsali, a place of about 1500 inhabitants, at the southern extremity, with a
                    bishop, and several convents and churches; the lesser hamlets are Modari,
                    Potamo, and San Nicolo. There are comparatively few traces of antiquity, and the
                    identification of the ancient cities has not been satisfactorily accomplished.
                    The capital bore the same name as the island, and consisted of a maritime and an
                    inland portion, distant from each other about 10 stadia. The site of the upper
                    city is probably at Paleopoli, about three miles from the present port of
                    Avlemona; but no trace can be discovered of the famous shrine of the Venus of
                    Cythera, whose worship had been introduced from Syria, and ultimately spread
                    over Greece. The present inhabitants of the island are very badly educated. The
                    number of priests is out of all proportion to the population, and no fewer than
                    260 churches or chapels have been counted. Spiridion Vlandi, author of an
                    Italian and Romaic lexicon, published at Venice in 1806, is one of the few
                    Cerigotes who have made appearance in literature. In 1857 the total population
                    was 13,256, the excess of females being 1028; it appears now to number about
                    10,000. At a very early date Cythera was the seat of a Phoenician settlement,
                    established in connection with the purple fishery of the neighbouring coast. For
                    a time dependent on Argos, it became afterwards an important possession of the
                    Spartans, who annually despatched a governor named the Cytherodices. In the
                    Peloponnesian War, Nicias occupied the island, and in 393 it was captured by
                    Conon the Athenian. By Augustus it was bestowed on Eurycles. Its modern history
                    has been very much the same as that of the other Ionian Islands; but it was
                    subject to Venice for a much shorter period—from 1717 to 1797. See the works
