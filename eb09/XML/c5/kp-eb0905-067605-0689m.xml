                    iodine, phosphorus, and sulphur. Chloral deliquesces in the air, and, like
                    aldehyde, is converted by water into a hydrate, with evolution of heat; it
                    combines also with ethylic alcohol and its homologues, and the derived
                    mercaptans. An ammoniacal solution of nitrate of silver is reduced by chloral;
                    sulphites of the alkalies form with it crystalline compounds; and nascent
                    hydrogen, by replacing its three atoms of chlorine, converts it into aldehyde
                    (Personne, <hi rend="italic">Ann. Ch. Pharm.,</hi> clvii. 113). By means of
                    phosphorus pentachloride, chlorine can be substituted for the oxygen of chloral,

                <p>Chloral is prepared by passing dry chlorine into absolute alcohol; the latter
                    must be cooled at first, but towards the end of the operation has to be heated
                    nearly to boiling. The alcohol becomes converted finally into a syrupy fluid,
                    from which chloral is procured by treatment with sulphuric acid. The action of
                    chlorine upon alcohol is complex;— first aldehyde, CH <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>A mixture of starch or sugar with manganese peroxide and hydrochloric acid may be

                    to be characteristic only of the alcoholate. The purest samples of chloral
                    hydrate present the appearance of ordinary alum broken into fragments, are

                    pure chloral hydrate as 50° to 51°, the boiling point as 99° C. It can be
                    distilled unchanged at 120° C.; but when heated with sulphuric acid it is
                    converted into anhydrous chloral and <hi rend="italic">chloralide,</hi> C <hi

                    causes a considerable degree of cold; and, as with camphor, small fragments of
                    it placed on the surface of water exhibit gyratory movements. An aqueous
                    solution should bo neutral or nearly so, and should give but a faint milkiness
                    when boiled with silver nitrate. A drop or two of ammonia added to solutions
                    assists in their preservation. Chloral hydrate may be detected in the presence
                    of other substances by adding an alkali and heating, when chloroform is evolved,
                    which may be collected in a receiver; this process can be employed for the
                    estimation of the commercial hydrate. When ammonium sulphide is added to a
                    solution of pure chloral hydrate, the liquid turns red, and then becomes rapidly
                    brown and thick; the presence of oily impurities in a solution is shown by the
                    brown colour it acquires when shaken up with concentrated sulphuric acid.
                    Chloral hydrate has the property of checking the decomposition of a great number
                    of albuminous substances, such as milk and meat; and a mixture of it with
                    glycerine, according to Personne, is suitable for the preservation of anatomical
                    preparations. When heated with concentrated glycerine to a temperature of
                    110°-230° C., chloral hydrate yields chloroform, CHCl <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>, and formate of allyl, HCO(OC <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H <hi

                    acid, is to render it darker.</p>
                <p>The breaking up of chloral hydrate, in the presence of alkalies, with the
                    production of chloroform and formates, led Liebreich to the conjecture that a
                    similar decomposition might be produced in the blood; and hence his introduction
                    of the drug, in 1869, as an anaesthetic and hypnotic <hi rend="italic">{Compt.
                    rend.,</hi> 1869, lxix,, 486). It has been supposed that its physiological
                    action may be due to formic acid as well as to chloroform set free in the blood,
                    the effects of the formic acid being attributed to the production from it of
                    carbon dioxide. Personne, however, has administered sodium formate to, dogs,
                    without perceiving in them the slightest anaesthetic phenomena, or the abnormal
                    formation of carbon dioxide <hi rend="italic">(Compt. rend.,</hi> 1874, Ixxviii.
                    129). He considers that chloroform is set free in the blood, but is not
                    eliminated as such, being converted into sodium chloride and formate <hi
                    rend="italic">(ibud.</hi> 1869, lxix., 983); the prolonged action of chloral on
                    the animal economy he explains on the supposition that, chloroform being
                    produced at the expense of the alkali of the albumen of the blood, the latter,
                    which may be regarded as an amide, forms with the trichlorinated aldehyde
                    chloral a compound which, by the gradual action of fhe blood, affords a
                    continuous supply of chloroform.</p>
                <p>Tanret, on the other hand, suggests that as chloral hydrate, when made alkaline
                    with caustic potash, yields in the presence of the oxidizing agent potassium
                    permanganate the formate, chloride, and carbonate of potassium, together with
                    carbon monoxide, the alkalinity of the serum of the blood may determine a
                    similar decomposition of chloral hydrate, the physiological effects of which may
                    therefore be ascribed to poisoning or deoxidation of arterial blood by carbon
                    monoxide ∖ <hi rend="italic">Compt. rend.,</hi> Ixxix. 662; <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The first effect of a dose of chloral hydrate is to produce a state of congestion
                    of the brain, as evidenced by the condition of the retinal vessels; after 5 or
                    10 minutes, contraction of the vessels is observed, the retina becomes of a pale
                    pink colour, and drowsiness ensues; when this wears off, the retinal and
                    cerebral vessels resume their accustomed size (Dr W. A. Hammond). In cases of
                    death from chloral, the cerebral vessels have been found much congested.</p>
                <p>The effects of chloral hydrate vary with different individuals; but, as a rule, a
                    dose of 20 grains acts in a healthy subject as a mild sedative of the sensory
                    nervous system, and produces, about half or three quarters of an hour after it
                    has been taken, a light, refreshing, and normal sleep, without causing headache
                    or disturbance of the respiration and pulse.</p>
                <p>Taken in large quantities chloral hydrate is a powerful soporific; it perceptibly
                    lowers the temperature of the body, and diminishes the frequency and force of
                    the heart’s action, probably from paralysis of its intrinsic motorganglia;
                    whilst the rate of respiration is lessened, apparently through affection of the
                    medulla oblongata. Excessive doses produce complete insensibility, and diminish,
                    and at last abolish reflex excitability; pallor, coldness of the extremities,
                    lividity, and muscular relaxation ensue; and death may result from cardiac
                    syncope.</p>
                <p>Μ Oré is the originator of a plan for performing operations during anaesthesia
                    produced by the intra-venous injection of chloral hydrate. He shows <hi
                    rend="italic">(Compt. rend.,</hi> 1874, Ixxviii. 515, 651) that it may be
                    harmlessly injected, and that when thus brought into immediate contact with the
                    blood, it effects complete anaesthesia of long duration, and is a rapid and
                    effectual remedy for tetanus. Chloral hydrate sometimes fails to afford relief
                    from suffering, and when it does not induce sleep, may occasion excitement and
                    delirium. In some cases a dose has produced an eruption of urticaria. It must be
                    administered with caution to children, and to patients having disease of the
                    heart and of the digestive tract, certain affections of the bronchi, or
                    hysteria. It appears that chloral cannot be decomposed and thrown off by a
                    healthy body at a greater rate than from 5 to 7 grains an hour (Richardson, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lancet,</hi> 1871, 1, 209); and as the limit of the dose that can
                    be safely taken is not affected by the customary use of the drug, as in the case
                    of opium, but rather the reverse, its incautious employment in large quantities,
                    and the practise of habitually resorting to it to gain relief from
                    sleeplessness, from neuralgia, and from the effects of alcoholic excess, have in
                    not a few instances led to fatal results. In consequence of this risk medical
                    practitioners now use it less extensively. The continued use of chloral hydrate,
                    too, is apt to cause a hyperaemic condition of the skin, diffuse inflammatory
                    erythema of the face and chest, conjunctivitis, and interference with
                    respiration; and may bring on deep melancholy, weakness of will, and inability
                    to sleep without the drug.</p>
                <p>Chloral hydrate is of special value as a soporific where opium is inadmissible,
                    as in the case of children, in uraemia, and in some fevers, It is used in
                    delirium tremens, rabies, severe chorea, acute mania, and phthisis, as well as
                    in dyspnoea, pertussis, cholera, sea-sickness, cancer, chronic rheumatism, and
                    gastralgia, and in parturition and eclampsia; <pb break="no"

                    muscular relaxation. Its antagonism to strychnia was first pointed out by
                    Liebreich <hi rend="italic">(Compt.</hi><hi rend="italic">rend.,</hi> 1870, lxx.
                    403). When administered to rabbits it has been found to be a remedy for
                    poisonous doses of strychnia (Bennett, <hi rend="italic">Ediιι. Med.
                    Journ.,</hi> 1870, xvi. 262); but Oré has shown <hi rend="italic">{Gaz.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Médis,</hi><hi rend="italic">de Paris,</hi> 1872, p. 401) that the
                    hypodermic injection of that drug is of no avail in the case of rabbits poisoned
                    with fatal doses of chloral hydrate. Numerous experiments have led to the
                    conclusions that “chloral hydrate is more likely to save life after a fatal dose
                    of strychnia, than strychnia is to save life after a fatal dose of chloral
                    hydrate;” that after a dose of strychnine has produced tetanic convulsions,
                    these convulsions may be reduced in force and frequency, and life may be saved,
                    by means of the influence of chloral hydrate; but that though the effects of a
                    poisonous dose of the hydrate may be mitigated, the coma produced by its action
                    on the brain is not removed by strychnia (Bennett, Report in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brit. Med. Jοur.,</hi> 1875, 1, 97; Ogilvie Will, <hi rend="italic">Edin. Med.
                    Jοur.,</hi> April 1875, 907). Chloral hydrate modifies the action of a fatal
                    dose of extract of Calabar bean, but is of little service if given some time
                    after the latter. The effects of chloralism are combated by provoking emesis,
                    and by stimulating freely.</p>
