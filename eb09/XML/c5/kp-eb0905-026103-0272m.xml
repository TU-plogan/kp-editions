                <p><label type="entry">CAVALRY</label>. From the earliest dates, at which there is
                    any record of armed men being systematically trained and organized, cavalry has
                    always formed an integral part of every army, although the relative size and
                    importance of the arm has varied, according to the nature of the country and the
                    peculiarities of its inhabitants. Egypt probably affords the earliest historical
                    records of any distinct attempt at military organization. In that country
                    cavalry and horsemanship were held in high repute, according to the prophet
                    Isaiah. Diodorus of Sicily tells us that Osyman-dias led 20,000 cavalry against
                    the rebels in Bactriana, and that twenty-five generations elapsed between
                    Osyman-dias and Sesostris, who seems to have been the chief founder of Egyptian
                    greatness, and to have lived at a period indistinctly laid down in history, but
                    certainly long prior to the Trojan war. In early times chariots appear to have
                    been associated with the horsemen of an army, although perfectly distinct from
                    them. Frequent references are made in the Bible to “chariots and horsemen;” and
                    Josephus states that the army of Israelites that escaped from Egypt numbered
                    50,000 horsemen and 600 chariots of war. Herodotus frequently speaks of the
                    cavalry arm, and Hippocrates mentions the existence of a corps of young women
                    whose breasts were seared to enable them to use the bow and javelin. Plato
                    likewise speaks somewhat vaguely of a corps of young ladies about 500 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The existence of Amazons as a race has never been
                    supported by even moderately authentic testimony, although by some they were
                    believed to live on the River Thermodon in the north of Asia Minor.</p>
                <p>The first authentic account that we have of cavalry being regularly organized is
                    given by Xenophon, who states that in the first Messenian war, 743 B.C.,
                    Lycurgus formed his cavalry in divisions. Some hundred years later, in 371 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Epaminondas raised a corps of 5000 cavalry, and from
                    this date it may be said the arm was much cultivated throughout Greece, until
                    Philip and Alexander of Macedon raised it to a great pitch of excellence. Both
                    these monarchs were indebted for several of their greatest successes to the
                    prowess of their cavalry; and the exploits of Alexander’s 7000 horsemen at the
                    battle of Arbela, 331 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> in which he signally
                    defeated Darius, may well serve as an example for future generations. The Greek
                    cavalry were divided into heavy, or “cataphracti,” and light, or “me
                    cataphracti.” To these Alexander added a third class, termed “dimachae,” who
                    were trained to fight on foot or on horseback. After the death of Alexander the
                    Great cavalry appears to have fallen into comparative disuse until the days of
                    Hannibal and the Carthaginians. Dire experience, more especially the defeats of
                    the Ticinus and the Trebia, taught the Romans the value of cavalry; and in the
                    latter days of the republic it became the most popular and highly favoured
                    service of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0273-0262"/> the Roman armies. According to Vegetius, the
                    Roman cavalry was organized into ten troops or squadrons, forming a regiment of
                    726 horses, either intended to act independently or, more usually, attached to
                    some special legion. As the Roman empire increased and brought many tributaries
                    under its flag, the cavalry began to be drawn from those countries whose
                    inhabitants were specially devoted to equestrian pursuits. The Gauls for many
                    years furnished the principal part of the cavalry both in the Carthaginian and
                    in the Roman armies, and appear to have rivalled the Numidians in efficiency.
                    Strange to say, saddles were never used until the time of Constantine, and
                    stirrups were introduced by the Franks about the middle of the õth century.</p>
                <p>In the Middle Ages the unwillingness to intrust any military power to the serfs
                    rendered the upper classes the only soldiers, and as these did not deign to
                    fight on foot cavalry became the basis of European armies. The knights and
                    esquires were the nucleus, mounted attendant bowmen and pikemen being the
                    .secondary portion of the fighting power.</p>
                <p>The invention of gunpowder and the decline of the feudal system wrought a change
                    in military tactics, and from the organization of a standing army by Charles II.
                    of France, in 1445, cavalry as it now exists may be said to date. As in early
                    days, each country produced a species of cavalry in accordance with the
                    characteristics of its inhabitants and the nature of its institutions. From
                    Hungary came the Hussars, whose name is derived from the Hungarian word “Husz,”
                    twenty, and “ar,” pay. Marshal Luxembourg appears to have been the first person
                    who disciplined and organized these hussars, and in 1692 they were attached to
                    his army as light troops and reconnoitrers. Carabineers were of a somewhat
                    earlier date, and seem to have come originally from Basque and Germany. The word
                    carbine has been traced to an Arab word “karab,” but this derivation is somewhat
                    doubtful. Originally it was the custom for carabineers or horsemen armed with
                    firearms to mount infantry behind them, and in 1543 King Louis of Nassau made
                    use of this hybrid force in his operations against Bergen.</p>
                <p>A few years later, in 1554, Marshal De Brissac formed a corps of mounted infantry
                    and called them Dragoons, thus justifying Dr Johnson’s definition of the word as
                    “a man who serves indifferently either on foot or on horseback.” The actual
                    origin of the term dragoon has been ascribed to the dragon’s head which, as a
                    rule, adorned the muzzle of the firearm with which these horsemen were
                    armed,—although this derivation again cannot be regarded as very certain. As
                    firearms became more generally used, so the tactics and organization of cavalry
                    underwent modifications. In the time of Francis I. the gens-d’armes of France
                    were reckoned the best cavalry in Europe, and were formed in single rank.
                    Somewhat later the Spaniards, and afterwards the Germans, carried off the palm;
                    they went to the other extreme as regards formation, being formed in six and
                    eight ranks, and were composed of a mixed force of arquebusiers and lancers. At
                    this time military leaders failed to appreciate the true mission of cavalry, and
                    assigned too great importance to the effect of firearms, too little to that of
                    “cold steel.” Maurice of Nassau was the first to train cavalry with a view to
                    their mobility, and teach them to act by separate bodies, and in distinct lines.
                    Now for the first time cavalry was organized by regiments, each regiment being
                    composed of four squadrons, formed in five ranks, and numbering about 1000
                    horses. During the Thirty Years’ War, from 1618 to 1648, the lance as a cavalry
                    weapon gradually disappeared, partly on account of the amount of training which
                    is necessary to insure its efficient use, and partly on account of the
                    exaggerated value attached to firearms as cavalry weapons. After Maurice of
                    Nassau, Gustavus Adolphus appears as the next great cavalry leader, and was so
                    successful in the employment of his cuirassiers and dragoons—into which two
                    divisions his horsemen were classed—that all other European nations began to
                    imitate him, and adopted his formation in three ranks. After the death of
                    Gustavus Adolphus, until the wars with the Turks, the French appear to have been
                    the most instructed and efficient in the employment of cavalry. The wars of
                    Louis XIII. and Louis XIV. soon developed military art, and such great leaders
                    as Turenne, Condé, Montecuculi, and Marlborough made their name. At this period
                    defensive armour for cavalry was abolished, and lances were unknown except among
                    irregular horsemen, who came from the plains of Poland and Russia. Excellent,
                    however, as the French cavalry at this period undoubtedly was, it could not vie
                    with that of the Turks either as regards its own efficiency or the results that
                    it achieved. So formidable and so much feared were the Turkish horsemen that the
                    Russian infantry when opposed to them invariably carried <hi rend="italic"
                    >chevaux-de-fιdse</hi> in light carts for their protection. It has been very
                    justly remarked that no other cavalry has ever obtained such an ascendency as
                    this over infantry.</p>
                <p>Hitherto but little attention had been paid to the employment of cavalry off the
                    field of battle for purposes of reconnoitring, although it had long exercised an
                    important influence in action. Marshal Saxe, however, may be said to have
                    introduced a new and more enlightened era in the history of the arm, he not only
                    was the first to recognize the true mission and use of light cavalry, but also
                    the necessity for celerity in movement and manoeuvre on all occasions. Although
                    he cannot be said to have introduced horse artillery, which did not appear on
                    the field of battle till 1762, still, by his timely use of guns in conjunction
                    with cavalry at the battle of Fontenoy, he first showed how the two arms might
                    be combined.</p>
                <p>It cannot, however, be said that cavalry has ever before or since played the
                    important part in war that it did in the days of Frederick the Great. This
                    monarch recognized that the “arme blanche,” and not the firearm, was the proper
                    weapon for a mounted soldier. He discontinued firing in line, and the pitch of
                    excellence at which his horsemen arrived under the leadership of Seidlitz, and
                    the results they obtained, have never been equalled by the cavalry of any other
                    nation. The battles of Zorndorf, Rosbach, Striegau, Kesselsdorf, and Leuthen
                    still remain the most signal examples of what may be attained if to long
                    previous training and preparation are joined brilliancy and rapidity of
                    execution in the field. It required, however, long experience and the occasional
                    disasters which befell him in the first and second Silesian wars before
                    Frederick the Great appreciated the true principles of mounted warfare or put
                    them into execution.</p>
                <p>The next period in the history of cavalry may be said, to date from the rise of
                    Napoleon I. until the battle of Waterloo. The Republican armies of France were
                    but ill provided with mounted troops, and the disaster of Wurzburg in 1796
                    nearly annihilated the comparatively few squadrons that France then possessed.
                    The genius of Napoleon evinced itself as remarkably in the organization as in
                    the leading of his armies, and his first care was to create a force of cavalry
                    such as would enable him to reap the fruits of his victories. To his cavalry he
                    was mainly indebted for some of his most signal triumphs, notably Marengo and
                    Austerlitz, and to the manner in which he employed his mounted scouts and
                    reconnoitrers he owed the facility with which he so often out-manoeuvred and
                    anticipated his enemies. The Russian campaign of 1812 annihilated the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n274/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0274-0263"/> French cavalry, and there was not time to
                    reorganize it before it was necessary again to take the field. Hence some of
                    Napoleon’s most decided successes in 1813 proved fruitless; as he himself
                    remarked, had he possessed cavalry at the battles of Lützen and Bautzen the war
                    would then have been brought to an end. It would here appear worthy of remark
                    that defensive armour for cavalry, which had fallen into disuse, was
                    re-introduced by Napoleon. He increased the French cuirassiers from one regiment
                    to twelve, and they performed excellent service ever afterwards. Similarly in
                    Napoleon’s time the lance began to be again used in Europe; in 1807 it was found
                    that a Polish regiment of lancers was so useful that twelve lancer regiments
                    were afterwards formed, and a certain proportion of this arm has ever since been
                    maintained in all European armies. Any remarks, however, on cavalry in the time
                    of Napoleon would be incomplete wère no reference made to the Cossacks, who so
                    much contributed to render the retreats from Russia and after Leipsic peculiarly
                    disastrous to the French. These irregular horsemen, mounted on small horses and
                    armed with lances, hung on the flanks and rear of the retreating enemy, and,
                    although seldom standing to meet an attack, appeared to be ubiquitous, alike
                    affording a screen for their own army and obtaining the fullest information
                    regarding the movements of that opposed to them.</p>
                <p>In the forty years’ peace cavalry deteriorated like everything else connected
                    with military science. In the Crimea, as the entire war may be said to have
                    consisted of one siege, there was but little occasion for the use of cavalry,
                    and the few opportunities afforded were certainly not turned to the best
                    account. In the 1859 campaign between the French and Italians on the one side
                    and the Austrians on the other, the nature of the country was unsuited to the
                    action of cavalry, and except in some isolated instances, as on the field of
                    Solferino, cavalry played a very unimportant part in the war. For many years the
                    value of cavalry was only exemplified on the plains of India, where both the
                    British and the native horsemen performed many deeds of valour and did excellent
                    service. In 1866 there occurred the first great European war since Waterloo in
                    which cavalry could be turned to full account. From long disuse and want of
                    practice neither Austrians nor Prussians made sufficient use of the large force
                    of horsemen which was at their disposal, and neither on the field of battle nor
                    off it did they achieve any great distinction, although, undoubtedly, of the two
                    the Austrians carried off the palm. They performed reconnoitring duties far more
                    efficiently than their antagonists, and the manner in which they covered the
                    retreat of their army after Königgratz was a model of devotion and bravery.</p>
                <p>Four years later the experience gained by the Prussians in 1866 on the plains of
                    Bohemia was in the fullest degree utilized, whereas their opponents the French
                    only showed how splendid material may be sacrificed and how brilliant courage
                    may be thrown away. Incessant practice during the four preceding years of peace
                    had rendered the Prussian cavalry most proficient in all the duties of
                    reconnoitring and outposts. The information they obtained and the manner in
                    which they concealed the movements of the army in their rear mainly contributed
                    to enable the leaders of the German army to carry out successfully their
                    strategic plans, and their prowess on the field of battle when turned to account
                    as at Mars-la-Tour was exerted to the best effect. The French cavalry, on the
                    other hand, were remarkable more for bravery than efficiency. In place of being
                    scattered in small parties some days in advance of an army they marched in
                    masses frequently in its rear. Off the field of battle they were of no service,
                    and on it they were needlessly sacrificed through the incapacity of their
                    leaders.</p>
                <p>History has few examples of bravery more devoted than that of the French cavalry
                    at the battles of Wörth and Sedan, and none in which bravery was more entirely
                    thrown away. After the fall of the empire it may be said that the French cavalry
                    ceased to exist, and as it is an arm that cannot be improvised the republic had
                    no time to replace what had been destroyed.</p>
                <p>On the whole it cannot be said that the last two European wars have added much to
                    the art of handling cavalry. The practice of spreading light troops two days’
                    march in advance of an army was not new, although of late years it had fallen
                    into disuse, and as regards the employment of mounted troops on the
                    battle-field, it is still an unsettled question whether the recent improvements
                    in firearms have or have not rendered it impossible for them ever to turn the
                    tide of victory.</p>
