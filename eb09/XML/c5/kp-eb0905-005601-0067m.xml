                    glass, open at both ends, is placed vertically with its lower end immersed in
                    water, the water is observed to rise in the tube, and to stand within the tube
                    at a higher level than the water outside. The action between the capillary tube
                    and the water has been called Capillary Action, and the name has been extended
                    to many other phenomena which have been found to depend on properties of liquids
                    and solids similar to those which cause water to rise in capillary tubes.</p>
                <p>The forces which are concerned in these phenomena are those which act between
                    neighbouring parts of the same substance, and which are called forces of
                    cohesion, and those which act between portions of matter of different kinds,
                    which are called forces of adhesion. These forces are quite insensible between
                    two portions of matter separated by any distance which we can directly measure.
                    It is only when the distance becomes exceedingly small that these forces become
                    perceptible. Quincke<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    the form of the lower part of the tube. He considered that the suspension of the
                    liquid is due to “the attraction of the periphery or section of the surface of
                    the tube to which the upper surface of the water is contiguous and coheres.”
                    From this he shows that the rise of the liquid in tubes of the same substance is
                    inversely proportional to their radii.</p>

                    >Opticks</hi> to molecular forces, and instances several examples of the

                    more than double the height at which it usually stands. This arises from its
                    adhesion to the tube, and the upper part of the mercury sustains a considerable
                    tension, or negative pressure, without the separation of its parts. He considers
                    the capillary phenomena to be of the same kind, but his explanation is not
                    sufficiently explicit with respect to the nature and the limits of the action of
                    the attractive force.</p>
                <p>It is to be observed that, while these early speculators ascribe the phenomena to
                    attraction, they do not distinctly assert that this attraction is sensible only
                    at insensible distances, and that for all distances which we can d&gt;.ectly
                    measure the force is altogether insensible. The idea of such forces, however,
                    had been distinctly formed by Newton, who gave the first example of the
                    calculation of the effect of such forces in his theorem on the alteration of the
                    path of a light-corpuscule when it enters or leaves a dense body.</p>

                    necessity of taking account of the attraction between the parts of the fluid
                    itself in order to explain the phenomena. He does not, however, recognize the
                    fact that the distance at which the attraction is sensible is not only small but
                    altogether insensible.</p>
                <p>Segner<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>' Segner, <hi
                    rend="italic">Comment. Soc. Reg. Götting.,</hi> i. (1751), p. 301.</p></note>
                    introduced the very important idea of the surface-tension of liquids, which he
                    ascribed to attractive forces, the sphere of whose action is so small “ut nullo
                    adhuc sensu percipi potuerit.” In attempting to calculate the effect of this
                    surface-tension in determining the form of a drop of the liquid, Segner took
                    account of the curvature of a meridian section of the drop, but neglected the
                    effect of the curvature in a plane at right angles to this section.</p>
                <p>But the idea of surface-tension introduced by Segner had a most important effect
                    on the subsequent development of the theory. We may regard it as a physical fact
                    established by experiment in the same way as the laws of the elasticity of solid
                    bodies. We may investigate the forces which act between finite portions of a
                    liquid in the same way as we investigate the forces which act between finite
                    portions of a solid. The experiments on solids lead to certain laws of
                    elasticity expressed in terms of coefficients, the values of which can be
                    determined only by experiments on each particular substance. Various attempts
                    have also been made to deduce these laws from particular hypotheses as to the
                    action between the molecules of the elastic substance. We may therefore regard
                    the theory of elasticity as consisting of two parts. The first part establishes
                    the laws of the elasticity of a finite portion of the solid subjected to a
                    homogeneous strain, and deduces from these laws the equations of the equilibrium
                    and motion of a body subjected to any forces and displacements. The second part
                    endeavours to deduce the facts of the elasticity of a finite portion of the
                    substance from hypotheses as to the motion of its constituent molecules and the
                    forces acting between them.</p>
                <p>In like manner we may by experiment ascertain the general fact that the surface
                    of a liquid is in a state of tension similar to that of a membrane stretched
                    equally in all directions, and prove that this tension depends only on the
                    nature and temperature of the liquid and not on its form, and from this as a
                    secondary physical principle ve may deduce all the phenomena of capillary
                    action. This is one step of the investigation. The next step is to deduce this
                    surface-tension from an hypothesis as to the molecular constitution of the
                    liquid and of the bodies that surround it. The scientific importance of this
                    step is to be measured by the degree of insight which it affords or promises
                    into the molecular constitution of real bodies by the suggestion of experiments
                    by which we may discriminate between rival molecular theories.</p>

                    a fluid to have a sensible effect only at the surface itself and in the
                    direction of the surface it would be easy to determine the curvature of the
                    surfaces of fluids in the neighbourhood of the solid boundaries which contain
                    them; that these surfaces would be <hi rend="italic">lintearice</hi> of which
                    the tension, constant in all directions, would be everywhere equal to the
                    adherence of two particles, and the phenomena of capillary tubes would then
                    present nothing which could not be determined by analysis.” He applied this
                    principle of surface-tension to the explanation of the apparent attractions and
                    repulsions between bodies floating on a liquid.</p>
                <p>In 1802 Leslie<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    gave the first correct explanation of the rise of a liquid in a tube by
                    considering the effect of the attraction of the solid on the very thin stratum
                    of the liquid in contact with it. He does not, like the earlier speculators,
                    suppose this attraction to act in an upward direction so as to support the fluid
                    directly. He shows that the attraction is everywhere normal to the surface of
                    the solid. The direct effect of the attraction is to increase the pressure of
                    the stratum of the fluid in contact with the solid, so as to make it greater
                    than the pressure in the interior of the fluid. The result of this pressure if
                    unopposed is to cause this stratum to spread itself over the surface of the
                    solid as a drop of water is observed to do when placed on a clean horizontal
                    glass plate, and this even when gravity opposes the action, as when the drop is
                    placed on the under surface of the plate. Hence a glass tube plunged into water
                    would become wet all over were it not that the ascending liquid film carries up
                    a quantity of other liquid which coheres to it, so that when it has ascended to
                    a certain height the weight of the column balances the force by which the film
                    spreads itself over the glass. This explanation of the action of the solid is
                    equivalent to that by which Gauss afterwards supplied the defect of the theory
                    of Laplace, except that, not being expressed in terms of mathematical symbols,
                    it does not indicate the mathematical relation between the attraction of
                    individual particles and the final result. Leslie’s theory was afterwards
                    treated according to Laplace’s mathematical methods by James Ivory in the
                    article on capillary action, under the heading “Fluids, Elevation of,” in the
                    supplement to the fourth edition of the <hi rend="italic">Eιιsyclop&lt;jedia

                <p>In 1804 Thomas Young<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    rend="italic">Transactions,</hi> 1805, p. 65.</p></note> founded the theory of
                    capillary phenomena on the principle of surface-tension. He also observed the
                    constancy of the angle of contact of a liquid surface with a solid, and showed
                    how from these two principles to deduce the phenomena of capillary action. His
                    essay contains the solution of a great number of cases, including most of those
                    afterwards solved by Laplace, but his methods of demonstration, though always
                    correct, and often extremely elegant, are sometimes rendered obscure by his
                    scrupulous avoidance of mathematical symbols. Having applied the secondary
                    principle of surface-tension to the various particular cases of capillary
                    action, Young proceeds to deduce this surface-tension from ulterior principles.
                    He supposes the particles to act on one another with two different kinds of
                    forces, one of which, the attractive force of cohesion, extends to particles at
                    a greater distance than those to which the repulsive force is confined. He
                    further supposes that the attractive force is constant throughout the minute
                    distance to which it extends, but that the repulsive force increases rapidly as
                    the distance diminishes. He thus shows that at a curved part of the surface, a
                    superficial particle would be urged towards the centre of curvature of the
                    surface, and he gives reasons for concluding that this force is proportional to
                    the sum of the curvatures of the surface in two normal planes at right angles to
                    each other.</p>
                <p>The subject was next taken up by Laplace.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    results are in many respects identical with those of Young, but his methods of
                    arriving at them are very different, being conducted entirely by mathematical
                    calculations. The form into which he has thrown his investigation seems to have
                    deterred many able physicists from the inquiry into the ulterior cause of
                    capillary phenomena, and induced them to rest content with deriving them from
                    the fact of surfacetension. But for those who wish to study the molecular
                    constitution of bodies it is necessary to study the effect of forces which are
                    sensible only at ius≡nsible distances; and Laplace has furnished us with an
                    example of the method of this study which has never been surpassed. Laplace
                    investigates the force acting on the fluid contained in an infinitely slender
                    canal normal to the surface of the fluid arising from the attraction of the
                    parts of the fluid outside the canal. He thus finds for the pressure at a point
                    in the interior of the fluid an expression of the form <hi rend="smallcaps">F =
                    K</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> +</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">∣h(⅛ + ⅛),</hi>
                    where K is a constant pressure, probably very large, which, however, does not
                    influence capillary phenomena, and therefore cannot be determined from
                    observation of such phenomena; H is another constant on which all capillary
                    phenomena depend; and R and R' are the radii of curvature of any two normal
                    sections of the surface at right angles to each other.</p>
                <p>In the first part of our own investigation we shall adhere to the symbols used by
                    Laplace, as we shall find that an accurate knowledge of the physical
                    interpretation of these symbols is necessary for the further investigation of
                    the subject. In the <hi rend="italic">Supplement to the Theory of Capillary
                    Action,</hi> Laplace deduces the equation of the surface of the fluid from the
                    condition that the resultant force on a particle at the surface must be normal
                    to the surface. His explanation, however, of the rise of a liquid in a tube is
                    based on the <hi rend="italic">assumption of</hi> the constancy of the angle of
                    contact for the same solid and fluid, and of this he has nowhere given a
                    satisfactory proof. In this supplement Laplace gives many important applications
                    of the theory, and compares the results with the experiments of Gay-Lussac.</p>
                <p>The next great step in the treatment of the subject was made by Gauss.<note

                    principle which under his hands was gradually transforming itself into what is
                    now known as the principle of the conservation of energy. Instead of calculating
                    the direction and magnitude of the resultant force on each particle arising from
                    the action of neighbouring particles, he forms a single expression which is the
                    aggregate of all the potentials arising from the mutual action between pairs of
                    particles. This expression has been called the force function. Withits sign

                    three parts, the first depending on the action of gravity, the second on the
                    mutual action between the particles of the fluid, and the third on the action
                    between the particles of the fluid and the particles of a solid or fluid in

                <p>The condition of equilibrium is that this expression (which we may for the sake
                    of distinctness call the potential energy) shall be a minimum. This condition
                    when worked out gives not only the equation of the free surface in the form
                    already established by Laplace, but the conditions of the angle of contact of
                    this surface with the surface of a solid.</p>
                <p>Gauss thus supplied the principal defect in the great work of Laplace. He also
                    pointed out more distinctly the nature of the assumptions which we must make
                    with respect to the law of action of the particles in order to be consistent
                    with observed phenomena. He did not, however, enter into the explanation of
                    particular phenomena, as this had been done already by Laplace. He points out,
                    however, to physicists the advantages of the method of Segner and Gay-Lussac,
                    afterwards carried out by Quincke, of measuring the dimensions of large drops of
                    mercury on a horizontal or slightly concave surface, and those of large bubbles
                    of air in transparent liquids resting against the under side of a horizontal
                    plate of a substance wetted by the liquid.</p>
                <p>In 1831 Poisson published his <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Theorie</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">ΓAction</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Capillaire.</hi> He maintains that there is a rapid variation of
                    density near the surface of a liquid, and he gives very strong reasons, which
                    have been only strengthened by subsequent discoveries, for believing that this
                    is the case. He then proceeds to an investigation of the equilibrium of a fluid
                    on the hypothesis of uniform density, and he arrives at the conclusion that on
                    this hypothesis none of the observed capillary phenomena would take place, and
                    that, therefore, Laplace’s theory, in which the density is supposed uniform, is
                    not only insufficient but erroneous. In particular he maintains that the
                    constant pressure K, which occurs in Laplace’s theory, and which on that theory
                    is very large, must be in point of fact very small, but the equation of
                    equilibrium from which he concludes this is itself defective. Laplace assumes
                    that the liquid has uniform density, and that the attraction of its molecules
                    extends to a finite though insensible distance. On these assumptions his results
                    are certainly right, and are confirmed by the independent method of Gauss, so
                    that the objections raised against them by Poisson fall to the ground. But
                    whether the assumption of uniform density be physically correct is a very
                    different question, and Poisson has done good service to science in showing how
                    to carry on the investigation on the hypothesis that the density very near the
                    surface is different from that in the interior of the fluid.</p>
                <p>The result, however, of Poisson’s investigation is practically equivalent to that
                    already obtained by Laplace. In both theories the equation of the liquid surface
                    is the same, involving a constant H, which can be determined only by experiment.
                    The only difference is in the manner in which this quantity H depends on the law
                    of the molecular forces and the law of density near the surface of the fluid,
                    and as these laws are unknown to us we cannot obtain any test to discriminate
                    between the two theories.</p>
                <p>We have now described the principal forms of the theory of capillary action
                    during its earlier development. In more recent times the method of Gauss has
                    been modified so as to take account of the variation of density near the
                    surface, and its language has been translated in terms of the modern doctrine of
                    the conservation of energy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    phenomena of surface-tension, has adopted the following method of getting rid of
                    the effects of gravity: He forms a mixture of alcohol and water of the same
                    density as olive oil. He then introduces a quantity of oil into the mixture. It
                    assumes the form of a sphere under the action of surface-tension alone. He then,
                    by means of rings of iron-wire, disks, and other contrivances, alters the form
                    of certain parts of the surface of the oil. The free portions of the surface
                    then assume new forms depending on the equilibrium of surface-tension. In this
                    way he has produced a great many of the forms of equilibrium of a liquid under
                    the action of surface-tension alone, and compared them with the results of
                    mathematical investigation. He has also greatly facilitated the study of liquid
                    films by showing how to form a liquid, the films of which will last for twelve
                    or even for twenty-four hours. The debt which science owes to Μ. Plateau is not
                    diminished by the fact that, while investigating these beautiful phenomena, he
                    has never himself seen them. He lost his sight long ago in tho pursuit of

                    experimented on the effects of the thickness of the film, and has come to the
                    conclusion that the thinner a film is, the greater is its tension. This result,

                    does not burst. The phenomena of very thin liquid filins deserve the most

                    extent, after which the resulting mixtures do not mix with each other. The same
                    substance may be able to exist in two different states at the same temperature
                    and pressure, as when water and its saturated vapour are contained in the same
                    vessel. The conditions under which the thermal and mechanical equilibrium of two
                    fluids, two mixtures, or the same sub stance in two physical states in contact
                    with each other, is possible belong to thermodynamics. All that we have to
                    observe at present is that, in the cases in which the fluids do not mix of
                    themselves, the potential energy of the system must be greater when the fluids
                    are mixed than when they are separate</p>
                <p>It is found by experiment that it is only very close to the bounding surface of a
                    liquid that the forces arising from the mutual action of its parts have any
                    resultant effect on one of its particles. The experiments of Quincke and others
                    seem to show that the extreme range of the forces which produce capillary action
                    lies between a thousandth and a twenty thousandth part of a millimetre</p>
                <p>We shall use the symbol e to denote this extreme range, beyond which the action
                    of these forces may be regarded as insensible. If <hi rend="italic">χ</hi>

                    rend="italic">χ</hi> as sensibly constant except within a distance e of the

                <p>The symbol <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> expresses the energy of unit of mass of the

                    and the surface energy is positive. By the principle of the conservation of
                    energy, any displacement of the liquid by which its energy is diminished will
                    tend to take place of itself. Hence if the energy is the greater, the greater
                    the area of the exposed surface, the liquid will tend to move in such a way as
                    to diminish the area of the exposed surface, or in other words, the exposed
                    surface will tend to diminish if it can do so consistently with the other
                    conditions. This tendency of the surface to contract itself is called the
                    surface-tension of liquids.</p>

                <p>If this quantity is positive, the surface of contact will tend to contract, and
                    the liquids will remain distinct. If, however, it were negative, the
                    displacement of the liquids which tends to enlarge the surface of contact would
                    be aided by the molecular forces, so that the liquids, if not kept separate by
                    gravity, would at length become thoroughly mixed. No instance, however, of a
                    phenomenon of this kind has been discovered, for those liquids which mix of
                    themselves do so by the process of diffusion, which is a molecular motion, and
                    not by the spontaneous puckering and replication of the bounding surface as
                    would be the case if T were negative.</p>
                <p>It is probable, however, that there are many cases in which the integral
                    belonging to the less dense fluid is negative. If the denser body be solid we
                    can often demonstrate this; for the liquid tends to spread itself over the
                    surface of the solid, so as to increase the area of the surface of contact, even
                    although in so doing it is obliged to increase the free surface in opposition to
                    the surface-tension. Thus water spreads itself out on a clean surface of glass.
                    This shows that <hi rend="italic">(χ - χ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">

                <p>The method already given for the investigation of the surface-tension of a

                    degrees of thinness may possibly lead to an estimate of the range of the
                    molecular forces, or at least of the depth within a liquid mass, at which its
                    properties become sensibly uniform. We shall therefore indicate a method of
                    investigating the tension of such films.</p>
                <p>Let S be the area of the film, Μ its mass, and E its energy; <hi rend="italic"
                    >σ</hi> the mass, and e the energy of unit of area; then</p>
                <p>M = Sσ (11),</p>
                <p>E —Se (12).</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose that by some change in the form of the boundary of the film
                    its area is changed from S to S + dS. If its tension is T the work required to
                    effect this increase of surface will be T&lt;ZS, and the energy of the film will
                    be increased by this amount, lienee</p>

                <p>But since Μ is constant, dM=SΛr + σdS=O (14).</p>
                <p>Eliminating &lt;ZS from equations (13) and (14), and dividing by S, we find <hi

                    energy of unit of area.</p>
                <p>If we take the axis of <hi rend="italic">z</hi> normal to either surface of the

                <p>Both p and χ are functions of <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> the value of which
                    remains the same when z-c is substituted for <hi rend="italic">z.</hi> If the
                    thickness of the film is greater than 2«, there will be a stratum of thickness
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi>- 2¢ in the middle of the film, within which the values
                    of pand χ will be ∕&gt; <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> and χ <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>Hence the tension of a thick film is equal to the sum of the tensions of its two
                    surfaces as already calculated (equation 7). On the hypothesis of uniform
                    density we shall find that this is true for films whose thickness exceeds ¢.</p>
                <p>The symbol <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> is defined as the energy of unit of mass of
                    the substance. A knowledge of the absolute value of this energy is not required,
                    since in every expression in which it occurs it is under the form <hi
                    rend="italic">χ - χ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >,</hi> that is to say, the difference between the energy in two different
                    states. The only cases, however, in which we have experimental values of this
                    quantity are when the substance is either liquid and surrounded by similar
                    liquid, or gaseous and surrounded by similar gas. It is impossible to make
                    direct measurements of the properties of particles of the substance within the
                    insensible distance « of the bounding surface.</p>
                <p>When a liquid is in thermal and dynamical equilibrium with its vapour, then if
                    <hi rend="italic">ρ'</hi> and <hi rend="italic">χ'</hi> are the values of <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> for the vapour, and p <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> and <hi rend="italic">χ</hi><hi rend="italic

                <p>χ'-χ. = Λ-y(i-L) .... (21), where J is the dynamical equivalent of heat, L is the
                    latent heat of unit of mass of the vapour, and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the
                    pressure. At points in the liquid very near its surface it is probable that <hi
                    rend="italic">χ</hi> is greater than χ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, and at
                    points in the gas very near the surface of the liquid it is probable that <hi
                    rend="italic">χ</hi> is less than <hi rend="italic">χ',</hi> but this has not as
                    yet been ascertained experimentally. We shall therefore endeavour to apply to
                    this subject the methods used in Thermodynamics, and where these fail us we
                    shall have recourse to the hypotheses of molecular physics.</p>
                <p>We have next to determine the value of <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> in teιms of the
                    action between one particle and another. Let us suppose that the force between
                    two particles <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">m'</hi> at the
                    distance∕ is <hi rend="italic">F≈mm' (ff&lt;F)</hi>.... (22), being reckoned
                    positive when the force is attractive. The actual force between the particles
                    arises in part from their mutual gravitation, which is inversely as the square
                    of the distance. This force is 0</p>
                <p>expressed by <hi rend="italic">mm</hi> ’ It is easy to show that a force subject
                    to this law would not account for capillary action. We shall, therefore, in what
                    follows, consider only that part of the force which depends on φ(∕), where φ(∕)
                    is a function of <hi rend="italic">f</hi> which is insensible for all sensible
                    values of ∕, but which becomes sensible and even enormously great when/is
                    exceedingly small.</p>

                    being at a distance /from <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and the other at an infinite
                    distance, the mass of unit of length of the rod being <hi rend="italic">m'.</hi>
                    The function ∏(∕) is also insensible for sensible values of/, but for insensible

                <p>If we next write 4*∕∏(∕)d∕=ψ(i) (24), then 2πJZJσψ(i) will represent—1. The work

                <p>Hence if ψ(c) is positive, the tension and the thickness will increase together.
                    Now 2πmpψ(c) represents the attraction between a particle <hi rend="italic"

                    the force between the particle and the liquid is certainly, on the whole,
                    attractive; but if between any two small values of c it should be repulsive,
                    then for films whose thickness lies between these values the tension will
                    increase as the thickness diminishes, but for all other cases the tension will
                    diminish as the thickness diminishes.</p>
                <p>We have given several examples in which the density is assumed to be uniform,
                    because Poisson has asserted that capillary phenomena would not take place
                    unless the density varied rapidly near the surface. In this assertion we think
                    he was mathematically wrong, though in his own hypothesis that the density does
                    actually vary, he was probably right. I n fact, the quantity 4ιrp <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> K, which we may call with Van der Waals the molecular
                    pressure, is so great for most liquids (5000 atmospheres for water), that in the
                    parts near the surface, where the molecular pressure varies rapidly, we may
                    expect considerable variation )f density, even when we take into account the
                    smallness of the compressibility of liquids.</p>
                <p>The pressure at any point of the liquid arises from two causes, the external
                    pressure P to which the liquid is subjected, and the pressure arising from the
                    mutual attraction of its molecules. If we suppose that the number of molecules
                    within the range of the attraction of a given molecule is very large, the part
                    of the pressure arising from attraction will be proportional to the square of
                    the number of molecules in unit of volume, that is, to the square of the
                    density. Hence we may write <hi rend="smallcaps">P=P + A</hi><hi rend="subscript
                    smallcaps"> p</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> 1</hi> (1), where A is a
                    constant. But by the equations of equilibrium of the liquid</p>
                <p>⅜=-pdχ (2).</p>

                <p>Near the plane surface of a liquid we may assume p a function of <hi
                    rend="italic">z.</hi> We have then for the value of χ at the point where <hi

                    attraction of a mass of liquid bounded by a plane surface becomes insensible.
                    The value of <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi> depends, therefore, on those values

                    nearly equal to c. We may, therefore, expand p in terms of zc, or writing <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">On Surface-tension.</hi></p>
                <p>Definition.— <hi rend="italic">The tension of a liquid surface across any line
                    drawn on the surface is normal to the line, and is the same for all directions
                    of the line, and is measured by the force across an element of the line divided
                    by the length of that element.</hi><hi rend="italic">Experimental Laws of
                    Surface-tension.</hi></p>
                <p>1. For any given liquid surface, as the surface which separates water from air.
                    or oil from water, the surfacetension is the same at every point of the surface
                    and in every direction. It is also practically independent of the curvature of
                    the surface, although it appears from the mathematical theory that there is a
                    slight increase of tension where the mean curvature of the surface is concave,
                    and a slight diminution where it is convex. The amount of this increase and
                    diminution is too small to be directly measured, though it has a certain
                    theoretical importance in the explanation of the equilibrium of the superficial
                    layer of the liquid where it is inclined to the horizon.</p>
                <p>2. The surface-tension diminishes as the temperature rises, and when the
                    temperature reaches that of the critical point at which the distinction between
                    the liquid and its vapour ceases, it has been observed by Andrews that the
                    capillary action also vanishes. The early writers on capillary action supposed
                    that the diminution of capillary action was due simply to the change of density
                    corresponding to the rise of temperature, and, therefore, assuming the
                    surfacetension to vary as the square of the density, they deduced its variations
                    from the observed dilatation of the liquid by heat. This assumption, however,
                    does not appear to be verified by the experiments of Brunner and Wolff on the
                    πse of water in tubes at different temperatures.</p>
                <p>3. The tension of the surface separating two liquids which do not mix cannot be
                    deduced by any known method from the tensions of the surfaces of the liquids
                    when separately in contact with air.</p>
                <p>When the surface is curved, the effect of the surfacetension is to make the
                    pressure on the concave side exceed the pressure on the convex side by T + -^,
                    where T is the intensity of the surface-tension and R <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, R. <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> are the radii of curvature of any two
                    sections normal to the surface and to each other.</p>
                <p>If three fluids which do not mix are in contact with each other, the three
                    surfaces of separation meet in a line, straight or curved. Let 0 (fig.</p>
                <p>3) be a point in this line, and let the plane of the paper be supposed to be
                    normal to the line at the point 0. The three angles between the tangent planes
                    to the three surfaces of separation at the point 0 are completely determined by
                    the tensions of the three surfaces. For if in the triangle <hi rend="italic"
                    >abc</hi> the side <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is taken so as to represent on a
                    given scale the tension of the surface of contact of the fluids <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and if the other sides <hi
                    rend="italic">be</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ca</hi> are taken so as to represent
                    on the same scale the tensions of the surfaces between <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and between <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> respectively, then the condition of equilibrium at 0 for
                    the corresponding tensions R, P, and Q is that the angle ROP shall be the
                    supplement of <hi rend="italic">abc,</hi> POQ of <hi rend="italic">bca,</hi>
                    and, therefore, QOR of <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> Thus the angles at which the
                    surfaces of separation meet are the same at all parts of the line of concourse
                    of the three fluids. When three films of the same liquid meet, their tensions
                    are equal, and, therefore, they make angles of 120° with each other. The froth
                    of soap-suds or beat-up eggs consists of a multitude of small films which meet
                    each other at angles of 120°.</p>
                <p>If four fluids, <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, d,</hi> meet in a point 0, and if a
                    tetrahedron ABCD is formed so that its edge AB represents the tension of the
                    surface of contact of the liquids <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> BC that of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and
                    so on; then if we place this tetrahedron so that the face ABC is normal to the
                    tangent at 0 to the line of concourse of the fluids <hi rend="italic">abc,</hi>
                    and turn it so that the edge AB is normal to the tangent plane at 0 to the
                    surface of contact of the fluids <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> then the other three faces of the tetrahedron will be normal to the
                    tangents at 0 to the other three lines of concourse of the liquids, and the
                    other five edges of the tetrahedron will be normal to the tangent planes at 0 to
                    the other five surfaces of contact.</p>
                <p>If six films of the same liquid meet in a point the corresponding tetrahedron is
                    a regular tetrahedron, and each film, where it meets the others, has an angle
                    v.hose cosine is - ½. Hence if we take two nets of wire with hexagonal meshes,
                    and place one on the other so that the point of concourse of three hexagons of
                    one net coincides with the middle of a hexagon of the other, and if we then,
                    after dipping them in Plateau’s liquid, place them horizontally, and gently
                    raise the upper one, we shall develop a system of plane laminae arranged as the
                    walls and floors of the cells are arranged in a honeycomb. We must not, however,
                    raise the upper net too much, or the system of films will become unstable.</p>
                <p>When a drop of one liquid, B, is placed on the surface of another, A, the
                    phenomena which take place depend on the relative magnitude of the three
                    surface-tensions corresponding to the surface between A and air, between B <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n74/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0074-0063"/> and air, and between A and B. If no one of these
                    tensions is greater than the sum of the other two, the drop will assume the form
                    of a lens, the angles which the upper and lower surfaces of the lens make with
                    the free surface of A and with each other being equal to the external angles of
                    the triangle of forces. Such lenses are often seen formed by drops of fat
                    floating on the surface of hot water, soup, or gravy. But when the
                    surface-tension of A exceeds the sum of the tensions of the surfaces of contact
                    of B with air and with A, it is impossible to construct the triangle of forces,
                    so that equilibrium becomes impossible. The edge of the drop is drawn out by the
                    surface-tension of A with a force greater than the sum of the tensions of the
                    two surfaces of the drop. The drop, therefore, spreads itself out, with great
                    velocity, over the surface of A till it covers an enormous area, and is reduced
                    to such extreme tenuity that it is not probable that it retains the same
                    properties of surface-tension which it has in a large mass. Thus a drop of train
                    oil will spread itself over the surface of the sea till it shows the colours of
                    thin plates. These rapidly descend in Newton’s scale and at last disappear,
                    showing that the thickness of the film is less than the tenth part of the length
                    of a wave of light. But even when thus attenuated, the film may be proved to be
                    present, since the surface-tension of the liquid is considerably less than that
                    of pure water. This may be shown by placing another drop of oil on the surface.
                    This drop will not spread out like the first drop, but will take the form of a
                    flat lens with a distinct circular edge, showing that the surface-tension of
                    what is still apparently pure water is now less than the sum of the tensions of
                    the surfaces separating oil from air and water.</p>
                <p>The spreading of drops on the surface of a liquid has formed the subject of a
                    very extensive series of experiments by Mr Tomlinson. Μ. Van der Mensbrugghe has
                    also written a very complete memoir on this subject. <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi></p>
                <p>When a solid body is in contact with two fluids, the surface of the solid cannot
                    alter its form, but the angle at which the surface of contact of the two fluids
                    meets the surface of the solid depends on the values of the three
                    surfacetensions. If <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and δ are the two fluids and <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> the solid then the equilibrium of the tensions at the point
                    0 depends only on that of thin components parallel to the surface, because the
                    surface-tensions normal to the surface are balanced by the resistance of the
                    solid.</p>
                <p>Hence if the angle ROQ (fig. 4) at which the surface of contact OP meets the
                    solid is denoted by <hi rend="italic">a,</hi></p>

                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> aδ</p>
                <p>As an experiment on the angle of contact only gives us the difference of the
                    surface-tensions at the solid surface, we cannot determine their actual value.
                    It is theoretically probable that they are often negative, and may be called
                    surface-pressures.</p>
                <p>The constancy of the angle of contact between the surface of a fluid and a solid
                    was first pointed out by Dr Young, who states that the angle of contact between
                    mercury and glass is about 140°. Quincke makes it 128° 52 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi>.</p>
                <p>If the tension of the surface between the solid and one of the fluids exceeds the
                    sum of the other two tensions, the point of contact will not be in equilibrium,
                    but will be dragged towards the side on which the tension is greatest. If the
                    quantity of the first fluid is small it will stand in a drop on the surface of
                    the solid without wetting it. If the quantity of the second fluid is small it
                    will spread itself over the surface and wet the solid. The angle of contact of
                    the first fluid is 180° and that of the second is zero.</p>
                <p>If a drop of alcohol be made to touch one side of a drop of oil on a glass plate,
                    the alcohol will appear to chase the oil over the plate, and if a drop of water
                    and a drop of bisulphide of carbon be placed in contact in a horizontal
                    capillary tube, the bisulphide of carbon will chase the water along the tube. In
                    both cases the liquids move in the direction in which the surface-pressure at
                    the solid is least.</p>

                    solid substance c, be dipped into a liquid <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Let us
                    suppose that the angle of contact for this liquid with the solid <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> is an acute angle. This implies that the tension of the
                    free surface of the solid <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is greater than that of the
                    surface of contact of the solid with the liquid <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Now
                    consider the tension of the free surface of the liquid <hi rend="italic">a.</hi>
                    All round its edge there is a tension T acting at an angle α with the vertical.
                    The circumference of the edge is 2τrr, so that the resultant of this tension is
                    a force <hi rend="italic">2τrrT cos. a</hi> acting vertically upwards on the
                    liquid. Hence the liquid will rise in the tube till the weight of the vertical
                    column between the free surface and the level of the liquid in the vessel
                    balances the resultant of the surfacetension. The upper surface of this column
                    is not level, so that the height of the column cannot be directly measured, but
                    let us assume that <hi rend="italic">lι</hi> is the mean height of the column,
                    that is to say, the height of a column of equal weight, but with a flat top.
                    Then if <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> is the radius of the tube at the top of the
                    column, the volume of the suspended column is <hi rend="italic">ιrr</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and its weight is <hi

                <p>Hence the mean height to which the fluid rises is inversely as the radius of the
                    tube. For water in a clean glass tube the angle of contact is zero, and</p>

                <p>For mercury in a glass tube the angle of contact is 128° 52', the cosine of which
                    is negative. Hence when a glass tube is dipped into a vessel of mercury, the
                    mercury within the tube stands at a lower level than outside it.</p>

                <p>When two parallel plates are placed vertically in a liquid the liquid rises
                    between them. If we now suppose fig. 5 to represent a vertical section

                <p>The form of the surface of a liquid acted on by gravity is easily determined if
                    we assume that near the part considered the line of contact of the surface of
                    the liquid with that of the solid bounding it is straight and horizontal, as it
                    is when the solids which constrain the liquid are bounded by surfaces formed by
                    horizontal and parallel generating lines. This will be the case, for instance,
                    near a flat plate dipped into the liquid. If we suppose these generating lines
                    to be normal to the plane of the paper then all sections of the solids parallel
                    to this plane will be equal and similar to each other, and the section of the
                    surface of the liquid will be of the same form for all such sections</p>

                    force thus produced by the introduction of a drop of water between two plates is
                    enormous, and is often sufficient to press certain parts of the plates together
                    so powerfully as to bruise them or break them. When two blocks of ice are placed
                    loosely together so that the superfluous water which melts from them may drain
                    away, the remaining water draws the blocks together with a force sufficient to
                    cause the blocks to adhere by the process called Regelation.</p>
                <p>In many experiments bodies are floated on the surface of water in order that they
                    may be free to move under the action of slight horizontal forces. Thus Newton
                    placed a magnet in a floating vessel and a piece of iron in another in order to
                    observe their mutual action, and Ampère floated a voltaic battery with a coil of
                    wire in its circuit in order to observe the effects of the earth’s magnetism on
                    the electric circuit. When such floating bodies come near the edge of the vessel
                    they are drawn up to it, and are apt to stick fast to it. There are two ways of
                    avoiding this inconvenience. One is to grease the float round its water line so
                    that the water is depressed round it. This, however, often produces a worse
                    disturbing effect, because a thin film of grease spreads over the water and
                    increases its surface-viscosity. The other method is to fill the vessel with
                    water till the level of the water stands a little higher than the rim of the
                    vessel. The float will then be repelled from the edge of the vessel. Such
                    floats, however, should always be made so that the section taken at the level of
                    the water is as small as possible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Phenomena arising from the Variation of the
                    Surface-tension.</hi></p>
                <p>Pure water has a higher surface-tension than that of any other substance liquid
                    at ordinary temperatures except mercury. Hence any other liquid if mixed with
                    water diminishes its surface-tension. For example, if a drop of alcohol be
                    placed on the surface of water, the surfacetension will be diminished from 80,
                    the value for pure water, to 25, the value for pure alcohol. The surface of the
                    liquid will therefore no longer be in equilibrium, and a current will be formed
                    at and near the surface from the alcohol to the surrounding water, and this
                    current will go on as long as there is more alcohol at one part of the surface
                    than at another. If the vessel is deep, these currents will be balanced by
                    counter currents below them, but if the depth of the water is only two or three
                    millimetres, the surface-current will sweep away the whole of the water, leaving
                    a dry spot where the alcohol was dropped in. This phenomenon was first described
                    and explained by Professor James Thomson, who also explained a phenomenon, the
                    converse of this, called the “tears of strong wine.”</p>
                <p>If a wine glass be half-filled with port wine the liquid rises a little up the
                    side of the glass as other liquids do. The wine, however, contains alcohol and
                    water, both of which evaporate, but the alcohol faster than the water, so that
                    the superficial layer becomes more watery. In the middle of the vessel the
                    superficial layer recovers its strength by diffusion from below, but the film
                    adhering to the side of the glass becomes more watery, and therefore has a
                    higher surface-tension than the surface of the stronger wine. It therefore
                    creeps up the side of the glass dragging the strong wine after it, and this goes
                    on till the quantity of fluid dragged up collects into a drop and runs down the
                    side of the glass.</p>
                <p>The motion of small pieces of camphor floating on water arises from the gradual
                    solution of the camphor. If this takes place more rapidly on one side of the
                    piece of camphor than on the other side, the surface-tension becomes weaker
                    where there is most camphor in solution, and the lump, being pulled unequally by
                    the surface-tensions, moves off in the direction of the strongest tension,
                    namely, towards the side on which least camphor is dissolved.</p>
                <p>If a drop of ether is held near the surface of water the vapour of ether
                    condenses on the surface of the water, and surface-currents are formed flowing
                    in every direction away from under the drop of ether.</p>
                <p>If we place a small floating body in a shallow vessel of water and wet one side
                    of it with alcohol or ether, it will move off with great velocity and skim about
                    on the surface of the water, the part wet with alcohol being always the
                    stern.</p>
                <p>The surface-tension of mercury is greatly altered by slight changes in the state
                    of the surface. The surface-tension of pure mercury is so great that it is very
                    difficult to keep it clean, for every kind of oil or grease spreads over it at
                    once.</p>
                <p>But the most remarkable effects of change of surfacetension are those produced by
                    what is called the electric polarization of the surface. The tension of the
                    surface of contact of mercury and dilute sulphuric acid depends on the
                    electromotive force acting between the mercury and the acid. If the
                    electromotive force is from the acid to the mercury the surface-tension
                    increases; <hi rend="italic">if</hi> it is from the mercury to the acid, it
                    diminishes. Faraday observed that a large drop of mercury, resting on the flat
                    bottom of a vessel containing dilute acid, changes its form in a remarkable way
                    when connected with one of the electrodes of a battery, the other electrode
                    being placed in the acid. When the mercury is made positive it becomes dull and
                    spreads itself out; when it is made negative it gathers itself together and
                    becomes bright again. Μ. Lippmann, who has made a careful investigation of the
                    subject, finds that exceedingly small variations of the electromotive force
                    produce sensible changes in the surfacetension. The effect of one of a Daniell’s
                    cell is to increase the tension from 30 ’ 4 to 40 ’ 6. He has constructed a
                    capillary electrometer by which differences of electric potential less than 0 01
                    of that of a Daniell’s cell can be detected by the difference of the pressure
                    required to force the mercury to a given point of a fine capillary tube. He has
                    also constructed an apparatus in which this variation in the surface-tension is
                    made to do work and drive a machine. He has also found that this action is
                    reversible, for when the area of the surface of contact of the acid and mercury
                    is made to increase, an electric current passes from the mercury to the acid,
                    the amount of electricity which passes while the surface increases by one square
                    centimetre being sufficient to decompose ’ 000013 grammes of water.</p>

                <p>A soap-bubble is simply a small quantity of soap-suds spread out so as to expose
                    a large surface to the air. The bubble, in fact, has two surfaces, an outer and
                    an inner surface, both exposed to air. It has, therefore, a certain amount of
                    surface-energy depending on the area of these <pb break="no"

                    outer and inner surfaces are approximately equal, we shall consider the area of
                    the film as representing either of them, and shall use the symbol T to denote
                    the energy of unit of area of the film, both surfaces being taken together. If
                    T' is the energy of a single surface of the liquid, T the energy of the film is
                    2T'. When by means of a tube we blow air into the inside of the bubble we
                    increase its volume and therefore its surface, and at the same time we do work
                    in forcing air into it, and thus increase the energy of the bubble.</p>
                <p>That the bubble has energy may be shown by leaving the end of the tube open. The
                    bubble will contract, forcing the air out, and the current of air blown through
                    the tube may be made to deflect the flame of a candle. If the bubble is in the
                    form of a sphere of radius <hi rend="italic">r</hi> this material surface will
                    have an area</p>
                <p>S=4τrr <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> (1).</p>
                <p>If T be the energy corresponding to unit of area of the film the surface-energy
                    of the whole bubble will be</p>
                <p>ST = 4πr <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> T (2).</p>
                <p>The increment of this energy corresponding to an increase of the radius from <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> to <hi rend="italic">r + dr</hi> is therefore</p>
                <p>TdS = 8πrTdr (3).</p>
                <p>Now this increase of energy was obtained by forcing in air at a pressure greater
                    than the atmospheric pressure, and thus increasing the volume of the bubble.</p>
                <p>Let ∏ be the atmospheric pressure and ∏ + <hi rend="italic">p</hi> the pressure
                    of the air within the bubble. The volume of the sphere is</p>
                <p>V=+" <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> (4), and the increment of volume is dV <hi

                <p>Now if we suppose a quantity of air already at the pressure ∏ + <hi rend="italic"
                    >p,</hi> the work done in forcing it into the bubble is <hi rend="italic"
                    >pdN.</hi> Hence the equation of work and energy is <hi rend="italic"

                <p>P=2TJ (8).</p>
                <p>This, therefore, is the excess of the pressure of the air within the bubble over
                    that of the external air, and it is due to the action of the inner and outer
                    surfaces of the bubble. We may conceive this pressure to arise from the tendency
                    which the bubble has to contract, or in other words from the surface-tension of
                    the bubble.</p>
                <p>If to increase the area of the surface requires the expenditure of work, the
                    surface must resist extension, and if the bubble in contracting can do work, the
                    surface must tend to contract. The surface must therefore act like a sheet of
                    india-rubber when extended both in length and breadth, that is, it must exert
                    surface-tension. The tension of the sheet of india-rubber, however, depends on
                    the extent to which it is stretched, and may be different in different
                    directions, whereas the tension of the surface of a liquid remains the same
                    however much the film is extended, and the tension at any point is the same in
                    all directions.</p>
                <p>The intensity of this surface-tension is measured by the stress which it exerts
                    across a line of unit length. Let us measure it in the case of the spherical
                    soap-bubble by considering the stress exerted by one hemisphere of the bubble on
                    the other, across the circumference of a great circle. This stress is balanced
                    by the pressure <hi rend="italic">p</hi> acting over the area of the same great
                    circle: it is therefore equal to <hi rend="italic">πr</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">p.</hi> To determine the intensity of the
                    surface-tension we have to divide this quantity by the length of the line across
                    which it acts, which is in this case the circumference of a great circle 2πr.
                    Dividing <hi rend="italic">τrr</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> by this length we obtain ½pr as the value of the intensity
                    of the surfacetension, and it is plain from equation 8 that this is equal to T.
                    Hence the numerical value of the intensity of the surface-tension is equal to
                    the numerical value of the surface-energy per unit of surface. We must remember
                    that since the film has two surfaces the surface-tension of the film is double
                    the tension of the surface of the liquid of whjch it is formed.</p>
                <p>To determine the relation between the surface-tension and the pressure which
                    balances it when the form of the surface is not spherical, let us consider the
                    following case :—</p>
                <p>Let fig. 8. represent a section through the axis <hi rend="italic">Cc</hi> of a
                    soap-bubble in the form of a figure of revolution bounded by two circular disks
                    AB and <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> and having the meridian section APα. Let PQ be
                    an imaginary section normal to the axis. Let the radius of this section PR be
                    <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> and let PT, the tangent at P, make an angle α with the
                    axis.</p>
                <p>Let us consider the stresses which are exerted across this imaginary section by
                    the lower part on the upper part. If the internal pressure exceeds the external
                    pressure by <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> there is in the first place a force <hi
                    rend="italic">τryp</hi> acting upwards arising from the pressure <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> over the area of the section. In the next place, there is
                    the surface-tension acting downwards, but at an angle α with the vertical,
                    across the circular section of the bubble itself, whose circumference is 2τry,
                    and the downward force is therefore 2ττyT cos. α.</p>
                <p>Now these forces are balanced by the external force which acts on the disk ACB,
                    which we may call F. Hence equating the forces which act on the portion included
                    between ACB and PRQ</p>

                    constant. In studying these variations we may if we please take as our

                    meridian section of the bubble. Since at any instant the rolling curve is
                    rotating about the point of contact with the axis, the line drawn from this
                    point of contact to the tracing point must be normal to the direction of motion
                    of the tracing point. Hence if N is the point of contact, NP must be normal to
                    the traced curve. Also, since the axis is a tangent to the rolling curve, the
                    ordinate PR is the perpendicular from the tracing point P on the tangent. Hence
                    the relation between the radius vector and the perpendicular on the tangent of
                    the rolling curve must be identical with the relation between the normal PN and
                    the ordinate PR of the traced curve. If we write <hi rend="italic">r ior</hi>
                    PN, then <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">= r</hi> cos. α, and equation

                <p>This relation between <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is
                    identical with the relation between the perpendicular from the focus of a conic
                    section on the tangent at a given point and the focal distance of that point,
                    provided the transverse and conjugate axes of the conic are 2α and 2δ
                    respectively, where</p>

                <p>Hence the meridian section of the film may be traced by the focus of such a
                    conic, if the conic is made to roll on the axis.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">On the different Forms of the Meridian Line.</hi></p>
                <p>(1.) When the conic is an ellipse the meridian line is in the form of a series of
                    waves, and the film itself has a series of alternate swellings and contractions
                    as represented in figs. 8 and 9. This form of the film is called the
                    unduloid.</p>
                <p>(Ia.) When the ellipse becomes a circle, the meridian line becomes a straight
                    line parallel to the axis, and the film passes into the form of a cylinder of
                    revolution.</p>
                <p>(1δ.) As the ellipse degenerates into the straight line joining its foci, the
                    contracted parts of the unduloid become narrower, till at last the figure
                    becomes a series of spheres in contact.</p>
                <p>In all these cases the internal pressure exceeds the 2T</p>
                <p>external by — where <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the semitransverse axis of the
                    <hi rend="italic">(I</hi> conic. The resultant of the internal pressure and the
                    surface-tension is equivalent to a tension along the axis, and the numerical
                    value of this tension is equal to the force due to the action of this pressure
                    on a circle whose diameter is equal to the conjugate axis of the ellipse.</p>
                <p>(2.) When the conic is a parabola the meridian line is a catenary (fig. 10), the
                    internal pressure is equal to the external pressure, and the tension along the
                    axis is equal to 2τrTm where <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is the distance of the
                    vertex from the focus.</p>
                <p>(3.) When the conic is a hyperbola the meridian line is in the form of a looped
                    curve (fig. 11). The corresponding figure of the film is called the nodoid. The
                    resultant of the internal pressure and the surface-tension is equivalent to a
                    pressure along the axis equal to that due to a pressure <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    acting on a circle whose diameter is the conjugate axis of the hyperbola.</p>
                <p>When the conjugate axis of the hyperbola is made smaller and smaller, the nodoid
                    approximates more and more to the series of spheres touching each other along
                    the axis. When the conjugate axis of the hyperbola increases without limit, the
                    loops of the nodoid are crowded on one another, and each becomes more nearly a
                    ring of circular section, without, however, ever reaching this form. The only
                    closed surface belonging to the series is the sphere.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stability of the Cylinder.</hi></p>
                <p>The cylinder is the limiting form of the unduloid when the rolling ellipse
                    becomes a circle. When the ellipse differs infinitely little from a circle, the
                    equation of the meridian line becomes approximately <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">= α + c</hi> sin. ∣ where <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is small. This
                    is a simple harmonic wave-line, whose mean distance from the axis is <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> whose wave-length is 2∏α, and whose amplitude is <hi

                    ÍZ</p>
                <p>consider a portion of a cylindric film of length <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    terminated by two equal disks of radius <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and containing
                    a certain volume of air. Let one of these disks be made to approach the other by
                    a small quantity <hi rend="italic">dx.</hi> The film will swell out into the
                    convex part of an unduloid, having its largest section midway between the disks,
                    and we have to determine whether the internal pressure will be greater or less
                    than before. If A and C (fig. 12) are the disks, and if <hi rend="italic">χ</hi>
                    the distance between the disks is equal to <hi rend="italic">πr</hi> half the
                    wave-length of the harmonic curve, the disks will be at the points where the
                    curve is at its mean distance from the</p>
                <p>T</p>
                <p>axis, and the pressure will therefore be — as before. If A <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>,</p>
                <p>C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are the disks, so that the distance between them
                    is less than ∏r, the curve must be produced beyond the disks before it is at its
                    mean distance from the axis. Hence in this case the mean distance is less than
                    <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and</p>
                <p>T</p>
                <p>the pressure will be greater than —. If, on the other hand, the disks are at A
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, so that the
                    distance between them is greater than <hi rend="italic">τrr,</hi> the curve will
                    reach its mean distance<pb break="no"

                    mean distance will therefore be greater than <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and the
                    τ</p>
                <p>pressure will be less than —. Hence if one of the disks be made to approach the
                    other, the internal pressure will be increased if the distance between the disks
                    is less than half the circumference of either, and the pressure will be
                    diminished if the distance is greater than this quantity. In the same way we may
                    show that if the distance between the disks is increased, the pressure will be
                    diminished or increased according as the distance is less or more than half the
                    circumference of either.</p>
                <p>Now let us consider a cylindric film contained between two equal fixed disks A
                    and B, and let a third disk, C, be placed midway between. Let C be slightly
                    displaced towards A. If AC and CB are each less than half the circumference of a
                    disk the pressure on C will increase on the side of A and diminish on the side
                    of B. The resultant force on C will therefore tend to oppose the displacement
                    and to bring C back to its original position. The equilibrium of C is therefore
                    stable. It is easy to show that if C had been placed in any other position than
                    the middle, its equilibrium would have been stable. Hence the film is stable as
                    regards longitudinal displacements. It is also stable as regards displacements
                    transverse to the axis, for the film is in a state of tension, and any lateral
                    displacement of its middle parts would produce a resultant force tending to
                    restore the film to its original position. Hence if the length of the cylindric
                    film is less than its circumference, it is in stable equilibrium. But if the
                    length of the cylindric film is greater than its circumference, and if we
                    suppose the disk C to be placed midway between A and B, and to be moved towards
                    A, the pressure on the side next A will diminish, and that on the side next B
                    will increase, so that the resultant force will tend to increase the
                    displacement, and the equilibrium of the disk C is therefore unstable. Hence the
                    equilibrium of a cylindri c film whose length is greater than its circumference
                    is unstable. Such a film, if ever so little disturbed, will begin to contract at
                    one section and to expand at another, till its form ceases to resemble a
                    cylinder, if it does not break up into two parts which become ultimately
                    portions of spheres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Instability of a Jet of Liquid.</hi></p>
                <p>When a liquid flows out of a vessel through a circular opening in the bottom of
                    the vessel, the form of the stream is at first nearly cylindrical though its
                    diameter gradually diminishes from the orifice downwards on account of the
                    increasing velocity of the Equid. But the liquid after it leaves the vessel is
                    subject to no forces except gravity, the pressure of the air, and its own
                    surface-tension. Of these gravity has no effect on the form of the stream except
                    in drawing asunder its parts in a vertical direction, because the lower parts
                    are moving faster than the upper parts. The resistance of the air produces
                    little disturbance until the velocity becomes very great. But the
                    surfacetension, acting on a cylindric column of liquid whose length exceeds the
                    limit of stability, begins to produce enlargements and contractions in the
                    stream as soon as the liquid has left the orifice, and these inequalities in the
                    figure of the column go on increasing till it is broken up into elongated
                    fragments. These fragments as they are falling through the air continue to be
                    acted on by surfacetension. They therefore shorten themselves, and after a
                    series of oscillations in which they become alternately elongated and flattened,
                    settle down into the form of spherical drops.</p>
                <p>This process, which we have followed as it takes place on an individual portion
                    of the falling liquid, goes through its several phases at different distances
                    from the orifice, so that if we examine different portions of the stream as it
                    descends, we shall find next the orifice the unbroken column, then a series of
                    contractions and enlargements, then elongated drops, then flattened drops, and
                    so on till the drops become spherical.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stability of the Catenoid.</hi></p>
                <p>When the internal pressure is equal to the external, the film forms a surface of
                    which the mean curvature at every point is zero. The only surface of revolution
                    having this property is the catenoid formed by the revolution of a catenary
                    about its directrix. This catenoid, however, is in stable equilibrium only when
                    the portion considered is such that the tangents to the catenary at its
                    extremities intersect before they reach the directrix.</p>
                <p>To prove this, let us consider the catenary as the form of equilibrium of a chain
                    suspended between two fixed points A and B. Suppose the chain hanging between A
                    and B to be of very great length, then the tension at A or B will be very great.
                    Let the chain be hauled in over a peg at A. At first the tension will diminish,
                    but if the process be continued the tension will reach a minimum value and will
                    afterwards increase to infinity as the chain between A and B approaches to the
                    form of a straight line. Hence for every tension greater than the minimum
                    tension there are two catenaries passing through A and B. Since the tension is
                    measured by the height above the directrix these two catenaries have the same
                    directrix. Every catenary lying between them has its directrix higher, and every
                    catenary lying beyond them has its directrix lower than that of the two
                    catenaries.</p>
                <p>Now let us consider the surfaces of revolution formed by this system of
                    catenaries revolving about the directrix of the two catenaries of equal tension.
                    We know that the radius of curvature of a surface of revolution in the plane
                    normal to the meridan plane is the portion of the normal intercepted by the axis
                    of revolution.</p>
                <p>The radius of curvature of a catenary is equal and opposite to the portion of the
                    normal intercepted by the directrix of the catenary. Hence a catenoid whose
                    directrix coincides with the axis of revolution has at every point its principal
                    radii of curvature equal and opposite, so that the mean curvature of the surface
                    is zero.</p>
                <p>The catenaries which lie between the two whose direction coincides with the axis
                    of revolution generate surfaces whose radius of curvature convex towards the
                    axis in the meridian plane is less than the radius of concave curvature. The
                    mean curvature of these surfaces is therefore convex towards the axis. The
                    catenaries which lie beyond the two generate surfaces whose radius of curvature
                    convex towards the axis in the meridian plane is greater than the radius of
                    concave curvature. The mean curvature of these surfaces is, therefore, concave
                    towards the axis.</p>
                <p>Now if the pressure is equal on both sides of a liquid film, if its mean
                    curvature is zero, it will be in equilibrium. This is the case with the two
                    catenoids. If the mean curvature is convex towards the axis the film will move
                    from the axis. Hence if a film in the form of the catenoid which is nearest the
                    axis is ever so slightly displaced from the axis it will move further from the
                    axis till it reaches the other catenoid.</p>
                <p>If the mean curvature is concave towards the axis the film will tend to approach
                    the axis. Hence if a film in the form of the catenoid which is nearest the axis
                    be displaced towards the axis, it will tend to move further towards the axis and
                    will collapse. Hence the film in the form of the catenoid which is nearest the

                    point in the directrix; for since any catenary with its directrix is a similar
                    figure to any other catenary with its directrix, if the directrix of the one
                    coincides with that of the other the centre of similitude must lie on the common
                    directrix. Also, since the curves at P and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> are equally
                    inclined to the directrix, P and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> are corresponding
                    points and the line P <hi rend="italic">p</hi> must pass through the centre of
                    similitude. Similarly Q? must pass through the centre of similitude. Hence T,the
                    point of intersection of <hi rend="italic">Pp</hi> and Qç, must be the centre of
                    similitude and must be on the common directrix. Hence the tangents at A and B to

                    stability of a catenoid is therefore that the tangents at the extremities of its

                    downwards in a vessel containing a mixture of alcohol and water, the mixture
                    being denser than the oil. The surface of separation is in this case horizontal
                    and stable, so that the equilibrium is established of itself. Alcohol is then
                    added very gradually to the mixture till it becomes lighter than the oil. The
                    equilibrium of the fluids would now be unstable if it were not for the tension
                    of the surface which separates them, and which, when the orifice of the vessel
                    is not too large, continues to preserve the stability of the equilibrium.</p>
                <p>When the equilibrium at last becomes unstable, the ’ destruction of equilibrium
                    takes place by the lighter fluid ascending in one part of the orifice and the
                    heavier descending in the other. Heuce the displacement of the surface to which
                    we must direct our attention is one which does not alter the volume of the
                    liquid in the vessel, and which therefore is upward in one part of the surface
                    and downward in another. The simplest case is that of a rectangular orifice in a
                    horizontal plane, the sides being <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    > τ</hi> ^hose length is less than λ the principal force concerned is khat of
                    surface-tension. Sir William Thomson proposes to distinguish the latter kind of
                    waves by the name of ripples.</p>
                <p>When a small body is partly immersed in a liquid originally at rest, and moves
                    horizontally with constant velocity V, waves are propagated through the liquid
                    with various velocities according to their respective wave-lengths. In front of
                    the body the relative velocity of the fluid and the body varies from V where the
                    fluid is at rest, to zero at the cutwater on the front surface of the body. The
                    waves produced by the body will travel forwards faster than the body till they
                    reach a distance from it at which the relative velocity of the body and the
                    fluid is equal to the velocity of propagation corresponding to the wavelength.
                    The waves then travel along with the body at a constant distance in front of it.
                    Hence at a certain distance in front of the body there is a series of waves
                    which are stationary with respect to the body. Of these, the waves of minimum
                    velocity form a stationary wave nearest to the front of the body. Between the
                    body and this first wave the surface is comparatively smooth. Then comes the
                    stationary wave of minimum velocity, which is the most marked of the series. In
                    front of this is a double series of stationary waves, the gravitation waves
                    forming a series increasing in wave length with their distance in front of the
                    body, and the surface-tension waves or ripples diminishing in wave-length with
                    their distance from the body, and both sets of waves rapidly diminishing in
                    amplitude with their distance from the body.</p>
                <p>If the current-function of the water referred to the body considered as origin is
                    <hi rend="italic">ψ,</hi> then the equation of the form of the crest of a wave
                    of velocity <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> the crest of which travels along with the
                    body, is <hi rend="italic">dψ = wds</hi> where <hi rend="italic">ds</hi> is an
                    element of the length of the crest. To integrate this equation for a solid of
                    given form is probably difficult, but it is easy to see that at some distance on
                    either side of the body, where the liquid is sensibly at rest, the crest of the
                    wave will approximate to an asymptote inclined to the path of the body at an
                    angle whose sine is , where <hi rend="italic">w</hi> is the velocity of the wave
                    and V is that of the body.</p>
                <p>The crests of the different kinds of waves will therefore appear to diverge as
                    they get further from the body, and the waves themselves will be less and less
                    perceptible. But those whose wave-length is near to that of the wave of mininum
                    velocity will diverge less than any of the others, so that the most marked
                    feature at a distance from the body will be the two long lines of ripples of
                    minimum velocity. If the angle between these is <hi rend="italic">2θ,</hi> the

                <p>Sir W. Thomson has applied the principles of Thermodynamics to determine the
                    thermal effects of increasing or diminishing the area of the free surface of a
                    liquid, and has shown that in order to keep the temperature constant while the
                    area of the surface increases by unity, an amount of heat must be supplied to
                    the liquid which is dynamically equivalent to the product of the absolute
                    temperature into the decrement of the surface-tension per degree of temperature.
                    We may call this the <hi rend="italic">latent heat of
                    surface-extension.</hi></p>
                <p>It appears from the experiments of Brunner and Wolff that at ordinary
                    temperatures the latent heat of extension of the surface of water is dynamically
                    equivalent to about half the mechanical work done in producing the
                    surfaceextension. (j. c. Μ.)</p>
