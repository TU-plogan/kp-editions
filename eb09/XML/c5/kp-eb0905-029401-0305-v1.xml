                    (1500-1569), was born at Florence, where his family, originally landowners in
                    the Vai d’Ambra, had for three generations been settled. His father, Giovanni
                    Cellini, was a musician, and artificer of musical instruments; he married Maria
                    Lisabetta Granacci, and eighteen years elapsed before they had any progeny. The
                    father designed Benvenuto for the same profession with himself, and endeavoured
                    to thwart his inclination for design and metal work. When he had reached the age
                    of fifteen, his youthful predilection had become too strong to be resisted, and
                    his father reluctantly gave consent to his becoming apprenticed to a goldsmith,
                    Antonio di Sandro, named Marcone. He had already attracted some notice in his
                    native place, when, being implicated in a fray with some of his companions, he
                    was banished for six months to Siena. After visiting Bologna and Pisa, and after
                    twice resettling for a while in Florence, he decamped to Rome. On his next
                    return to Florence, his violent temper again embroiled him in a quarrel, which
                    again compelled him to retreat in disguise to Rome. Here he produced a vase for
                    the bishop of Salamanca, which introduced him to the favourable notice of Pope
                    Clement VII.,—likewise at a later date one of his celebrated works, the
                    medallion of Leda and the Swan; he also reverted to music, practised
                    flute-playing, and was appointed one of the Pope’s courtmusicians. In the attack
                    upon Rome by the Constable de Bourbon, which occurred immediately after, in
                    1527, the bravery and address of Cellini proved of signal service to the
                    pontiff; if we may believe his own accounts, his was the very hand which shot
                    the Bourbon dead, and he after wards wounded the Prince of Orange. His exploits
                    paved the way for a reconciliation with the Florentine magistrates, and his
                    return shortly after to his native place. Here he assiduously devoted himself to
                    the execution of medals, the most famous of which (executed a short while later)
                    are Hercules and the Nemean Lion, and Atlas supporting the Sphere. From Florence
                    he went to the court of the duke of Mantua, and thence again to Florence and to
                    Rome. Here he avenged a brother’s death by slaying the slayer; and shortly
                    afterwards he had to flee to Naples to shelter himself from the consequences of
                    an affray with a notary, Ser Benedetto, whom he wounded. Through the influence
                    of several of the cardinals he obtained a pardon; and on the elevation of Paul
                    III. to the pontifical throne he was reinstated in his former position of
                    favour, notwithstanding a fresh homicide of a goldsmith which he had committed
                    in the interregnum Once more the plots of Pier Luigi, a natural son of Paul ΠL,
                    led to his retreat from Rome to Florence and Venice, and once more he was
                    restored with greater honour than before. On returning from a visit to the court
                    of Francis I., being now aged thirty-seven, he was imprisoned on a charge
                    (apparently false) of having embezzled during the war the gems of the pontifical
                    tiara; he remained some while confined in the castle of Sant’ Angelo, escaped,
                    was recaptured, and was in daily expectation of death on the scaffold. At last,
                    however, he was released at the intercession of Pier Luigi’s wife, and of the
                    cardinal of Ferrara, to whom he presented a splendid cup.</p>
                <p>For a while after this he wrought at the court of Francis I. at Fontainebleau and
                    in Paris; but the intrigues of the king’s favourites, whom he would not stoop to
                    conciliate and could not venture to silence by the sword, as he had silenced his
                    enemies at Rome, led him, after about five years of laborious and sumptuous
                    work, and of continually-recurring jealousies and violences, to retire in
                    disgust to Florence, where he employed his time in works of art, and exasperated
                    his temper in rivalries with the uneat y-natured sculptor Baccio Bandinelli.
                    Here, as well as in a previous instance in Paris, he was accused of gross
                    immorality; in his autobiography he rather repels than denies the charge, but he
                    certainly repels it with demonstrative and grotesque vivacity. During the war
                    with Siena, Cellini was appointed to strengthen the defences of his native city,
                    and he continued to gain the admiration of his fellow-citizens by the
                    magnificent works which he produced. He died in Florence on 13th December 1569,
                    and was buried with great pomp in the church of the Annunziata. Besides the
                    works in gold and silver which have been alluded to, Cellini executed several
                    pieces of sculpture on a grander scale. The most distinguished of these is the
                    bronze group of Perseus holding the head of Medusa, placed in front of the old
                    Ducal Palace at Florence, a work full of the fire of genius and the grandeur of
                    a terrible beauty, one of the most typical and unforgettable monuments of the
                    Italian Renaissance. The casting of this great work gave Cellini the utmost
                    trouble and anxiety; its completion was hailed with rapturous homage from all
                    parts of Italy. Not less characteristic of its splendidly gifted and
                    barbarically untameable author are the autobiographical memoirs which he
                    composed, beginning them in Florence in 1558,—a production of the utmost energy,
                    directness, and racy animation, setting forth one of the most singular careers
                    in all the annals of fine art. His amours and hatreds, his passions and
                    delights, his love of the sumptuous and the exquisite in art, his self-applause
                    and self assertion, running now and again into extravagances which it is
                    impossible to credit, and difficult to set down as strictly conscious
                    falsehoods, make this one of the most singular and fascinating books in
                    existence. Here we read, not only of the strange and varied adventures of which
                    we have presented a hasty sketch, but of the devout complacency with which
                    Cellini could contemplate a satisfactorily achieved homicide; of the legion of
                    devils which he and a conjuror evoked in the Colosseum, after one of his not
                    innumerous mistresses had been spirited away from him by her mother; of the
                    marvellous halo of light which he found surrounding his head at dawn and
                    twilight after his Roman imprisonment, and his supernatural visions and angelic
                    protection during that adversity; and of his being poisoned on two several
                    occasions. The autobiography has been translated into English by Thomas Roscoe.
                    Cellini also wrote treatises on the goldsmith’s art, on sculpture, and on
                    design. Among his works of art not already mentioned, and many of which have
                    perished, are a colossal Mars for a fountain at Fontainebleau and the bronzes of
                    the doorway, coins for the Papal and Florentine states, a marble Christ in the
                    Escorial palace, a magnificent button for the pontifical cope of Clement VII., a
                    Jupiter in silver of life size, and a bronze bust of Bindo Altoviti. (w. <hi
