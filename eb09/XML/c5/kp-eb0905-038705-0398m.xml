                    world; but all of them are of a trivial nature, bearing little reference to the
                    subsequent application of the term. The word <hi rend="italic">chancel</hi> is
                    connected with the most ordinary and apt of these origins. It supposes the
                    chancellor to have been so called because he sat within a lattice or screen
                    partitioned from the court of justice or hall of audience. There was no such
                    office in the early civil law, and even under the later Western emperors the
                    cancellarius appears to have been a mere subordinate person, a sort of clerk of
                    the chamber, or scribe, who saw the petitioners, and arranged about their
                    business. Gradually he appears to have risen to the rank of an adviser or
                    conscience-keeper, on whose decision the fate of suitors in a great measure
                    depended. In the Eastern empire the chief cancellarius had become a powerful and
                    important officer. As it was the principle of the popedom to be the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n399/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0399-0388"/> epiritual counterpart of the empire, and possess
                    a corresponding hierarchy, the office was imitated at the ecclesiastical court
                    of Rome, and a chancery at the Vatican was repeated throughout the several
                    bishoprics, where each diocese had its chancellor. The great monastic houses too
                    had frequently a chancellor. In the universities an officer of the same name was
                    the connecting-link between those republican institutions and the Romish
                    hierarchy. While the rector was elected by the proctors of the nation or some
                    other corporate constituency, the bishop of the diocese, or in some cases the
                    head of the monastic house to which the university was subordinated, was <hi
                    rend="italic">ex officio</hi> the chancellor.</p>
                <p>It was the ambition of the kings who rose on the fall of the Roman empire, even
                    of those who reigned in Saxon England, to gather round them as many as they
                    could obtain of the attributes of the emperor or basileus, and hence each
                    generally had his cancellarius. In Central Europe the office would naturally
                    descend from the imperial court of Charlemagne; and in France the chancellor
                    became the head of the law and the minister of justice. The office was abolished
                    at the first Revolution. At the Restoration the ministry of justice was made a
                    separate office, and the chief function of the chancellor was to preside in the
                    House of Peers.</p>
                <p>It is perhaps in England that we have the most remarkable illustration of the
                    struggle between the influence of the imperia] usages and the constitutional
                    spirit of the Northern nations. The existence of common law courts enforcing in
                    its strictness what was deemed the old law of the land, and the chancery with
                    its regal equity interfering to give redress, presents to us the English people
                    with their common lawyers standing up for their rights and privileges, and the
                    monarch, with his clerical advisers, endeavouring to acquire the imperial
                    prerogatives. The chancellor was generally a churchman, who took his ideas of
                    law from the canonists and the civilians, whose principles were intensely
                    disliked by the common lawyers. Hence the two systems called law and equity grew
                    up in antagonism, neither throughout a long contest being able to conquer the
                    other; and hence it is that England has been burdened with the inconvenience of
                    having two systems of jurisprudence, the one called common law, the other
                    equity. The spirit of the former, indeed, may be said to have been so far
                    triumphant in compelling equity to depart from her digressional vagueness, and
                    become a fixed system as securely bound to statute and precedent as the common
                    law itself. But even in Selden’s day we find the laxity of the chancellor’s
                    equity so much suspected, that he says in his <hi rend="italic">Table
                    Talk,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> “Equity is a roguish thing. For law we have a
                    measure—know what to trust to: equity is according to the conscience of him that
                    is chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is equity. It is all one as
                    if they should make the standard for the measure we call a foot a chancellor’s
                    foot. What an uncertain measure would this be! One chancellor has a long foot,
                    another a short foot, another an indifferent foot; it is the same thing in the
                    chancellor’s conscience.” How little, indeed, the chancery practice had been at
                    that time moulded into a strict system, we may infer from the seals being held
                    by a churchman, the celebrated Archbishop Williams, and this at the time when
                    the common law had accumulated that amazing mass of intricate precedents which
                    it tasked all the diligence and genius of Coke to reduce into order. Clarendon,
                    when he became chancellor, had been twenty years out of practice, and his
                    successor Shaftesbury had no pretensions to be acquainted with law. Lord
                    Nottingham appears to have been the first who wished to apply strict rules in
                    the court of chancery, but it does not seem to have been in a fit condition for
                    their application. Roger North says, “He was a formalist; and took pleasure in
                    hearing and deciding, and gave way to all kinds of motions the counsel would
                    offer; supposing that if he split the hair, and with his gold scales determined
                    reasonably on one side of the motion, justice was nicely done—not imagining what
                    torment the people endured who were drawn from the law, and there tost in a
                    blanket.” <hi rend="italic">(Life of Lord Keeper Guildford,</hi> 423). Guildford
                    himself, who, in the words of Lord Campbell, “had as much law as he could
                    contain,” made light of the mere judicial business of his office, which ere
                    then, however, had begun to show its characteristic defects, for, according to
                    his biographer, “the greatest pain he endured ensued from a sense he had of the
                    torments the suitors underwent by the excessive charges and delays of the
                    court.”</p>
                <p>The Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain is a great state officer, with varied
                    and disconnected functions. He is in official rank the highest civil subject in
                    the land out of the royal family, and when raised to the peerage, as he
                    invariably is, he takes precedence immediately after the archbishop of
                    Canterbury. His functions have sometimes been exercised by a “lord keeper of the
                    great seal but there appears to be no essential difference between the two
                    offices, save that the keeper is appointed by mere delivery of the seal, which
                    is of itself sufficient to confer all the powers appertaining to the office,
                    while a chancellor receives letters patent along with it. As a great officer of
                    state, the chancellor acts for both England and Scotland, and in some respects
                    for the United Kingdom, including Ireland. As an administrative officer, as a
                    judge, and as head of the law, he acts merely for England. In the first class of
                    functions he acts as prolocutor, speaker, or chairman of the House of Lords, and
                    in this capacity it sometimes falls to him to adjudicate in Scottish law, since
                    he often leads the judgment of the house on appeals. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Appeal.)</hi> By the Treaty of Union, one great seal was appointed to be kept
                    for all public acts. Hence, in this department, the chancellor’s authority
                    extends to the whole of Britain, and thus the commissions of the peace for
                    Scotland as well as England issue from him. His English ministerial functions
                    are thus briefly described by Blackstone :—“He became keeper of the king’s
                    conscience, visitor, in right of the king, of all hospitals and colleges of the
                    king’s foundation, and patron of all the king’s livings under the value of
                    twenty marks per annum in the king’s books. He is the general guardian of all
                    infants, idiots, and lunatics, and has the general superintendence of all
                    charitable uses in the kingdom.” There is much convenience in the repetition of
                    such vague definitions, from the difficulty of more specifically defining the
                    chancellor’s functions in these matters. His indistinct and unsatisfactory
                    authority as to charitable foundations has been virtually superseded by the
                    Charity Commissioners’ Act of 1853 (17 Vict. cap. 137). The Lord Chancellor is
                    by office a privy-councillor, and it has long been the practice to make him a
                    cabinet minister. Hence he belongs to a political party, and is affected by its
                    fluctuations. This has often been denounced as destructive of the independence
                    and calm deliberativeness essential to the purity and efficiency of the bench.
                    In defence, however, of the ministerial connection of the chancellor, it has
                    been said that, while the other judges should be permanent, the head of the law
                    should stand or fall with the ministry, as the best means of securing his
                    effective responsibility to parliament for the proper use of his extensive
                    powers. The addition of permanent judges to the Chancery Court has removed many
                    of the objections to the fluctuating character of the office.</p>
                <p>Under the Judicature Act, 1873, the Lord Chancellor is president of the Court of
                    Appeal, and, although the Act is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n400/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0400-0389"/> singularly indefinite on the subject, of the High
                    Court of Justice also. He is named as president of the Chancery Division of the
                    latter court. By the Amendment Act of 1875, he is not tobe deemed a “permanent
                    member of the High Court of Justice” within the meaning of the section of the
                    original Act, limiting the number of permanent judges to twenty-one. His
                    judicial patronage is very extensive, and Lord Campbell says that he is by usage
                    the adviser of the Crown in the appointment of judges in the superior courts.
                    His proper title is “Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and Ireland.” His
                    salary is £10,000 per annum, and he is entitled to a pension of £5000 per
                    annum.</p>
                <p>In Ireland there is a lord chancellor at the head of the equity system, which
                    arose in minute imitation of the English.</p>
                <p>In Scotland a chancellor appears at a pretty early period in history, as the
                    person who, being the adviser and conscience-keeper of the king, issued his
                    writs or letters for the remedy of injustice done by judges or other persons in
                    power. A comparison between the English and the Scottish chancellors of the 13
                    th century would probably show them to have then been much alike. Subsequently,
                    however, the civil law predominating in Scotland, the chancellor was its chief
                    administrator, instead of leading on a system antagonistic to the common law.
                    Hence he became the leading judge of the Court of Session on its establishment
                    in 1533. While Episcopacy predominated he was generally an ecclesiastic, never a
                    working lawyer; and after the Revolution he became an officer of state, who was
                    not expected to be a working lawyer. Hence, when by the Treaty of Union the
                    great seal for public transactions was appointed to be kept in England, the Lord
                    Chancellor of Scotland dropped out of existence. A keeper of the great seal
                    continued to be appointed for sealing writs as to private matters, and the
                    office of director of chancery remained for the transaction of routine business
                    connected with the department. When the method of certifying hereditary
                    successions was simplified and placed on a uniform system in 1848, it was put
                    under the direction of an officer called the Sheriff of Chancery.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chancellor of a Diocese</hi> is an officer who holds the
                    courts of the bishop, and acts as his assessor or adviser in matters of
                    ecclesiastical law. A bishop may be compelled to appoint a chancellor; and there
                    is no appeal from the chancellor to the bishop.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster</hi> is an officer
                    appointed of old chiefly to determine controversies between the king and his
                    tenants of the duchy land, and otherwise to direct all the king’s affairs
                    belonging to that court. By late practice, the office, nominally one of high
                    dignity, but demanding little exertion, has been given to statesmen who have
                    grown old in other and more laborious offices, but whose services are still
                    desired in the ministry.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chancellor of the Exchequer</hi> is an officer who,
                    according to the old definitions of his functions, presides in the Exchequer
                    Court, and takes care of the interest of the Crown. He is always in commission
                    with the lord treasurer for the letting of Crown lands, &lt;fcc., and has power,
                    with others, to compound for forfeitures of lands upon penal statutes. While the
                    treasury is understood to have the custody and distribution of the collected
                    revenue, it is the function of the exchequer to realize it. Hence the Chancellor
                    of the Exchequer, as the head of that department which proposes to parliament
                    the plans for the annual revenue, and sees to its realization, is always an
                    important member of the cabinet. Sometimes he is prime minister. His annual
                    statement of the method by which he proposes to meet the exigencies of the
                    exchequer is called “The Budget.” The salary attached to the office is £5000 a
                    year.</p>
