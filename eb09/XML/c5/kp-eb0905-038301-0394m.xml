                    his marriage, and his literary activity, a German. He was born in 1781 at the
                    castle of Boncourt in Champagne, and traced his descent from a respectable line
                    of French knights, who derived their title from the ancient town of Chamesson or
                    <hi rend="italic">Cambisonum,</hi> near Châtillon-sur-Seine. The quiet home-life
                    at Boncourt was broken up by the Revolution in 1790, and the Chamissos, parents
                    and children, were forced, like so many of their rank, to leave their country,
                    and find such footing as might chance in a foreign land. And though in after
                    years the main part of the family was permitted to settle again on their native
                    soil, several of the younger members were left behind, where they had begun to
                    take root. Of these was Adalbert, who had in 1796 obtained a situation as page
                    to the queen of Prussia, and in 1798 entered the military service with the rank
                    of ensign. To his professional studies he devoted himself with ardour, and he
                    attracted the royal attention by some of his writings; but in the society of his
                    comrades he was made bitterly to feel that he was not regarded as one of
                    themselves, and it was not altogether with regret that he found himself in 1806
                    set free from the army. Meanwhile he had formed a friendship with several
                    congenial spirits, such as Hitzig, Varnhagen von Ense and Neumann; and with the
                    last two he joined in the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Musenalmanach,</hi> which first appeared in 1803. A visit to Madame de Stael at
                    Coppet was a pleasing interruption to his ordinary course of life, and has
                    afforded the reader of his letters some amusing description of that eccentric
                    woman, who alternately flattered Chamisso for his ability and scolded him
                    soundly for his inattention to etiquette. The study of botany, which he began at
                    Coppet, was prosecuted with so much persistence and success that it became his
                    professional subject. In 1815 he was chosen botanist of the expedition for the
                    circumnavigation of the world, which was originated by Romanzυfl) and conducted
                    by Kotzebue; and on his return in 1818 he was appointed custodian of the
                    botanical gardens at Berlin. Much to his own advantage and comfort, he obtained
                    the hand of Antonie Piaste, a young lady of eighteen years; and the rest of his
                    life was spent in steady professional labour, relieved by kindly intercourse
                    with an increasing circle of friends. Among those with whom he became acquainted
                    were August Neander, Freiligrath, and Andersen.</p>
                <p>It cannot be said of Chamisso, as he himself affirmed of Heine, that he was a
                    poet to the very tips of his fingers; but the poetic element in his nature was
                    genuine and strong, and, in spite of the unfavourable circumstances of his life,
                    his tendency towards literary expression was very early displayed. In estimating
                    his success as a writer, it should not be forgotten that he was cut off from his
                    native speech and from his natural current of thought and feeling. None of his
                    works perhaps can be called great; but he has none the less enriched his adopted
                    language with several poems <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n395/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0395-0384"/> of undisputed and enduring value. He often deals
                    with gloomy and sometimes with ghastly and repulsive subjects; and even in his
                    lighter and gayer productions there is too frequently an undertone of sadness or
                    of satire. In the lyrical expression of the domestic emotions he displays a fine
                    felicity, and he knows how to pour true pathos into a tale of love or vengeance.
                    The “Lion’s Bride”— <hi rend="italic">Die Lowenbraut</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> may be taken as a simple of his weird and powerful simplicity; and
                    “Retribution,”— <hi rend="italic">Vergeltung</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> is
                    remarkable for a pitiless precision of treatment. The “Song of Women’s Devotion
                    ”— <hi rend="italic">Ein</hi><hi rend="italic">Lied</hi><hi rend="italic">von
                    der</hi><hi rend="italic">Weibertreue</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> might find a
                    place in the <hi rend="italic">Ingoldsby Legends;</hi> and “Cousin Anselmo”— <hi
                    rend="italic">Vetter Anselmo</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> is worthy to rank with
                    the ballads of Southey. Of more celebrity perhaps than any of his poems is the
                    little prose narrative of <hi rend="italic">Peter Schlemihl,</hi> the man who
                    lost his shadow, which first appeared in 1814, and was soon afterwards
                    translated into several European languages. It was written partly to divert his
                    own attention from gloomier thoughts, and partly to afford amusement to the
                    children of his friend Hitzig; and the plot was suggested by a casual question
                    of Fouqué’s. First and prominently a genuine story such as children love, with
                    full allowance of incident and fun, it is also to the older and sympathetic
                    reader an allegory only too accurate of the poet’s own life. For full details
