                    seizure) is a term applied to a nervous affection characterized by the sudden
                    suspension of sensation and volition, accompanied with a peculiar rigidity of
                    the whole or of certain muscles of the body. The subjects of catalepsy are in
                    most instances females of highly nervous temperament. The exciting cause of an
                    attack is usually mental emotion operating either suddenly, as in the case of a
                    fright, or more gradually in the way of prolonged depression. The symptoms
                    presented vary in different cases, and even in the same individual in different
                    attacks. Sometimes the typical features of the disease are exhibited in a state
                    of complete insensibility, together with a statue-like appearance of the body
                    which will retain any attitude it may be made to assume during the continuance
                    of the attack. In this condition the whole organic and vital functions appear to
                    be reduced to the lowest possible limit consistent with life, and to such a
                    degree as to simulate actual death. At other times considerable mental
                    excitement will accompany the cataleptic symptoms, and the patient will sing or
                    utter passionate exclamations during the fit, being all the while quite
                    unconscious. The attack may be of short duration, passing off within a few
                    minutes. It may, however, last for many hours, and in some rare instances
                    persist foi several days; and it is conceivable that in such cases the
                    appearances presented might be mistaken for real death, <pb break="no"

                    Catalepsy belongs to the class of functional nervous disorders, of which the
                    pathology is but little understood, owing to the manner in which morbid physical
                    and psychical conditions are mixed up. Although it is said to occur in persons
                    in perfect health, careful inquiry will usually reveal some -departure from the
                    normal state, as is shown by the greater number of the recorded cases. More
                    particularly is this true of females, in whom some form of menstrual derangement
                    will generally be found to have preceded the cataleptic affection. Catalepsy is
                    sometimes associated with epilepsy and with grave forms of mental disease. In
                    ordinary cases, however, the mental phenomena bear close resemblance to those
                    witnessed in hysteria, with which disease catalepsy, though not identical, has
                    very close alliance. In many of the subjects of catalepsy there appears to be a
                    remarkable weakness of the will, whereby the tendency to lapse into the
                    cataleptic state is not resisted but rather in some measure encouraged, and
                    attacks may thus be induced by the most trivial circumstances. From what has
                    been stated it follows that the successful treatment of such a disease as
                    catalepsy must depend upon the due recognition of both its corporeal and mental
                    relations. While the state of health will demand the attention of the physician,
                    his skill and judgment will be no less urgently called for in dealing with the
                    mental and moral characteristics manifested in each particular case. Dr Chambers
                    has shown that efforts directed to obtain command of the patient’s will, so as
                    to compel her to resist to the utmost the inclination to fall into the
                    cataleptic state, may succeed in curing even aggravated examples of this
                    disease. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Ecstasy, Hysteria, Somnambulism.</hi></p>
