                <p><label type="entry">CLARK, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label> (1801-1867),
                    a distinguished chemist, was born at Ayr, on the 31st March 1801. His father was
                    captain of a merchant vessel, and his mother began the Ayrshire needlework. He
                    was educated at the Ayr Academy, a school of great efficiency and repute. In
                    1816 he entered the counting-house of Charles Macintosh &lt;fc Co., the
                    inventors of the waterproof cloth, but soon obtained the more congenial
                    situation of chemist in Tennant’s chemical works at St Rollox. In 1826 he was
                    appointed lecturer on chemistry to the Glasgow mechanics’ institution, where he
                    propounded advanced views on the atomic theory and the theory of salts. The same
                    year he published his first papers, containing his discovery of the pyrophospate
                    of soda, which was a turning-point in chemical history. Becoming a medical
                    student in the university of Glasgow, he took the degree of M.D. in 1831. He was
                    for several years apothecary to the Glasgow infirmary, and published several
                    important papers on pharmacy. In 1832 he published in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Westminster Review</hi> an elaborate inquiry into the existing system of
                    weights and measures. In 1833 he obtained by competition the chair of chemistry
                    in Marischal College, Aberdeen. About the same time he matured two important
                    practical researches relating to the construction of hydrometers and the means
                    of detecting arsenic. In 1835 he published a paper on the “Application of the
                    Hot-Blast,” explaining the principle of its efficacy. In 1836 appeared his
                    letter to Mitscherlich on the Oxygen Salts. Clark’s name became most generally
                    known in connection with his water tests and his process for softening hard
                    (chalk) waters. These came out in 1841. The tests have been in use ever since;
                    and the softening process intended for the London waters, but not as yet adopted
                    by any of the London companies, has been very successfully carried out in
                    several places. In 1844 his health gave way under mental strain, and he ceased
                    to be able to lecture to his class. Being removed also from his laboratory, he
                    did little more chemical work, except directing his assistant in perfecting his
                    water tests. His active mind, however, could not rest, and he took up several
                    inquiries, the last of all, which occupied what strength he had for nearly
                    twenty years before his death, beingthe historical origin of the Gospels.
                    Proceeding from one stage to another, he finally concentrated his energies on an
                    attempt to settle the true readings of the Greek text of the three first
                    Gospels. His mode of proceeding displayed the peculiar sagacity and tact shown
                    in his scientific inventions, and his results had reached a form admitting of
                    publication at the time of his death. The work would have been very valuable in
                    connection with the revision of the Bible, and it is to be regretted that his
                    surviving relatives didnot seefit topublishit. Clark took a leading part in all
                    the discussions relating to the improvement of the university of Aberdeen. He
                    was an admirable lecturer, but unfortunately his teaching career was short. He
                    died at Glasgow on the 27th November 1867.</p>
