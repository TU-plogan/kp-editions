                    noble family, but alienated his friends by embracing the dramatic profession
                    early in life. He made a runaway marriage with Zanetta Farusi, the beautiful
                    daughter of a Venetian shoemaker; and Giovanni was their eldest child. When he
                    was but a year old, his parents, taking a journey to London, left him in charge
                    of his grandmother, who perceiving his precocious and lively intellect, had him
                    educated far above her means. At sixteen he passed his examination and entered
                    the seminary of St Cyprian in Venice, from which he was expelled a short time
                    afterwards for some scandalous and immoral conduct, which would have cost him
                    his liberty, had not his mother managed somehow to procure him a situation in
                    the household of the Cardinal Acquaviva. He made but a short stay, however, in
                    that prelate’s establishment, all restraint being irksome to his wayward
                    disposition, and took to travelling. Then began that existence of adventure and
                    intrigue which only ended with his death. He visited Rome, Naples, Corfu,
                    Constantinople, and penetrated even so far as St Petersburg, where he was
                    introduced to Catherine II. By turns journalist, preacher, abbé, diplomatist, he
                    was nothing very long, except <hi rend="italic">homme à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bonnes fortunes,</hi> which profession he assiduously cultivated till the end
                    of his days. In 1755 having returned to Venice, he was denounced to the
                    Government as a political spy, and committed to prison. After several fruitless
                    attempts he succeeded in establishing a communication with another prisoner, in
                    whose company he made his escape on the night of the 31st of October 1756. This
                    exploit, afterwards so graphically related by him in a separate volume, and also
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> gained him great celebrity. From that day
                    he became a man of fashion, and recommenced his life of dissolute and profligate
                    adventure. Exhibiting his effrontery and audacity at every court in Europe, he
                    at last made his way through Germany, in which country he was presented to
                    Frederick the Great, into France. Here he became acquainted with Rousseau,
                    Voltaire, and many more notabilities, had interviews with Louis XV., and was
                    almost tenderly intimate with Madame de Pompadour. Handsome, witty, and
                    eloquent, it is not to be wondered at that such a man should have been received

                    18th century. Consummate profligate and charlatan as he was, he was loaded with
                    honours by the Italian princes, and even decorated by the Pope himself.</p>
                <p>After eighteen years’ absence from his native town, he endeavoured to reinstate
                    himself in the esteem of the Venetians by a refutation of the work of Amelot de
                    la Houssaye on the constitution of the republic; and when at last serious
                    matters took the place of his pleasures, he became, in 1782, librarian to a
                    German prince without a library. This prince was Count Waldstein, whom he
                    accompanied to his chateau at Dux in Bohemia, in which place he died in 1803,
                    after having written his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> a work not unlike the
                    <hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi> of Rousseau, but far more depraved in tone.
                    They are the frank avowal of a godless life, notwithstanding the frequent
                    professions of Christianity in the preface. Much as they have been overrated, a
                    certain literary merit cannot be denied to them. They are principally
                    interesting for the faithful pictures they give us of the morals and manners of
                    the times. The <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> were published at Leipsic, 10
                    vols., in 1828-38, and at Paris, 4 vols., in 1843. He also wrote several works
                    on history in Italian; <hi rend="italic">Récit de ma Captivité,</hi> 1788; a
                    translation in verse of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> 1778; and a <hi
                    rend="italic">Narrative of Eighty Years spent among the Inhabitants of the
