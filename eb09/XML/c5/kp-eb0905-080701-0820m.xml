                <p><label type="entry">CLARENDON, <hi rend="smallcaps">George William Frederick
                    Villiers, fourth Earl of</hi></label>, diplomatist and statesman, was born in
                    London 12th January 1800, and died 27th June 1870. He was the eldest son of the
                    Honourable George Villiers, brother of the third earl of Clarendon (second
                    creation), by Theresa, only daughter of the first Lord Boringdon, and
                    granddaughter of the first Lord Grantham. The earldom of the Lord Chancellor
                    Clarendon became extinct in 1756 by the death of the fourth earl, his last male
                    descendant. Jane Hyde, countess of Essex, the sister of that nobleman (who died
                    in 1724), left two daughters; of these the eldest, Lady Charlotte, became
                    heiress of the Hyde family. She married Thomas Villiers, second son of the
                    second earl of Jersey, who served with distinction as English minister in
                    Germany, and in 1776 the earldom of Clarendon was revived in his favour. The
                    connection with the Hyde family was therefore in the female line and somewhat
                    remote. But a portion of the pictures and plate of the great chancellor was
                    preserved to this branch of the family, and remains at the Grove, their family
                    seat at Hertfordshire, to this day.</p>
                <p>Young George Villiers, the subject of this notice, entered upon life under
                    circumstances which gave small promise of the brilliancy of his future career.
                    He was well born; he was heir presumptive to an earldom; and his mother was a
                    woman of great energy, admirable good sense, and high feeling. But the means of
                    his family were contracted; his education was desultory and incomplete; he had
                    not the advantages of a training either at a public school or in the House of
                    Commons. He went up to Cambridge at the early age of sixteen, and entered St
                    John’s College on the 29th June 1816. In 1820, as the eldest son of an earl’s
                    brother with royal descent, he was enabled to take his M.A. degree under the
                    statutes of the university then in force; and in the same year he was appointed
                    attaché to the British embassy at St Petersburg, where he remained three years,
                    and acquired that practical knowledge of the business of diplomacy which was of
                    so much use to him in after-life. He had received from nature a singularly
                    handsome person, a polished and engaging address, a ready command of languages,
                    and a remarkable power of composition.</p>
                <p>Upon his return to England in 1823, Mr Villiers was appointed to a
                    commîssionership of customs, an office which he retained for about ten years.
                    Part of this time was spent in Ireland in the work of fusing the revenue boards
                    of England and Ireland into those of the United Kingdom. It was the period of
                    the liveliest excitement that preceded Catholic Emancipation, and the young
                    English official incurred the censure of the Tory Government of the day for
                    having presumed to cultivate the acquaintance of the most accomplished of the
                    Catholic leaders. These official duties trained Mr Villiers in the business of
                    civil administration, and likewise enabled him to acquire some useful experience
                    of the Irish character. In 1831 he was despatched to France to negotiate a
                    commercial treaty, which, however, led to no result.</p>
                <p>The time was come which was to open to him a wider and more congenial field of
                    action in the politics of Europe. On the 16th of August 1833 Mr Villiers was
                    appointed minister at the court of Spain. Ferdinand VII. died within a month of
                    his arrival at Madrid, and the infant queen Isabella, then in the third year of
                    her age, was placed by the old Spanish law of female inheritance on her
                    contested throne. Don Carlos, the late king’s brother, claimed the crown by
                    virtue of the Salic law of the House of Bourbon which Ferdinand had renounced
                    before the birth of his daughter. Isabella II. and her mother Christina, the
                    queen regent, became the representatives of constitutional monarchy, Don Carlos
                    of Catholic absolutism. The conflict which had divided the despotic and the
                    constitutional powers of Europe since the French Revolution of 1830 broke out
                    into civil war in Spain, and by the Quadruple Treaty, signed on April 22, 1834,
                    France and England pledged themselves to the defence of the constitutional
                    thrones of Spain and Portugal. For six years Mr Villiers continued to give the
                    most active and intelligent support to the Liberal Government of Spain. He was
                    accused, though unjustly, of having favoured the revolution of La Granja, which
                    drove Christina, the queen mother, out of the kingdom, and raised Espartero to
                    the regency. He undoubtedly supported the chiefs of tke Liberal party, such as
                    Olozaga and Espartero against the intrigues of the French Court; but the object
                    of the British Government was to establish the throne of Isabella on a truly
                    national and liberal basis and to avert those complications, dictated by foreign
                    influence, which eventually proved so fatal to that princess. Spain never forgot
                    what she owed in those years to the youthful and energetic minister of Great
                    Britain, and he, on his part, retained a cordial interest in her welfare. He
                    received the Grand Cross of the Bath in 1838 in acknowledgment of his services,
                    and succeeded, on the death of his uncle, to the title of earl of Clarendon; in
                    the following year, having left Madrid, he married Katharine, eldest daughter of
                    James Walter, first earl of Verulam.</p>
                <p>In January 1840 he entered Lord Melbourne’s administration as Lord Privy Seal,
                    and from the death of Lord Holland in the autumn of that year, Lord Clarendon
                    also held the office of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster until the
                    dissolution of the ministry in 1841. In this capacity he made his first
                    appearance in parliament, and although he always regretted the want of a
                    previous training in the House of Commons, he was from the first listened to by
                    the House of Peers as a speaker well qualified to assist the deliberations of
                    parliament on questions of foreign policy. But on these questions he was not
                    heartily united with the spirit that then animated the Foreign Office. Deeply
                    convinced that the maintenance of a cordial understanding with France was the
                    most essential condition of peace and of a liberal policy in Europe, he
                    reluctantly concurred in the measures proposed by Lord Palmerston for the
                    expulsion of the pasha of Egypt from Syria; he strenuously advocated, with Lord
                    Holland, a more conciliatory policy towards France; and he was only restrained
                    from sending in his resignation by the dislike he felt to break up a cabinet he
                    had so recently joined. Lord Palmerston’s policy (as is shown by his own
                    published letters) was constantly governed by the belief that France must be
                    regarded by England as a rival and an enemy, with whom war was, sooner or <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0821-0808"/> later, inevitable. Lord Clarendon, on the
                    contrary, regarded France as a rival, but a friend; he relied on the good sense
                    and common interests of the two nations to maintain amicable relations; and he
                    succeeded in drawing closer for a period of thirty years, from 1840 to 1870, the
                    ties which still happily remain unbroken between them. That was his great
                    object, and the proudest result of his political life; and the difficulties he
                    had to encounter were at times as great on his own side of the Channel as on the
                    other.</p>
                <p>The interval of Sir Robert Peel’s great administration (1841-1846) was to the
                    leaders of the Whig party a period of repose; but Lord Clarendon took the
                    warmest interest in the progressive triumph of the principles of free trade and
                    in the ultimate repeal of the corn-laws, of which his brother, Mr Charles Pelham
                    Villiers, had been the earliest, the most constant, and the most able advocate.
                    For this reason, upon the formation of Lord John Russell’s first administration,
                    Lora Clarendon accepted the office of President of the Board of Trade. Twice in
                    his career the Governor-Generalship of India was offered him, and once the
                    Governor-Generalship of Canada;—these he refused from reluctance to withdraw
                    from the politics of Europe. But in 1847 a sense of duty compelled him to take a
                    far more laborious and uncongenial appointment. The desire of the cabinet was to
                    abolish the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland, and Lord Clarendon was prevailed upon
                    to accept that office, with a view to transform it ere long into an Irish
                    Secretaryship of State. But he had not been many months in Dublin before he
                    acknowledged that the difficulties then existing in Ireland could only be met by
                    the most vigilant and energetic authority, exercised on the spot. The crisis was
                    one of extraordinary peril. Agrarian crimes of horrible atrocity had increased
                    threefold. The Catholic clergy were openly disaffected. This was the second year
                    of a famine which had desolated Ireland. The population, decimated by starvation
                    and disease, lived upon the poor-rate and the alms of England, and extraordinary
                    measures were required to regulate the bounty of the Government and the nation.
                    In 1848 the French Revolution let loose fresh elements of discord, which
                    culminated in an abortive insurrection, and for a lengthened period Ireland was
                    a prey to more than her wonted symptoms of disaffection and disorder. During
                    those five years Lord Clarendon held the reins of the vice-regal government; a
                    task more entirely repugnant to his own predilections and more certain to be
                    repaid with unmerited obloquy could not have been imposed upon him. But he bore
                    up against that flood of hostile passions and difficulties with unshaken
                    firmness. He fed the starving; he subdued the factious; he crashed the
                    rebellious. He left behind him permanent marks of improvement in the legislation
                    of Ireland; and he practised, as far as possible, the broadest toleration of
                    races and of creeds. If any name is associated in Ireland with the recollection
                    of a government at once firm, far-sighted, and liberal, it should be that of
                    Lord Clarendon. His services were expressly acknowledged by her Majesty in the
                    Speech to both Houses of Parliament from the throne, on September 5, 1848,—this
                    being the first time that any <hi rend="italic">civil</hi> services obtained
                    that honour; and he was made a Knight of the Garter (retaining also the Grand
                    Cross of the Bath by special order of her Majesty) on the 23d March 1849.
                    Looking back to that period, after an interval of more than twenty years, it
                    must be acknowledged that from this crisis dates the regeneration of Ireland.
                    The population, reduced in numbers, has never ceased to advance in prosperity;
                    wages have risen; the land has been freed from secular incumbrances; crime has
                    diminished; and treason itself has never recovered the crushing defeat of Smith
                    O’Brien and Meagher. Lord Clarendon had a large share in promoting these
                    results; but he hailed with no common satisfaction the change of Government
                    which released him from those arduous duties in 1852.</p>
                <p>Upon the formation of the coalition ministry between the Whigs and the Peelites,
                    in 1853, under Lord Aberdeen, the premier placed, without hesitation, the
                    foreign office in the hands of Lord Clarendon; but incredulous himself of the
                    peril of war, which was already casting its dark shadow over the East, Lord
                    Aberdeen sought rather to check than to stimulate the decisions which might
                    possibly have arrested the course of hostilities. It can hardly now be doubted
                    that the hesitation which appeared to mark the successive steps of the Western
                    allies encouraged the czar to more daring aggressions; and Lord Clarendon
                    confessed, in an expression which was never forgotten, that we “drifted” into
                    war, which a more prompt defiance and an open alliance between the Western
                    powers and the Porte might have arrested. But the war once begun Lord Clarendon
                    continually urged the prosecution of it with the greatest energy. He employed
                    every means in his power to stimulate and assist the war departments, and above
                    all he maintained the closest relations with our French allies, on whose
                    cooperation everything depended. The Emperor Nicholas had speculated on the
                    impossibility of the sustained joint action of France and England in council and
                    in the field. It was mainly by Lord Clarendon at Whitehall and by Lord Raglan
                    before Sebastopol that such a combination was rendered practicable, and did
                    eventually triumph over the enemy. The diplomatic conduct of such an alliance
                    for three years between two great nations jealous of their military honour and
                    fighting for no separate political advantage, tried by excessive hardships and
                    at moments on the verge of defeat, was certainly one of the most arduous duties
                    ever performed by a minister. No one will ever know all the labour it cost; but
                    the result was due in the main to the confidence with which Lord Clarendon had
                    inspired the emperor of the French, and to the affection and regard of the
                    empress, whom he had known in Spain from her childhood.</p>
                <p>In 1856 Lord Clarendon took his seat at the Congress of Paris convoked for the
                    restoration of peace, as first British Plenipotentiary, invested with full
                    powers. It was the first time since the appearance of Lord Castlereagh at Vienna
                    that a secretary of state for foreign affairs had been present in person at a
                    congress on the Continent. Lord Clarendon’s first care was to obtain the
                    admission of Italy to the council chamber as a belligerent power,, and to raise
                    the barrier which still excluded Prussia as a neutral one. But in the general
                    anxiety of all the powers to terminate the war there was no small danger that
                    the objects for which it had been undertaken would be abandoned or forgotten. It
                    is due, we may say, entirely to the firmness of Lord Clarendon that the
                    principle of the neutralization of the Black Sea was preserved, that the Russian
                    attempt to trick the allies out of the cession in Bessarabia was defeated, and
                    that the results of th« war were for a time secured.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> The Crimean War and the peace of 1856 had
                    results highly beneficial to the politics of Europe. They rescued Turkey from
                    the inimical grasp of Russia, and gave to the Ottoman empire twenty years of
                    peace and security, which might, under abler rulers, have restored it to real
                    independence and prosperity. They overthrew the preponderance which the Emperor
                    Nicholas had asserted in Europe; they cemented the alliance of France and
                    England; and they led the way to the subsequent changes which followed in Italy
                    and Germany. These were all objects which Lord Clarendon had at heart, and
                    although no minister can hope to have a permanent influence on the course of
                    human affairs, the events of the last twenty-five years have not been
                    uninfluenced by his liberal and conciliatory views.</p></note> The Congress was
                    eaεer to turn to other subjects, and perhaps the most important result of its
                    deliberations was the celebrated Declaration of the Maritime Powers, which
                    abolished privateering, defined the right of blockade, and limited the right of
                    capture to enemy’s property in enemy’s ships. Lord Clarendon has been accused of
                    an abandonment of what are termed the belligerent rights of this country, which
                    were undoubtedly based on the old maritime laws of Europe. But he acted in
                    strict conformity with the views of the British cabinet, and the British cabinet
                    adopted those views because it was satisfied that it was not for the benefit of
                    the country to adhere to practices which exposed the vast mercantile interests
                    of Britain to depredation, even by the cruisers of a secondary maritime power,
                    and which, if vigorously enforced against neutrals, could not fail to embroil
                    her with every maritime state in the world. The experience of 1780, when the
                    armed neutrality of the North reacted so fatally on the American war, is the
                    most conclusive demonstration of the fatal results of such a system of policy;
                    and the more enlightened views of the present day have shown that a commercial
                    belligerent nation would lose far more than she would gain by the suppression of
                    the neutral trade, even if such a suppression were possible.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0822-0809"/> 1859, Lord John Russell made it a condition of
                    his acceptance of office under Lord Palmerston that the Foreign Department
                    should be placed in his own hands, which implied that Lord Clarendon should be
                    excluded from office, as it would have been inconsistent alike with his dignity
                    and his tastes to fill any other post in the Government. The consequence was
                    that from 1859 till 1864 Lord Clarendon remained out of office, and the critical
                    relations arising out of the civil war in the United States were left to the
                    guidance of Earl Russell. But he re-entered the cabinet in May 1864 as
                    Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; and upon the death of Lord Palmerston in
                    1865, Lord Russell again became prime minister, when Lord Clarendon returned to
                    the Foreign Office, which was again confided to him for the third time upon the
                    formation of Mr Gladstone’s administration in 1868. To the last moment of his
                    existence, Lord Clarendon continued to devote every faculty of his mind and
                    every instant of his life to the public service; and he expired surrounded by
                    the boxes and papers of his office on the 27th June 1870, within a few days of
                    that great catastrophe which was about to change the face of Europe, and which
                    he, if any body, might possibly have retarded or averted. His death called forth
                    expressions of the deepest sympathy and regret from all the courts and statesmen
                    of both hemispheres; and these manifestations of more than official sorrow were
                    collected and laid before parliament by order of the Queen. This is not the
                    place to enlarge on the charm of Lord Clarendon’s personal demeanour, or on the
                    playfulness and grace he threw over the conduct of great affairs. We must
                    content ourselves with a brief record of what he did in public life. But no man
                    owed more to the influence of a generous, unselfish, and liberal disposition. If
                    he had rivals he never ceased to treat them with the consideration and
                    confidence of friends, and he cared but little for the ordinary prizes of
                    ambition in comparison with the advancement of the great cause of peace and
                    progress in the world.</p>
                <p>A notice of Lord Clarendon, by a friendly hand, was printed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fraser's Magazine</hi> for August 1870, from which we have borrowed some
                    details. No other-biography of this eminent and accomplished statesman has been
                    published. (H. R.)</p>
