                    the world, and especially with the conduct of Manasses, archbishop of Rheims,
                    determined to live, in some remote and retired spot, a life dedicated to
                    contemplation and religion. With six companions he went to consult Hugh, bishop
                    of Grenoble, who led them to a spot among the mountains, about ten or twelve
                    miles from the town, called Chartreuse; and Bruno at once fixed upon this as the
                    site of the establishment which he was minded to found. Very many mediaeval
                    writers have exhausted the resources of language in describing the awful and
                    terrible nature and aspect of this spot, shut in among nakèd and precipitous
                    rocks, surrounded by sterile mountains, and for a large portion of the year
                    buried in the snow; and many modern writers have celebrated the romantic and
                    picturesque features of the place. The obscure name was destined to become
                    familiar in every country and language of Europe, and the monastery which Bruno
                    founded there, soon after mankind had begun to recover from the alarm caused by
                    the belief that the world would come to an end in the 1000th year after Christ,
                    has been the parent of all the numerous “Chartreux,” “Certose,” and
                    “Charterhouses,” and “Carthusian” establishments throughout Europe.</p>
                <p>Peter the Venerable, abbot of Cluny, writing about fifty years later, speaks thus
                    of the mode of life of the earliest Carthusians :—</p>
                <p>“Warned by the negligence and lukewarmness of many of the older monks, they
                    adopted for themselves and for their followers greater precaution against the
                    artifices of the Evil One. As a remedy against pride and vain-glory they chose a
                    dress more poor and contemptible than that of any other religious body; so that
                    i ’ is horrible to look on these garments, so short, scanty, coarse, and dirty
                    are they. In order to cut up avarice by the roots, they enclosed around their
                    cells a certain quantity of land, more or less, according to the fertility of
                    the district; and they would not accept a foot of land beyond that limit if you
                    were to offer them the whole world. For the same motive they limit the quantity
                    of their cattle, oxen, asses, sheep, and goats. And in order that they might
                    have no motive for augmenting their possessions, either of land or animals, they
                    ordained that in every one of their monasteries there should be no more than
                    twelve monks, with their prior the thirteenth, eighteen lay brothers, and a few
                    paid servants. To mortify the flesh they always wear hair shirts of the severest
                    kind, and their fasting is well-nigh continuous. They always eat bread of
                    unbolted meal, and take so much water with their wine that it has hardly any
                    flavour of wine left. They never eat meat, whether in health or ill. They never
                    buy fish, but they accept it if it is given to them for charity. They may eat
                    cheese and eggs only on Sundays and Thursdays. On Tuesdays and Saturdays they
                    eat cooked vegetables. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, they take only bread
                    and water. They eat once a day only, save on the days of the octaves of
                    Christmas, Easter, Pentecost, Epiphany, and one or two other solemnities. They
                    live in separate little houses like the ancient monks of Egypt, and they occupy
                    themselves continually with reading, prayer, and the labour of their hands,
                    especially the writing of books. They recite the prayers for minor canonical
                    hours in their own dwellings, when warned by the bell of the church; but they
                    all assemble in church for matins and vespers. On feast days they eat twice, and
                    sing all the offices in the church, and eat in the refec-toιy. They do not say
                    mass save on festivals and Sundays. They boil the vegetables served out to them
                    in their own dwellings, and never drink wine save with their food.”</p>
                <p>As might be supposed, the rigour of this rule has been much modified. The
                    Carthusian dress of very thick white cloth is no longer by any means the poorest
                    or dirtiest of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n175/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0175-0164"/> monastic costumes. It consists of a cassock or
                    frock and cloak of ample and comfortable length. But the practice of each monk
                    living in his own separate dwelling has always characterized the Carthusians.
                    They have never been Coenobites.</p>
                <p>The Carthusians had no written rule till one was composed for them, about
                    forty-five years after the foundation of the first house of the order at
                    Chartreuse, by Guigo, their fifth prior. Some of the most special and
                    characteristic points of it are as follows :—</p>
                <p>It was not permitted to the members of the order to practise any greater or
                    additional austerities than those prescribed, without special licence from the
                    prior. They were rarely to use medicine, but to be bled five times a year, and
                    shaved six times. They were forbidden to receive any charity from usurers or
                    excommunicated persons. They declined to bury any stranger (save a monastic
                    person who might have happened to die within their walls) within their
                    pre-tincts, and refused to charge themselves with the saying of any anniversary
                    or other masses for the dead,—the reason assigned for the refusal being, that
                    “we have heard that the majority of priests are very ready to say masses, and to
                    make splendid banquets whenever any one goes to pay them for praying for the
                    dead—all which destroys abstinence, and renders prayer venal, making it depend
                    on the will of whoso gives dinners.” If, says Guigo’s rule, our successors
                    should find it impossible to maintain even this small number (thirteen) without
                    being reduced to the odious necessity of begging, and wandering to beg, we
                    advise them rather to reduce their number to as many as can be supported, than
                    to expose themselves to such dangers. Under the seventh general of the order, St
                    Anthelm, the practice of holding general chapters was first introduced among the
                    Carthusians; these have always been held at the “Grande Chartreuse” near
                    Grenoble, the parent establishment.</p>
                <p>The earliest formal approbation of the Carthusian Order is attributed to Urban
                    II. (ob. 1099). That pontiff, who had been a disciple of Bruno, when the latter
                    was lecturing on theology at Rheims, had sent for Bruno to Rome a few years
                    after his retirement to Chartreuse. The saint obeyed, taking all his monks with
                    him. The latter shortly returned to Chartreuse, under Landuino, appointed by
                    Bruno to be their second prior; but Bruno himself refused to be made archbishop
                    of Reggio, and finding the life of Rome insupportable to him, soon obtained the
                    Pope’s permission to accept a district of forest, in the diocese of Squillace in
                    Calabria, given to him by Count Roger, where he founded the second house of his
                    order. The rule and constitution of the order were frequently modified on
                    subsequent occasions. The present rule is that which was fixed in 1578 and was
                    corrected by a congregation of cardinals, published in 1581, and reconfirmed by
                    Innocent XL in 1682. According to those new statutes, observes Moroni (or rather
                    the learned writer of the article in his <hi rend="italic">Dictionary),</hi>
                    some of the practices as at present enjoined are more austere than in the
                    ancient rule, since the choral service and the office used by Carthusians are
                    peculiar to them, and are of excessive length, following in many respects the
                    ceremonies and rites of the ancient church. By these statutes the use of linen
                    is wholly prohibited to them. They wear next the skin a shirt of horse-hair,
                    bound by a cord girdle, and outside this a cossack and mantle of serge; and they
                    sleep on a paillasse, with woollen sheets. The portrait of a Carthusian monk may
                    be seen in Bonanni’s <hi rend="italic">Catalogo,</hi> at chapter 108, and a
                    similar figure forms the 10th plate of Capparroni’s <hi rend="italic">Raccolta
                    degli</hi><hi rend="italic">Ordini religiosi,</hi> published at Rome in
                    1826.</p>
                <p>It is a very common error to suppose that the Carthusians are a branch or
                    off-shoot from the great Benedictine order. It is true that the formula of their
                    “office” or choral service is nearly the same as that used by the different
                    orders which belong to the great Benedictine family; but there is no
                    relationship, of parentage or other, between the Carthuisans and Benedictines.
                    The superiors of Carthusian convents are called priors, and not abbots as is the
                    case with the Benedictine orders. Their general is the prior of the “Grande
                    Chartreuse” near Grenoble, and resides always there, and not, as in the case of
                    most other orders, at Rome. The order has a proctor-general <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Procuratore</hi><hi rend="italic">Generale)</hi> who resides at Rome. Above
                    all there is the radical difference in their mode of life,—the Benedictines
                    being Coenobites, the Carthusians eremitical, living each in his own separate
                    dwelling, erected within the wall, which forms the cloister <hi rend="italic"
                    >(clausura),</hi> but not even contiguous the one to the other.</p>
                <p>St Bruno and his early successors made no pretension to any exemption from the
                    jurisdiction of the ordinary, nor sought for any privilege of the kind. On the
                    contrary they in a special manner recognized the bishop of Grenoble, in whose
                    diocese their first and parent establishment was situated, as the chief and
                    abbot of their order. But the constant and unfailing tendency, which led all the
                    regular bodies to aim at such exemptions, and to encroach in every manner ever
                    more and more on the authority and proper domain of the bishops and secular
                    clergy, induced the Carthusians within little more than an hundred years after
                    their foundation to beg and to obtain from Pope Boniface IX. a bull, dated 6th
                    of March 1391, granting them the exemption in question. It is remarkable, as
                    indicating the strength of this tendency, that although the bull of Boniface is
                    the first recognition whatever of any such exemption, the Pope says in the
                    document in question, “A supplication has been presented in your name, setting
                    forth, that although your order <hi rend="italic">has been for a long time
                    repτιted exempt</hi> from the jurisdiction of the ordinary, and dependent
                    immediately on the Holy See,” &lt;fcc. It had evidently come to be considered as
                    a matter of course that monks, merely as such, were not subject to the authority
                    of the bishop. The motive assigned for granting the exemption is that “certain
                    persons seek by citing you to their tribunals to disturb you in the quietude and
                    contemplation which are the object of your institute.”</p>
                <p>The order of the Carthusians has always been one of the most respectable of the
                    monastic bodies. It has maintained to a greater degree than most of them the
                    spirit and qualities which presided at its foundation. Nor has it ever needed,
                    as so many of its fellow communities, to be reformed. And although the services
                    which it has rendered to literature cannot vie with those of the Benedictines,
                    it has by no means been valueless to the world in this respect.</p>
                <p>The order at one time possessed 172 monasteries, of which 75 were in France. It
                    had also numerous establishments in England (where, as is well known, the
                    “Charter House” near Smithfield, in London, was its principal house), Italy,
                    Germany, and Spain. Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, canonized in 1220, was a
                    Carthusian. The order, however, has had fewer saints than almost any of the
                    others; so much so that the Carthusian Ferrari wrote a treatise of inquiry into
                    the causes of this fact. To which query an answer may be found in the 97th of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Letters</hi> of Father Sarnelli, who was
                    vicar-general under Benedict XIII. (published in ten volumes at Venice in 1716),
                    to the following effect :—</p>
                <p>“For canonization not only exalted virtues but the working of miracles is
                    required. Now miracles are rarely performed by these solitary recluses, because
                    the result of their doing so would be to call numbers of persons together, who
                    would necessarily destroy or greatly impede the quietude of the contemplative
                    life which it is the object of their rule to ensure. So true is this, continues
                    the vicar-general, that Saint Antonine has recorded in his ecclesiastical
                    history (bk. xv. ch. 22, sec. 2), that a certain Carthusian having performed a
                    quantity of miracles at his tomb, became thereby, in consequence of the crowds
                    who were attracted thither, so great a nuisance that the prior was obliged to go
                    to the grave of the sainted deceased, and there command him on his obedience to
                    do no more miracles,—an order which the dead saint thenceforward scrupulously
                    obeyed.”</p>
                <p>Father Petrejo published, in 1609, a <hi rend="italic">lìiblioteca degli
                    Scrittori dell'</hi><hi rend="italic">Ordine,</hi> which has been subsequently
