                    Fifeshire, on the 17th March 1780. He was early destined to the church, and
                    while only eleven years old was enrolled as a student in the university of St
                    Andrews. Having completed his collegiate course, in which he devoted himself
                    almost exclusively to the study of mathematics, in January 1799 he was licensed
                    as a preacher of the gospel by the presbytery of St Andrews. Instead of entering
                    at once on the duties of his profession, he spent the two following winters in
                    Edinburgh, attending the lectures of Professors Stewart, Playfair, Robison, and
                    Hope. In May 1803 he was ordained as minister of Kilmany, a small parish in
                    Fifeshire, about nine miles from St Andrews. During the preceding winter he had
                    acted as assistaht to Mr Vilant, professor of mathematics in the university of
                    that city, who for many years had been laid aside by ill health. The novelty,
                    however, of his method, and the singular enthusiasm that he exhibited and
                    excited were distasteful to those attached to the old routine of university
                    education; and at the close of the session he was informed that his further
                    services would not be required. Indignant at the fancied injustice thus done
                    him, he adopted the singular expedient of opening mathematical classes of his
                    own during the succeeding winter, which, though discountenanced in every way by
                    the university authorities, many of the students were attracted to attend. The
                    winter of 1803-4 was a very busy and exciting one. During the week he taught
                    three classes in St Andrews, and prepared and delivered there a course of
                    lectures on chemistry, largely illustrated by experiments,—appearing at the same
                    time in the pulpit of Kilmany every Sunday. Having sufficiently redeemed his
                    reputation by the great success which attended them, his mathematical classes
                    were not resumed. The lectures on chemistry were frequently redelivered in his
                    own and in many adjoining parishes, to the surprise and delight of many rural
                    audiences. In 1805 the chair of mathematics in Edinburgh became vacant, and he
                    appeared, but unsuccessfully, as a candidate. In 1808 he published an <hi
                    rend="italic">Inquiry into the Extent and Stability of National Resources,</hi>
                    a treatise originated by the alarm which Bonaparte’s commercial policy had
                    created in Britain, and intended to elucidate some of those questions in
                    political economy which the existing state of affairs had raised. He was
                    preparing a new edition of this work when a series of domestic bereavements, and
                    a severe illness that brought him to the brink of the grave, and laid him aside
                    from all duty for upwards of a year, turned his thoughts and life into a new
                    channel. Dr Brewster had invited him to become a contributor to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> at his own
                    request the article Christianity had been assigned to him, and he was now
                    engaged in preparing it. In studying the credentials of Christianity, he
                    received a new impression of its contents. A sustained but abortive effort to
                    attain that pure and heavenly morality which the Gospel of Christ requires led
                    on to that great spiritual revolution the nature and progress of which his
                    journal and letters enable us to trace with such distinctness. When he resumed
                    his duties, an entire change in the character of his ministry was visible to
                    all. The report of discourses so earnest and eloquent as those now delivered,
                    and of household visitations conducted with such ardent zeal, soon spread beyond
                    the limits of his own neighbourhood. His reputation as an author received at the
                    same time a large accession by the publication in a separate form of his article
                    on Christianity, as well as by several valuable contributions to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi><hi rend="italic">Christian Instructor</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Eclectic Review.</hi> So strong, however, at that time was the
                    public bias against those evangelical doctrines which he had embraced, that when
                    a vacancy occurred in Glasgow, and his friends brought him forward as a
                    candidate, it was only after extraordinary efforts, and by a narrow majority,
                    that his election was carried in the town-council.</p>
                <p>In July 1815 he was formally admitted as minister of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n386/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0386-0375"/> the Tron church and parish. A blaze of
                    unparalleled popularity at once broke around him as a preacher. A series of
                    discourses which he had preached on the connection between the discoveries of
                    astronomy and the Christian revelation were published in January 1817. Never
                    either before or since has the same reception been given to any volume of
                    sermons in our language. Within a year, nine editions and 20,000 copies of the
                    volume were in circulation. Soon after its appearance he visited London, and
                    occupied for the first time one or two of the pulpits of the metropolis. The
                    crowds were enormous, the applause loud and universal. “All the world,” writes
                    Mr Wilberforce, “wild about Dr Chalmers.” His extraordinary popularity remained
                    undiminished during the eight years that he remained in Glasgow.</p>
                <p>. His preparation for the pulpit, however, formed but a small part of his
                    labours. In visiting his parish, which contained a population of about 11,000
                    souls, he speedily discovered that nearly a third of them had relinquished all
                    connection with any Christian church, and that their children were growing up in
                    ignorance and vice. The appalling magnitude of the evil, and the certainty of
                    its speedy and frightful growth, at once arrested and engrossed him. To devise
                    and execute the means of checking and subduing it became henceforth one of the
                    ruling passions of his life. Attributing the evil to the absence of those
                    parochial influences, educational and ministerial, which wrought so effectually
                    for good in the smaller rural parishes, but which had not been brought to bear
                    upon the overgrown parishes of our great cities, from all spiritual oversight of
                    which the members of the Establishment had retired in despair, his grand panacea
                    was to revivify, remodel, and extend the old parochial economy of Scotland.
                    Taking his own parish as a specimen, and gauging by it the spiritual necessities
                    of the city, he did not hesitate to publish it as his conviction that not less
                    than twenty new churches and parishes should immediately be erected in Glasgow.
                    All, however, that he could persuade the towncouncil to attempt was to erect a
                    single additional one, to which a parish containing no fewer than 10,000 souls
                    was attached. This church, built at his suggestion, was offered to him and
                    accepted, in order that he might have free and unimpeded room for carrying out
                    his different parochial plans.</p>
                <p>In September 1819 he was admitted as minister of the church and parish of St
                    John’s. The population of the parish was made up principally of weavers,
                    labourers, factory workers, and other operatives. Of its 2000 families, more
                    than 800 had no connection with any Christian church. The number of its
                    uneducated children was countless. In this, as in his former parish, Dr
                    Chalmers’s first care and efforts were bestowed upon the young. For their
                    week-day instruction, two commodious school-houses were built, four
                    well-qualified teachers were provided, each with an endowment of £25 per annum;
                    and at the moderate school-fees of 2s. and 3s. per quarter, 700 children had a
                    first-rate education supplied. For the poorer and more neglected, between forty
                    and fifty local sabbath schools were opened, in which more than 1000 children
                    were taught. The parish was divided into 25 districts, embracing from 60 to 100
                    families, over each of which an elder and a deacon were placed—the former taking
                    the oversight of their spiritual, the latter of their temporal interests. Over
                    the whole of this complicated parochial apparatus Dr Chalmers presided,
                    watching, impelling, controlling every movemsnt. Nor was his work that of mere
                    superintendence. He visited personally all the families, completing his round of
                    them in about two years, and holding evening meetings, in which he addressed
                    those whom he had visited during the week. Many families were thus reclaimed to
                    the habit of church-going, and many individuals deeply and enduringly impressed
                    by the sacred truths of Christianity.</p>
                <p>The chief reason why Dr Chalmers removed from the Tron parish to that of St
                    John’s was that he might have an opportunity of fairly testing the efficacy of
                    the old Scottish method of providing for the poor. At this period there were not
                    more than 20 parishes north of the Forth and Clyde in which there was a
                    compulsory assessment for the poor. The English method of assessment, however,
                    was rapidly spreading over the southern districts of Scotland, and already
                    threatened to cover the whole country. Dr Chalmers dreaded this as a great
                    national catastrophe. Having studied in its principles, as well as in its
                    results, the operation of a compulsory tax for the support of the poor, he was
                    convinced that it operated prejudicially and swelled the evil it meant to
                    mitigate. It was said, however, that though the old Scotch method of voluntary
                    contributions at the church door administered by the kirk-session was applicable
                    to small rural parishes, it was inapplicable to the large and already
                    half-pauperized parishes of our great cities. Dr Chalmers asked the magistrates
                    of Glasgow to commit the entire management of the poor of the parish of St
                    John’s into his own hands, and he undertook to refute that allegation. He was
                    allowed to try the experiment. At the commencement of his operations, the poor
                    of this parish cost the city £1400 per annum. He committed the investigation of
                    all new applications for relief to the deacon of the district, who had so small
                    a number of families in charge, that by spending an hour among them every week,
                    he became minutely acquainted with their character and condition. By careful
                    scrutiny of every case in which public relief was asked for, by a summary
                    rejection of the idle, the drunken, and the worthless, by stimulating every
                    effort that the poor could make to help themselves, and when necessary, aiding
                    them in their efforts, a great proportion of these new cases were provided for
                    without drawing upon the church-door collections; and such was the effect of the
                    whole system of Christian oversight and influence, prudently and vigorously
                    administered, that in four years the pauper expenditure was reduced from £1400
                    to £280 per annum.</p>
                <p>At the commencement of his ministry in St John’s, Dr Chalmers began a series of
                    quarterly publications on <hi rend="italic">The Christian and Civic Economy of
                    Large Towns,</hi> devoted to the theoretic illustration of the various schemes
                    of Christian usefulness which be was carrying on,—presenting himself thus to us
                    as at once their skilful deviser, their vigorous conductor, their eloquent
                    expounder and advocate. But the fatigues of so toilsome a ministry began to
                    exhaust his strength; and he was already longing to exchange the personal for
                    the literary labours of his profession, when the vacant chair of moral
                    philosophy in the university of St Andrews was offered to him. This offer, the
                    seventh of the same kind that had been made to him during his eight years’
                    residence in Glasgow, he accepted, entering on his new duties in November 1823,
                    and devoting the next four years of his life to their fulfilment. Hitherto
                    metaphysics and ethics had been taught conjunctly by the professors of moral
                    science in the Scotch colleges, while, in téaching the latter, allusions to the
                    peculiar doctrines of Christianity had generally and often carefully been
                    avoided. Looking upon mental philosophy as belonging properly to another chair,
                    Dr Chalmers confined his prelections to the philosophy of morals, entering at
                    large upon the duties man owes to God as well as those he owes to his
                    fellow-men, endeavouring throughout to demonstrate the insufficiency of natural
                    religion to serve any other purpose than that of a precursor of Christianity.
                    Many of his lectures, as remodelled afterwards and transferred to the
                    theological chair, are to be found now in the first and second volumes <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n387/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0387-0376"/> of his works. In the purely ethical department,
                    the discussions in which he made important and original contributions to the
                    science are those occupied with the place and functions of volition and
                    attention, the separate and underived character of the moral sentiments, and the
                    distinction between the virtues of perfect and imperfect obligation. It was not
                    so much, however, for their scientific speculations that his lectures in the
                    moral philosophy class-room were distinguished, as for that· fervour of
                    professional enthusiasm with which they were delivered, and which proved so
                    healthfully contagious. Beyond the intellectual impulse thus communicated, his
                    frequent references to the great doctrines of Christianity, and still more the
                    force of his inviting example, kindled to a very remarkable degree the religious
                    spirit among the students of St Andrews; and not a few of them—including many
                    men who have since highly distinguished themselves—were led thereby to
                    consecrate their lives to missionary labour.</p>
                <p>In November 1828, Dr Chalmers was transferred from the chair of moral philosophy
                    in St Andrews to that of theology in Edinburgh. In this wider theatre he was
                    enabled to realize all his favourite ideas as to the best methods of academical
                    instruction. To the old practice of reading to his students a set of carefully
                    prepared lectures he added that of regular <hi rend="italic">viυa voce</hi>
                    examination on what was thus delivered, and introduced besides the use of
                    textbooks, communicating through them a large amount of information; and coming
                    into the closest and most stimulating contact with his pupils, he attempted to
                    combine the different systems pursued in the English and the Scottish
                    universities. In the professorial chair there have been many who, with larger
                    stores of learning, have conducted their students to greater scientific
                    proficiency; but none have ever gone beyond him in the glowing impulse,
                    intellectual, moral, and religious, that he conveyed into the hearts of ths
                    ardent youths who flocked around his chair; and to that spirit with which he so
                    largely impregnated the young ministerial mind of Scotland, may, to a large
                    extent, be traced the Disruption of the Scottish Established Church.</p>
                <p>The leisure for literary labour which professorial life afforded was diligently
                    improved. At St Andrews he resumed the work which his departure from Glasgow had
                    suspended, and in 1826 published a third volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Christian and Civic Economy of Large Towns.</hi> This was followed in 1827 by
                    his treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Use and Abuse of Literary and
                    Ecclesiastical Endowments,</hi> the ablest defence of endowments in our
                    language, a work which itself would have won celebrity for its author. For many
                    years his chief ambition had been to complete a treatise on political economy, a
                    science which had been a favourite one from youth. In St Andrews, besides his
                    ordinary course on ethics, he had opened a class for instruction in this
                    science, and had been delighted to find how attractive it had proved. As soon as
                    he had got through his first course of theological lectures in Edinburgh, he
                    resumed this subject, and embodied the reflections and preparations of many
                    years in a work on <hi rend="italic">Political Economy,</hi> published in 1832.
                    Many of the particular doctrines of this work have not met with general
                    acceptance. The public mind, however, has been gradually coming round to a
                    belief in that great truth which this volume was mainly intended to
                    enforce,—that a right moral is essential to a right economic condition of the
                    masses,—that character is the parent of comfort. His work on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Political Economy</hi> was scarcely through the press, when, on invitation from
                    the trustees of the earl of Bridgewater, Dr Chalmers was engaged on a treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">On the Adaptation of External Nature to ths Moral and
                    Intellectual Constitution of Man,</hi> which appeared in 1833. Literary honours,
                    such as were never united previously in the person of any Scottish ecclesiastic,
                    crowned these labours. In 1834 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society of
                    Edinburgh, and was soon after made one of its vice-presidents. In the same year
                    he was elected corresponding member of the Royal Institute of France, and in
                    1835 the university of Oxford conferred on him the degree of D.C.L.</p>
                <p>Hitherto Dr Chalmers had taken but little part in the public business of the
                    church. He had given some effective help in the prosecution of two measures—the
                    one for the abolition of pluralities, and the other for the improvement of
                    theological education. The death of Dr Andrew Thomson, who had long been the
                    able leader of the Evangelical party, and the obtaining by that party of the
                    ascendency, called him to lead the counsels and doings of the church. One of the
                    earliest acts of the General Assembly of 1834, the first in which the
                    Evangelical party had the majority, was to place Dr Chalmers at the head of a
                    committee appointed to promote the extension of the church. In this office he
                    had a double duty to discharge— to solicit the Government to make a grant out of
                    the public revenue, and to stimulate the friends of the church by their own
                    voluntary efforts to meet the spiritual necessities of the country. In both
                    departments extraordinary efforts were made, but with very different results.
                    The Whig Government, insecure in its hold of power, and dependent to some extent
                    on the political assistance of the Scottish Dissenters, could be induced to do
                    nothing beyond appointing a committee of inquiry, which led to no practical
                    result. It was otherwise when Dr Chalmers appealed to the country. That appeal
                    was made with singular ardour and eloquence. When circulars, pamphlets, and
                    reports had done their uttermost, he made a tour through a large part of
                    Scotland, addressing the various presbyteries and holding public meetings in the
                    most populous districts. Year after year swelled the fund that these efforts
                    created, till at last in 1841, when he resigned his office as convener of the
                    Church Extension Committee, he had to announce that in seven years upwards of
                    £300,000 had been contributed to this object, and 220 new churches had been
                    built.</p>
                <p>This great movement on behalf of church extension was finally checked by another
                    in which Dr Chalmers was destined to play a still more conspicuous part. In
                    1834, the General Assembly, after declaring it to be a fundamental principle of
                    the church that “no minister shall be intruded into any parish contrary to the
                    will of the congregation,” had enacted that in every instance the dissent of the
                    majority of the male heads of families, being communicants, should be a bar to
                    the settlement of a minister. This Act, commonly called the Veto Law, was based
                    upon the old constitutional practice of the “call,” in which the people invited
                    the minister to undertake the pastoral office, on which invitation alone the
                    spiritual act of ordination was grounded. The church believed herself to possess
                    the power of determining what kind and amount of popular concurrence was
                    necessary before the pastoral tie was formed by ordination. She had often
                    exercised that power to the effect of setting aside the nominee of the patron.
                    When invited in such instances to interfere, the civil courts had refused, on
                    the ground that the church was acting within the limits of her acknowledged
                    authority. In other instances the civil courts had often reviewed decisions of
                    the church courts, but only with a view of regulating the title to the benefice.
                    But now the power of the church to pass such a law as that of the Veto was
                    challenged, and the civil courts claimed a right not only to regulate the
                    destination of the benefice, but to control and overrule the decisions of the
                    church. In the parish of Auchterarder, containing a population of 3000 souls,
                    only two individuals signed the call, while 287 out of 300 dissented; but in an
                    action raised at the instance of the presentee, the Court of Session decided
                    that his rejection by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n388/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0388-0377"/> the church was illegal. This decision the House
                    of Lords, on appeal to it, confirmed,—Lords Brougham and Cottenham, in
                    delivering judgment, stating it expressly to be their opinion that in settling a
                    minister the church had no legal right to look beyond his qualification as to
                    “life, literature, and morals.” In this decision, as involving a forfeiture of
                    the benefice, the church acquiesced, declaring at the same time her intention,
                    for her own spiritual objects, to interpret for herself the statutes which
                    established her, and announcing her unaltered purpose to protect her
                    congregations from the intrusion of unacceptable ministers. It speedily appeared
                    that she was not to be permitted to carry out these resolutions if the Court of
                    Session could pτ2vent. The presbytery of Dunkeld rejected a licentiate presented
                    by the Crown to the parish of Lethendy on the ground of his having been vetoed
                    by the people. The Crown acquiesced and issued a new presentation. At the
                    instance of the first presentee the Court of Session interdicted the presbytery
                    from ordaining the second. The church ordered the presbytery to proceed with the
                    ordination. It did so, and was summoned in consequence to the bar of the civil
                    court, solemnly rebuked, and informed that in the next instance of such
                    disregard by the church of the interdict of the civil court imprisonment would
                    be the punishment. In the parish of Marnoch, with a population of 2800 souls,
                    only one individual signed the call; an overwhelming majority dissented; but in
                    defiance of the law of the church, and in obedience to the Court of Session, the
                    presbytery of Strathbogie, by a majority of 7 to 3, resolved to proceed to the
                    ordination. To prevent this ordination the church suspended the seven ministers
                    who formed the majority. The Court of Session not only annulled that suspension
                    and prohibited the church from intimating or executing it, but interdicted all
                    ministers from preaching or administering any of the sacraments within any of
                    the parishes of the seven suspended clergymen. The church held such interference
                    as a violation of her spiritual independence, and proceeded as if no such
                    sentence of the civil court had been passed,—many of the most distinguished
                    ministers, Dr Chalmers and Dr Gordon among the rest, preaching in those parishes
                    in the face of interdicts served on them personally. The seven suspended
                    clergymen treated in the same way the supreme ecclesiastical authority, and on
                    the 21st January 1841, in opposition to an express order of the General
                    Assembly, consummated the ordination. By the following General Assembly these
                    clergymen were deposed from the office of the ministry. The Court of Session
                    immediately thereafter pronounced the deposition null and void. Other like
                    instances occurred. The collisions between the two supreme courts became
                    frequent and most unseemly. Matters were running into inextricable confusion.
                    The church appealed to the Government to interfere. At first the Whigs were in
                    power, but they declined to interfere. In 1841, Sir Robert Peel was placed at
                    the head of a Government strong enough to have applied the remedy, and the hopes
                    of the church were excited. Still no measure was introduced. Under the guidance
                    of Dr Chalmers the church pursued her course with steady unfaltering step; but
                    she was not prepared to prolong the controversy indefinitely. Denying the right
                    of the Court of Session to act as it had done, she freely conceded to the
                    legislature the right of determining on what terms she held her temporalities;
                    and if, fairly appealed to, the legislature declared that she held them on
                    condition of rendering such obedience to the civil courts as they now required,
                    she felt that she had no alternative but either to renounce her own principles
                    or relinquish the temporalities. At a solemn convocation held in November 1842 a
                    large number of ministers signed and published a declaration that if no measure
                    of relief were granted they would resign their livings. Up to the last, however,
                    it was not believed that any very extensive secession would take place. In
                    January 1843, the Government not only refused to grant the protection the church
                    required, but put a final and peremptory negative on her claims of spiritual
                    independence. And in March the House of Commons did the same by a large
                    majority,— the Scotch members, however, voting in the proportion of more than
                    two to one in her favour. The controversy was now closed, and it remained only
                    for those clergymen who felt that they could not with a good conscience submit
                    to the civil restraint imposed upon the church to adopt the only expedient now
                    left to them and retire from the Establishment. On the 18th May 1843, 470
                    clergymen withdrew from the General Assembly and constituted themselves into the
                    Free Church of Scotland, electing Dr Chalmers as their first moderator.</p>
                <p>For two years previous to this final step, Dr Chalmers had foreseen the issue,
                    and in preparation for it had drawn up a scheme for the support of the outgoing
                    ministers. For a year or two afterwards the establishment and extension of that
                    fund, to which the Free Church owes so much of her stability, engaged a large
                    share of his attention. He then gradually withdrew from the public service of
                    the church, occupying himself with his duties as principal of the Free Church
                    College, and in perfecting his <hi rend="italic">Institutes of Theology.</hi> In
                    May 1847, he was summoned before a committee of the House of Commons to give
                    evidence regarding that refusal of sites for churches in which a few of the
                    landed proprietors of Scotland who were hostile to the Free Church were still
                    persisting. He returned from London in his usual health, and after a peaceful
                    Sabbath (May 30) in the bosom of his family at Morningside, he bade them all
                    good night Next morning, when his room was entered and the curtains of his bed
                    withdrawn, he was found half erect, his head leaning gently back upon the
                    pillow, no token of pain or struggle, the brow and hand when touched so cold as
                    to indicate that some hours had already elapsed since the spirit had peacefully
                    departed.</p>
                <p>During a life of the most varied and incessant activity, spent much too in
                    society, Dr Chalmers scarcely ever allowed a day to pass without its modicum of
                    composition. He had his faculty of writing so completely at command that at the
                    most unseasonable times, and in the most unlikely places, he snatched his hour
                    or two for carrying on his literary work. He was methodical indeed in all his
                    habits, and no saying passed more frequently from his lips than that punctuality
                    is a cardinal virtue. His writings now occupy more than 30 volumes. He would
                    permanently perhaps have stood higher as an author had he written less, or had
                    he indulged less in that practice of reiteration into which he was so constantly
                    betrayed by his anxiety to impress his ideas upon others. It would be premature
                    to attempt to estimate the place which his writings will hold in the literature
                    of our country. We may briefly indicate, however, some of the original
                    contributions for which we are indebted to him. As a political economist he was
                    the first to unfold the connection that subsists between the degree of the
                    fertility of the soil and the social condition of a community, the rapid manner
                    in which capital is reproduced (see Mill’s <hi rend="italic">Political
                    Economy,</hi> vol. i. p. 94), and the general doctrine of a limit to all the
                    modes by which national wealth may accumulate. He was the finit also to advance
                    that argument in favour of religious establishments which meets upon its own
                    ground the doctrine of Adam Smith, that religion like other things should be
                    left to the operation of the natural law of supply and demand. In the department
                    of natural theology and the Christian evidences, he ably advocated that method
                    of reconciling the Mosaic narrative with the indefinite antiquity of the globe
                    which Dr Buckland has advanced in his Bridgewater Treatise, and which Dr
                    Chalmers had previously communicated to that author. His refutation of Hume’s
                    objection to the truth of miracles is perhaps his intellectual <hi rend="italic"
                    >chef S'oeuvre,</hi> and is as original as it is complete. The distinction
                    between the laws and dispositions of matter, as between the ethics and objects
                    of theology, he was the first to indicate and enforce. And it is in his pages
                    that the fullest and most masterly exhibition is to be met with of the superior
                    authority as witnesses for the truth of Revelation of the Scriptural as compared
                    with the ex-Seriptural writers, and of the Christian as compared with the
                    heathen testimonies. In his <hi rend="italic">Institutes of Theology,</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n389/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0389-0378"/> no material modification is either made or
                    attempted on the doctrines of Calvinism, which he received with all simplicity
                    of faith, as he believed them to be revealed in the Divine word, and which he
                    defended as in harmony with the most profound philosophy of human nature and of
                    the Divine providence.</p>
                <p>The character of Dr Chalmers’s intellect was eminently practical. The dearest
                    object of his earthly existence was the elevation of the common people.
                    Poor-laws appeared to him as calculated to retard this elevation; he therefore
                    strenuously resisted their introduction. The Church of Scotland appeared to him
                    as peculiarly fitted to advance it; he spoke, he wrote, he laboured in its
                    defence and extension. “I have no veneration,” he said to the royal
                    commissioners in St Andrews, before either the Voluntary or the Non-intrusion
                    controversies had arisen, ‘ ‘ I have no veneration for the Church of Scotland
                    <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> an establishment, but I have the utmost veneration
                    for it <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> an instrument of Christian good.” Forcing
                    that church to intrude unacceptable ministers, and placing her in spiritual
                    subjection to the civil power, in his regard stripped her as such an instrument
                    of her strength, and he resolutely but reluctantly gave her up.</p>
                <p>It is as a mover of his fellow men, as the reviver of evangelistic feeling in
                    Scotland, and as a leader in the great movement which terminated in the erection
                    of the Free Church, that Dr Chalmers will fill the largest place in the eye of
                    posterity, and occupy a niche in the history of Scotland and of the church.
                    Various elements combined to clothe him with public influence—a childlike,
                    guileless, transparent simplicity, the utter absence of everything factitious in
                    matter or manner—a kindliness of nature that made him flexible to every human
                    sympathy—a chivalry of sentiment that raised him above all the petty jealousies
                    of public life—a firmness of purpose that made vacillation almost a thing
                    impossible, a force of will and general momentum that bore all that was movable
                    before it—a vehement utterance and overwhelming eloquence that gave him the
                    command of the multitude, a scientific reputation that won for him the respect
                    and attention of the more educated— the legislative faculty that framed measures
                    upon the broadest principles, the practical sagacity that adapted them to the
                    ends they were intended to realize—the genius that in new and difficult
                    circumstances could devise, coupled with the love of calculation, the capacity
                    for business details, and the administrative talent that fitted him to execute—a
                    purity of motive that put him above all suspicion of selfishness, and a piety
                    unobtrusive but most profound, simple yet intensely ardent. (W. HA.)</p>
