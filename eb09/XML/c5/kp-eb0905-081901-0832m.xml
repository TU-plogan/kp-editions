                    points on which his works now extant inform us are his date and his instructors.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Stromata,</hi> while attempting to show that the Jewish
                    Scriptures were older than any writings of the Greeks, he invariably brings down
                    his dates to the death of Commodus, a circumstance which at once suggests that
                    he wrote in the reign of the Emperor Severus, from 193 to 211 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> (see <hi rend="italic">Strom.,</hi> lib. i. cap. xxi.
                    140,p. 403, Potter’s edition). The passage in regard to his teachers is corrupt,
                    and the sense is therefore doubtful <hi rend="italic">(Strom.,</hi> lib. i. cap.
                    i. 11, p. 322, P.)</p>
                <p>“This treatise,” he says, speaking of the <hi rend="italic">Stromata,</hi> “has
                    not been contrived for mere display, but memoranda are treasured up in it for my
                    old age to be a remedy for forgetfulness,—an image, truly, and an outline of
                    those clear and living discourses, and those men truly blessed and noteworthy I
                    was privileged to hear. One of these was in Greece, the Ionian, the other was in
                    Magna Graecia; the one of them was from Coele Syria, the other from Egypt; but
                    there were others in the East, one of whom belonged to the Assyrians, but the
                    other was in Palestine, originally a Jew. The last of those whom I met was first
                    in power. On falling in with him I found rest, having tracked him while he lay
                    concealed in Egypt. He was in truth the Sicilian bee, and, plucking the flowers
                    of the prophetic and apostolic meadow, he produced a wonderfully pure knowledge
                    in the souls of the listeners.”</p>
                <p>Some have supposed that in this passage seven teachers are named, others that
                    there are only five, and various conjectures have been hazarded as to what
                    persons were meant. The only one about whom conjecture has any basis for
                    speculating is the last, for Eusebius states <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Ecd.,</hi>
                    v. 11 ) that Clement made mention of Pantaenus as his teacher in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hypotyposes.</hi> The reference in this passage is plainly to one
                    whom he might well designate as his teacher.</p>
                <p>To the information which Clement here supplies subsequent writers add little. By
                    Eusebius and Photius he is called Titus Flavius Clemens, and “the Alexandrian”
                    is added to his name. Epiphanius tells us that some said Clement was an
                    Alexandrian, others that he was an Athenian <hi rend="italic">(Hoer.,</hi>
                    xxxii. 6), and a modern writer imagined that he reconciled this discordance by
                    the supposition that he was born at Athens, but brought up at Alexandria. We
                    know nothing of his conversion except that he passed from heathenism to
                    Christianity. This is expressly stated by Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(Prcep.
                    Evangel.,</hi> lib. ii. cap. 2), though it is likely that Eusebius had no other
                    authority than the works of Clement. These works, however, warrant the
                    inference. They show a singularly minute acquaintance with the ceremonies of
                    pagan religion, and there are indications that Clement himself had been
                    initiated in some of the mysteries <hi rend="italic">(Protrept.,</hi> cap. ii.
                    sec. 14, p. 13, P.). There is no means of determining the date of his
                    conversion. He attained the position of presbyter in the church of Alexandria
                    (Eus., <hi rend="italic">Hist, Eccl.,</hi> vi. 11, and Jerome, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Vir.</hi><hi rend="italic">III.,</hi> 38), and became the successor of
                    Pantaenus in the catechetical school of that place. Among his pupils were Origen
                    (Eus., <hi rend="italic">Hist. Eccl.,</hi> vi. 7) and Alexander, bishop of
                    Jerusalem (Eus., <hi rend="italic">Hist. Eccl.,</hi> vi. 14). How long he
                    continued in Alexandria, and when and where he died, are all matters of pure
                    conjecture. The only further notice of Clement that we have in history is in a
                    letter written in 211 by Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem, to the Antiochians, and
                    preserved by Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Eccl.,</hi> vi. 11). The words
                    are as follows.:—“This letter I sent through Clement the blessed presbyter, a
                    man virtuous and tried, whom ye know and will come to know completely, who being
                    here by the providence and guidance of the Ruler of all strengthened and
                    increased the church of the Lord.” A statement of Eusebius in regard to the
                    persecution of Severus in 202 <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Eccl.,</hi> vi. 3) would
                    render it likely that Clement left Alexandria on that occasion. It is
                    conjectured that he went to his old pupil Alexander, who was at that time bishop
                    of Flaviada in Cappadocia, and that when his pupil was raised to the see of
                    Jerusalem Clement followed him there. The letter implies that he was known to
                    the Antiochians, and that it was likely he would be still better known. Some
                    have conjectured that he returned to Alexandria, but there is not the shadow of
                    evidence for such conjecture.</p>
                <p>Eusebius and Jerome give us lists of the works which Clement left behind him.
                    Photius has also described some of them. They are as follows:—1. <hi

                    dedicated to Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>Of these, the first four have come down to us complete, or nearly complete. The
                    first three form a series. The <hi rend="italic">Hortatory Address</hi> to the
                    Greeks is an appeal to them to give up the worship of their gods, and to devote
                    themselves to the worship of the one living and true God. Clement exhibits the
                    absurdity and immorality ot the stories told with regard to the pagan deities,
                    the cruelties perpetrated in their worship, and the utter uselessness of bowing
                    down before images made by hands. He at the same time shows the Greeks that
                    their own greatest philosophers and poets recognized the unity of the divine
                    Being, and had caught glimpses of the true nature of God, but that fuller light
                    had been thrown on this subject by the Hebrew prophets. He replies to the
                    objection that it was not right to abandon the customs of their forefathers, and
                    points them to Christ as their only safe guide to God.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Paedagogus</hi> is divided into three books. In the first
                    Clement discusses the necessity for and the true nature of the Paedagogus, and
                    shows how Christ as the Logos acted as Paedagogus, and still acts. In the second
                    and third books Clement enters into particulars, and explains how the Christian
                    following the Logos or Reason ought to behave in the various circumstances of
                    life—in eating, drinking, furnishing a house, in dress, in the relations of
                    social life, in the care of the body, and similar concerns, and concludes with a
                    general description of the life of a Christian. Appended to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Foedagogue</hi> are two hymns, which are, in all probability, the
                    production of Clement, though some have conjectured that they were portions of
                    the church service of that time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stromata,</hi> or rather <hi rend="italic">'S,τρωμa.τeιs,</hi>
                    are coverlets made out of miscellaneous pieces of cloth. The title is used by
                    Clement to designate a miscellaneous collection of materials, and Clement’s work
                    is unquestionably of this nature. It is impossible to give a brief account of
                    its varied contents. Sometimes he discusses chronology, sometimes philosophy,
                    sometimes poetry, entering into the most minute critical and chronological
                    details; but one object runs through all, and this is to show what the true
                    Christian Gnostic is, and what is his relation to philosophy. The work was in
                    eight books. The first seven are complete. The eighth now extant is really an
                    incomplete treatise on logic. Some critics have rejected this book as spurious,
                    since its matter is so different fτom that of the rest. Others, however, have
                    held to its genuineness, because in a Patch-work or Book of Miscellanies the
                    difference of subject is no sound objection, and because Photius 'seems to have
                    regarded our present eighth book as genuine (Phot., cod. Ill, p. 89b,
                    Bekker).</p>
                <p>The treatise <hi rend="italic">Who is the Rich Man that is Saved ĭ</hi> is an
                    admirable exposition of the narrative contained in St Mark’s Gospel, x. 17-31.
                    It was in all probability preached.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hypotyposes</hi> have not come down to us. Cassiodorus
                    translated them into Latin, freely altering to suit his own ideas of orthodoxy.
                    Both Eusebius and Photius describe the work. It was a short commentary on all
                    the books of Scripture, including some of the apocryphal works, such as the
                    Epistle of Barnabas and the Revelation of Peter. Photius speaks in strong
                    language of the impiety of some opinions in the book <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Bibl.,</hi> cod. 109, p. 89a, Bekker), but his statements are such as to prove
                    conclusively that he must have had a corrupt copy, or read very carelessly, or
                    grossly misunderstood Clement. Notes in Latin on the first epistle of Peter, the
                    epistle of Jude, and the first two of John have come down to us; but whether
                    they are the translation of Cassiodorus, or indeed a translation of Clement’s
                    work at all, is a matter of dispute.</p>
                <p>The treatise on the Passover was occasioned by a work of Melito on the same
                    subject, Two fragments of this treatise were given by Petavius, and are
                    contained in the modern editions.</p>
                <p>We know nothing of the work called <hi rend="italic">The Ecclesiastical
                    Canon</hi> from any external testimony. Clement himself often mentions the <hi
                    rend="italic">btκλησιaστικi&gt;s κavωv,</hi> and defines it as the agreement and
                    harmony of the law and the prophets with the covenant delivered at the
                    appearance of Christ <hi rend="italic">(Strom., A.</hi> cap. xv. 125, p. 803,
                    P.). No doubt this was the subject of the treatise. Jerome and Photius call the
                    work <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Canons,</hi> but this seems to be a
                    mistake.</p>
                <p>Of the other treatises mentioned by Eusebius and Jerome nothing is known. A
                    fragment of Clement, quoted by Antonius Melissa, is most probably taken from the
                    treatise on slander.</p>
                <p>Besides the treatises mentioned by Eusebius, fragments of treatises on Providence
                    and the Soul have been preserved. Mention is also made of a work by Clement on
                    the Prophet Amos, and another on Definitions.</p>
                <p>In addition to these Clement often speaks of his intention to write on certain
                    subjects, but it may well be doubted whether in most cases, if not all, he
                    intended to devote separate treatises to them. Some have found an allusion to
                    the treatise on the Soul already mentioned. The other subjects are Marriage
                    (γαμικδy λoγos), Continence, the Duties of Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and
                    Widows, Prophecy, the Soul, the Transmigration of the Soul and the Devil,
                    Angels, the Origin of the World, First Principles and the Divinity of the Logos,
                    Allegorical Interpretation of Statements made with regard to God’s anger and
                    similar affections, the Unity of the Church, and the Resurrection.</p>
                <p>Two works are incorporated in the editions of Clement which are not mentioned by
                    himself or any ancient writer. They are ∈κ <hi rend="italic">rw Θeoδiτoυ κai τηs

                    Clement, must be a book merely of excerpts, for it contains many opinions which
                    Clement opposed. Mention is made of Pantaenus in the second, and some have
                    thought it more worthy of him than the first. Others have regarded it as a work
                    similar to the first, and derived from Theodorus.</p>
                <p>Clement occupies a profoundly interesting position in the history of
                    Christianity. He is the first to bring all the culture of the Greeks and all the
                    speculations of the Christian heretics to bear on the exposition of Christian
                    truth. He does not attain to a systematic exhibition of Christian doctrine, but
                    he paves the way for it, and lays the first stones of the foundation. In some
                    respects Justin anticipated him. He also was well acquainted with Greek
                    philosophy, and took a genial view of it; but he was not nearly so widely read
                    as Clement. The list of Greek authors whom Clement has quoted occupies upwards
                    of fourteen of the quarto pages in Fabricius’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                    Groeca.</hi> He is at home alike in the epic and the lyric, the tragic and the
                    comic poets, and his knowledge of the prose writers is very extensive. He made a
                    special study of the philosophers. Equally minute is his knowledge of the
                    systems of the Christian heretics. And in all cases it is plain that he not
                    merely read but thought deeply on the questions which the civilization of the
                    Greeks and the various writings of poets, philosophers, and heretics raised. He
                    pondered on all he read that he might gain a clearer insight into the truth. But
                    it was in the Scriptures that he found his greatest delight. He believed them to
                    contain the revelation of God’s wisdom to men. He quotes all the books of the
                    Old Testament except Ruth and the Song of Solomon, and amongst the sacred
                    writings of the Old Testament he evidently included the Book of Tobias, the
                    Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus. He is equally full in his quotations from
                    the New Testament, for he quotes from all the books except the epistle to
                    Philemon, the second epistle of St Peter, and the epistle of St James, and he
                    quotes from the pastor of Hermas, and the epistles of Clemens Romanus and of
                    Barnabas, as inspired. He appeals also to many of the lost Gospels, such as
                    those of the Hebrews, of the Egyptians, and of Matthias.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this adequate knowledge of Scripture, the modern theologian is
                    disappointed to find very little of what he deems characteristically Christian.
                    In fact Clement regarded Christianity as a philosophy. The ancient philosophers
                    sought through their philosophy to attain to a nobler and holier life, and this
                    also was the aim of Christianity. The difference between the two, in Clement’s
                    judgment, was that the Greek philosophers had only glimpses of the truth, that
                    they attained only to fragments of the truth, while Christianity revealed in
                    Christ the absolute and perfect truth. All the stages of the world’s history
                    were therefore preparations leading up to this full revelation, and God’s care
                    was not confined to the Hebrews alone. The worship of the heavenly bodies, for
                    instance, was given to man at an early stage that he might rise from a
                    contemplation of these sublime objects to the worship of the Creator. Greek
                    philosophy in particular was the preparation of the Greeks for Christ. It was
                    the schoolmaster or paedagogue to lead them to Christ. Plato was Moses
                    atticizing. Clement varies in his statement how Plato got his wisdom or his
                    fragments of the Reason. Sometimes he thinks that they came direct from God,
                    like all good things, but he is also fond of maintaining that many of Plato’s
                    best thoughts were borrowed from the Hebrew prophets; and he makes the same
                    statement in regard to the wisdom of the other philosophers. But however this
                    may be, Christ was the end to which all that was true in philosophies pointed.
                    Christ himself was the Logos, the Reason. God the Father was ineffable. The Son
                    alone can manifest Him fully. He is the Reason that pervades the universe, that
                    brings out all goodness, that guides all good men. It was through possessing
                    somewhat of this Reason that the philosophers attained to any truth and
                    goodness; but in Christians He dwells more fully and guides them through all the
                    perplexities of life. It is easy to see that this doctrine in regard to Christ
                    may be misconstrued. If Jesus were the Reason, thus visible in all goodness, how
                    could there be a real difference between Him and the Father, or how could He
                    really become incarnate! Photius, probably on a careless reading of Clement,
                    argued that he could not have believed in areal incarnation. But the words of
                    Clement are quite precise and their meaning indisputable. He believed in a
                    personal God different from the universe. He believed in a personal Son of God
                    who was the Reason and Wisdom of God; and he believed that this Son of God
                    really became incarnate. The object of His incarnation and death was to free man
                    from his sins, to lead him into the path of wisdom, and thus in the end elevate
                    him to the position of a god. But man’s salvation was to be gradual. It began
                    with faith, passed from that to love, and ended in full and complete knowledge.
                    There could be no faith without knowledge. But the knowledge is imperfect, and
                    the Christian was to do many things in simple obedience without knowing the
                    reason. But he has to move upwards continually until he at length does nothing
                    that is evil, aud he knows fully the reason and object of what he does. He thus
                    becomes the true Gnostic, but he can become the true Gnostic only by
                    contemplation and by the practice of what is right. He has to free himself from
                    the power of passion. He has to give up all thoughts of pleasure. He must prefer
                    goodness in the midst of torture to evil with unlimited pleasure. He has to
                    resist the temptations of the body, keeping it under strict control, and with

                    supreme good, and live a hfe according to reason. In other words, he must strive
                    after likeness to God as He reveals himself in his Reason or in Christ. Clement
                    thus looks entirely at the enlightened moral elevation to which Christianity
                    raises man. He believed that Christ instructed men before He came into the
                    world, and he therefore viewed heathenism with kindly eye. He was also
                    favourable to the pursuit of all kinds of knowledge. All enlightenment tended to
                    lead up to the truths of Christianity, and hence knowledge of every kind not
                    evil was its handmaid. Clement had at the same time a strong belief in evolution
                    or development. The world went through various stages in preparation for
                    Christianity. The man goes through various stages before he can reach Christian
                    perfection. And Clement conceived that this development took place not merely in
                    this life, but in the future through successive grades. The Jew and the heathen
                    had the gospel preached to them in the world below by Christ and His apostles,
                    and Christians will have to pass through processes of purification and trial
                    after death before they reach perfect knowledge and perfect bliss.</p>
                <p>The beliefs of Clement have caused considerable difference of opinion among
                    modern scholars. He sought the truth from whatever quarter he could get it,
                    believing that all that is good comes from God, wherever it be found. He
                    belongs, therefore, to no school of philosophers. Some have insisted that he was
                    an eclectic. Daehne has tried to show that he was Neo-Platonic, and Reinkens has
                    maintained that he was essentially Aristotelian. His mode of viewing
                    Christianity does not fit into any classification. It is the result of the
                    period in which he lived, of his wide culture and the simplicity and noble
                    purity of his character.</p>
                <p>It is needless to say that his books well deserve study; but the study is not
                    smoothed by beauty of style. Clement despised ornament. He wished to avoid
                    everything that might seem to deceive. He thought also that it was quite
                    possible to throw pearls before swine, and that care should be taken to prevent
                    this by digressions and difficulties which only the earnest student would
                    encounter. He is singularly simple in his character. In discussing marriage he
                    refuses to use any but the plainest language. A euphemism is with him a
                    falsehood. But he is temperate in his opinions; and the practical advices in the
                    second and third books of the <hi rend="italic">Poedagogue</hi> are remarkably
                    sound and moderate. He is not always very critical, and he is passionately fond
                    of allegorical interpretation ∙ but these were the faults of his age.</p>
                <p>All early writers speak of Clement in the highest terms of laudation, and he
                    certainly ought to have been a saint in any Church that reveres saints. But
                    Clement is not a saint in the Roman Church. He was a saint up till the time of
                    Benedict XIV., who read Photius on Clement, believed him, and struck the
                    Alexandrian’s name out of the calendar. The Pope was unquestionably wrong; and
                    many Roman Catholic writers, though they yield a practical obedience, have
                    adduced good reason why the decision of the Pope should be reversed (Cognat, p.
                    451).</p>

                <p>The writings that discuss Clement are very numerous. Notice is taken of him by
                    ecclesiastical historians, and by the historians of Christian literature, among
                    whom Lumper, Permaneder, and Konto-gones deserve special mention. There are
                    monographs on Clement and his doctrine by J. and F. Tribbechovius, Bielcke,
