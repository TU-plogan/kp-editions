                    in 1729; by the dethronement of her husband Peter III., and the exclusion of her
                    son, she ascended the Russian throne in 1762, and occupied it till her death in
                    1796. Her father, who was prince of Anhalt-Zerbst in Upper Saxony, served in the

                    manners then prevalent at the Russian court, Frederick shrunk from the proposal
                    and suggested the princess of Anhalt-Zerbst. Proposals being made in that
                    quarter and thankfully accepted, the princess, whose original name was Sophia
                    Augusta, was conducted to Russia by her mother in 1744; after soma preliminary
                    religious instruction she received the name of Catherine, and was admitted into
                    the Greek Church, and was at length in 1745 with due splendour married to Peter,
                    who was only a year older than herself. The marriage proved an unhappy and
                    ill-assorted one. While Catherine grew up to be a handsome, strong-minded, and
                    ambitious lady, Peter passed his life apparently on the very borders of idiocy.
                    Though not destitute of generous and even noble impulses, he was silly, wayward,
                    and extravagant. Excluded from all serious employment, and indeed incapable of
                    it, he spent his time in drilling a troop of dogs that he kept in a kennel
                    adjoining his wife’s sleeping apartments, executed martial law on the rats he
                    used to train to the same military functions, and felt very angry when Catherine
                    ventured to laugh at the extravagance of his proceedings. From early boyhood he
                    had been habituated to strong drink, and, as he grew up, he was intoxicated
                    every day. He insisted, too, on making his own wife his confidante in the
                    ceaseless love intrigues he carried on with the ladies of the court. Such was
                    the husband to whom the poor gid of fifteen was married, and the man who was to
                    have uncontrolled povzer over a vast empire. For a long time Catherine did her
                    best to induce him to act in a reasonable way, but with little success. His wild
                    and drunken habits continued, and, from mere caprice as much as anything else,
                    he became more and more alienated from her.</p>
                <p>Though Catherine was thus severely tried during those early years of her married
                    life, the natural firmness of her character bore her through, and her great
                    acuteness and adroitness soon enabled her to gain firm footing in the court. She
                    set herself resolutely to learn the Russian language, and soon acquired a
                    perfect mastery of it. She made herself thoroughly acquainted with the history,
                    manners, and institutions of the country, and identified herself completely with
                    the people around her, so that she became a thorough Russian in character and
                    sympathies, and, when occasion required, knew how to move the Russian heart. The
                    best foreign culture of her time, too, she made thoroughly her own, being an
                    assiduous reader of French literature during the long inactive hours of her
                    youth. Voltaire and the other <hi rend="italic">philosophes</hi> of the 18th
                    century were her favourite authors; she professed to be a disciple of the new
                    humanity they preached, expressed the highest reverence for them, and
                    corresponded with somo of them in after-life.</p>
                <p>In this way, while her husband wasted his life in every kind of grotesque
                    extravagance, Catherine was engaged in cultivating her mind, and in learning to
                    understand her strange surroundings. Indeed the Russian court of that era was
                    nearly as extraordinary as her husband. Since the death of Peter the Great
                    (1725) the crown had been again and again a plaything in the hands of intriguing
                    courtiers, mostly of German origin. To accomplish a revolution, to pull down one
                    ruler and set up another, and despatch the leaders of an opposing faction to
                    Siberia, it was necessary only to gain over a few of the guards. In such a way
                    had Elizabeth, youngest daughter of Peter the Great, won the crown in 1741. She
                    had some natural capacity for command, but lived in the utmost licence, in which
                    she was only too perfectly imitated by the court. Placed in such a position as
                    this, Catherine had a difficult part to play, and required for it all the
                    deftness and insight of her nature. But she succeeded. She gradually acquired a
                    considerable influence over the mind of Elizabeth, who admired her cleverness
                    and beauty. The courtiers of both sexes learned to respect her. Even Peter came
                    to recognize the superiority of her understanding, and though he never liked
                    her, used to ask her advice in his many perplexities. But she did not escape the
                    contagion of the court. In accordance with the prevailing custom, she became
                    involved in one love intrigue after another. Consequently, when children were at
                    length born of her (Paul, the eldest, in 1753), their paternity was matter of
                    serious doubt,</p>
                <p>In this way she lived till the beginning of 1762, when the death of Elizabeth
                    opened the way to a very different career. The poor, half-imbecile Peter was
                    novz called on to leave his silly employments, and undertake the government of
                    the most extensive empire in the world. All the schemes he embarked in were
                    marked by a wild generosity and sense of justice; but, unhappily, in almost
                    every one he managed to give deadly offence to the susceptible national spirit
                    of Russia. Being a devoted admirer of the great Frederick, he gave back with
                    impetuous haste all the advantages won in the Seven Years’ War, sent home all
                    the Prussian prisoners, restored the provinces torn from Prussia, and concluded
                    peace and then an offensive and defensive alliance with his hero. Himself a
                    Lutheran in his early years, he made little account of the religious etiquette
                    of the Russian court, and still further alarmed the clergy by threatening to lay
                    hands on the property of the church, while he grievously offended the soldiery
                    by introducing the Prussian uniform and the severe Prussian drill. The ambition
                    of Catherine would probably have been satisfied with the prospect of governing
                    Russia through her husband, but he was too wayward a person to be an obedient
                    instrument; and he soon publicly insulted her beyond forgiveness by compelling
                    her to decorate his mistress, the Countess Woronzoff, with the order of St
                    Catherine. This and other matters, and the growing alienation of a long and
                    distasteful married life, brought on a crisis. It became clear that they could
                    not live together; and Catherine began to adopt precautionary measures in
                    self-defence. She had little difficulty in doing so most effectively. The
                    Orloffs, influential persons in the Russian guards, were devoted to her; the
                    eldest, Gregory, was her lover. Those men, with the help of the Princess
                    Dashkoff, Count Panin (the tutor of her son Paul), and others, planned the
                    overthrow of Peter. Early on the morning of the 9th July (1762), Catherine was
                    awakened at the palace of Peterhof by Alexis Orloff with the injunction to act
                    immediately; they had been betrayed. Accordingly, she set out for the capital,
                    and finding Gregory Orloff on the spot, appealed to the guards, who were easily
                    induced to raise the standard of revolt. In the church, the priests anointed her
                    regent in the name of her son, while, outside, the Orloffs had her proclaimed
                    empress in her own right. After that, going in procession through the streets
                    she was joyously saluted empress of <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0245-0234"/> Russia. In the meantime, Peter, all unaware
                    of what was göing on, was busy drilling his favourite German guards at
                    Oranienbaum. On proceeding to Peterhof he found that Catherine had vanished, and
                    suspected the truth. He was urged to fight, but all his fortitude forsook him.
                    Next day he abdicated, expecting freedom to retire to Holstein; but he was
                    compelled to proceed to Ropscha, where on the 17th, the Orloffs, after an
                    unsuccessful attempt to poison him, strangled him with their own hands in the
                    most revolting manner. Of this part of the proceedings Catherine seems to have
                    had no knowledge. Thus easily, and apparently to the satisfaction of those
                    concerned, was a revolution effected, by which a beautiful and ambitious woman,
                    a foreigner, ascended the Russian throne, to the exclusion of the rightful
                    occupants. For some time, however, Catherine did not feel quite secure, and had
                    to trust to the influence of her admirers in suppressing discontent. The
                    soldiery at Moscow were disposed to resent the liberties taken by their compeers
                    in the disposal of the crown, and even among the guards at St Petersburg
                    doubtful symptoms appeared. But, eventually, they were all bribed or threatened
                    into acquiescence. Á conspiracy formed to place on the throne Ivan (a descendant
                    of a brother of Peter the Great), who had already been emperor a few months in
                    1740, also proved abortive, and cost that unfortunate prince his life. Ten years
                    later (1773), a Cossack, Pugatcheff, who gave himself out for the dethroned
                    Peter, raised an insurrection in the Volga region, which, being supported by
                    many of the extreme orthodox party and by the peasantry, threatened to prove
                    formidable. But the undisciplined bravery of his troops was of no avail against
                    the forces of Catherine; he was defeated, taken, and executed at Moscow. Her son
                    Paul, whom she disliked and neglected, was placed under the strictest
                    surveillance to the end of her reign.</p>
                <p>As soon as she was securely seated upon the throne, Catherine began to attend to
                    the foreign interests of her empire. Here she zealously observed the traditions
                    of Russia. Debarred in so many ways from the free development of their
                    resources, and surrounded in almost every direction by weak and semi-barbarous
                    neighbours, the Muscovites had been constantly aiming at the extension of their
                    frontiers especially towards the sea. This policy Catherine took up, and no
                    native Russian could have better carried it out in its calculating steadiness
                    and unscrupulousness. One of her first steps (1763) was to expel the Saxon duke
                    of Courland, and to put Biron, a creature of her own, in his place; and by
                    ceaseless intrigue she so managed things in Courland, that it was eventually
                    glad to be incorporated with the Russian empire (1795). Towards Frederick she
                    took a threatening attitude at the beginning of her reign; but finding nothing
                    offensive to herself in the correspondence of the king with her late husband,
                    and seeing that great profit might be derived from the good-will of Prussia, she
                    concluded with it an offensive and defensive alliance, which continued to the
                    end of Frederick’s reign.</p>
                <p>It was chiefly with a view to Poland that this treaty of alliance was made. The
                    first result of it was the advance of a Russian army to the Vistula to compel
                    the election of Poniatowski, an old lover of Catherine, to the throne of Poland
                    (1763). But this was only the beginning of troubles. The old question of the
                    toleration of dissenters soon turned up; one confederation, that of Radom, was
                    formed by a party of Polish nobles to enforce, and another, that of Bar, to
                    resist toleration. Catherine supported the former. The confederation of Bar was
                    defeated and broken up, and its members fled over the frontiers to Turkey and
                    Austria (1768). The Turks, alarmed and incensed at the progress of Russia on
                    Polish ground, fanatically rushed into a war (1768--1774) for which they were
                    not prepared, and were disgracefully beaten both by land and sea. The Russian
                    arms marched victoriously through Bessarabia, Moldavia, and Wallachia to the
                    banks of the Danube; while a fleet, led chiefly by English seamen, sailed from
                    Cronstadt round the coasts of Western Europe into the Mediterranean, and after
                    sweeping the Levant burned the Turkish fleet in Tchesme Bay (1770).</p>
                <p>After the Turks had been so thoroughly disabled, Catherine had leisure once more
                    to attend to the state of Poland. The liberum veto, the freedom of
                    confederation, the want of a middle class, the want of union and of a healthy
                    public spirit, the oppression and brutalizing of the peasantry, and many other
                    causes, had reduced Poland to a state of incurable disease which it is
                    impossible to describe. During the Seven Years’ War the Russian armies had
                    incessantly marched unchallenged over the Polish territory; that splendid
                    opportunity for shaking off the northern incubus was allowed to pass away.
                    Lately, famine and pestilence had so ravaged the country that pigs and dogs
                    devoured the unburied bodies of men; a loaf of bread could not be had for a
                    hundred ducats. But it was from no benevolent feelings towards Poland that
                    Catherine wished to interfere with its territory; instead of favouring the
                    efforts made towards political improvement, her aim was simply to prolong the
                    ătate of anarchy till she was ready to enter upon as large a share of it as
                    possible. Frederick was the first to suggest a partial partition of Poland as
                    the best way out of many existing difficulties. The project was dropped for a
                    time, till Catherine took it up, and invited Prussia and Austria to join in it.
                    An agreement was at last come to (1772); and a common fund was raised to bribe
                    the Polish diet, which gave its consent the following year. Catherine, in this
                    and the two ensuing partitions, seized the lion’s share, in all about two-thirds
                    of the Polish territory. By the peace of Kainardschi with the Turks (1774), who
                    resigned all pretensions of supremacy over the Tartars in Southern Russia,
                    Catherine was free to occupy all the northern shore of the Black Sea. One Tartar
                    khan was expelled, and another was induced to abdicate; the Tartars were
                    massacred, and a flourishing country reduced to a wilderness. The Crimea, Kuban,
                    and Taman were finally annexed to the Russian empire (1783).</p>
                <p>Towards 1787 Catherine began to entertain still more magnificent schemes of
                    conquest. She made a progress as far as Kherson through the midst of flourishing
                    towns, villages, and farms, by fine roads, amidst festivals and illuminations,
                    all of which Potemkin had artificially extemporized in the wilderness, in order
                    to convince her how flourishing the recent conquests were. One of the gates of
                    Kherson bore the inscription, “This is the way to Byzantium.” Catherine was
                    going to fulfil the dreams of her French flatterers by chasing the Turk from
                    Europe, and restoring the Byzantine empire. The Turks were accordingly provoked
                    into a new war (1787-92), and were again beaten everywhere. Important events in
                    Poland, however, arrested the progress of Catherine on the Danube, and induced
                    her to make a peace with Turkey (Jassy, 1792), by which the Dniester became the
                    boundary between the two countries.</p>
                <p>England and Prussia had been taking a hostile attitude to Russia. Under the
                    furtherance of Hertzberg, the Prussian minister, many reforms had been
                    introduced into Poland, and a constitutional hereditary monarchy established
                    (1792). But a confederation of nobles, opposed to these salutary changes,
                    invoked the aid of Catherine, who was only too glad of an opportunity to
                    interfere; and as the progress of the French Revolution began to upset all
                    existing political combinations, and to discredit everything <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n246/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0246-0235"/> like constitutionalism in governing quarters,
                    Prussia found it prudent to acquiesce in the arrangements of Catherine. She
                    restored all the old abuses and seized upon whatever territory pleased her,
                    allowing Prussia a small share of it (1793). The resulting attempt at a national
                    rising of Poland under Kosciusko failed; the Russian armies entered the heart of
                    Poland and stormed Warsaw (J794); and along with Austria and Prussia, Catherine
                    effected the last partition in 1795.</p>
                <p>Thus was an event consummated, which some historians denounce as the foulest deed
                    in the history of the world, and others justify not only as necessary to the
                    order and tranquillity of Europe, but as a vindication of Heaven’s laws on those
                    who have contemned them. In any case, Catherine must almost alone bear the
                    responsibility of it, and in her it would be useless to seek for any other
                    motive than an unscrupulous ambition. She had skilfully taken her measures for
                    it, in securing the acquiescence or cooperation of Prussia and Austria, and in
                    finally pushing it on while these and the other powers of Central and Western
                    Europe were more and more involving themselves in the terrible struggles of the
                    Revolution. She was a great hater of the Revolution; but while others were
                    endeavouring to suppress it, she profited by the opportunity to accomplish the
                    partition of Poland.</p>
                <p>In the domestic government of Russia, Catherine professed to act on the
                    principles she had learned from her French teachers. Most of her plans, however,
                    proved illusory, in a country where all the elements and conditions of an ideal
                    theory of government were wanting, even if Catherine had been perfectly resolute
                    in her aims. The attempt to introduce a code of laws on the model of Montesquieu
                    was a failure; but in the administration, especially the administration of
                    justice, in the furtherance of education, of industry, and of commerce, real
                    improvement seems to have been effected. All her schemes vitally suffered in two
                    ways: from the absence of trustworthy public servants, and from the defects of
                    her own character. In this, as in other reigns, bribery and corruption were
                    prevalent to an extraordinary degree, and Catherine intrusted the government to
                    her favourites and to upstarts, to the exclusion of the nobility. In the
                    capital, at her court, and in her own circle there reigned the most systematic
                    immorality, which she encouraged by her example. French admirers used to call
                    her the Semiramis of the North. Mr Carlyle calls her a female Louis Quatorze.
                    She justified both comparisons by her beauty, her masculine ambition, and her
                    summary disregard of virtuous restraint. One favourite was dismissed after
                    another; but Potemkin eclipsed all others by the extraordinary union of
                    qualities most requisite for success in Russia,—beauty, daring, extravagance,
                    ambition,—and in the length of time his influence over Catherine continued. From
                    1775 till his death in 1791, that is, for a period of sixteen years, he was
                    supreme; after Catherine’s personal inclination for him had abated, he supplied
                    her with new favourites and retained the power for himself, in all essential
                    points directing Russian politics during that long period. To all her lovers she
                    was munificent, not only during their season of favour, but after their
                    dismissal, loading them with presents and pensions to such an extent, that
                    altogether they are estimated to have cost Russia about £20,000,000. Towards the
                    end of her reign discerning men began to fear that such extravagance, and the
                    corruption attendant upon such a state of things, might lead to the exhaustion
                    of the empire. In fact, the magnificence of her court, the marvellous extent of
                    her empire, her foreign conquests, and the imposing position she held among the
                    sovereigns of the world, only served to bring into more painful relief the moral
                    corruption, the semi-barbaric violence, the hard-hearted cruelty, and systematic
                    unscrupulousness which characterized the Russian court and the Russian policy.
                    Things grew worse towards the end of her reign. The progress of the French
                    Revolution damped all her sentimental enthusiasm for reform. The friend and
                    correspondent of Voltaire and D’Alembert, and the patroness of Diderot, lived
                    long enough to prohibit the publication of French works in Russia. She died of
                    apoplexy in November 1796. The best account of Catherine’s early life is
