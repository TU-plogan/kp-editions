                <p><label type="entry">CENSUS</label> is now almost solely used to denote that
                    enumeration of the people made at intervals in most European countries, and in
                    the United Kingdom and the British Colonies decennially. The term had its origin
                    in Rome, where a group of the many functions performed by the high officer
                    called censor received the name of <hi rend="italic">census.</hi> An enumeration
                    of the people was only one of them, but they were chiefly of a statistical
                    character. They were especially directed to fiscal objects; and it does not
                    appear that the enumeration of the people was then deemed of value as a source
                    of statistical knowledge which might influence morals and legislation. It was
                    connected with the Servian constitution, which apportioned the rights and duties
                    of citizens to the amount of property, dividing them into six classes, which
                    were subdivided into centuries by a mixed ratio of wealth and numbers. Had the
                    enumeration been deemed of value for any such other purposes, besides the
                    adjustment of rights and obligations, as those for which statistical knowledge
                    is now deemed so valuable, the notices preserved of the vast collection of
                    statistical facts thus made would have been less scanty and meagre, and we
                    should not have found it so impracticable to come to any conclusion about the
                    population and extent of the city of Rome itself. The Roman census must have
                    been minute and full. It indicated not only the number and respective classes of
                    all free persons, but their domestic position as husbands and wives, fathers and
                    mothers, and sons and daughters. The slaves and freedmen were indicated in
                    connection with the possessions of the head of the house, and landed property
                    was analyzed into several classes according to its character and produce. The
                    important practical effect of the census caused it to be conducted at intervals
                    generally so frequent as every fifth year. It was followed by a sacrifice of
                    purification or lustration, whence the term of five years came to be designated
                    a lustru m. There were highly penal consequences to the citizen who neglected
                    his registration for the census, to whom as an unregistered person the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">incensus</hi> was given. From the mixed functions to which it
                    was applied we have the word used among the Romans to signify the patrimony or
                    property qualification of a particular grade—as <hi rend="italic">census
                    senatorius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">census equester;</hi> and we have it
                    employed in later times to indicate taxation. Hence <hi rend="italic"
                    >census</hi><hi rend="italic">dominicains,</hi> implying a feudal tax to the
                    superior, and <hi rend="italic">census duplicatus,</hi> a double tax or feudal
                    casualty; and the word <hi rend="italic">cense,</hi> used by old English
                    writers, was abbreviated in modern use into <hi rend="italic">cess.</hi></p>
                <p>While the word census was thus applied to the taxation of the Middle Ages, it
                    will readily be understood that in its modern sense it received no practical
                    application, since neither taxation nor the adjustment of social rank required a
                    numbering of the people; and the statistic or economic ends of such a process
                    were as little known as they had been to the Romans. Under the despotic
                    Governments of the Continent, however, the tendency to central organization for
                    purposes of administration and police prepared the way for statistical inquiries
                    into the numbers of the inhabitants of particular areas whenever there should
                    occur an occasion for enumerating them. It was in Britain, with its abstinent
                    Government and unrestrained people, that the want of population statistics
                    became most flagrantly <pb break="no"

                    realize the idea that, long after Adam Smith’s time, the number of the
                    inhabitants of the British empire could only be guessed at as the populousness
                    of China is at the present day; and, as in all matters of statistics, which have
                    their own simple solution through specific inquiry, the guesses about the
                    population of the empire were not only vague but extravagantly contradictory.
                    During the 18th century, the most trustworthy geographers were generally those
                    who did not venture on an estimate of the population even in those European
                    states which had the best means of enumeration at their command.</p>
                <p>The first effort to take a census of the population of Great Britain was made in
                    1801; it did not then extend to Ireland. The success which attended this and the
                    two succeeding efforts was mainly owing to the zeal and ability of Mr Rickman,
                    the assistant-clerk of the House of Commons. Where there is an organization like
                    that of many in the European states for preserving a constant official record of
                    all the fluctuations of the population, not only in their absolute numbers
                    throughout a whole territory, but in the relative numbers in its respective
                    parts as they may be affected by fluctuations, systematic arrangements are thus
                    prepared not only for obtaining a general census at any one moment, but for
                    checking its accuracy and classifying its elements. But to deal at once with the
                    raw material in the self-governed British empire required great ingenuity and
                    sagacity. A census, to be accurate, must be taken on a uniform system, and must
                    be taken simultaneously. Any enumeration going over a tract of time, were it but
                    two days, must be more or less inaccurate, and destitute of the means of
                    correcting its own inaccuracies. Besides the mere abstract numbers of the
                    people, there is much collateral information to be recorded. This, besides its
                    own intrinsic value, is necessary as a check on the numbers; since a
                    distribution into elements according to sex, age, social condition, occupation,
                    and the like, affords a self-acting control on the accuracy of mere figures. In
                    a census, indeed, it is a simple rule, that the information returned should be
                    extended as far beyond the main facts as with safety to these it can be carried.
                    The tendency towards complexity in the nature of the returns must always be
                    checked by the liability of the people at large to make blunders and create
                    confusion where they are required to attest facts not of the most obvious
                    nature, and by the difficulty of getting a number of subordinate officers to
                    understand and carry out a complex classification. Hence there was great
                    difficulty in obtaining a classification according to occupation, from its
                    complex intermixture with the classification according to families. Thus, in the
                    first census, there was an attempt to classify the people under three
                    divisions—(1) persons chiefly employed in agriculture, (2) persons chiefly
                    employed in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, and (3) all other persons not
                    comprised in the two preceding classes. But Mr Rickman found the returns
                    unsatisfactory, from the difficulty of deciding “whether the females of the
                    family, children, and servants were to be classed as of no occupation, or of the
                    occupation of the adult males of the family.” In the two subsequent
                    enumerations, the rule adopted was to record the occupation of the head of the
                    family; but here comes a new element of confusion, in the difficulty of defining
                    the head of a family. Experience, and an anxious desire to combine simplicity
                    and comprehensiveness in the returns, were the only means by which such
                    difficulties could be mitigated.</p>
                <p>The enumerations of 1841 and 1851 in England were much facilitated by the uniform
                    system of registration of births, marriages, and deaths which came into
                    operation on 1st July 1837, and which not only afforded the means of checking
                    the accuracy of the returns, but provided a prompt and skilled machinery
                    accustomed to statistical work. Far more dependence could now be placed on the
                    discretion and skill of the officers to whom the local duties were committed;
                    and the returns were made more minute and complete. In Scotland it was necessary
                    to adopt the method of employing the parish schoolmasters to perform the local
                    duty of enumerating the population in the country districts. In Ireland the
                    first attempt at a générai census was made in 1811, but it was decidedly
                    unsuccessful. It was repeated in 1821, but went no further than a bare
                    enumeration of doubtful accuracy. The census taken there in 1831 was subject to
                    correction in 1834, to make it the basis of the new system of national
                    education. In the two subsequent enumerations the aid of the admirable
                    constabulary force, and the use of an ordnance survey, nearly complete in 1841,
                    went far to supply the want of permanent local statistical machinery.</p>
                <p>The census of 1851 was taken on the 31st day of March, the previously distributed
                    schedules beiug then collected. They embraced a return of the local and other
                    conditions of the population during the preceding night.</p>
                <p>“At the present census,” say the commissioners, “it was resolved to exhibit, not
                    merely the statistics, as before, of parishes, and more completely of
                    parliamentary and municipal boroughs, but also of such other large towns in
                    England and Scotland as appeared sufficiently important for separate mention,
                    and of all the ecclesiastical districts and new ecclesiastical parishes which,
                    under the provision of various Acts of Parliament, have, during the last forty
                    years, been created in England and Wales. In addition also to the inquiry
                    concerning the occupation, age, and birthplace of the population, it was
                    determined to ascertain the various relationships (such as husband, wife, son,
                    daughter), the civil condition (as married, unmarried, widower, or widow), and
                    the numberof persons blind, deaf, and dumb.”</p>
                <p>Another novel feature in the census of 1851 was an attempt to supply the
                    statistics of the ecclesiastical and educational condition of the country. It
                    stated the amount of church accommodation at the command of each religious
                    denomination; while a return was procured of those in attendance in the several
                    churches on Sunday, 30th March. The attendance throughout thirty-five religious
                    communities in England on that forenoon was returned as 4,428,338, of which the
                    proportion assigned to the Church of England was 2,371,732. The returns for
                    Scotland, admittedly very imperfect, give a total of 943 <hi rend="subscript">
                    y</hi> 951, of which 351,454 belonged to the Established Church. The English
                    report was accompanied by an elaborate history of the several religious
                    communities.</p>
                <p>The enumerations in Ireland exhibit statistical novelties of a totally different
                    kind. In 1841 it was resolved, as that country so totally depended on the amount
                    of its agricultural produce, to obtain the statistics of its rural economy. The
                    surface of the country was divided unde <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> five
                    heads—arable, plantations, uncultivated, towns, and water; and, with a view to
                    these divisions, a return was made of the character of each farm or other
                    agricultural allotment, with the quantity of live stock and other relevant
                    facts. The attempt was found so successful, that it was renewed with more full
                    effect in 1851, producing 727 tabular folio pages of very valuable
                    information.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Census of</hi> 1861.</p>
                <p>The enumeration in 1861 was the seventh census of England, and was taken under
                    the superintendence of the Registrar-General, under the powers conferred by
                    three Acts of Parliament, applicable respectively to England, Scotland, and
                    Ireland. By this census it was found that the population of the United Kingdom
                    was 29,321,288, and that of each pf the four divisions of the kingdom was as
                    follows :— England and Wales, 20,228,497; Scotland, 3,096,808; Ireland
                    5,850,309; islands in the British seas, 145,674.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0347-0336"/>
                <p>The population of England and Wales, excluding the portion of the army, navy, and
                    merchant seamen abroad, was 20,066,224. The annual rate of increase per cent, of
                    the population in the United Kingdom, in the ten years 1851-61 was 0 55,
                    viz.:—England and Wales, 144; Scotland, 0’58; Ireland, (decrease), 123; and
                    islands in the British seas, 0O2.</p>
                <p>The local machinery by means of which the census of England was taken in 1861
                    differed in no material respect from that employed in 1851. In subdividing the
                    country the registrars were to see that the enumeration districts were not too
                    extensive or too populous; they were not to contain more than 200 houses in
                    towns, so that they could be enumerated by an active man within the compass of a
                    single day. An important feature consisted of the publication of the number of
                    houses and population in “civil counties” and in lieutenancy subdivisions. The
                    number of blind and of deaf and dumb from birth, the number of foreigners, and
                    the number of naturalized British subjects, were shown in 1861 for the first
                    time. In the case of Scotland, the enumeration was for the first time required
                    to be made apart from that of England, under the superintendence of the
                    Registrar-General of Scotland. From 1855 Scotland had the advantage of a
                    national system of registration, and the census of 1861 was therefore no longer
                    taken through the agency of the sheriffs in counties, and of the provosts or
                    chief magistrates in the royal and parliamentary burghs, but through the agency
                    of 1001 local registrars of births, deaths, and marriages, assisted by 8075
                    enumerators. The forms and instructions issued were all based on, and in most
                    cases virtually the same as, those used in England in the census of 1851. “Flats
                    <hi rend="italic">”</hi><hi rend="italic">were not</hi> reckoned as houses in
                    Scotland in 1861. All the details as to population, &lt;fcc., in 1851, were for
                    civil parishes and civil counties only. In 1861 the returns were for
                    registration districts and registration counties. The novel features in 1861 for
                    Scotland, which merit special notice, were the number of families in every
                    parish and county, the number of houses having windows, and the number of
                    children between the ages of five and fifteen years in attendance at school. In
                    1861 it was ascertained that the islands in Scotland amounted to 787 in number,
                    and of these 186 were inhabited by one or more persons on the census day.</p>
                <p>The tables in 1861 relating to the ages, conjugal conditions, birthplaces, blind,
                    deaf and dumb, and to the occupations combined with ages, were published
                    uniformly with those in 1851. A comparison can be made of the occupations at the
                    different ages with the death registers, and the comparative mortality
                    prevailing among the different classes and ranks of society can now be
                    ascertained as well as the comparative healthiness of each occupation or
                    trade.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ireland,</hi> 1861.—The enumeration of the people of Ireland in
                    1861 was effected for the first time altogether (excepting the metropolis) by
                    the officers and men of the constabulary force. The returns show—for provinces,
                    counties, baronies, parishes, towns, and parliamentary boroughs—the area,
                    population, and number of houses, the number of families with their pursuits and
                    the means upon which they were dependent, also the religious professions and
                    education of the inhabitants, the number of families living in each house, and
                    the amount of their accommodation by counties in rural and civic districts, the
                    birthplaces of the people, their condition as to marriage, and their occupations
                    for each county, also tabular summaries relating to vital statistics.</p>
                <p>The ages of the people in Ireland were incorrectly returned in 1861, and in the

                    with instructions from the Home Office, by the respective Lieutenant-Governors
                    acting in conjunction with the English central office.</p>

                <p>In 1871 the first <hi rend="italic">Imperial</hi> census of the British empire
                    was taken, and the population was found to amount to 234,762,593, living upon
                    7,769,449 square miles of territory; comprising England and Wales, with a
                    population of 22,856,164; Scotland, 3,392,559; Ireland, 5,449,186: islands in
                    the British seas, 147,470; and British Colonies and Possessions (exclusive of
                    the army, navy, and merchant seamen abroad, as they are included in the
                    populations just quoted), 202,917,214. The population of England and Wales,
                    excluding the portion of the army, navy, and merchant seamen abroad, was
                    22,712,266. The annual rate of increase per cent, of the population in the

                <p>In this great undertaking the work was subdivided for convenience of execution.
                    In conformity with the Act of Parliament the census of England and Wales was
                    taken by the Registrar-General, assisted by Dr Farr and J. T. Hammick. The
                    population was enumerated <hi rend="italic">in one day</hi> (3d April 1871) by
                    32,543 enumerators, employed under 2195 registrars and 626 superintendent
                    registrars.</p>
                <p>Instructions were issued to the superintendent registrars, and to the registrars
                    of births and deaths, for their guid ∙ ance in taking the census, and one of the
                    duties requiring their earliest attention was the division of the country into
                    enumeration districts, and just here the registrar had an important duty to
                    fulfil, for he was directed to see that the boundaries of parishes, townships,
                    ecclesiastical districts, municipal and parliamentary cities and boroughs, urban
                    sanitary districts, and all other of the various conflicting and confusing
                    territorial subdivisions of the country, were duly indicated. Most of the
                    registrars laid down the boundaries of their enumeration districts on maps, so
                    as to ensure that no part of their districts was omitted.</p>
                <p>These plans of division were first submitted to the various superintendent
                    registrars, and finally to the Registrar-General for approval. The 32,543
                    enumerators were required to be intelligent, trustworthy, and active, to write
                    well, and to have some knowledge of arithmetic. They were not to be infirm or of
                    weak health, not younger than 18 years, nor older than 65; and they were
                    required to be persons likely to conduct themselves with strict propriety and
                    civility. 627 of the public or charitable institutions were enumerated by the
                    masters or chief resident officers.</p>
                <p>In order to facilitate the proper designation of all roads, streets, and houses,
                    a circular was addressed to the mayor of each municipal city and borough, and to
                    the chairman of every local board, suggesting that previous to the census all
                    unnamed roads and streets should be named, and all houses numbered. Circulars
                    were also addressed to the press explaining the objects and uses of the census,
                    so as to aid in securing complete and correct returns,</p>
                <p>The enumeration of 1871 was a <hi rend="italic">“nominal”</hi> census.</p>
                <p>The householders’ schedules were delivered by the enumerators prior to 3d April.
                    Every separate occupier received a schedule, and this schedule was so prepared
                    in accordance with the 4th section of the Census Act, that, as shown in the
                    annexed example, the name, sex, age, rank, profession or occupation, conjugal
                    condition, relation to head of family, and birthplace of every person who abode
                    in any house, on the night of Sunday, 2d April 1871, might be returned; the
                    blind, deaf and dumb, imbecile, or lunatic were distinguished. At the census of
                    1871 the numbers of lunatics out of asylums and of imbeciles or idiots were
                    ascertained for the first time.</p>

                <p>The despatch of forms and instructions began as soon as the office in Craig’s
                    Court was opened, and included 6,500,000 householders’ schedules, weighing about
                    41 tons. The enumeration books and forms sent out weighed in the aggregate about
                    54 tons. But in addition to these there were sent out from the central office no
                    less than 115 different descriptions of printed instructions, forms, and
                    circulars, including a calendar, so that certain operations might be

                <p>The metropolitan, the municipal, and the county police afforded help in
                    enumerating the houseless population. The strength of the navy, in forms

                    port or out at sea, by Her Majesty’s Customs, and by the Registrar-General of
                    merchant seamen; and His Royal Highness the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-chief
                    supplied full returns of the various particulars respecting the army. The
                    numbers of British subjects in foreign states and in India and the population of
                    the Colonies were obtained through Her Majesty’s Secretaries of State for
                    Foreign Affairs, India, and the Colonies.</p>
                <p>Welsh schedules were issued for the use of a certain number of the Welsh people,

                <p>The enumerators were instructed to consider a house as comprising all the space

                    family, or by several families living in distinct stories or apartments; and
                    they were also instructed, when delivering their schedules, to make a record, in
                    a “memorandum book” supplied for the purpose, of the road or street in which
                    every house was situated, and of the name or number of each house, and to state
                    the number of schedules left at each house. Uninhabited houses, houses building,
                    churches, chapels, and all other public buildings were likewise noticed in this
                    book. With the assistance of the police, the enumerator had to make or procure
                    returns of all persons not dwelling in houses, but sleeping in barns, sheds,
                    caravans, or tents, or in the open air.</p>
                <p>Special schedules were printed for the enumeration of persons in public
                    institutions, on board vessels, or in charge of boats and barges employed in
                    inland navigation.</p>
                <p>Persons travelling during the night of Sunday, 2d April, were to be included in
                    the schedule of the proprietor or manager of the hotel or inn, or in the
                    schedule of the occupier of the house, at which they arrived on the morning of
                    Monday, 3d April. Persons engaged in work away from home during the night of
                    Sunday, 2d April, were to be included in schedules left at their houses.</p>
                <p>The cause of an unusual number of persons being temporarily absent or present was
                    to be noted.</p>
                <p>VVhen the enumerators had collected and arranged their schedules, they were
                    copied into enumeration books provided for this purpose, and a summary was made
                    of the population of each civil parish, township, or place, and these books were
                    delivered to the registrar on or before 10th April, by whom they were examined
                    and corrected, and forwarded on or before 24th April to the superintendent
                    registrar.</p>
                <p>The enumeration books were then revised by the superintendent registrar, who was
                    at this stage required to fill up a printed form, showing a summary of the
                    houses and population in each sub-district, municipal or parliamentary city or
                    borough, &lt;fcc., and transmit the whole to the Census Office in Craig’s
                    Court.</p>
                <p>On receipt of the books and summaries by the RegistrarGeneral, the abstract
                    required by the 9th section of the Census Act was prepared and laid before
                    Parliament on 20th June 1871.</p>
                <p>As soon as the preliminary report, consisting of 137 pages, was published, the
                    work commenced at the central office of revising the enumeration books so as to
                    ascertain the correct number of houses and population in each of the various
                    subdivisions of the country, and in order to ensure accuracy in the preparation
                    of this work, statements of the houses and population of ecclesiastical
                    districts and other local subdivisions were submitted to the clergy and to the
                    various local authorities for approval. The registrars were required to state
                    the cause of any remarkable increase or decrease of population, and a proof of
                    the tables relating to each county was submitted to the clerk of the peace for
                    correction and approval.</p>
                <p>The abstracts relating to the occupations and ages of the people were a great
                    work. It was considered desirable not only to take out the number of persons of
                    each sex in each occupation, but the number at each quinquennial period of age;
                    for without this information the relative salubrity of the professions, and a
                    great variety of other important questions could not be determined.</p>
                <p>In this arrangement of the people according to occupations and ages, they had not
                    only to be classified in different orders, but it was necessary to find a place
                    for every one of the 23 millions of population, so as to be enabled to pass them
                    rapidly and distinctly in review.</p>
                <p>The classification of the living according to their professions. and occupations
                    in combination with age has opened up a new field of inquiry, and the question
                    can now be determined for sanitary purposes, and for life insurance, what
                    effects the different professions and occupations have on health, at different
                    ages. Formerly, the mean age at death was taken to show the healthiness or
                    insalubrity of certain occupations. But the mean age at death depends upon many
                    circumstances besides health, and among others, upon the ages of the living,
                    which vary in proportions in almost every profession, according as it is a
                    profession that people enter early or later in life. Insurance offices and
                    friendly societies will find the results of the third volume of the Census of
                    England in 1871—in conjunction with the 14th Annual Report, and the two
                    Supplements to the 25th and 35th Annual Reports of the Registrar-General,
                    recording the mortality of persons at different occupations—of great use to them
                    in their trans actions, for it is evident that the lives of farmers, for
                    example, may be safely insured at much lower rates than the lives of licensed
                    victuallers.</p>
                <p>Many important results for “civil counties” were published in 1871 that will not
                    be found in the census returns of 1861, such as a description of the
                    territorial, executive, and ecclesiastical divisions in each county, more exact
                    areas from the ordnance survey, additional columns showing <pb break="no"

                    distinguishing the sexes of the population, additional columns showing area,
                    number of electors, and of members within the parliamentary limits, including
                    and excluding represented boroughs, petty sessional divisions, wards of
                    municipal boroughs, comparative tables of houses and population in 1861 and
                    1871, tables showing the number of families in each civil parish and township,
                    and results showing the residue of area and population in mother parishes.</p>
                <p>Also under “registration counties” many new particulars were published in 1871,
                    such as maps of counties and districts, showing the population of large towns,
                    and the particulars as to reformatory and industrial schools, and as to Her
                    Majesty’s ships.</p>
                <p>The census of Ireland in 1871 was taken by the Registrar-General of Ireland,
                    assisted by two other commissioners, W. R. Wilde and G. W. Abraham. The
                    enumeration (except in the metropolis, in which 178 of the Dublin Metropolitan
                    Police discharged that duty) was effected by 4536 members of the Royal Irish
                    Constabulary, whose local knowledge and previous experience as enumerators on
                    three former occasions rendered them peculiarly well suited for this
                    undertaking. The country was divided into 248 districts, each under the charge
                    of a sub-inspector. Printed instructions were furnished, and, when necessary,
                    the enumerators were supplied with maps, conveyances, boats, and in the
                    Irish-speaking districts with interpreters also. In conformity with the Census
                    Act an abstract of the census of Ireland was published on 14th June 1871,
                    showing the number of houses, families, and population in each county and city,
                    and in certain corporate towns in Ireland. The numbers in the different
                    religious professions were also returned as directed by the Act. The revised and
                    final numbers, for Ireland record the population in 1871 at 5,412,377, showing a
                    decrease since 1861 of 386,590 or 6*67 per cent. In the previous decenniad,
                    1851-61, the population had decreased by 753,418, or 11 ’ 50 per cent. The
                    decrease in the population of 1871 is stated to be chiefly attributable to
                    emigration. From 1st May 1851 to 31st March 1871 the loss by emigration amounted
                    to 2,024,609. Results relating to the ages, civil conditions, occupations,
                    birthplaces, religion and education of the people are published in the census
                    returns for Ireland; and instructions were issued by the Government, directing
                    that the results of the census of 1871 for each of the three divisions of the
                    kingdom should be published, with a view to uniformity. Some of the principal
                    results have thus been assimilated in 1871, but there is still a considerable
                    want of uniformity, especially as regards, the ages of children in Ireland. A
                    volume devoted entirely to vital statistics is not the least interesting of the
                    results of the census of Ireland in 1871.</p>
                <p>As regards Scotland, the results of the census of 1871 are nearly uniform with
                    those of England. In addition to the ordinary particulars, inquiries were made
                    as to the number of children from five to thirteen years of age receiving
                    education, and the number of rooms with windows. This census was taken by the
                    Registrar-General of Scotland and Dr Stark, through the agency of 1016 local
                    registrars, assisted by 8342 enumerators, whose appointments were approved by
                    the sheriffs in counties, and by the chief magistrates in boroughs. The returns
                    for Scotland in 1871 contain some new features, such as the ecclesiastical
                    subdivisions of civil counties, grouping the population of each civil county
                    into three great divisions, according as they inhabited towns, villages, or
                    rural parts; the particulars as to houses, families, and population relative to
                    parliamentary constituencies of counties are also new. As there were no
                    registration districts in 1851, no attempt was made in 1861 to show the relative
                    increase or decrease of the population from 1851. But in the census of 1871,
                    this want was supplied by giving the number of the population in each district
                    for 1861, for comparison with that of 1871. The number of children from five to
                    thirteen years of age in the receipt of education also appears for the first
                    time in the returns for 1871.</p>
                <p>The census of the Island of Man and of the Channel Islands was taken by the
                    lieutenant-governors according to directions issued by the Secretary of State
                    for the Home Department, but the forms and instructions were issued by the
                    Registrar-General of England. The population of these islands on the aggregate
                    in 1871 was 144,638, viz.:—Isle of Man 54,042, Jersey 56,627, and Guernsey and
                    adjacent islands 33,969. No census of the Isle of Man was taken earlier than
                    that of 1821, when 40,081 persons were enumerated. Enumerations of the
                    inhabitants of Jersey were made in 1806 and in 1815, in which years the
                    population was respectively returned as 22,855 and 22,763. The first census of
                    Guernsey, &lt;fcc., was taken in 1821, and was 20,302, The population of these
                    islands has remained nearly stationary at the last three censuses.</p>
                <p>The cost of the census, incurred at the central office, and in payment of local
                    officers in each of the three countries in 1871, was £5, 5s. 7fd. per 1000 of
                    the population for England and Wales, £8, Is. 4d. for Scotland, and £7, 2s. 7d.
                    for Ireland.</p>
                <p>The results of the census of 1871 are multitudinous, and it is impossible here to
                    enumerate all the facts of interest which the returns disclose. Those relating
                    to parliamentary constituencies show that of 95 counties, or divisions of
                    counties, the population had increased since 1861 in 82, while in 13 the
                    population had decreased. Out of 198 boroughs which returned members to
                    Parliament the population had increased in 156, while in 31 the population had
                    decreased. In the year 1868 the boundaries of 68 boroughs were altered, and in
                    some of these the increase of population may be due to enlarged area. Eleven
                    boroughs had been formed since 1861. Some of the elaborate results afford the
                    means of solving important questions relating to the industrial organization of
                    the country, and show to what extent there has been a diminution in the numbers
                    employed in the cultivation of the soil, and to what extent there has been a
                    consolidation of farms, affecting the average size of the holdings. Other
                    results show the ages of the married and unmarried population, and these,
                    combined with the returns of the ages at marriage, furnish the means of
                    determining very important questions, such as the probable duration of the joint
                    lives of husband and wife, the annual rate of marriage at different ages, and so
                    on. Tables showing the number of foreigners resident in England and Wales, and
                    the number of British residents abroad, throw much light on many points relating
                    to the social condition of the people. Not the least useful of the results is an
                    interpolated table of the population at each year of age, furnishing
                    school-boards with the means of ascertaining the proportional number of children
                    at the school ages, and enabling life insurance offices and scientific and other
                    authorities to solve many important problems. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>The census in the United States is a political necessity. To this, and not to the
                    general appreciation of the claims of statistical science is due the fact that
                    the systematic periodical enumeration of inhabitants was there undertaken
                    earlier even than in England.</p>
                <p>Had the government set up in 1787 been a pure confederation, like that which
                    preceded it, into which the States entered as equal bodies, the census would not

                    arms-bearing population, or on the number of horses, or on the rçcords of births
                    and deaths, might long have answered all administrative purposes. On the other
                    hand, had the Constitution of 1787 erected a single, self-sufficient government,
                    a simple sovereignty, the census need not have been provided for in that
                    instrument. Representative power might have been apportioned approximately
                    according to common fame, or numbers might have been rejected as the measure of
                    political power, as in England, and even as in Connecticut, alone of all the
                    States of the American Union, to-day.</p>
                <p>But the mixed form of government established by that constitution, the only form
                    of government which was then possible, by which the pre-existing States
                    maintained their right to exist and to act for themselves in all strictly
                    internal affairs, while for all national purposes political power was to be
                    exercised by a double rule, partly through the States acting as equal bodies,
                    and partly according to population irrespective of State lines, positively
                    required, not as a means of administrative efficiency, but as an essential
                    condition of its own existence, that the inhabitants of the United States should
                    be periodically enumerated. Accordingly, we find in the Constitution of 1787a
                    provision for a census to be taken every ten years, the first enumeration to be
                    made “within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United
                    States.”</p>
                <p>It would appear from this brief review that the eulogium of Moreau de Jonnès was
                    scarcely merited, when he declared that the United States present a phenomenon
                    without parallel in history,—“that of a people who instituted the statistics of
                    their country on the very day when they founded their government, and who
                    regulated by the same instrument the census of inhabitants, their civil and
                    political rights, and the destinies of the nation.” As a matter of undoubted
                    history, the provision for a national census was incorporated in the
                    constitution solely from political, not at all from philosophical,
                    considerations. Pending the actual accomplishment of the first enumeration, an
                    estimate of the population of the several States was adopted as a provisional
                    basis of representation in Congress.</p>
                <p>The first census was taken in 1790, the returns all being referred to the 1st of
                    August of that year, although the work of canvassing was extended over a
                    considerable period. As was the case with the first British census eleven years
                    later, and as is likely to be the case with the first census of any community,
                    great disappointment was felt at the result, and dissatisfaction at the methods
                    of enumeration was loudly expressed. Mr Jefferson, then Secretary of State, was
                    careful in sending abroad copies of the published tables, to impress it on the
                    minds of his correspondents that the returns fell far short of the truth, and
                    even went so far as to supply the omissions which he assumed to exist. The
                    results of later censuses, however, have established the substantial accuracy of
                    the first enumeration, and shown that the dissatisfaction felt at the time was
                    but the inevitable disappointment of over-strained anticipations. “To count,”
                    says Dr Johnson, “is a modern practice; the ancient method was to guess; and
                    where numbers are guessed, they are always magnified.” General censuses were
                    taken in 1800, 1810, and 1820, with exact intervals of ten years. In 1830 the
                    date of enumeration was fixed on the 1st of June. This change made the interval
                    between the fourth and fifth censuses nine years and ten months only, reducing
                    the nominal ratio of increase between 1820 and 1830, by about two-thirds of 1
                    per cent. The succession of census was then resumed with exact intervals of ten
                    years. The ninth census was taken as of date June 1, 1870.</p>
                <p>Peculiarities of the Constitution of the United States have been spoken of which
                    rendered the census a political necessity, and secured its adoption there
                    earlier than in countries far more advanced in statistical science and in the
                    arts of administration. To the same peculiarities are attributable the features
                    by which the census of the United States has come to differ from the census of
                    other countries. The reservation by the States of all rights not granted to the
                    general Government makes it fairly a matter of question whether purely
                    statistical inquiries, other than for the single purpose of apportioning
                    representation, could be initiated by any other authority than that of the
                    States themselves. That large party which advocates a strict and jealous
                    construction of the constitution would certainly oppose any independent
                    legislation by the national Congress for providing a registration of births,
                    marriages, and deaths, or for obtaining social and industrial statistics,
                    whether for the satisfaction of the publicist, or for the guidance of the
                    legislature. Even though the supreme court should decide such legislation to be
                    within the grant of powers to the general Government, the distrust and
                    opposition, on constitutional grounds, of so large a portion of the people,
                    could not but go far to defeat the object sought.</p>
                <p>In this political difficulty, the unquestionable provision of the constitution
                    for a decennial census has been taken advantage of by all parties to secure much
                    statistical information, which is not usually, and perhaps is not properly,
                    connected with a census. Nor can there be any doubt that the introduction of new
                    schedules of inquiries has, since 1850, somewhat impaired the efficiency of the
                    census in its original constitutional function of making a count of the
                    inhabitants of the several parts of the country for the purpose of distributing
                    representation in Congress. As the census has widened, it has weakened. More has
                    been put upon the enumerator than he could well carry. His attention has been
                    distracted by the multiplicity of objects presented; the great number of
                    inquiries has also perplexed and irritated the body of citizens; while the
                    result of protracting the canvass to obtain additional information has, in the
                    incessant changes of population, especially in cities and in manufacturing
                    villages, allowed not a few to escape enumeration altogether.</p>
                <p>The first enlargement of the scope of the census was in 1810, when the agents of
                    the census were by law required to take an account of the several manufacturing
                    establishments and manufactories within their several districts. The same
                    requirement was contained in the Act for the census of 1820; but the results
                    proved of so little value that the attempt was altogether abandoned in 1830. In
                    1840 a manufacturers’ schedule was used, and inquiries respecting schools were
                    incorporated. It was at the seventh census, 1850, however, that the main
                    enlargement was effected. By the Act of May 23 of that year, the census was
                    extended to cover the several subjects of mortality, agriculture, productive
                    industry, schools, churches, newspapers, &lt;fcc., &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>The agencies and methods of enumeration in the census of the United States have
                    been but little changed from the first, and are to-day antiquated and
                    ineffective in a high degree. By the Act of 1790, it was made the duty of the
                    marshals of the United States courts in the several judicial districts to take
                    the enumeration, appointing therefor as many assistants as they should deem
                    necessary. The enumeration was to commence August 1, and to close within nine
                    calendar months thereafter; the returns were to be filed with the clerks of the
                    several courts, while the marshals were to forward to the president “the
                    aggregate amount of each description of persons within their respective
                    districts.” In 1800 the supervision of the census was placed with the Secretary
                    of State. The <pb break="no"

                    same as in 1790.</p>
                <p>In 1810 the agents of the census were placed under the direction of the Secretary
                    of the Treasury as to the enumeration of manufactures required; but in 1820 the
                    entire charge remained with the Secretary of State. In 1850, the supervision of
                    the census was committed to the newly created Department of the Interior, and
                    the period allowed for enumeration was restricted to five months. As a matter of
                    fact, no enumeration has been completed within that time. The United States
                    marshals and their assistants remained the agents of the census office; and a
                    superintendent of census was appointed. In preparation for the census of 1870, a
                    committee of the House of Representatives, under the chairmanship of General
                    James A. Garfield of Ohio, presented a bill which sought to bring the census as
                    nearly up to the demands of modern statistical science as the peculiar
                    conditions of settlement and occupation in the United States would allow. The
                    report of the committee dwelt strongly on the essential viciousness of a
                    protracted enumeration, and on the general unfitness of the marshals of the
                    courts to perform the duty. The bill, however, did not propose a single-day
                    enumeration, but allowed a month for its completion. The schedules of inquiries
                    were largely increased in recognition of the impossibility of obtaining
                    statistical information under authority of the United States Government, except
                    under cover of the constitutional provision for a decennial census. The rank and
                    power of the superintendent of census were increased.</p>
                <p>The bill of the committee was carried through the House of Representatives by
                    large majorities, but failed in the Senate. The census of 1870 was consequently
                    taken under the Act of 1850 with two or three inconsiderable amendments.</p>
