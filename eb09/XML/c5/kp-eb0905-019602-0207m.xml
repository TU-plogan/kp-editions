                    (1494-1556), was born, according to Moratin, in Ciudad-Rodrigo. Attached at an
                    early age to the household of Ferdinand of Austria, afterwards king of Bohemia
                    and Hungary, and eventually emperor, Castillejo rose in the prince’s service to
                    the post of secretary, taking orders on the departure of his master from Spain,
                    in which country he remained some time. A letter written during this period
                    (1523) by Martin de Salinas to the treasurer Salamanca, in reply to one asking
                    him to provide the treasurer with a secretary, bears flattering witness to the
                    ability and temper of Castillejo, who is warmly recommended to the vacancy. It
                    is not known whether he obtained this post. Certain it is, however, that he soon
                    afterwards folowed Ferdinand, and resumed his secretaryship, with but little
                    profit, if we may judge from many passages in his verse, in which he deplores
                    his poverty and the forlorn position unaided merit, held at court. He was
                    several times in Venice, where certain of his opuscules were printed for
                    smuggling into Spain,—Castillejo, like Terres Naharro, whose comedies and
                    satires were also published in Italy, being on the <hi rend="italic">Index</hi>
                    of the Inquisition, on account of the strong anti clerical bias of his satirical
                    works. He died in a monastery near Vienna, two years before Ferdinand’s
                    recognition as emperor.</p>
                <p>Castillejo was a voluminous writer of verse. His poems are worthy of note, not
                    only on account of their intrinsic merit, but also as being the last
                    manifestation of importance of the older Spanish School of poetry against the
                    younger section under the leadership of Garcilaso de la Vega. That fine melodist
                    and brilliant rhetorician, the Ronsard of Spain, seconded by Boscan and Hurtado
                    de Mendoza, had introduced into his own land the rhythms and cadences employed
                    in Italy; through him the sonnet, the canzone, the octaves of the comic epics,
                    and even the <hi rend="italic">terza rima of</hi> the comedy itself had been
                    transplanted into Spanish soil; and he and his followers had created a
                    vocabulary of picked and exquisite terms which, passing through the hands of the
                    magniloquent Herrera, was to end in the monstrous dialect of Gongora and his
                    disciples. Against this revolution Castillejo set his face, fighting gallantly
                    and unavailingly in defence of the antique metrical forms and structures. The
                    use of these he never abandoned, save on one or two occasions when, for purposes
                    of parody, he produced sonnets and octaves. In the poetry of Castillejo, which
                    is written chiefly in “quintillas” and “copias de pié quebrado,” are all the
                    qualities that make the older verse of Spain such pleasant reading—the graceful
                    simplicity, the artless elegance, the fluency and spontaneity (which sometimes,
                    however, degenerates into garrulity), the keen and homely mother wit, often
                    gross but seldom offensive or cruel. He has, however, other qualities which are
                    peculiar to himself, and which give him a place apart even among the school that
                    may be said to end in him; his society verses are bright with a pleasant gossipy
                    amiability; his satires are quick with a certain cynical sprightliness that
                    makes them still amusing and attractive; while one at least of his poems, the
                    “Dialogue between Himself and his Pen,” overflows with a humorous tenderness
                    that is extremely effective. Writing on anything and everything—“On a Green and
                    Yellow Costume,” “On the Wood Guaiacum,” “On a Friend’s Horse called Tristram,”
                    —he of course produced a cloud of rhymes that are intolerable and to be avoided.
                    Some of his “Villancicos,” “Letras,” and “Motes,” however, are charming in
                    despite of years; a not infrequent note in them reminding the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0208-0197"/> reader somewhat of the quaint graces of Charles
                    of Orleans, with whom in this fondness for elaborate trifles Castillejo may be
                    said to have a certain affinity, though immeasurably his inferior in delicacy of
                    touch and artistic restraint. His principal satires, “The Sermon against Love”
                    and the “Dialogue of the Conditions of Women,” are amusing and witty enough;
                    while his “Galatea,” an imitation of Ovid, must be regarded as one of the
                    sweetest pieces of pastoral poetry in the whole range of Spanish letters, and,
                    with the exception of the exquisite little anacreontic to Love, as the best of
                    Castillejo’s many poems.</p>
                <p>The strong anti-clerical feelings of Castillejo, himself an ecclesiastic, have
                    been already remarked. His satires were treated exceedingly ill on this account
                    by the officers of the Inquisition, who did not scruple to excise large portions
                    of them, and to fill up the gaps thus caused with screeds of a contrary
                    tendency, the work of their own hack rhymesters, who had at this period a great
                    deal of work to do of the same sort. The poems themselves are divided into three
                    books, the first devoted to “Love,” and the second to “Conversation and
                    Pastime;” while the third is composed of moral and religious verses. The best
                    text is that given in the <hi rend="italic">BibUoteca de Autores Españoles,</hi>
