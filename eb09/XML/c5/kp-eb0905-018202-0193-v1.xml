                <p><label type="entry">CASSANDER</label> (c. 354-297 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.),</hi> king of Macedonia, was probably born about 354 B.c. He first
                    appears in history at the court of Alexander, defending his father Antipater
                    against the accusations of his enemies. Whether it be true or not that he
                    brought himself into disfavour by manifesting his contempt for the Eastern
                    customs with which the king had surrounded himself, it is certain that he
                    conceived a great hatred for Alexander, a hatred so well known that he was
                    accused of having caused the king’s death by poison. When his father became
                    regent of Macedonia, Cassander was made chiliarch; but, when Polysperchon
                    succeeded Antipater, he was not content with this position, but allied himself
                    with Ptolemy Soter and Antigonus, and declared war against the regent. His
                    success was such as to win over most of the Greek States; and he also effected
                    an alliance with Eurydice, the ambitious wife of King Arrhidaeus. Both she and
                    her husband, however, together with Cassander’s brother Nicanor, and a number of
                    others, were soon after slain by Queen Olympias. Cassander at once marched
                    against Olympias, and, having forced her to surrender in Pydna, put her to
                    death. Not long afterwards he also murdered Roxana and Alexander, the wife and
                    son of Alexander the Great. Hë had already connected himself with the royal
                    family by marriage with Thessalonica, Alexander’s half-sister, and, having
                    formed an alliance with Seleucus, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus, and defeated
                    Antigonus and Demetrius near Ipsus, in 301, Cassander became undisputed
                    sovereign of Macedonia and nominal king of Greece. He died some three years
                    after, in 297 B.c. For the history of his campaigns (which is given in Diodorus,
                    xviii.-xxi.) see <hi rend="smallcaps">Macedonia.</hi> Cassander is said to have
                    been a man of cultivated literary taste, and we are told that his delight in
                    Homer was such that he could repeat from memory every line of his poems.</p>
