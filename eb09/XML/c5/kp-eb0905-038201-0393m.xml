                    (1741-1794), one of the most famous talkers of a century rich in conversational
                    excellence, was born at a little village near Clermont in Auvergne. The
                    illegitimate child of a <hi rend="italic">dame de compagnie,</hi> he never knew
                    his father, and started in life as plain Nicolas, that being the name bestowed
                    on him by his mother. A journey to Paris resulted, through some now unknown
                    influence, in the boy’s obtaining a bursary at the Collège des Grassins. He
                    worked hard, and won nine prizes out of ten in two years. It is significant of
                    his cynical and original turn of mind that he should have been the only critic
                    disposed to be severe on the Latin hexameters that crowned his college
                    reputation, and that in after years he should have regarded as wasted the time
                    bestowed on the acquisition of academical knowledge, his opinion of which is
                    expressed in one of his most contemptuous epigrams—“<hi rend="italic">Ce que fai
                    appris je ne le sais plus; le peu que je sais je l'ai divine."</hi> After this
                    success the future king of the <hi rend="italic">salons</hi> ran away from
                    college, in company with two class-mates, on a voyage round the world. The three
                    rovers reached Cherbourg, and there reflected. They returned, and Chamfort
                    became an abbé. <hi rend="italic">“C’est un</hi><hi rend="italic">costume, el
                    non point</hi><hi rend="italic">un état,’’</hi> he said; and to the principal of
                    his college who promised him a benefice, he replied that he would never be a
                    priest, inasmuch as he preferred honour to honours— <hi rend="italic">“j’aime
                    l’honneur et</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic">les
                    honneurs.’’</hi></p>
                <p>About this time he assumed that name of Chamfort he was afterwards to render
                    famous, and plunged hap-hazard into the press for literary work and renown. He
                    met with scant success. Repulsed by editors and booksellers alike, he took to
                    making sermons at a louis each for an incompetent brother; and in this way,
                    scribbling now and then for the journals, he contrived to exist for a whole
                    year. A successful competition for one of the Academy’s prizes opened to him the
                    drawing-rooms of the upper world, and he became fashionable. His health and
                    constitution were exceedingly vigorous; but his passions were violent, he lived
                    hard, and he presently had to seek rest and recovery at Spa and elsewhere. In a
                    second competition he was unsuccessful; but a comedy of little merit, <hi
                    rend="italic">La Jeune</hi><hi rend="italic">Indienne,</hi> made some noise, and
                    consoled him for his failure. He was always poor. Though his was already a well
                    known name, he lived on eleemosynary dinners and suppers, repaying countenance
                    and sustenance with his <hi rend="italic">bons</hi><hi rend="italic">mots.</hi>
                    Madame Helvétius entertained him at Sèvres for some years. Chabanon, however,
                    gave up to the destitute wit his pension of 1200 livres on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercure de France,</hi> and about the same time Chamfort took two more Academy
                    prizes for his eulogies on Molière and on La Fontaine, by which he also won a
                    hundred louis from Necker, and obtained an enormous reputation. And as he wrote
                    little and talked a great deal, his reputation increased, till, under protection
                    of the Duchesse de Grammont, he went to court. His poor tragedy, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mustapha et</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeangir,</hi> was played at
                    Fontainebleau before Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette; the king added 1200 livres
                    to the gift of Chabanon, and the Prince de Condé made Chamfort his <pb

                    age; he was fast growing misanthropical; he was <hi rend="italic">“gai mais
                    ombrageux</hi> he was a Bohemian naturally and by habit. He resigned his post in
                    the prince's household, and retired into solitude at Auteuil. There, comparing
                    the authors of old with the men of his own time, he uttered the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">mot</hi> that proclaims the superiority of the dead over the
                    living as companions; and there too he presently fell in love. The lady,
                    attached to the household of the Duchesse de Maine, was forty-eight years old,
                    but clever, amusing, a woman of the world; and Chamfort married her. They left
                    Auteuil, and went to Vaudouleurs, near Etampes, where in six months Madame
                    Chamfort died. The widowed epicurean travelled, lived in Holland for a space
                    with Μ. de Narbonne, and returning to Paris received the Academy arm-chair left
                    vacant by the death of Sainte-Pelaye in 1781. He haunted the court, and made
                    himself loved in spite of the reach and tendency of his unalterable irony; but
                    he quitted it for ever after an unfortunate and mysterious love affair, and was
                    received into the house of Μ. de Vaudreuil. Among the many men of mark assembled
                    round him there by his fine faculty of pregnant speech, he made the acquaintance
                    and gained the friendship of Mirabeau, whom he assisted with orations, and whom
                    he followed heart and soul into the storm and tumult of the young
                    Revolution.</p>
                <p>He forgot his old friends (“<hi rend="italic">ceux qui passent la fleuve des
                    révolutions ont passé la fleuve de l’oubli”)·,</hi> he frequented the clubs, and
                    for a time was secretary of that of the Jacobins; he became a street-orator; he
                    entered the Bastille among the first of the storming party; he worked for the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mercure de France,</hi> a royalist print in which he
                    depreciated kingship. With the reign of Marat and Robespierre, however, his
                    uncompromising Jacobinism grew critical, and with the fall of the Girondins his
                    political life came to an end. But he could not restrain the tongue that had
                    made him famous; he no more spared the Convention than he had spared the Court.
                    His notorious republicanism failed to excuse the sarcasms he lavished on the new
                    order of things; and denounced by au assistant in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliothèque</hi><hi rend="italic">Nationale,</hi> to a share in the direction
                    of which he had been appointed by Roland, he was taken to the Madelonnettes.
                    Released for a moment, he was threatened again with arrest; but to this
                    brilliant free-lance of thought captivity had been intolerable, and he had
                    determined to prefer death to a repetition of the moral and physical restraint
                    to which he had been subjected. He attempted suicide, with pistol and with
                    poniard; and, horribly hacked and shattered, dictated to those who came to
                    arrest him the well-known declaration— <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Moi, Sebastien-Roch-Nicolas Chamfort, declare avoir</hi><hi rend="italic">voulu
                    mourir en homme libre plutôt que d’être conduit en esclave dans une
                    prison”—</hi> which he signed in a firm hand and in his own blood. He did not
                    die at once, but lingered on a while in charge of a gendarme, for whose wardship
                    he paid a crown a day. To the Abbé Sieyès Chamfort had given fortune in the
                    title of a pamphlet (“<hi rend="italic">Qu’</hi><hi rend="italic">est-ce que le
                    Tiers-État</hi><hi rend="italic">I</hi><hi rend="italic">Tout. Qu'a-t-il</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ĭ</hi><hi rend="italic">Rien</hi> ”), and to Sieyès did Chamfort
                    retail his supreme sarcasm, the famous “<hi rend="italic">Je m’en vais enfin de
                    ce monde où il faut que le coeur se brise ou se bronze.”</hi> The maker of
                    constitutions followed the dead wit to the grave.</p>
                <p>The writings of Chamfort, which include comedies, political articles, literary
                    criticisms, portraits, letters, and verses, are colourless and uninteresting in
                    the extreme. As a talker, however, he was of extraordinary force. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Maximes et Pensées,</hi> highly praised by John Stuart Mill, are,
                    after those of La Rochefoucauld, the most brilliant and suggestive sayings that
                    have been given to the modern world. The aphorisms of Chamfort, less systematic
                    and pschologically less important than those of the ducal moralist, are as
                    significant in their violence and iconoclastic spirit of the period of storm and
                    preparation that gave them birth as the <hi rend="italic">Reflexions</hi> in
                    their exquisite restraint and elaborate subtlety are characteristic of the
                    tranquil elegance of their epoch; and they have the advantage in richness of
                    colour, in picturesqueness of phrase, in passion, in audacity. Sainte-Beuve
                    compares them to “well-minted coins that retain their value,” and to keen arrows
                    that “<hi rend="italic">arrivent brusquement et sifflent encore.”</hi> An
                    edition of his works— <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres complètes de Nicolas
                    Chamfort,</hi><hi rend="italic">5</hi> volumes—was published at Paris in
                    1824-25. A selection— <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres de Chamfort—</hi> in one volume,
                    appeared in 1852, with a biographical and critical preface by Arsène Houssaye,
                    reprinted from the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes.</hi> See also
