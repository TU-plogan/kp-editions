                    C., and vapour density 1-491. It boils at 60Ι6° C. (Régnault), and is not frozen
                    at a temperature of — 16° C. It has an agreeable ethereal odour, a slightly
                    acrid and intensely sweet taste, is miscible in all proportions with alcohol,
                    but is only slightly soluble in water. Though not ordinarily inflammable, it
                    burns with a green flame when thrown upon hot coals, or if a light be applied to
                    a mixture of it with not less than about 30 per cent, of alcohol. Chloroform may
                    be employed as a solvent for resin, camphor, gutta-percha, iodine, bromine, and
                    the alkaloids. It can be prepared in a great variety of ways :—(1) By the action
                    of alkalies on chloral (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Chloral);</hi> (2) by boiling
                    trichloracetic acid, CC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.CO(OH), with aqueous
                    solutions of the alkalies; (3) by the replacement of an atom of chlorine in
                    carbon tetrachloride, CC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, by nascent hydrogen; (4)
                    on the large scale for commercial purposes by the action of bleaching powder on
                    ethylic alcohol and other carbon compounds. About 8 S&gt; of slaked lime, and 80
                    S&gt; of the strongest chloride of lime, and 22 gallons of water at a
                    temperature of 80°-90° C. are introduced into a leaden vessel or wooden cask,
                    and thoroughly mixed. Two lb of alcohol are then poured in; and if the heat
                    evolved in the ensuing reaction is not sufficient to distil over the chloroform,
                    a current of steam is passed into the vessel. The crude distillate is purified
                    by washing with water and agitation with sulphuric acid, and by redistillation,
                    finally, with a small quantity of slaked lime and calcium chloride, by means of
                    a water-bath. The chief impurities to which chloroform is liable are ether,
                    alcohol, aldehyde, hydrochloric, hypochlorous, and sulphuric acids, chloral, and
                    heavy volatile oils. Pure chloroform does not become opalescent in contact with
                    water, and is not coloured yellow or brown by sulphuric acid, or green by
                    chromic acid; with the former, it gradually evolves hydrochloric acid. When
                    exposed to air and light, chloroform becomes decomposed, with the formation of
                    chlorine, hydrochloric acid, carbon tetrachloride, and other products. The
                    presence of chloroform can be detected by adding to the liquid to be tested for
                    it a monamine, such as aniline, N(C <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi>)H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and an alcoholic
                    solution of caustic potash, when the characteristic odour of the carbamines is
                    given off at once, or on the application of heat.</p>
                <p>The history of chloroform affords but one amongst many instances of the
                    importance of chemical research even when no immediate practical advantages are
                    apparently to be derived from its prosecution. Chloroform was discovered in 1831
                    by Guthrie in America, and by Soubeiran in France, and by the latter was
                    described as <hi rend="italic">ether bichlorique.</hi> Liebig, who made the
                    independent discovery of it in the following year, regarded it as a trichloride
                    of carbon; but in 1834 its true constitution was established by Dumas. In March
                    1847 Flourens submitted to the Academy of Sciences at Paris a paper containing
                    observations on the anaesthetic powers of chloroform upon animals. In the summer
                    of that year “chloric ether,” the active principle of which is chloroform, was
                    used at St Bartholomew’s Hospital by Mr Lawrence instead of sulphuric ether for
                    the production of anaesthesia; and in the succeeding autumn Dr J. Y. Simpson of
                    Edinburgh introduced the employment of pure chloroform as an anaesthetic into
                    surgical practice. By its effect upon the nervous system chloroform causes a
                    suspension of voluntary motion and of sensation, whilst respiration and the
                    action of the sympathetic ganglia of the heart are still continued. It is more
                    active, occasions less bronchial irritation, and is easier of application than
                    ether, the use of which in British practice it has to a very great extent
                    superseded; it possesses also the advantage that its vapour is uninflammable.
                    The occurrence, however, from time to time, of deaths in consequence of the use
                    of chloroform, has led many practitioners to recommend the employment of ether
                    in its stead; but in the majority of instances fatal results may be attributed
                    to some fault in administration; and in some cases death has been thought to be
                    attributable to the giving of a less than customary quantity of chloroform,
                    which, paralyzing the cerebral hemispheres, but not the ganglia of the base of
                    the brain and the medulla, has permitted reflex action of the vagus upon the
                    heart through irritation of a sensory nerve. In operations after which
                    disturbance of the abdomen must be avoided, ether is far preferable to
                    chloroform, on account of the sickness usual for some time after the taking of
                    the latter.</p>
