                    Hercules in the Forum Boarium from the hands of the Politian gens to that of
                    public slaves. He distributed the <hi rend="italic">libertini</hi> among all the
                    tribes; and he further invaded the exclusive rights of the patricians by
                    directing his secretary Cneius Flavius (whom, though a freedman, he made a
                    senator) to publish the <hi rend="italic">legis actiones</hi> and the list of
                    <hi rend="italic">dies fasti</hi> (or days on which legal business could be
                    transacted). And lastly, he gained enduring fame by the construction of a road
                    and an aqueduct, which—a thing unheard of before—he called by his own name. In
                    the year after his resignation of the censorship (307) he was elected consul. In
                    298 he was made interrex; and in 296, as consul, he led the army in Samnium, and
                    the armies of the two consuls gained a victory over the Etruscans and Samnites;
                    but he never triumphed, nor does his military career appear to have been at all
                    distinguished. Next year he was praetor, and he was once dictator. To the
                    Ogulnian law admitting the plebeians to the offices of augur and pontifex he was
                    strongly opposed; and his advocacy of the cause of the democracy seems to have
                    ended with his censorship. His ambition and his pride of race were, however,
                    accompanied by a passionate love of Rome.</p>
                <p>He was already blind and tottering with age when Cineas, the minister of Pyrrhus
                    visited him, but so vigorously did he oppose every concession that all the
                    eloquence of Cineas was in vain, and the Romans forgot past misfortunes'in the
                    inspiration of his patriotism. The story of his blindness, however, may be
                    merely a method of accounting for his cognomen.</p>
                <p>Appius Claudius Caecus is also remarkable as the first of the Roman writers, both
                    in verse and prose, of whom we know anything. He wrote a poem which is mentioned
                    by Cicero, but of which the remaining fragments are of the smallest, and a legal
                    work entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Usurpationibus.</hi>
                    Itis very likely also that he was concerned in the drawing up of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Legis Actiones</hi> published by Flavius. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sententioe,</hi> which include the famous dictum “Every one is the architect of
                    his own fortunes,” were read by Panaetius, but are now lost.</p>
