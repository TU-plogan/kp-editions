                <p><label type="entry">CATECHISM</label>, a word which originally signified
                    instruction by word of mouth, being derived from the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >κατηχίω.</hi> But, as it was necessarily by oral instruction that, in the early
                    church, catechumens (or converts in preparation for baptism) were instructed in
                    the essential doctrines of Christianity, and as the catechist usually sought to
                    produce clear comprehension by means of questioning, several distinct uses of
                    the word have sprung from its original employment, and it has come to
                    signify—(1) instruction by means of question and answer; (2) elementary
                    instruction, whether oral or written, in any branch of knowledge; and (3), in
                    common language, a book of elementary instruction by means of question and
                    answer,— either secular, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the science catechisms
                    of the Middle Ages, or, as usually, religious.</p>
                <p>Catechetical instruction was doubtless common among the ancient Jews, and the
                    modern Jews possess several catechisms. The earliest with which we are
                    acquainted are the <hi rend="italic">Thirteen Articles of Belief</hi> of the
                    famous Maimonides, which belongs to the 12th century, and Rabbi Levi’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of Education,</hi> which belongs to the 13th. Among those
                    used at the present day in England may be mentioned Leser’s and Pixiotto’s.</p>
                <p>The most important and authoritative of the catechisms of the Roman Catholic
                    Church is that of the Council of Trent, which was published in 1566. It was
                    prepared under the superintendance of the archbishop of Milan, by Leonardo
                    Marini, Francisco Fureiro, Aegidius Foscorari, and Mugio Calini; and the style
                    was polished by Pogianus. It is not a catechism in the ordinary sense, for it is
                    not in the interrogative form, and it can scarcely be called elementary. It is,
                    in fact, a very careful and complete system of Roman Catholic doctrine,
                    extending over 500 8vo pages of closely-printed Latin. By command of the
                    council, it was translated into French, German, Spanish, and Italian, and there
                    is also an English version. The earliest of the catechisms of this church appear
                    to be that of Kero, a monk of St Gall, who lived in the 8th century, and that
                    which is ascribed to Otfried, a monk of Weissen burg of the 9th century. Others
                    worthy of mention are the <hi rend="italic">Summa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Doctrinarum</hi> of Peter Canisius, which was authorized in 1566; that of
                    Bellarmine (1603), and that of Bossuet (1687). In 1870, the Oecumenical Council
                    recommended the general use of the <hi rend="italic">Schema de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Parvo,</hi> a small catechism, which is little more than an
                    abstract of Bellarmine’s.</p>
                <p>Catechisms were also very common among the Christian sects which, during the
                    Middle Ages, opposed themselves to the dominant church, as the Albigenses and
                    the Wickliffites.</p>
                <p>The Greek Church has two principal catechisms, the earlier of which is that of
                    Peter Mogilas, patriarch of Kieff, which was published in 1542, and sanctioned
                    by the church in 1572. The other is that of Plato, patriarch of Moscow, of which
                    an abstract has been made for purposes of education. This work is divided into
                    two parts, of which the first treats of natural religion, the second of
                    revealed.</p>
                <p>Of the larger Protestant sects, each has a separate catechism. The Lutherans are
                    represented by the two smaller catechisms of their founder, published in 1520
                    and 1529, and by his larger catechism, published in the latter year. In
                    Switzerland, France, the Low Countries, Hungary, and Scotland, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Geneva Catechism</hi> of Calvin (1536) was for some time the
                    standard of the Reformed Church. The <hi rend="italic">Heidelberg</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Catechism,</hi> which appeared in 1563, compiled' by Caspar
                    Olevian and Zacharias Ursinus, and revised by the Synod of Dort, became the
                    standard of the Swiss Church; and upon it was founded the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zurich Catechism</hi> (1639). ASocinian catechism appeared at Rakov in
                    1574.</p>
                <p>The first prayer-book of Edward VI., published in the year 1549, contained what
                    now forms the first part of the catechism of the English Church»</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n231/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0231-0220"/>
                <p>ĭt consists of no more than two or three pages, and contains only the Ten
                    Commandments, the Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, and an expression of the doctrine of
                    baptism held by the English Church. In the reign of James I. an explanation of
                    the Anglican doctrine of the sacraments was added by Bishop Overall.</p>
                <p>The first catechism produced by the Scottish Presbyterians was that known as
                    Craig’s, which was laid before the General Assembly in 1592. It embodied, in
                    twelve chapters, the Calvinistic doctrine of the church with regard to original
                    sin, redemption, the sacraments, and ecclesiastical discipline; and after each
                    chapter was a number of questions and answers. This catechism, together with
                    some of those used on the Continent, served the British Presbyterians till 1647.
                    In that year the Westminster Assembly of Divines appointed committees to draw up
                    the famous <hi rend="italic">Larger</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Shorter
                    Catechisms.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides these catechisms, which profess to be the symbols of various churches, a
                    large number of private catechisms have been published. In the English Church
                    the most important are Cranmer’s and Noel’s (1570). Among the English Protestant
                    dissenters, who, of course, do not possess an authoritative catechism, there
                    have been several, of which the most famous are those of Dr Watts. A
                    considerable number have also been produced by German theologians; but many of
                    the works which they have published under the name have no claim to it
                    whatever.</p>
