                <p><label type="entry">CHRYSIPPUS</label> (c. 280-206 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> one of the greatest of the Stoics, was born probably in 280 B.C.,
                    at Soli, in Cilicia. Being robbed of his property, he visited Athens, and
                    attended the lectures, possibly of Zeno, and certainly of Cleanthes. The latter
                    he succeeded as recognized chief of the school. He is also said to have been
                    instructed in the doctrines of the Middle Academy by Arcesilaus and Lacydes.
                    Chrysippus was the author of a prodigious number of works, which, though
                    extremely prolix and disfigured by great obscurity and carelessness of style and
                    language, were distinguished by extensive learning and considerable acuteness.
                    But nothing has come down to us except small fragments, and from these it is
                    difficult to discover what doctrines are originally due to Chrysippus. We know,
                    however, that he made considerable emendations on the theory of Zeno and
                    Cleanthes. With regard to the relation of moral to physical science, he reversed
                    their conclusion, adopting the view, which from that time became characteristic
                    of Stoicism, that, as the sole aim of philosophy is to discover man’s duty,
                    ethics is the only science that is of real importance in itself, while physics
                    is to be regarded merely as an aid to its study. He improved on the crude theory
                    of perception which had been held by his predecessors, who compared the action
                    of the object on the mind to that of the seal on the wax, arguing that this
                    would do away with the possibility of the simultaneous perception of more than
                    one object, and denying that the mental modification resembles the object. He
                    also finally determined the Stoical theory of the criterion of truth, which,
                    according to him, is irresistible conviction. Much attention was paid by
                    Chrysippus to formal logic. He held that the hypothetical syllogism is the
                    original type of syllogistic inference, and he devoted the most elaborate study
                    to its various forms. He drew up a scheme of the categories,—making the highest
                    Substance <hi rend="smallcaps">(to</hi><hi rend="italic">vττoκelμevov)',</hi>
                    the next, Form, or essential attribute; the third, Variety, or that
                    non-essential attribute which is at the same time independent of all but the
                    object itself; the fourth, Variety of Relation, or that non-essential attribute
                    which depends on the relation of the object to some other object. Chrysippus
                    also gave some attention to linguistic, and especially to grammatical
                    investigations.</p>
                <p>The explanation of the universe adopted by Chrysippus is that of the rest of his
                    school. The real is the corporeal; man and the world are all that exists. In
                    each there is that which is inert, and also the informing soul or vivifying
                    fire. The soul of the universe is God, or Destiny. Each human soul is part of
                    the universal soul, in which, according to the view originated by Chrysippus,
                    the souls of all, except the wise, are again swallowed up at death. The universe
                    is perfect. So-called physical evil is none. Moral evil is the necessary
                    complement of good, and is turned by Providence into good. AH is the result of
                    perfect law. Yet Chrysippus employed all his subtilty to establish the freedom
                    of the will. A nother inconsistency was his reliance on divination, which he
                    strove to explain on a theory of natural causation. The stories of the gods
                    Chrysippus regarded as symbolical myths; and of many of them he attempted
                    ingenious explanations.</p>
                <p>In morals Chrysippus somewhat modified the extreme theory of the earlier Stoics.
                    He admitted between the good and the bad a third class of things—the
                    indifferent, and even avowed that it is foolish not to desire health, and
                    riches, and honour. In practice a man of unsullied purity, he felt bound to
                    conclude, from the theory that the lower animals live according to nature, that
                    incest and many other crimes, and acts so repulsive as the devouring of the
                    bodies of the dead, are natural, and therefore not to be blamed.</p>
