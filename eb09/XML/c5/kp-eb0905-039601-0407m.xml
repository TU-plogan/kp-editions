                    applying himself to medicine. Having finished his studies, he was engaged for a
                    while in teaching Spanish to a young nobleman. He was then appointed tutor to
                    the two sons of a Μ. de la Trousse, grand provost of France. Attached for the
                    next seventeen years to the family of this gentleman, the administration of
                    whose fortune was wholly in his hands, he seems to have published nothing during
                    this period, yet to have acquired a great reputation as a probability. His first
                    work given to the public was a preface for the <hi rend="italic">Adons</hi> of
                    Marini, who printed and published that notorious poem at Paris. This was
                    followed by an excellent translation of Mateo Aleman’s novel, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guzman de Alfarache,</hi> and by four extremely indifferent odes, one of them
                    addressed to the great Richelieu, whom Chapelain had the honour of grounding in
                    the dramatic unities. Rewarded with a pension of a thousand crowns, and
                    appointed from the first a member of the newly-constituted Academy, Chapelain
                    drew up the plan of the grammar and dictionary, the compilation of which was to
                    be a principal function of the young institution, and at Richelieu’s command
                    prepared a criticism of the <hi rend="italic">Cid.</hi> In 1756 he published, in
                    a magnificent form, the first twelve cantos of his celebrated epic <hi
                    rend="italic">La Fuselle,</hi> on which he had been engaged during twenty years.
                    His reputation at this time was so great that six editions of the poem were
                    disposed of in eighteen months. But this was the end of Chapelain, “the legist
                    of Parnassus.” The epigrams of Montdor and Furetière, the slashing satire of
                    Boileau (in this case fairly master of his subject), had done their work, and
                    Chapelain (“le plus grand poète· Français qu’ait jamais été et du plus solide
                    jugement,” as he is called in Colbert’s list) had taken his place among the
                    failures of modern art. The last twelve cantos of <hi rend="italic">La
                    Pusells</hi> never published. A complete manuscript of it exists, with
                    corrections and a preface in the author’s autograph, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliothèque Nationale;</hi> but its readers, it may be presumed, are few.</p>
                <p>In 1662 Chapelain was employed by Colbert to draw up an account of contemporary
                    men of letters, destined to guide the king in his distribution of pensions. In
                    this pamphlet, as in the extracts from his letters published by Camusat in 1726
                    <hi rend="italic">(Mélanges de Littérature tirés des Lettres manuscrites de
                    Chapelain),</hi> he shows to far greater advantage than in his unfortunate epic.
                    His prose is said to be incomparably better than his verse; his criticisms are
                    remarkable for their justice and generosity; his erudition and kindliness of
                    heart are everywhere apparent; the royal attention is directed alike towards the
                    author’s firmest friends and bitterest enemies. The man, indeed, appears to have
                    been as excellent as the poet was worthless. He does not seem to have known
                    jealousy; Corneille was the object of his warmest praises; and to him the young
                    Racine was indebted not only for kindly and seasonable counsel, but also for
                    that pension of six hundred livres which was so useful to him. Moving in the
                    best society, polite and literary, and loaded with honours and pensions, in his
                    old age Chapelain is reported to have become a miser of the most sordid type,
                    the clothes he wore being so patched and clouted as to procure for him the
                    nickname of the Chevalier de 1’Araignée; while Ménage relates that, calling upon
                    the old man after a long estrangement, he found on the hearth the same cinders
                    that he had remarked thereon twelve years before. His avarice, moreover, is said
                    to have been indirectly the cause of his death, which happened in his
                    seventy-ninth year. Some 50,000 crowns, a large fortune for those days, were
                    found in his apartments.</p>
                <p>As a poet, Chapelain seems to occupy on the French side of Parnassus a place
                    analogous to that one filled on the English side by Sir Richard Blackmore. <hi
                    rend="italic">La Pucelle</hi> is an enormous allegorical nightmare, towards a
                    correct appreciation of which the satire of Boileau is said to be the best
                    guide. As a prose-writer and critic, Chapelain seems to have had real merit; in
                    a passage of his, concerning the legendary epic of the Middle Ages, quoted by
                    Sainte-Beuve (who calls him “homme instruit, sinon poète ”), he would appear to
                    have anticipated much of what modern criticism has had to say on the
                    subject.</p>
