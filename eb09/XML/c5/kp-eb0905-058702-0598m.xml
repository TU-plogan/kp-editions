                    says of himself, “at six years, composition at nine; the former I was taught by
                    my father, the latter by Bartholomew Felici and his son Alexander.” Italian
                    music at that time was at a low ebb. The popular composers of <hi rend="italic"
                    >opera</hi><hi rend="italic">seria</hi> chiefly aimed at inventing pleasing
                    tunes and <hi rend="italic">fioriture</hi> for the vocal display of the singers;
                    the dignity and grandeur of the old Italian school were all but lost. To imbue
                    himself with these great traditions of the past was the chief aim of young
                    Cherubini’s ambition, and for that purpose he went in 1777 to Bologna, where for
                    four years he studied under Joseph Sarti, a well-known composer and theorist of
                    the time, and himself the pupil of the celebrated Padre Martini, one of the
                    greatest contrapuntists Italy has produced. It was in this school that Cherubini
                    laid the foundation of that deep knowledge of his art which gives to all his
                    works the impress of perfect mastership. It was also under Sarti’s guidance that
                    he made his first attempts at dramatic composition. They were preceded, however,
                    by a mass written at the age of thirteen, and various other sacred compositions.
                    Sarti was the composer of numerous operas, amongst which <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Nozze di Donina</hi> may be mentioned as the most
                    successful one. It now became Cherubini’s task to supply the music for the minor
                    characters in his master’s dramatic works, an excellent way of gaining
                    versatility of style and resource, turned to full account by the young composer.
                    His first independent work was called <hi rend="italic">Quinto Fabio,</hi> an
                    <hi rend="italic">opera</hi><hi rend="italic">seria,</hi> in three acts, first
                    performed in 1780, and soon followed by <hi rend="italic">Armida</hi> (1782),
                    <hi rend="italic">Adriano in</hi><hi rend="italic">Siria</hi> (same year), and
                    several other works of a similar kind. At this time of his life his artistic
                    individuality was forming gradually; but as yet he had not emerged from the
                    purely imitative stage of production. Absolute artistic value these juvenile
                    works do not possess, but they tended to prepare Cherubini for greater things,
                    and in the meantime secured him a dignified position amongst contemporary
                    composers. In 1784 he was asked to write two works for the Italian opera in
                    London, one of which, <hi rend="italic">Lafinta ρrincipessa,</hi> was favourably
                    received, while the other, <hi rend="italic">Giulio Sabino,</hi> was “murdered”
                    by the critics, to use the emphatic expression of a contemporary witness. In
                    1786 he left London, whither he had gone to be present at the production of his
                    operas, and went to Paris. After a short stay in Italy he took up his permanent
                    residence iu the latter city.</p>
                <p>Cherubini may be cited as a striking instance of the amalgamating power inherent
                    in the French type of national culture; Spontini, Meyerbeer, and to some extent
                    Gluck, submitted to the same spell. With the last-mentioned master Cherubini
                    shares the grand declamatory pathos, the classic dignity which characterizes the
                    Augustan age of French tragedy. A work like Cherubini’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >M'edée</hi> is imbued with the same elevation of pathos which in Corneille’s
                    greatest tragedies makes us forget the stilted affectations of his heroes and
                    heroines. The first opera composed by Cherubini in France is called <hi
                    rend="italic">Demophoon,</hi> words by Marmontel. Its merits were appreciated by
                    connoisseurs, but it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n599/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0599-0588"/> was not a popular success. This, however, was
                    achieved in the most brilliant manner by Cherubini’s next opera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lodoislca</hi> (1791), which opens the series of great dramatic
                    works belonging to the composer’s second period. The representative production
                    of this period is <hi rend="italic">Médxe,</hi> already alluded to. The main
                    characteristics of the composer’s style have also been briefly touched upon.
                    From a mere musical point of view a bold though always strictly logical sequence
                    of harmonies, a rich vein of melodious developments, and great brilliancy and
                    originality of instrumental effects ought to be added.</p>
                <p>By the production of <hi rend="italic">Médée</hi> (1797) the composer’s
                    reputation was firmly established. All Paris was in rapturous admiration of his
                    genius, with one exception— Napoleon Bonaparte. The young victorious general
                    aspired to musical amateurship, and loved to speak authoritatively on that as on
                    most other subjects. But it was not in Cherubini’s character to bow to any man,
                    however great, in matters artistic. Cherubini’s repeated remonstrances against
                    Napoleon’s exaggerated enthusiasm for Paesiello, Zingarelli, and other ephemeral
                    composers culminated in the blunt repartee,—“Citoyen-général, I perceive that
                    you love only that music which does not prevent you from thinking of your
                    politics.” The emperor remembered the affront offered to the citizen-general,
                    and the appointment of Imperial chapelmaster was given to Lesueur, in spite of
                    the Italian composer’s superior merits. But Cherubini does not seem to have
                    suffered much under this disappointment. Two works replete with serenest joy owe
                    their origin to the period alluded to— <hi rend="italic">Anacreon</hi> (1803)
                    and <hi rend="italic">Les deux Journées</hi> (1804). The last-mentioned work is
                    Cherubini’s masterpiece of comic opera. In it we admire the grace and true <hi
                    rend="italic">gaieté de coeur,</hi> which have made the comic opera of France
                    deservedly famous amongst civilized nations. The libretto of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Les deux Journées,</hi> although clever and piquant, does not offer many
                    opportunities for musical expansion, the action, as is usual in French comic
                    opera, being to a great extent carried on in spoken dialogue. But Cherubini has
                    succeeded in delineating with a few graphic touches the import of his characters
                    and situations. A peasant chorus in the third act, a Savoyard’s song, and the
                    couplets of Micheli the jovial water-carrier, are insurpassable specimens of
                    their <hi rend="italic">genre,</hi> equal in melodious beauty and grace to
                    anything that French composers have produced in these forms of art. Cherubini,
                    indeed, ranks with the greatest masters of the French school,—with Gretry,
                    Dalayrac, Auber, and Boieldieu, all of whom he infinitely surpasses as far as
                    musical workmanship is concerned.</p>
                <p>In 1805 Cherubini went to Vienna, in compliance with an invitation to compose an
                    opera for the imperial theatre of that city. Here his chances of success were
                    once more thwarted by his great antagonist Napoleon, who entered Vienna at the
                    head of the victorious French army, and for a time interrupted all artistic
                    enterprise. The personal meeting of emperor and composer was again of anything
                    but a friendly kind. Soon after the performance of his new work <hi
                    rend="italic">Faniska</hi> (1806) at Vienna, Cherubini returned to Paris, and
                    <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> or a long time kept an unbroken silence. His
                    chief occupation was his lessons at the Conservatoire, besides which he filled
                    up great part of the day by cutting the hearts and diamonds of ordinary playing
                    cards into all kinds of fantastic figures and landscapes. The results of his
                    extraordinary ingenuity, carefully framed, covered the walls of his study. An
                    accidental circumstance at last roused him from this morbid indolence. He was
                    staying at a country seat of the Prince de Chimay, where a new church was to be
                    inaugurated. Timidly was an appeal made to him for a religious composition to be
                    performed on the occasion, and in compliance with this request he wrote in a few
                    weeks his .great Mass in F. Thus at a time of life when most artists rest on
                    their laurels he entered a new field of creative labour—that of sacred music. Of
                    the works of Cherubini’s third and perhaps his greatest period only the most
                    important can be mentioned here. They are the Missa Solemnis in D, the
                    coronation mass written for the consecration of Charles X., and the two requiems
                    in C and D, the latter for male voices. Besides these he wrote numerous smaller
                    compositions for the service of the Chapel Royal, most of which are still
                    unpublished. The most striking feature of Cherubini’s sacred compositions is
                    their solemn grandeur of conception, combined with an unequalled mastership of
                    artistic treatment.</p>
                <p>The Restoration of the Bourbons drew Cherubini from his long seclusion. The royal
                    family were eager to show their favour to the opponent of Napoleon Bonaparte.
                    Cherubini was created composer and conductor to the Chapel Royal, and in 1821
                    obtained the permanent directorship of the Conservatoire. His days were
                    prolonged beyond the ordinary age of men, and after having witnessed and partly
                    celebrated numberless revolutions in his adopted country, the more than
                    septuagenarian retained sufficient vigour of mind to write one of his most
                    charming operas when Louis Philippe was king in France. It is called <hi
                    rend="italic">Ali Baba,</hi> and was first performed in 1833. To the list of his
                    dramatic compositions ought also to be added another important opera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Abencerrages,</hi> written in 1813, but treated with
                    undeserved neglect by the public. He also wrote several pieces of chamber music,
                    amongst which six quartets for strings, and one quintet and six sonatas for the
                    pianoforte may be mentioned. A great number of his compositions, moreover,
                    remained in manuscript at his death, March 15, 1842. Cherubini’s external
                    bearing was frequently harsh and arrogant; his prejudice against Beethoven, both
                    personally and artistically, is a deplorable instance of his one-sidedness. But
                    his more intimate friends found him kind and faithful. His love of order was
                    carried to excess. All his music was carefully labelled and distributed in
                    pigeon-holes, and even his pocket-handkerchiefs were numbered for consecutive
                    use. To this extreme carefulness we owe a complete catalogue of his own
                    compositions from 1773-1841, edited by M. Bottée de Toulmon, under the title of
