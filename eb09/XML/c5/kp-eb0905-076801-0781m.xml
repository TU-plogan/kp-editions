                    fine not exceeding £5 or by imprisonment not exceeding two years. The states are
                    mountainous, thinly cultivated, and inhabited for the most part by wild
                    aboriginal tribes. They cover an area of 15,419 square miles, the largest states
                    being Sirgujá and Gangpur. Their aggregate population amounts to 405,980 souls,
                    giving an average of 26 persons to the square mile. No towns exist in the
                    Tributary States, and only three villages contain more than 1000 inhabitants.
                    The following is a brief description of each of the States :—</p>
                <p>(1.) Sirgujá, the largest, lies between 22° 30' and 24° N. lat., and 82° 35 and
                    84° 10 E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the independent state of Rewá and the
                    districts of Mirzápur and Lohárdágá, on the E. by the district of Lohárdágá, on

                    elevated table-lands affording good pasturages, and cut up by numerous ravines.
                    The rivers are the Kanhar, Rer, Mahán, Son, and Santch, the last being formerly
                    known as the Diamond River. Hot springs exist in the state. Extensive <hi
                    rend="italic">sál</hi> forests cover a large area, affording shelter to herds of
                    wild elephants, antelopes, bisons, buffaloes, and many sorts of deer, and also
                    to tigers, bears, and other beasts of prey. The area is 6103 square mues; the
                    population in 1872, 182,831 souls, residing in 1295 villages and 36,463 houses

                    of the estates in Sirgujá in possession of the different members of the chief’s
                    family is £7000; the rental of the personal estate of the Rájá, £3000; the

                <p>(2.) Udaipur lies between 22° 3' and 22° 50' N. lat., and 83° 5' and 83° 50' E.
                    long., and is bounded on the N. by the Mainpát plateau in Sirgujá, on the E. by
                    Jashpur, on the S. by Ráigarh, and on the W. by Biláspur in the Central
                    Provinces. Country hilly, diversified with plains, and possessing one of the

                    the W. by the state of Sirgujá. The country is divided almost equally into high
                    and low lands. The only river of importance is the Eb, in the bed of which
                    diamonds are found, and from time immemorial its sands have been washed for
                    gold. Jashpur iron, smelted by the Kols, is highly prized. Jungles of <hi

                    wild beasts. Jungle products—lac, silk-cocoons, and beeswax, which are exported.

                    district, S. by Sambalpur and Bámrá, and W. by Ráigarh in the Central Provinces.
                    The country is for the most part an undulating plain, broken by detached ranges
                    of hills, one of which, the Mahávíra range, possesses a very remarkable and
                    imposing appearance, springing abruptly from the plain in an irregular wall of
                    tilted and disrupted rock, with two flanking peaks. The rivers are the Eb and
                    the Bráhmaní, formed here by the union of the Sankh and the Koel, both navigable
                    by canoes. The Eb was formerly famous on account of diamonds found in its bed,

                    out of which he pays £50 as tribute to the British Government, the connection of

                <p>(7.) Chang Bhakár state protrudes like a spur into the Rewá territory, which
                    bounds it to the N., W., and S., the eastern side being bounded by the state of
                    Koriá, of which it was formerly a fief. The natural scenery of the country
                    consists of hills, ravines, and plateaus, covered with forests of <hi
                    rend="italic">sál,</hi> with small villages at distant intervals in the jungle.
                    Herds of wild elephants commit sad havoc on the crops, which has caused the
                    desertion of several villages. Area, 906 square miles; population, 8919, viz.,
