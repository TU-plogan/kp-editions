                <p><label type="entry">CANON</label>. The Greek word <hi rend="italic">κανών</hi>
                    means originally a straight rod or pole, and metaphorically what serves to keep
                    a thing upright or straight, a rule. In the New Testament it occurs in Gal. vi.
                    16 and 2 Cor. x. 13,15, 16, signifying in the former passage a measure, in the
                    latter, what is measured, a district. There are three opinions as to the origin
                    of its application to the writings used by the church. According to Semler,
                    Baur, and others, the word lìad originally the sense of list or catalogue—the
                    books publicly read in Christian assemblies. Others, as Steiner, suppose that
                    since the Alexandrian grammarians applied it to collections of old Greek authors
                    as models of excellence or classics, it meant classical (canonical) writings.
                    According to a third opinion, the term included from the first the idea of a
                    regulating principle. This is the more probable, because the same idea lies in
                    the New Testament use of the noun, and pervades its applications in the language
                    of the early Fathers down to the time of Constantine, as Credner has shown.<note

                    fathers thought the Scriptures to be can only be conjectured; it is certain that
                    they believed the Old Testament books to be a divine and infallible guide. But
                    the New Testament was not so considered till towards the close of the 2d
                    century, when the conception of a Catholic Church was realized. The collection
                    of writings was not called <hi rend="italic">Scripture,</hi> or put on a par
                    with the Old Testament as sacred and inspired, till the time of Theophilus of
                    Antioch (about 180 A.D.) Hence Irenaeus applies the epithets divine and perfect
                    to the Scriptures; and Clement of Alexandria calls them inspired.</p>
                <p>When distinctions were made among the Biblical writings other words were
                    employed, synonymous with <hi rend="italic">κανοι&gt; ζομεva</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">κeκavοvισμεva,</hi> such as <hi rend="italic">ίνδοάθηκα,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ωρtσμeva,</hi> The canon was thus a catalogue of writings, forming
                    a rule of truth, sacred, divine, revealed by God for the instruction of men. The
                    rule was perfect for its purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Old Testament Canon.</hi></p>
                <p>The individual who first gave public sanction to a portion of the national Jewish
                    literature was Ezra, who laid the foundation of a canon. He was the leader in
                    restoring the theocracy after the exile, “a ready scribe in the law of Moses,
                    who had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to teach in Israel
                    statutes and judgments.” The question how far Ezra was also the redactor of the
                    Pentateuch, or made additions to it, will be discussed in its <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n11/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0011-0002"/> proper place (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pentateuch).</hi> Here it is sufficient to observe that the public authority he
                    conferred on the Law is the first step in the formation of the canon.</p>
                <p>After the first collection was made attention was directed to other national
                    documents. Of these the prophetic books were the most conspicuous; and the order
                    of men from whom they came, or whose names they bore, stood out in a favourable
                    light, when looked back at from the restored theocracy, because many of their
                    predictions had been fulfilled. Exhortations and warnings, which had often
                    fallen upon listless ears, had been verified by experience. A desire to gather
                    together the earlier prophetic writings would naturally accompany or follow the
                    zeal displayed in bringing forth the Pentateuch to public view. Hence the
                    historical books of the nation which described the divine guidance of the
                    people, as well as the kings under whom the earliest prophets lived
                    (Joshua—Kings), were first adopted.</p>
                <p>This second canon originated with Nehemiah, of whom it is said in the second book
                    of Maccabees, that, when founding a library, “he gathered together the acts of
                    the kings, and the prophets, and the (Psalms) of David, and the epistles of the
                    kings concerning the holy gifts.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Chan, it 13.</p></note> These words, though somewhat
                    ambiguous, and admitting different explanations, present an historical statement
                    which should not be summarily rejected, as it is by Graetz. “The Acts of the
                    Kings” contained the two books of Kings (including those now called after
                    Samuel), with Joshua and Judges, of which last Ruth was the concluding part; for
                    Joshua was now separate from the Mosaic books, with which it was closely
                    connected at first. This historical portion was the proper continuation of
                    Ezra’s canon. The “Prophets” comprehended the four greater and twelve minor
                    ones. Not all the latter, however; for Jonah is of subsequent date. Lamentations
                    were united to Jeremiah as one book. The “Psalms of David” also belong to this
                    canon, and may have been almost coextensive with the first three divisions of
                    the present book. The epistles of the kings concerning the holy gifts are not
                    extant. They appear to have been the documents of heathen (Persian for the most
                    part) kings favourable to the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its temple. Nehemiah’s
                    canon was identical to some extent with the second division of the Biblical
                    books. It wanted Jonah, perhaps Malachi, but it had “the Epistles of the kings.”
                    It was larger than the second Hebrew division of the Old Testament, and had
                    probably been preceded by smaller collections of prophetic productions before
                    the captivity. We know that in the captivity itself, and immediately after,
                    older prophecies were edited.</p>
                <p>Whether Nehemiah himself collected the books, or whether he merely set the thing
                    on foot and saw that it was carried out by the learned men of the time, can only
                    be conjectured. As he was not a priest or a scribe like Ezra, but a statesman,
                    the latter supposition is the more probable. This collection was highly
                    esteemed; though it did not take equal rank with the first. It was not completed
                    before the close of the 4th century B.C., because the book of Jonah was probably
                    not written till that time. The close of the prophetic canon could not have
                    taken place till some period had elapsed after Malachi,—a period sufficient for
                    the growth of a general consciousness that the prophetic function had ceased
                    with the youngest of the prophets. Besides the historical books which preceded,
                    there were in it four prophetic ones—Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah, the twelve minor
                    prophets. Ruth belonged to the book of Judges, and Lamentations to Jeremiah; but
                    they were afterwards detached and put into the third division or canon. Definite
                    allusions to this prophetic collection do not occur till the 2d century B.c.
                    Daniel speaks of a passage in Jeremiah being in “the books” or “writings;”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>ix. 2.</p></note> and Sirach,
                    both in the prologue and the 49th chapter, presupposes its completion. Such was
                    the second or Nehemiah canon, partly gradual in its formation.</p>
                <p>The third canon, in which the other books of the Old Testament were included, was
                    not made at unce. Its contents were multifarious, differing widely from one
                    another in age and character—poetical, prophetic, didactic, historical. Such as
                    seemed worthy of preservation, though they had not been included in the second
                    canon, were gathered together during the space of a hundred and fifty years. The
                    oldest part consisted of psalms supposed to belong to David, which were a
                    supplement to those in Nehemiah’s collection,—perhaps the last two divisions,
                    with some exceptions (books fourth and fifth). Next to the Psalms were Proverbs,
                    Job, Canticles, which, though non-prophetic, and probably excluded on that
                    account from the sacred canon, must have existed before the exile. Enriched with
                    the latest additions, they survived the national disasters, and claimed a place
                    next to the Psalms. They were but a portion of the literature current in and
                    after the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> as may be inferred from
                    the epilogue to Ecclesiastes and the Wisdom of Sirach. The historical work
                    compiled by the chronicle-writer was separated, Ezra being put first as the most
                    important part and referring also to the church of the 6th and 5th centuries,
                    whose history had not been written. The Chronicles themselves were placed last,
                    being considered of less value than the first part, as they contained the
                    summary of a period already described, though with numerous adaptations to
                    post-exile times. The youngest portion consisted of the book of Daniel, not
                    written till the Maccabean period (between 170 and 160 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>); and probably of several psalms which were inserted in different
                    places of the collection so as to make the whole number 150. The list continued
                    open, and no stringent principle guided selection. The character of the
                    collection was somewhat indefinite. It was called <hi rend="italic">c</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">tubim, i.e.,</hi>

                    suited to the contents.</p>
                <p>The earliest attestation of this third canon is that of the prologue to Jesus
                    Sirach, where not only <hi rend="italic">the law and the prophets</hi> are
                    specified, but “the other books of the fathers,” or “the rest of the

                    the particular books included. They may have been for thé most part the same as
                    the present ones. The passage does not show that the third list was closed. The
                    better writings of the fathers, such as tended to learning and wisdom, are not
                    excluded by the definite article. In like manner, neither Philo nor the New
                    Testament gives exact information as to the contents of the division in
                    question. Indeed, several books (Canticles, Esther, Ecclesiastes), are unnoticed
                    in the latter. The argument drawn from Matthew xxiii. 35, that the Chronicles
                    were then the last book of the canon, is inconclusive, as the Zechariah there
                    named was probably different from the Zechariah in 2 Chronicles xxiv. The third
                    canon is not proved to be closed by any of these witnesses, much less by a
                    passage of 2 Maccabees ii. 14, which is sometimes adduced for the purpose.</p>
                <p>A more definite testimony respecting the canon is given by Josephus towards the
                    end of the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> “For we have not an

                    reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, the prophets who were after Moses wrote down
                    what was done in their times in thirteen books. The remaining four books contain
                    hymns to God and precepts for the conduct of human life. It is true our history
                    has been written since Artaxerxes very particularly, but has not been esteemed
                    of the like authority with the former by our forefathers, because there has not
                    been an exact succession of prophets since that time: and how firmly we have
                    given credit to these books of our own nation is evident by what we do; for
                    during so many ages as have already passed, no one has been so bold as either to
                    add anything to them, to take anything from them, or to make any change in them;
                    but it has become natural to all Jews immediately and from their very birth, to
                    esteem these books to contain divine doctrines, and to persist in them, and, if
                    occasion be, willingly to die for them.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Palestinian Jews were tolerably unanimous as to the extent of the collection.
                    The thirteen prophets include Job; the four lyric and moral books are Psalms,
                    Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Canticles.</p>
                <p>The canon, however, was not considered to be closed in the 1st century before and
                    the 1st after Christ. There were doubts about some portions. The book of Ezekiel
                    gave offence, because some of its statements seemed to contradict the law.
                    Doubts about others were of a more serious nature,—about Ecclesiastes, the
                    Canticles, Esther, and the Proverbs. The first was impugned because it had
                    contradictory passages and a heretical tendency; the second, because of its
                    worldly and sensual tone; Esther for its want of religiousness; and Proverbs on
                    account of inconsistencies. This scepticism went far to procure the exclusion of
                    the suspected works from the canon, and their relegation to the class of the <hi

                    to the fixity of the canon were not the last. They reappeared about 65 A.υ <hi

                    upon the canonicity of Ecclesiastes, which the school of Shammai, who had the

                    when R. Eleaser ben Asaria was chosen patriarch, and Gamaliel the second
                    deposed. Here it was decided, not unanimously, however, but by a majority of
                    Hillelites, that Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs “pollute the hands,” t.e.,
                    belong properly to the Hagiographa. This was about 90 A.D.<note anchored="true"

                    pp. 162, 163.</p></note> Thus the question of the canonicity of certain books
                    was discussed at two synods. The canon was virtually settled at Jamnia, where
                    was confirmed what R. Akiba said of the Canticles in his usual extravagant way:
                    “No day in the whole history of the world is of so much worth as the one in
                    which the Song of Songs was given to Israel; for all the Scriptures are holy;
                    but the Song of Songs is most holy.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    later books loses all part in everlasting life.” can have no weight.</p></note>
                    As the Hagiographa were not read in public, with the exception of Esther,
                    opinions of the Jewish rabbins -might still differ about Canticles and
                    Ecclesiastes, even after the synod at Jamnia.</p>
                <p>J ewish literature began to degenerate after the captivity, and it continued to
                    do so. It leant upon the past more and more, having an external and formal
                    character with little of the living souk The independence of their religious
                    literature disappeared with the national independence of the J ews; and the
                    genius of the people was too exclusive to receive much expansion from the spirit
                    of nations with whom they came in contact. In such circumstances, amid the
                    general consciousness of present misfortune, which the hope of a brighter future
                    could not dispel, and regretful retrospects of the past tinged with ideal
                    splendour, the exact time of drawing a line between books that might be included
                    in the third division of the canon must have been arbitrary. In the absence of a
                    normal principle to determine selection, the productions were arbitrarily
                    separated. Not that they were badly adjusted. On the contrary, the canon as ∙a
                    whole was wisely settled, Yet the critical spirit of learned Jews in the future
                    could not be extinguished by anticipation. The canon was not really settled for
                    all time by a synodical gathering at Jamnia; for Sirach was added to the
                    Hagiographa by some rabbins about the beginning of the 4th century;<note

                    considerable time, possessing a kind of canonical credit even among the learned
                    Jews of Palestine. Rab, Jochanan, Elasar, Rabba bar Mare, occasionally refer to
                    Sirach in the way in which the <hi rend="italic">dtubim</hi> were quoted; the
                    writer of Daniel used Baruch; and the translator of Jeremiah put it into
                    Greek.</p>
                <p>With the formation of the canon we may now connect the labours of the Great
                    Synagogue, so far as Jewish authorities present credible information regarding
                    it. The Talmudic and other accounts are legendary in part, and also incorrect.
                    Little as is known of its members or doings, some idea may be gathered from
                    scattered notices about it as well as from analogy.</p>
                <p>The oldest notice of the Great Synagogue is that in the Pirke Aboth, about 200
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> where it is said that “Moses received the law
                    from Mount Sinai and delivered it to Joshua, Joshua to the elders, the elders to
                    the prophets, and the prophets delivered it to the men of the Great Synagogue. .
                    These last spake three words: Be cautious in pronouncing judgment; make many
                    disciples; put a hedge about the law.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    his book and Judges and Ruth. David wrote the psalms of the ten elders, &lt;tc.,

                <p>As Ezra is called “a ready scribe,” and his labours in connection with the law
                    were important, he may have organized a body of scribes who should work in
                    harmony, attending, among other concerns, to the preservation and correction of
                    the national literature. It must be admitted, however, that the priests
                    enumerated in Nehemiah x. 1, &lt;fcc., and the “company of scribes”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sυvαγωγ∙⅛ <hi rend="italic"

                    ii. 42), afford no basis for such a college. Still, there is nothing improbable
                    in the hypothesis. A succession of scribes and priests, if not conjointly, at
                    least in harmony, continued to labour till the corporation ceased to exist with
                    Simon the Just, who is mentioned as the last belonging to it, t.e., from 444 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> till about 200. What they did can only be inferred
                    from the proceedings of Ezra himself, and from the prevailing views as well as
                    wants of the times they lived in. Those who began with Ezra, seeing what he did,
                    would naturally follow his example, and would not scruple, if it seemed best, to
                    revise the text in substance; but their chief work related to the form of the
                    text. After the last canon was made, about a century or more anterior to the
                    Christian era, the text was not considered inviolate by the learned Jews; it
                    received modifications and interpolations long after. The process of redaction
                    had not ceased before the time of Christ. This was owing, among other causes, to
                    the state of parties among the Jews, as well as the intrusion of Greek
                    literature and culture, whose influence the Palestinian Jews themselves were not
                    able to withstand altogether.</p>
                <p>The canon did not include all the national literature; and if it be asked on what
                    principle books were admitted, it is not easy to answer. The higher the value of
                    the writings, the more conducive to the religious life and advancement of the
                    people, they were the more readily accepted. Real or apparent importance
                    determined their adoption. In judging of their value different considerations
                    weighed. Some were regulative in the department of the legal and ethical; the
                    prophetic claimed a divine origin; the lyric or poetic touched and elevated the
                    ideal faculty on which religion acts. The nation, early imbued with the
                    theocratic spirit, and believing itself the chosen of God, was favourably
                    inclined toward documents in which that stand-point was assumed. The names of
                    men renowned for their piety, wisdom, or knowledge of divine things, which some
                    books bore, ensured their admission. A variety of considerations contributed to
                    the gradual formation of the canon; and the best part of the national literature
                    was incorporated.</p>
                <p>Of the three divisions, “The Law” or Pentateuch was most highly venerated by the
                    Jews. It was the first translated into Greek, and in Philo’s view was inspired
                    in a way peculiar to itself. “The Prophets,” or second division, occupied a
                    somewhat lower place in their estimation, but were read in the public services
                    as the law had been before. The <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >C'thubim,'</hi> ’ or third division, was not looked upon as equal to the
                    Prophets in importance; only the five Megilothwere publicly read. The three
                    parts of the collection present the three gradations of sanctity which the books
                    assumed successively in Israelite estimation. A certain reverence was attached
                    to all as soon as they were made canonical; but the reverence was not of equal
                    height, and the supposed authority was proportionately varied.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dillmann, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jahrbücher für deutsche Theologie,</hi> Bd. iii. p.
                    422.</p></note> The consciousness of prophetism being extinct soon after the
                    return from Babylon was a genuine instinct. With the extinction of the Jewish
                    state the religious spirit almost evaporated. The idealism which the old
                    prophets proclaimed in contrast with the symbolic religion of the state gave
                    place to forms and an attachment to the written law. Religion came to be a thing
                    of the understanding, the subject of learned treatment; and its essence was
                    reduced to dogmas or precepts. Thus it ceased to be spiritual, or a thing in
                    which the heart had free scope for its highest aspirations. The narrow
                    prophetism that appeared after the restoration was little more than an echo of
                    the past, falling in with an external and written legalism. The literature of
                    the people deteriorated in quality, and prophecy became apocalypse.</p>
                <p>When the three divisions were united, the ecclesiastical respect which had
                    gathered round the law and the prophets from ancient times began to be
                    transferred to the <hi rend="italic">dthubim.</hi> A belief in their sanctity
                    increased apace in the 1st century before the Christian era, so that <hi
                    rend="italic">sacredness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">caηoηicity</hi> were almost
                    identical. The doubts of individuals, it is true, were still expressed
                    respecting certain books of the <hi rend="italic">dthubirn,</hi> but they had no
                    perceptible effect upon the current opinion. The sanctity attaching to the last
                    division as well as the others did not permit the total displacement of any
                    part.</p>
                <p>The origin of the threefold division of the canon is not, as Oehler supposes<note

                    religious development through which the nation passed, as if the foundation were
                    the Law, the ulterior tendency in its objective aspect the Prophets, and its
                    subjective aspect the Hagiographa. The books of Chronicles and others refute
                    this arbitrary conception. The triplicity lies in the manner in which the books
                    were collected. Men who belonged to different periods and possessed different
                    degrees of culture worked successively in the formation of the canon. It
                    resulted out of the circumstances in which it was made, and the subjective
                    ideas, of those who made it.</p>
                <p>The places of the separate books within the first division or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Torah</hi> were determined by the succession of the historical events narrated.
                    The second division naturally begins with Moses’s successor, Joshua. Judges,
                    Samuel, and Kings follow according to the regular chronology. To the former
                    prophets, as Joshua to Kings were called, the latter were attached, Isaiah,
                    Jeremiah, and Ezekiel,—succeeded by the twelve minor prophets, arranged for the
                    most part according to their times, though the length of individual prophecies
                    also influenced their position, together with similarity of contents. The
                    arrangement of books in the third division depended on their age, character, and
                    authors. The Psalms were put first, because David was supposed to be the author
                    of many, and on account of their intrinsic value in promoting the religious life
                    of the people. After the Psalms came the three poetical works attributed to
                    Solomon, with the book of Job among them,—Proverbs, J ob, Canticles,
                    Ecclesiastes. The book of Esther followed, since it was intended to further the
                    observance of the Purim feast; with the late book of Daniel, which had some
                    affinity to Esther in its relation to heathenism and to Greek life. To Ezra and
                    Nehemiah, which were adopted before the other part of the chronicle-book and
                    separated from it, were added the so-called Chronicles. Such was the original
                    succession of the third division or <hi rend="italic">dthubim</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but it did not remain unaltered. For the use of the
                    synagogue the five Megiloth were put together, so that Ruth (originally the last
                    part of Judges), and the Lamentations (appended at first to Jeremiah’s
                    prophecies) were taken out of the second and put into the third canon. This
                    caused a separation of Canticles and Ecclesiastes.</p>

                <p>This restricted collection is owing to the fact that, when the Samaritans
                    separated from the Jews and began their worship on Gerizim, no more than the
                    'Mosaic writings had been invested by Ezra with canonical dignity. The hostile
                    feeling between the rivals hindered the reception of books subsequently
                    canonized. The idea of their having the oldest and most sacred part in its
                    entirety satisfied their spiritual wants. Some have thought that the Sadducees,
                    who already existed as a party before the Maccabean period, agreed with the
                    Samaritans in rejecting all but the Pentateuch; yet this is doubtful. It is true
                    that the Samaritans themselves say so;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    church fathers, Origen, Jerome, and others agree; but little reliance can be put
                    on the statement. The latter, perhaps, confounded the Samaritans and Sadducees.
                    It is also noteworthy that Christ, in refuting the Sadducees, appeals to the
                    Pentateuch alone; but the conclusion that he did so because of their admitting
                    no more than that portion does not follow</p>
                <p>The Alexandrian canon differed from the Palestinian. The Greek translation
                    commonly called the Septuagint contains some later productions which the
                    Palestinian Jews did not adopt, not only from their aversion to Greek literature
                    generally, but also from the recent origin of the books, and perhaps their want
                    of prophetic sanction. The closing line of the third part in the Alexandrian
                    canon was more or less fluctuating—capable of admitting recent writings
                    appearing under the garb of old names and histories, or embracing religious
                    subjects; while the Palestinian collection was pretty well determined, and all
                    but finally settled. The judgment of the Alexandrians was freer than that of
                    their brethren in the mother country. They had even separated in a measure from
                    the latter, by erecting a temple at Leontopolis; and their enlargement of the
                    canon was another step of divergence. The influence of Greek learn ing and
                    philosophy led to a more liberal treatment of Jewish books. Nor had they the
                    criterion of language for the separation of canonical and uncanonical; both
                    classes were before them in the same tongue. The enlarged canon was not formally
                    sanctioned; it had not the approval of the Sanhedrim; yet it was to the
                    Alexandrians what the Palestinian one was to the Palestinians. If Jews who were
                    not well acquainted with Hebrew used the apocryphal and canonical books alike,
                    it was a matter of feeling and custom; and if those who knew the old language
                    better adhered to the canonical one more closely, it was a matter of tradition
                    and language. The former set little value on the prevalent consciousness of the
                    race that the spirit of prophecy was extinct; their view of the Spirit’s
                    operation was larger. The latter clung to the past with all the more tenacity
                    that the old life of the nation had degenerated. The identity of the Palestinian
                    and Alexandrian canons must be abandoned. It is said, indeed, that Philo neither
                    mentions nor quotes the Greek additions; but neither does he quote several
                    canonical books. According to Eichhorn, no fewer than eight of the latter are
                    unnoticed by him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    he had peculiar views of inspiration, and quoted loosely from memory. Believing
                    as he did in the inspiration of the Greek version as a whole, it is difficult to
                    think that he made a distinction between the different parts of it. The argument
                    for the identity of the two canons deduced from 4 Esdras xiv. 44, &lt;fcc., as
                    if the twenty-four open books were distinguished from the other writings
                    dictated to Ezra, is of no force, both because the reading is uncertain and,
                    even if seventy be distinguished from twenty-four in the passage, verisimilitude
                    required that an Egyptian Jew himself must make Ezra conform to the old
                    Palestinian canon. It is also alleged that the grandson of Jesus Sirach, who
                    translated his grandfather’s work during his abode in Egypt, knew no difference
                    between the Hebrew and Greek canon, though he speaks of the Greek version; he
                    speaks as a Palestinian, without having occasion to allude to the difference
                    between the canonical books of the Palestinian and Egyptian Jews. The latter may
                    have reckoned the apocryphal writings in the third division; and therefore the
                    translator of Jesus Sirach could recognize them in the ordinary classification.
                    The mention of three classes is not opposed to their presence in the third. The
                    general use of an enlarged canon in Egypt cannot be denied, though it was
                    somewhat loose, was not regarded as a completed collection, and wanted express
                    rabbinical sanction. The very way in which apocryphal are inserted among
                    canonical books in the Alexandrian canon, shows the equal rank assigned to both.
                    Esdras first and second succeed the Chronicles; Tobit and Judith are between
                    Nehemiah and Esther; the Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach follow Canticles; Baruch
                    succeeds Jeremiah; Daniel is followed by Susanna and other productions of the
                    same class; and the whole closes with the three books of Maccabees. Such is the
                    order in the Vatican MS.</p>
                <p>The threefold division of the canon, indicating three stages in its formation,
                    has continued. Josephus, indeed, gives another, based on the nature of the
                    separate books, not on MSS. We learn nothing from him of its history, which is
                    somewhat remarkable, considering that he did not live two centuries after the
                    last work had been added. The account of the canon’s final arrangement was
                    unknown to him. The number of the books was variously estimated. Josephus gives
                    twenty-two, which was the usual number among Christian writers in the 2d, 3d,
                    and 4th centuries, having been derived from the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.
                    Origen, Jerome, and others have it. It continued longest among the teachers of
                    the Greek Church, and is even in Nicephoros's stichometry.<note anchored="true"

                    enlarged with the five final letters, and dividing Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles

                    from Alexandria. After the Pentateuch and the former prophets, which are in the
                    usual order, it gives Jeremiah as the first of the later, succeeded by Ezekiel
                    and Isaiah with the twelve minor prophets. The Talmud knows no other reason for
                    such an order than that it was made according to the contents of the prophetic
                    books, not according to the times of the writers. This solution is
                    unsatisfactory. It is more probable that chronology had to do with the
                    arrangement.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Fürst,

                    the Psalter, coming as near the former prophets as possible; for it properly
                    belongs to them, the contents associating it with the Judges’ time. The Talmudic

                    division is given by the New Testament (Luke xxiv. 44; Matthew xxiii. 35),
                    agreeably to which the Psalms were first and the Chronicles last; but this is
                    inconclusive.</p>
                <p>The Alexandrian translators, as we have seen already, placed the books
                    differently from the Palestinian Jews. In their version Daniel comes after
                    Ezekiel, so that it is put beside the greater prophets. Was this done by Jews or
                    Christians î Perhaps by the latter, who put it between the greater and lesser
                    prophets, or, in other words, out of the third into the second division, because
                    of dogmatic grounds, and so effaced a trace of the correct chronology. Little
                    importance, however, can be attached to the order of the books in the
                    Septuagint, because the work was done at different times by different persons.
                    But whatever may have been the arrangement of the parts when the whole was
                    complete, we know that it was disturbed by Protestants separating the apocryphal
                    writings and putting them all together.</p>
                <p>The writings of the New Testament show their authors’ acquaintance with the
                    apocryphal books. They have expressions and ideas derived from them. Stier

                    scarcely conclusive; else Esther, Canticles, Ecclesiastes, and other works might
                    be equally discredited. Yet it is probable that the New Testament writers,
                    though quoting the Septuagint much more than the original, were disinclined to
                    the additional parts of the Alexandrian canon. They were Palestinian themselves,
                    or had in view Judaizers of a narrow creed. The apostle Paul, at least, and
                    probably the other writers of the New Testament, believed in the literal
                    inspiration of the Biblical books, for he uses an argument in the Galatian
                    epistle which turns upon the singular or plural of a noun.<note anchored="true"

                    Septuagint translators was commonly held by the Christians of the early
                    centuries, it may be that the apostles and evangelists made no distinction
                    between its parts. Jude quotes Enoch, an apocryphal work not in the Alexandrian
                    canon; so that he at least had no rigid notions about the difference of
                    canonical and uncanonical writings. Still we know that the compass of the Old
                    Testament canon was somewhat unsettled to the Christians of the 1st century, as
                    it was to the Hellenist Jews themselves. It is true that the Law, the Prophets,
                    and the Psalms were universally recognized as authoritative; but the extent of
                    the third division was indefinite, so that the non-citation of the three books
                    respecting which there was a difference of opinion among the Jews may not have
                    been accidental. Inasmuch, however, as the Greek-speaking Jews received more
                    books than their Palestinian brethren, the apostles and their immediate
                    successors were not disinclined to the use of the apocryphal productions. The
                    undefined boundary of the canon facili tated the recognition of other sacred
                    writings, such as the primitive records of the new revelation.</p>
                <p>The early fathers used the Greek Bible, as almost all of them were ignorant of
                    Hebrew. Thus restricted, they naturally considered its parts alike, citing
                    apocryphal and canonical in the same way. Accordingly, Irenaeus (t 202) quotes
                    Baruch under the name of “Jeremiah the prophet;”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The first Christians relied on the Old Testament as their chief religious book.
                    To them it was of divine origin and authority The New Testament writings came
                    into gradual use by the side of the older Jewish documents, according to the
                    times in which they appeared and the reputed names of the authors.</p>
                <p>When Marcion came from Pontus to Rome (144 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> he
                    brought with him a Scripture-collection consisting of ten Pauline epistles.
                    Those addressed to Timothy and Titus, with the epistle to the Hebrews, were not
                    in it. The gospel of Marcion was Luke’s in an altered state. From this and other
                    facts we conclude thàt external parties were the first who carried out the idea
                    of collecting Christian writings, and of putting them either beside or over
                    against the sacred books of the Old Testament, in support of their systems. As
                    to Basilides (125 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> his supposed quotations from
                    the New Testament in Hippolytus are too precarious to be trusted.<note

                    Isidore and succeeding disciples used Matthew’s gospel. Jerome says that Marcion
                    and Basilides denied the Pauline authorship of the epistle to the Hebrews and
                    the pastoral ones.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    doubtful whether Valentinus’s (140-166) alleged citations from the New Testament
                    can be relied upon. The passages of this kind ascribed to him by the fathers
                    belong in a great measure to his disciples; and Henrici has not proved his
                    position that he used John’s gcspel. But hjs followers, including Ptolemy (180
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> and Heracleon (185-200), quote the gospels and
                    other portions of the New Testament. From Hippolytus’s account of the Ophites,
                    Peratae, and Sethians, we infer that the Christian writings were much employed
                    by them. An apocryphal work they rarely cite. More than 160 citations from the
                    New Testament have been gathered out of their writings.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the Indexes to Duncker and Schneidewin’s
                    edition.</p></note> We may admit that these Ophites and Peratae were of early
                    origin, the former being the oldest known of the Gnostic parties; but there is
                    no proof that the acquaintance with the New Testament which Hippolytus
                    attributes to them belongs to the first rather than the second half of the 2d
                    century. The early existence of the sect does not show an early citation of the
                    Christian books by it, especially of John’s gospel; unless its primary were its
                    last stage. Later and earlier Ophites are not distinguished in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophumena.</hi> Hence there is a presumption that the author
                    had the former in view, which is favoured by no mention of them occurring in the
                    “Adversus omnes Haereses” usually appended to Tertullian’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proeseriptiones Hoeretieomm,</hi> and by Irenaeus’s derivation of their heresy
                    from that of Valentinus. The latter father does not even speak of the Peratae.
                    Clement of Alexandria is the first who alludes to them. The early heretics were
                    desirous of confirming their peculiar opinions by the writings current among
                    catholic Christians, so that the formation of a canon by them began soon after
                    the commencement of the 2d century, and continued till the end of
                    it,—contemporaneously with the development of a catholic church and its
                    necessary adjunct a catholic canon.</p>
                <p>No New Testament canon, except a partial and unauthoritative one, existed till
                    the latter half of the 2d century, that is, till the idea of a catholic church
                    began to be entertained. The Ebionites or Jewish Christians had their favourite
                    gospels and Acts. The gospel of Matthew was highly prized by them, existing as
                    it did in various recensions. Other documents, such as the Revelation of John,
                    and the Preaching of Peter, (a Jewish-Christian history subsequently re-written
                    and employed in the Clementine Recognitions and Homilies) were also in esteem.
                    Even so late as 170-175, Hegesippus, a Jewish Christian, used the gospel
                    according to the Hebrews and despised Paul’s writings, in conformity with the
                    leading principle of the party to which he belonged, viz., the identity of
                    Jesus’s words with the Old Testament. The Clementine Homilies (161-180) used the
                    four canonical gospels, even the fourth, which they assign to the apostle John.
                    The gospel according to the Egyptians was also employed. Paul’s epistles were
                    rejected, of course, as well as the Acts; since the apostle of the Gentiles was
                    pointed at in Simon Magus, whom Peter refutes. It is, therefore, obvious that a
                    collection of the New Testament writings could make little progress among the
                    Ebionites of the 2d century. Their reverence for the Law and the Prophets
                    hindered another canon. Among the Gentile Christians the forma tion of a canon
                    took place more rapidly, though Judaic influences retarded it even there. After
                    Paul’s epistles were interchanged between churches a few of them would soon be
                    put together. A collection of this kind is implied in 2 Peter iii. 16.</p>
                <p>The apostolic fathers quote from the Old Testament, to them an inspired and
                    sacred thing. They have scarcely any express citations from the New Testament.
                    <hi rend="italic">Allusions</hi> occur, especially to the epistles. The letter
                    of Clement to the Corinthians (about 120) does not use written gospels, though
                    it presupposes an acquaintance with the epistles to the Romans, Corinthians, and
                    Hebrews. Where “Scripture” is cited, or the expression “it is written” occurs,
                    the Old Testament is meant.</p>
                <p>Hermas (about 130) seems to have used the epistles to the Ephesians· and Hebrews,
                    those of James and 1 Peter, perhaps, too, the Acts; but there is great
                    uncertainty about the matter, and he has no express quotation from any part of
                    the New Testament. The writer often alludes to words of Jesus found in Matthew’s
                    gospel, so that he may have been acquainted with it.</p>
                <p>Barnabas 'about 119) has but one quotation from the New Testament, if, indeed, it
                    be such. Apparently, Matthew xx. 16 is introduced by “it is written,” showing
                    that the gospel was considered Scripture. This is the earliest trace of
                    canonical authority, being transferred from the Old Testament to Christian
                    writings.</p>
                <p>As far as we can judge from Eusebius’s account of Papias<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Hist. Eccles.,</hi> iii.
                    39.</p></note> (+163), that writer knew nothing of a New Testament canon. He
                    speaks of Matthew and Mark; but whether he had their present gospels is
                    uncertain. According to Andreas of Caesarea he was acquainted with the
                    Apocalypse of John, while Eusebius testifies to his knowledge of 1 Peter and 1
                    John. But he seems to have had no conception of canonical authority attaching to
                    any part of the New Testament.</p>
                <p>Traces of later ideas about the canonicity of the New Testament appear in the
                    shorter Greek recension of the seven Ignatian epistles (about 175). There “the
                    Gospel” and “the Epistles” are recognized as the constituents of the book.<note

                    gospel, perhaps the so-called gospel of the Hebrews. He had also the older Acts
                    of Pilate. Paul’s epistles are never mentioned, though he doubtless knew them.
                    Having little sympathy with Paulinism he attached his belief to the primitive
                    apostles. The Apocalypse, 1 Peter, and 1 John he esteemed highly; the epistle to
                    the Hebrews and the Acts he treated in the same way as the Pauline writings.
                    Justin’s canon, as far as divine authority and inspiration are concerned, was
                    the Old Testament. He was merely on the threshold of a divine canon made up of
                    primitive Christian writings, attaching no exclusive sanctity to those he used,
                    because they were not to him the only source of doctrine. Even of the Apocalypse

                    divinely authoritative; and the use of the epistles, which formed the second and
                    less valued part of the collection, must still have been limited.</p>
                <p>Justin’s disciple, Tatian (160-180), who wrote an address to the Greeks, quotes

                    canonical ones: but too little is known of it to enable us to speak with
                    certainty. Doubtless he was acquainted with Paul’s writings, as he quotes
                    statements contained in them. He seems, however, to have rejected several of his
                    epistles, probably 1 and 2 Timothy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    was his only authoritative canon. He makes no reference to the Christian
                    documents, but adduces words of Jesus with the verb “he says.” His treatise on
                    the resurrection appeals to a passage in one of Paul’s epistles.<note

                    it was done was by raising the apostolic writings higher and higher till they
                    were of equal authority with the Old Testament, so that the church might have a
                    rule of appeal. The Old Testament was not brought down to the New; the New was
                    raised to the Old. It is clear that the earliest church fathers did not use the
                    books of the New Testament as sacred documents clothed with divine authority,
                    but followed for the most part, at least till the middle of tho second century,
                    apostolic tradition orally transmitted. They were not solicitous about a canon
                    circumscribed within certain limits.</p>
                <p>In the second half, then, of the second century there was a canon of the New
                    Testament consisting of two parts called <hi rend="italic">the gospel</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(to</hi> eυαγγ∈λιov) and <hi rend="italic">the apostle</hi> (ò
                    απόστολος). The first was complete, containing the four gospels alone; the
                    second, which was incomplete, contained the Acts of the Apostles and epistles,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> thirteen letters of Paul, one of Peter, one of
                    John, and the Revelation. How and where this canon originated is uncertain. Its
                    birthplace may have been Asia Minor, like Marcion’s; but it may have grown about
                    the same time in Asia Minor, Alexandria, and Western Africa. At all events,
                    Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian speak „of its two parts; and the
                    three agree in recognizing its existence.</p>
                <p>Irenaeus had a canon which he adopted as apostolic. In his view it was of binding
                    force and authoritative. This contained the four gospels, the Acts, thirteen
                    epistles of Paul, the first epistle of John, and the Revelation. He had also a
                    sort of appendix or deuterocanon (which he highly esteemed, without putting it
                    on a par with the received collection), consisting of John’s second epistle, the
                    first of Peter, and the Shepherd of Hermas. The last he calls a “Scripture”
                    because it was prophetic.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Clement’s collection was more extended than Irenaeus’s. His appendix or
                    deutero-canon included the epistle to the Hebrews, 2 John, Jude, the Apocalypse
                    of Peter, the Shepherd of Hermas, the epistles of Clement and Barnabas. He
                    recognizes no distinction between the New Testament writings except by the more
                    frequent use of those generally received, and the degree of importance attached
                    to them. Yet Barnabas is cited as an apostle.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Tertullian’s canon consisted of the gospels, Acts, thirteen epistles of Paul, the
                    Apocalypse, and 1 John. As an appendix he had the epistle to the Hebrews, that
                    of Jude, the Shepherd of Hermas, 2 John probably, and 1 Peter. This
                    deutero-canon was not regarded as authoritative. No trace occurs in his works of
                    James’s epistle, 2 Peter, and 3 John. He used the Shepherd, but thought little
                    of it, with the Montanists in general.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>These three fathers did not fix the canon absolutely. Its limits were still
                    unsettled. But they sanctioned most of the books now accepted as divine, putting
                    some extra-canonical productions almost on the same level with the rest, at
                    least in practice.</p>
                <p>The canon of Muratori is a fragmentary list which was made towards the end of the
                    2d century (170). Its birthplace is uncertain, though there are traces of Roman
                    origin. Its translation from the Greek is assumed; but that is uncertain. It
                    begins with the four gospels in the usual order, and proceeds to the Acts,
                    thirteen epistles of Paul, the epistles of John, that of Jude, and the
                    Apocalypse. The epistle to the Hebrews, 1 and 2 Peter, and James are not named.
                    The epistle “to the Laodiceans” is probably that to the Ephesians, which had
                    this superscription in Murcion's canon; and that “to the Alexandrians” seems to
                    be the epistle to the Hebrews. According to the usual punctuation, both are said
                    to have been forged in Paul’s name, an opinion which may have been entertained
                    among Roman Christians about 170 A.D. The epistle to the Hebrews was rejected in
                    the West, and may have been thought a supposititious work in the interests of
                    Paulism with some reason, because of its internal character. The story about the
                    origin of the fourth gospel, with its apostolic and episcopal attestation,
                    evinces a desire to establish the authenticity of a work which had not obtained
                    universal acceptance at the time. It is <pb break="no"

                <p>The stichometrical list of the Old and New Testament Scriptures in the Latin of

                    in the 3d century. It is peculiar. After the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,
                    and the historical books, follow Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles,
                    Wisdom, Sirach, the twelve minor prophets, the four greater, three books of the
                    Maccabees, Judith, Esdras, Esther, Job, and Tobit. In the New Testament, the.
                    four gospels, Matthew, John, Mark, Luke, are succeeded by ten epistles of Paul,
                    two of Peter, the epistle of James, three of John, and that of Jude. The epistle
                    to the Hebrews (characterized as that of Barnabas), the Revelation of John, the
                    Acts of the Apostles, the Shepherd of Hermas, the Acts of Paul, the Revelation
                    of Peter, follow. There are thus three New Testament works, afterwards reckoned
                    apocryphal, lt is possible that the carelessness of a transcriber may have
                    caused some of the singularities observable in this list,— such as the omission
                    of the epistles to the Philippians and Thessalonians; but the end shows a freer
                    idea of books fitted for reading than what was usual even at that early time in
                    the African Church.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    2 and 3 John, Jude, and the Apocalypse. It has, however, all the other books,
                    including the epistle of James and that to the Hebrews. The last two were

                <p>Towards the middle of the 3d century Origen’s testimony respecting the Canon (+
                    254) is of great value. He seems to have distinguished three classes of
                    books—authentic ones, whose apostolic origin was generally admitted, those not
                    authentic, and a middle class not generally recognized, or in regard to which
                    his own opinion wavered. The first contained those already adopted at the
                    beginning of the century both in the East and West, with the Apocalypse, and the
                    epistle to the Hebrews so far as it contains Pauline ideas;<note anchored="true"

                    admitted of considerable latitude, he is cautious enough, appealing to the
                    tradition of the church, and throwing in qualifying expressions.<note

                    Eusebius put between them was that of ecclesiastical use. Though he classes as

                    Christopherson, Schmid, and Hug think that Eusebius gave the opinion of others
                    in this word; but it is more likely that he gave his own, as Valesius thinks.

                    About 332 the Emperor Constantine entrusted Eusebius with the commission to make
                    out a complete collection of the sacred Christian writings for the use of the
                    Catholic Church. How this order was executed we are not told. But Credner is
                    probably correct in saying that the code consisted of all that is now in the New
                    Testament except the Revelation. The fifty copies which were made must have
                    supplied Constantinople and the Greek Church for a considerable time with an
                    authoritative canon.</p>
                <p>Eusebius’s catalogue agrees in substance with that of Origen. The historian
                    followed ecclesiastical tradition. He inquired diligently into the prevailing
                    opinions of the Christian churches and writers, the views held by others before
                    and contemporaneously with himself, but could not attain to a decided result.
                    His hesitation stood in the way of a clear, firm view of the question. The
                    tradition respecting certain books was still wavering, and he was unable to fix
                    it. Authority fettered his independent judgment. That he was inconsistent and
                    confused does not need to be shown.</p>
                <p>The exact principles that guided the formation of a canon in the earliest
                    centuries cannot be discovered. Definite grounds for the reception or rejection
                    of books were not very clearly apprehended. The choice was determined by various
                    circumstances, of which apostolic origin was the chief, though this itself was
                    insufficiently attested, for, if it be asked whether all the New Testament
                    writings proceeded from the authors whose names they bear, criticism cannot
                    reply in the affirmative. The example and influence of churches to which the
                    writings had been first addressed must have acted upon the reception of books.
                    Above all, individual teachers here and there saw the necessity of meeting
                    heretics with their own weapons, in their own way, with <hi rend="italic"
                    >apostolic records</hi> instead of oral tradition. The circumstances in which
                    the orthodox were placed led to this step, effecting a bond of union whose need
                    must have been felt while each church was isolated under its own bishop and the
                    collective body could not take measures in common. Writings of more recent
                    origin would be received with greater facility than such as had been in
                    circulation for many years, especially if they professed to come from a
                    prominent apostle. A code of apostolic writings, divine and perfect like the Old
                    Testament, had to be presented as soon as possible against Gnostic and
                    Manichaean heretics, whose doctrines were injurious to objective Christianity;
                    while the multiplication of apocryphal works threatened to overwhelm genuine
                    tradition with a heap of superstition.</p>
                <p>When it is asked, to whom do we owe the canon 1 the usual answer is, to the
                    Church, which is hardly correct. The Church Catholic did not exist till after
                    the middle of the second century. The preservation of the early Christian
                    writings was owing, in the first instance, to the congregations to whom they
                    were sent, and the neighbouring ones with whom such congregations had friendly
                    connection. The care of them devolved on the most influential teachers, —on
                    those who occupied leading positions in the chief cities, or were most
                    interested in-apostolic writings as a source of instruction. The Christian books
                    were mostly in the hands of the bishops. In process of time the canon was the
                    care of assemblies or councils. But it had been made before the first general
                    council by a few leading fathers towards the end of the second century in
                    different countries. The formation of a Catholic Church and of a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0019-0010"/> canon was simultaneous. The circumstances in
                    which the collection originated were unfavourable to the authenticity of its
                    materials, for tradition had been busy over them and their authors. Instead of
                    attributing the formation of the canon to the Church, it would be more correct
                    to say that the important stage in it was due to three teachers, each working
                    separately and in his own way, who were intent upon the creation of a Christian
                    society which did not appear in the apostolic age,—a visible organisation united
                    in faith,—where the discordant opinions of apostolic and sub-apostolic times
                    should be finally merged. The canon was not the work of the Christian Church so
                    much as of the men who were striving to form that Church, and could not get
                    beyond the mould received by primitive Christian literature. The first mention
                    of a “Catholic Church” occurs in <hi rend="italic">The Martyrdom of Poly
                    carp,</hi> an epistle that cannot be dated earlier than 160 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> and may perhaps be ten years later. But though the idea be there and
                    in the Ignatian epistles, its established use is due to Irenaeus, Tertullian,
                    and Cyprian.</p>
                <p>Origen was the first who took a somewhat scientific view of the relative value
                    belonging to the different parts of the biblical collection. His examination of
                    the canon was critical. Before him the leading books had been regarded as divine
                    and sacred, the source of doctrinal and historic truth; and from this
                    stand-point he did not depart. With him ecclesiastical tradition was a
                    prevailing principle in the recognition of books belonging of right to the New
                    Testament collection. He was also guided by the inspiration of the authors,—a
                    criterion arbitrary in its application, as his own statements show. In his time,
                    however, the collection was being gradually enlarged,—his third class, t.e., the
                    <hi rend="italic">mixed,</hi> approaching reception into the first. But amid all
                    the fluctuations of opinion to which certain portions of the New Testament were
                    subject, and the unscientific procedure both of fathers and churches in the
                    matter, though councils had not met to discuss it, and vague tradition had
                    strengthened with time, a certain spiritual consciousness manifested itself
                    throughout the East and West in the matter of the canon. Tolerable unanimity
                    ensued. The result was a remarkable one, and calls for our gratitude. Though the
                    development was pervaded by no critical or definite principIe, it ended in a
                    canon which has maintained its validity for centuries.</p>
                <p>It is sometimes said that the history of the canon should be sought from definite
                    catalogues, not from isolated quotations. The latter are supposed to be of
                    slight value, the former to be the result of deliberate judgment. This remark is
                    more specious than solid. In relation to the Old Testament, the catalogues given
                    by the fathers, as by Melito and Origen, rest solely on the tradition of the
                    Jews, apart from which they have no independent authority. As none except Jerome
                    and Origen knew Hebrew, their lists of the Old Testament books are. simply a
                    reflection of what they learned from others. If they deviate in practice from
                    their masters by quoting as Scripture other than the canonical books, they show
                    their judgment over-riding an external theory. The very men who give a list of
                    the Jewish books evince an inclination to the Christian and enlarged canon. So
                    Origen says, in his <hi rend="italic">Epistle io Africanus,</hi> that “the
                    churches use Tobit.” In explaining the prophet Isaiah, Jerome employs Sirach vi.
                    6, in proof of his view, remarking that the apocryphal work is in the Christian
                    catalogue. In like manner Epiphanius, in a passage against Aetius, after
                    referring to the books of Scripture, adds, “as well as the books of Wisdom, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Wisdom of Solomon and of Jesus son of Sirach;
                    finally, all the other books of Scripture.” In another place he gives the canon
                    of the Jews historically, and excludes the apocryphal Greek books; but here he
                    includes some of the latter. We also learn from Jerome that Judith was in the
                    number of the books reckoned up by the.Nicene Council. Thus the fathers who give
                    catalogues of the Old Testament show the existence of a Jewish and a Christian
                    canon in relation to the Old Testament;—the latter wider than the former, their
                    private opinion more favourable to the one, though the other was historically
                    transmitted. In relation to the New Testament, the synods which drew up lists of
                    the sacred books show the opinion of some leading father like Augustine, along
                    with what custom had sanctioned. In this department no member of the synod
                    exercised his critical faculty; á number together would decide such questions
                    summarily. Bishops proceed in the track of tradition or authority.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Canon from the Fourth Century.</hi></p>
                <p>It will now be convenient to treat of the two Testaments together, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the canon of the Bible. The canons of both have been
                    considered separately to the end of the third century; they may be henceforward
                    discussed together. We proceed, therefore, to the Bible-canon of the fourth
                    century, first in the Greek Church and then in the Latin.</p>
                <p>The Council of Laodicea, at which there was a predominant semi-Arian influence,
                    forbade the reading of all non-canonical books. The 59th canon enacts, that
                    “private psalms must not be read in the Church, nor uncanonized books; but only
                    the canonical ones of the New and Old Testament.” The 60th canon proceeds to
                    give a list of such. All the books of the Old Testament are enumerated, but in a
                    peculiar order, somewhat like the Septuagint one. With Jeremiah is specified
                    Baruch, then the Lamentations and Epistle. The prophets are last; first the
                    minor, next the major and Daniel. In the New Testament list are the usual seven
                    catholic epistles, and fourteen of Paul, including that to the Hebrews. The
                    Apocalypse alone is wanting. Credner has proved that this 60th canon is not
                    original. It is of much later date.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Constitutions give a kind of canon like that in the 59th of Laodicea. After
                    speaking of the books of Moses, Joshua, Judges, Kings, Chronicles, those
                    belonging to the return from the captivity, those of Job, Solomon, the sixteen
                    prophets, and the Psalms of David, our Acts, the epistles of Paul, and the four
                    gospels are mentioned. It is remarkable that the catholic epistles are not
                    mentioned. That they are indicated under Acts is altogether improbable. The
                    Antiochian Church of that time doubted or denied the apostolicity of these
                    letters, as is seen from Theodore, Cosmas, and others. Hence their absence from
                    these Constitutions, which are a collection belonging to different times, the
                    oldest portion not earlier perhaps than the third century.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Cyril of Jerusalem, who took part in the Council of Laodicea, and died 386 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> gives a list of “the divine Scriptures.” The books
                    of the Old Testament are twenty-two, and the arrangement is usually that which
                    is in the English Bible. With Jeremiah are associated “Baruch and the Epistle.”
                    All the New Testament books are given except the Apocalypse. The list agrees
                    very nearly with that of Eusebius, by taking the latter’s “controverted”
                    writings into the class of the “generally received.”<note anchored="true"

                    the Church upon the subject, and forbids the reading of writings not generally
                    received. Yet he refers to Baruch (iii. 36-38) as “the prophet”; and in adducing
                    the testimonies of the prophets for the existence of the Holy Spirit, the last
                    is Daniel xiii. 41, 45.</p>
                <p>In Athanasius’s festal epistle (365) the Alexandrian archbishop undertakes “to
                    set forth in order the books that are canonical and handed down and believed to
                    be divine.” His list of the Old Testament nearly agrees with Cyril’s, except
                    that Esther is omitted, and Ruth counted separately, to make out the twenty-two
                    books. He adds, “there are other books not canonical, designed by the fathers to
                    be read by those just joining us, and wishing to be instructed in the doctrine
                    of piety;” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Wisdom of Solomon and the Wisdom of
                    Sirach, and Esther and Judith and Tobit, and the Doctrine of the Apostles

                    and these being <hi rend="italic">read,</hi> let there be no mention of
                    apocryphal writings,” &amp;c. The New Testament list is the same as Cyril’s,
                    with the addition of the Apocalypse.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Gregory of Nazianzus (+ 389) puts his list into a poetical form. In the Old

                    canonical books; in the New, he leaves out the Apocalypse, and so deviates from

                <p>Amphilochius of Iconium (f 395) gives a long catalogue of the Biblical books in
                    verse. The canon of the Old Testament is the usual one, except that he says of
                    Esther at the end, “Some judge that Esther should be added to the foregoing.” He
                    notices none of the apocryphal books. His New Testament canon agrees with the
                    present, only he excludes the Apocalypse as spurious, which is given as the
                    judgment of the majority. He alludes to the doubts that existed as to the
                    epistle to the Hebrews, and to the number of the catholic epistles (seven or
                    three).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Testament books, he hesitates between twenty-two and twenty-seven; but the
                    contents are the same. At the end of the twenty-seven books of the New
                    Testament, Wisdom and Sirach are mentioned as “divine writings;” elsewhere they
                    are characterized as doubtful.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    James, and others of the catholic ones. But Leontius’s account of his opinions

                <p>The catalogues of the Old Testament contained in the manuscriptS'B, C, and K need
                    not be given, as they are merely codices of the Septuagint, and have or had the
                    books canonical and apocryphal belonging to that version. The list of the New
                    Testament books in B is like that of Athanasius. Imperfect at the end, it must
                    have had at first the Epistles to Timothy, Titus, Philemon, and the Apocalypse.
                    C (cod. Ephraemi rescriptus) has fragments of the New Testament, which show that
                    it had originally all the present books in the same order as Athanasius’s, ÿ¢ or
                    the Sinaitic manuscript has in addition to the New Testament the Epistle of
                    Barnabas and the Shepherd of Hermas. The progress made by the Greek Church of
                    the fourth and former part of the fifth century, in its conception of the canon,
                    seems to be that the idea of ecclesiastical settlement, or public, legal,
                    definitive establishment, was attached to the original one. A writing λvas
                    considered canonical when a well-attested tradition put it among those composed
                    by inspired men, apostles or others; and it had on that account a determining
                    authority in matters of faith. Books which served as a rule of faith and were
                    definitively set forth by the Church as divinely authoritative, were now termed
                    canonical. The canon consisted of writings settled or determined by
                    ecclesiastical law.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    >ώρισιιίνα.</hi></p></note> Such was the idea added to the original acceptation
                    of canon. To canonical were opposed apocryphal writings, ι.e., <hi rend="italic"
                    >heretical</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fabricated</hi> ones; while an
                    intermediate class consisted of those read in the churches, which were useful,
                    but not decisive in matters of belief. Another advance in the matter of the
                    canon at this period was the general adoption of the Hebrew canon, with a
                    relegation of the Greek additions in the Septuagint to the class “publicly
                    read.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >βιβλία</hi><hi rend="italic">avaγιPωκoμeva.</hi></p></note> Yet doubts about
                    the reception of Esther into the number of the canonical books were still·
                    entertained, though it was one of the Jewish canon. And the catholic epistles
                    which had been doubted before—Jude, James, Second Peter—were now generally
                    received. But there was a division of opinion about the Apocalypse.</p>
                <p>We come to the period of the Latin corresponding to that of the Greek Church
                    which has just been noticed. Augustine (+430) gave great attention to the
                    subject, labouring to establish a complete canon, the necessity of which was
                    generally felt. According to him the Scriptures· which were received and
                    acknowledged by all the churches of the day should be canonical. Of those not
                    universally adopted, such as are received by the majority of the churches and
                    the weightier should be preferred to those received by the fewer and less
                    important churches.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    of the forty-four books of the Old Testament, he gives, after Chronicles, other
                    histories “which are neither connected with the order” specified in the
                    preceding context “nor with one another,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Job,
                    Tobit, Esther, Judith, the two books of the Maccabees, and Esdras. Wisdom and
                    Ecclesiasticus, he thinks, should be numbered among the prophets, as deserving
                    of authority and having a certain likeness to Solomon’s writings. He says of the
                    Maccabees that this “Scripture has been received by the Church not uselessly, if
                    it be read or heard soberly.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    passage in the treatise on Christian, doctrine, where Augustine enumerates the
                    whole canon, is qualified by no other; for though he knew the distinction
                    between the canonical books of the Palestinian Jews and the so-called apocryphal
                    ones, as well as the fact of some New Testament writings not being received
                    universally, he considered church reception a sufficient warrant for canonical
                    authority. Hence he considered the books of the Maccabees canonical, because so
                    received by the Church; while he says of Wisdom and Sirach that they merited
                    authoritative reception and numbering among the prophetic Scriptures. He raises,
                    not lowers, the authority of the so-called apocryphal books which he mentions.
                    He enumerates all the New Testament books, specifying the Pauline epistles as
                    fourteen, and sc reckoning that to the Hebrews as the apostle’s; but he speaks
                    of it elsewhere as an epistle about which some were uncertain, professing that
                    he was influenced to admit it as canonical by the authority of the Oriental
                    churches.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>In 393 the African bishops held a council at Hippo, where the canon was
                    discussed. The list of the canonical Scriptures given includes, besides the
                    Palestinian one, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Tobit, Judith, and the two books of
                    Maccabees. The New Testament canon seems to have agreed exactly with our present
                    one.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mansi, tom. iii. p.

                    Augustine was the animating spirit of both councils, so that they may be taken
                    as expressing his views on the subject.</p>
                <p>Jerome( + 420) gives a list of the twenty-two canonical books of the Old
                    Testament, the same as that of the Palestinian Jews, remarking that some put
                    Ruth and Lamentations among the Hagiographa, so making twenty-four books. All
                    besides should be put among the Apocrypha. Wisdom, Sirach, Judith, Tobit, the
                    Shepherd are not in the canon. The two books of Maccabees he regarded in the
                    same light.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    position of these extra-canonical books, he allows of their being read in public
                    for the edification of the people, not to confirm the authority of doctrines;
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> they belong to “the ecclesiastical books” of
                    Athanasius. His idea of “apocryphal” is wider and milder than that of some
                    others in the Latin Church. It has been conjectured by Welte,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In Herbst’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Einleit.,</hi> erster Theil, p. 37.</p></note> that the conclusions of the
                    African councils in 393 and 397 influenced Jerome’s views of the. canon, so that
                    his later writings allude to the apocryphal works in a more favourable manner
                    than that of the <hi rend="italic">Prologus galeatus</hi> or the preface to
                    Solomon’s books. One thing is clear, that he quotes different passages from the
                    Apocrypha along with others from the Hebrew canon. In his letter to Eustochius,
                    Sirach iii. 33 comes between citations from Matthew and Luke with the phrase “as
                    it is written;” and xi. 3Qhas “holy Scripture” applied to it. Ruth, Esther, and
                    Judith are spoken of as “holy volumes.” The practice of Jerome differed from his
                    theory; or rather he became less positive and altered his views somewhat with
                    the progress of time and knowledge. As to the New Testament, he gives a
                    catalogue of all that now belong to it, remarking of the epistle to the Hebrews
                    and of the Apocalypse that he adopts both on the authority of ancient writers,
                    not of present custom. His opinion about them was not decided.<note

                    books of the Hebrew canon and of the New Testament are specified. After the list
                    he says, “these are they which the fathers include in the canon, by which they
                    wished to establish the assertion of our faith.” He adds that there are other

                    in the churches, but not as authoritative in matters of faith.<note

                <p>Philastrius (+ about 387) gives some account of the Scriptures and their contents
                    in his time. The canonical Scriptures, which alone should be read in the
                    Catholic Church, are said to be the Law and the Prophets, the gospels, Acts,
                    thirteen epistles of Paul, and seven others. He speaks of heretics who reject
                    John’s gospel and the Apocalypse,—remarking also that some do not read the
                    epistle to the Hebrews, not thinking it to be Paul’s.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Innocent I. of Rome wrote to Exsuperius (405), bishop of Toulouse, giving a list
                    of the canonical books. Besides the Hebrew canon, he has Wisdom and Sirach,
                    Tobit, Judith, the 2 Maccabees. The New Testament list is identical with the
                    present. He also refers to pseudepigιaphical writings which ought not only to be
                    rejected but condemned.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>A canonical list appears in three different forms bearing the names of Damasus
                    (366-384), Gelasius I. (492-496), and Hormisdas (514-523). According to the
                    first, the books of the Old Testament are arranged in three orders. In the first
                    are the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, four Kings, two Chronicles, Psalms,
                    Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Wisdom, and Ecclesiasticus; in the second,
                    all the Prophets, including Baruch; in the third, Job, Tobit, Judith, Esther,
                    Esdras, two Maccabees. The New Testament books are the four gospels, fourteen
                    epistles of Paul, the Apocalypse, and Acts, with seven catholic epistles.</p>
                <p>That which is called the Decree of Gelasius is almost identical with the
                    preceding. It wants Baruch and Lamentations. It has also two Esdras instead of
                    one. In the New Testament the epistle to the Hebrews is absent.</p>
                <p>The Hormisdas-fυrm has the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and in the New Testament the
                    epistle to the Hebrews.</p>
                <p>The MSS. of these lists present some diversity; and Credner supposes the
                    Damasus-list a fiction. But Thiel has vindicated its authenticity. It is
                    possible that some interpolations may exist in the last two; but the first,
                    which is the shortest, may well belong to the time of Damasus.<note

                <p>In 419 A.D. another council at Carthage, at which Augustine was present, repeated
                    the former list of books with a single alteration, viz., fourteen epistles of
                    Paul (instead of thirteen).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The preceding notices and catalogues show a general desire in the Western Church
                    to settle the canon. The two most influential men of the period were Augustine
                    and Jerome, who did not entirely agree. Both were unfitted for the critical
                    examination of such a topic. The former was a gifted spiritual man, lacking
                    learning and independence. Tradition dominated all his ideas about the difficult
                    or disputed books,—a tradition arbitrarily assumed. He did not enter upon the
                    question scientifically, on the basis of certain principles, but was content to
                    take refuge in authority—the prevailing authority of leading churches.</p>
                <p>His judgment was weak, his sagacity moderate, and the absence of many sidedness
                    hindered a critical result, Jerome, again, was learned but timid, lacking the
                    courage to face the question fairly or fundamentally, and the independence
                    necessary to its right investigation. Belonging as he did to both churches, he
                    recommended the practice of the one to the other. He, too, was chiefly
                    influenced by tradition,—by Jewish teachers in respect to the Old Testament, and
                    by general custom as to the New. Compared with the Eastern Church, the Western
                    accepted a wider canon of the Old Testament, taking some books into the class of
                    the canonical which the former put among those “to be read.” In regard to the
                    New Testament, all the Catholic epistles and even the Apocalypse were received.
                    The African churches and councils generally adopted this larger canon, which
                    resulted from the fact of the old Latin versions of the Bible current in Africa
                    being daughters of the Septuagint. If the Latins apparently looked upon the
                    Greek ās the original itself, the apocryphal books would soon get rank with the
                    canonical. Still the more learned fathers, Jerome, Rufinus, and others, favoured
                    the Hebrew canon in distinguishing between canonical and ecclesiastical books.
                    The influence of the Eastern upon the Western Church is still. visible, though
                    it could not extinguish the prevailing desire to include the disputed books. The
                    Greek view was to receive nothing which had not apparently a good attestation of
                    divine origin and apostolic authority; the Latin was to exclude nothing hallowed
                    by descent and proved by custom. The former Church looked more to the sources of
                    doctrine; the latter to those of edification. The one desired to contract those
                    sources, so as not to be too rich; the other to enlarge the springs of
                    edification, not to be too poor. Neither had the proper resources for the work,
                    nor a right perception of the way in which it should be set about; and therefore
                    they were not fortunate in their conclusions, differing in regard to points
                    which affect the foundation of a satisfactory solution.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the numerous endeavours both in the East and West to settle the
                    canon during the 4th and 5th centuries, it was not finally closed. The doubts of
                    individuals were still expressed, and succeeding ages testify to the want of
                    universal agreement respecting several books. The question, however, was <hi
                    rend="italic">practically</hi> determined. No material change occurred again in
                    the absolute rejection or admission of books. With some fluctuations, the canon
                    remained very much as it was in the 4th and 5th centuries. Tradition had shaped
                    and established its condition. General usage gave it a permanency which it was
                    not easy to disturb. The history is mainly an objective one. Uncritical at its
                    commencement, it was equally so in the two centuries which have just been
                    considered.</p>
                <p>The history of the canon in the Syrian church cannot be traced with much
                    exactness. The Peshito version had only the Hebrew canonical books at first; the
                    apocryphal were added afterwards. In the New Testament it wanted four of the
                    catholic epistles and the Apocalypse. Ephrem (378) uses all the books in our
                    canon, the apocryphal as well as the canonical The former are cited by him in
                    the same way as the latter. The Syrian version made by Polycarp at the request
                    of Philoxenus of Mabug, had the four catholic epistles wanting in the Peshito;
                    and the Charklean recension of it probably had the Apocalypse also, if that
                    which was published by De Dieu at Leyden belongs to it. Junilius, though an
                    African bishop (about 550), says that he got his knowledge from a Persian of the
                    name of Paulus, who received his education in the school of Nisibis. He may,
                    therefore, be considered a witness of the opinions of the Syrian church at the
                    beginning of the 6th century. Dividing the biblical books into those of <pb

                    authority, he makes the first the canonical; the second, those added to them by
                    many <hi rend="italic">(plures)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the third, all the
                    rest. In the first list he puts Ecclesiasticus. Among the second he puts 1 and 2
                    Chronicles, Job, Ezra and Nehemiah, Judith, Esther, 1 and 2 Maccabees; and in
                    the New Testament, James, 2 Peter, Jude, 2 and 3 John. He also says that the
                    Apocalypse of John is much doubted by the Orientals. In the third list, t.e.,
                    books of no authority added by some <hi rend="italic">(quidam)</hi> to the
                    canonical, are put Wisdom and Canticles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Gallandi, xii.,p. 79, &amp;c.</p></note> The catalogue is
                    confused, and erroneous at least in the one respect, that Jerome is referred to
                    as sanctioning the division given of the Old Testament books; for neither he nor
                    the Jews agree with it.</p>
                <p>The canon of the old Abyssinian church seems to have had all the books in the
                    Septuagint, canonical and apocryphal together, little distinction being made
                    between them. The New Testament agrees with the present Greek one. At a later
                    period a list was made and constituted the legal one for the use of the church,
                    having been derived from the Jacobite canons of the apostles. This gives in the
                    Old Testament the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Judith, Kings, Chronicles,
                    Ezra and Nehemiah, Esther, Tobit, two books of Maccabees, Job, Psalms, five
                    books of Solomon, minor and greater prophets. External are the Wisdom of Sirach
                    (for teaching children) and the book of Joseph ben Gorion, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,e.,</hi> that of the Maccabees. The New Testament has four gospels, Acts,
                    seven apostolic epistles, fourteen of Paul, and the Revelation of John. Later
                    catalogues vary much, and are often enlarged with the book of Enoch, 4 Esdras,
                    the Apocalypse of Isaiah, &amp;c. The canon of the Ethiopie church was
                    fluctuating.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>The Armenian canon, if we may judge from printed editions, follows the
                    Septuagint; but the books are put in a peculiar position. The three books of
                    Maccabees follow the historical ones. In the New Testament the epistle to the
                    Hebrews precedes those to Timothy and Titus; while Sirach, a second recension of
                    Daniel, Manasseh, 3 Corinthians, with the account of John’s death, are relegated
                    to an appendix behind the New Testament.</p>
                <p>The Bible canon of the Eastern Church in the Middle Ages shows no material
                    change. Endeavours were made to remove the uncertainty arising from the
                    existence of numerous lists; but former decisions and decrees of councils were
                    repeated instead of a new, independent canon. Here belongs the catalogue in the
                    Alexandrian MS. of the 5th century, which is peculiar. After the prophets come
                    Esther, Tobit, Judith, Ezra and Nehemiah, 4 Maccabees, Psalms, Job, Proverbs,
                    Ecclesiastes, Canticles, the all-virtuous Wisdom, the Wisdom of Jesus of Sirach.
                    In the New Testament, the Apocalypse is followed by two epistles of Clement. The
                    list was probably made in Egypt. That of Anastasius Sinaita (+ 599) needs no
                    remark. The apostolic canons (canon 76) give a list both of the Old and New
                    Testament books, in which the usual canonical ones are supplemented by Judith, 3
                    Maccabees, and in the New Testament, by two epistles of Clement, and the
                    Clementines in eight books. The Apocalypse is wanting. But the whole is a
                    patchwork, borrowed from the Apostolic Constitutions, Athanasius’s festal
                    epistle, and other sources. It cannot&gt; be put earlier than the 5th century;
                    and it is pretty certain that Judith and Maccabees are later insertions.<note

                <p>In the Western church of the Middle Ages, diversity of opinion respecting certain
                    books continued. Though the views of Augustine were generally followed, the
                    stricter ones of Jerome found many adherents. The canon was fluctuating, and the
                    practice of the churches in regard to it somewhat lax. Here belong Cassiodorus
                    (about 550); the list in the Codex Amiatinus (about 550); and Isidore of Seville
                    (+636), who, after enumerating three classes of Old Testament books gives a
                    fourth, not in the Hebrew canon. Here he specifies Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus,
                    Tobit, Judith, 1 and 2 Maccabees, saying that the Church of Christ puts them

                    several MSS. of the old Latin version, in <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,f,ff, q,
                    cod. D</hi> (Latin),—Matthew, John, Luke, Mark. In the Acts of the council at
                    Ephesus (431), Cyril of Alexandria, Theodoret, and several Latin translations,
                    they are Matthew, John, Mark, Luke. The Curetonian Syriac has Matthew, Mark,
                    John, Luke; while a very old fragment of the gospels in Turin has Mark and
                    Matthew.</p>
                <p>The oldest order of the books, and that which lies at the basis of the current
                    one given by Tertullian, is Gospels, Acts, Pauline epistles, Apocalypse, epistle
                    of John. This was varied by putting the Catholic epistles before the Apocalypse,
                    as in the, Muratorian fragment. This order became the prevailing one in the
                    West, with a few variations here and there, such as the placing of the Acts
                    after the Pauline epistles by the Peshito, Jerome, and Epiphanius; or after the
                    Catholic epistles, immediately before the Apocalypse, by Augustine and the
                    Spanish church; while in the Stichometry of the Clermont MS. they follow the
                    Apocalypse as the last canonical book.</p>
                <p>In the ancient Greek Church the order was different. There the usual one was
                    Gospels, Acts, the Catholic epistles, the Pauline epistles, and the Apocalypse.
                    This exists in Cyril of Jerusalem, Athanasius, and the MSS. B and A. But the
                    Sinaitic has Gospels, Pauline epistles, Acts, Catholic epistles, Apocalypse.</p>
                <p>The Pauline epistles seem to have been arranged accord ing to their length; the
                    Catholic ones have that of James first, because the author was the bishop of the
                    church at Jerusalem, then the epistles of Peter, the chief of the apostles.<note

                <p>The Reformers generally returned to the Hebrew canon, dividing off the additional
                    books of the Septuagint as well as those attached to the Vulgate. These they
                    called apocryphal, after Jerome’s example. The latter, though considered of no
                    authority in matters of doctrine, were still pronounced useful and edifying. The
                    principal reason that weighed with them was, that Christ and the apostles
                    testified to none of the Septuagint additions.</p>
                <p>Besides the canonical books of the Old Testament, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0023-0014"/> Luther translated Judith, Wisdom, Tobit, Sirach,
                    Baruch, 1 and 2 Maccabees, the Greek additions to Esther and Daniel, with the
                    Prayer of Manasseh. His judgment respecting several of these is expressed in the
                    prefaces to them. With regard to 1 Maccabees he thinks it ahnost equal to the
                    other books of Holy Scripture, and not unworthy to be reckoned among them. Of
                    Wisdom, he says, he was long in doubt whether it should be numbered among the
                    canonical books; and of Sirach, that it is a right good book proceeding from a
                    wise man. But he speaks unfavourably of several other apocryphal productions, as
                    of Baruch and 2 Maccabees. It is evident, however, that he considered all he
                    translated of <hi rend="italic">some</hi> use to the Christian Church. He
                    thought that the book of Esther should not belong to the canon.</p>
                <p>Luther’s judgment respecting some of the New Testament books was freer than most
                    Protestants now are disposed to approve. He thought the epistle to the Hebrews
                    was neither Paul’s nor an apostle’s, but proceeded from an excellent and learned
                    man who may have been the disciple of apostles. He did not put it on an equality
                    with the epistles written by apostles themselves. The Apocalypse he considered
                    neither apostolic nor prophetic, but put it almost on the same level with the
                    4th book of Esdras, which he spoke elsewhere of tossing into the Elbe. This
                    judgment was afterwards modified, not retracted. James’s epistle he pronounced
                    unapostolic. It was quite an epistle of straw. In like manner, he did not
                    believe that Jude’s epistle proceeded from an apostle. Considering it to have
                    been taken from 2 Peter, and not well extracted either, he put it lower than the
                    supposed original. The Reformer, as also his successors, made a distinction
                    between the books of the New Testament similar to that of the Old,—the <hi
                    rend="italic">generally received</hi> (homologoumena) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >controverted</hi> books (antilegomena); but the Calvinists afterwards
                    obliterated it, as the Roman Catholics at the Council of Tr≡nt did with the Old
                    Testament. The epistle to the Hebrews, those of Jude and James, with the
                    Apocalypse, belong to the latter class. Luther assigned a greater or less value
                    to the separate writings of the New Testament, and left every one to do the
                    same. He relied on their internal value more than tradition,—taking the “Word of
                    God” in a deeper and wider sense than its coincidence with the Bible.</p>
                <p>Bodenstein of Carlstadt examined the question of canonicity more thoroughly than
                    any of his contemporaries, and followed out the principle of private judgment in
                    regard to it. He divides the biblical books into three classes— 1. Books of the
                    highest dignity, viz., the Pentateuch and the Gospels; 2. Books of the second
                    dignity, t.e., the works termed prophetic by the Jews, and the fifteen epistles
                    universally received; 3. Books of the third and lowest authority, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Jewish Hagiographa and the seven antilegomena
                    epistles of the New Testament. Among the Apocryphi he makes two classes—such as
                    are out of the canon of the Hebrews yet hagiographical (Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus,
                    Judith, Tobit, the two Maccabees), and those that are clearly apocryphal and to
                    be rejected (third and fourth Esdras, Baruch, Prayer of Manasseh, a good part of
                    the third chapter of Daniel, and the last two chapters of Daniel).<note

                <p>The Waldensian canon, in which the canonical are carefully separated from the

                    or made by a Protestant after 1532. It is not genuine.</p>
                <p>The canon of the Anglican Church (1562), given in the sixth Article of Religion,
                    defines holy Scripture to be “those canonical books of the Old and New
                    Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.” After giving
                    the names and number of the canonical books, the article prefaces the apocryphal
                    ones with, “And the other books (as Hierome saith) the Church doth read for
                    example of life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to
                    establish any doctrine. Such are these following,” &amp;c., &amp;c. At the end
                    it is stated that “all the books of the New Testament, as they are commonly
                    received, we do receive and account them canonical.” The Article is ambiguous.
                    If the canonical books enumerated are those meant in the phrase “of whose
                    authority was never any doubt in the Church,” the statement is incorrect. If a
                    distinction is implied between the canonical books and such canonical ones as
                    have never been doubted in the Church, the meaning is obscure. In either case
                    the language is not explicit.</p>
                <p>The Westminster Confession of Faith gives a list of all the books of the Old and
                    New Testaments as the Word of God written,—adding that those called the
                    Apocrypha are not of divine inspiration, and no part of the canon, of no
                    authority in the Church, nor to be approved or made use of otherwise than human
                    writings.</p>
                <p>The Roman Catholic canon was finally determined at the Council of Trent (1546),
                    which adopted all the books in the Vulgate as sacred and canonical without
                    distinction. But 3 and 4 Esdras, 3 Maccabees, and the Prayer of Manasseh were
                    not included,—though the first and last appeared in the original Clementine
                    edition of 1592, not however in the preceding one of Sixtus (1590). A council at
                    Florence in 1441 had set the example, which was followed at Trent. But this
                    stringent decree did not prevent individual Catholics from making a distinction
                    between the books, in assuming a first and second canon, or proto-canonical and
                    deutero-canonical books,—as did Sixtus Senensis, B. Lamy, Anton a matre Dei,
                    Jahn, and others,—though it is hardly consistent with orthodox Catholicism or
                    the view of those who passed the decree.</p>

                    the same decision with the Romish, and canonized all the Apocrypha. This was

                <p>Semler (+1791) was the first scholar after the Reformation who set himself to
                    correct the prevailing ideas respecting the canon. He had no definite principles
                    to guide him, but judged books chiefly by their Christian value and use to the
                    Church. Though his views are sometimes one-sided, and his essays ill-digested,
                    he placed the subject in pew lights, and his labours bore abundant fruit in
                    after years.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Michaelis, Herder, Lessing, and Eichhorn,— most of whom recommended their views
                    by a freshness of style which Semler did not command; In more recent times the
                    whole question has been subjected to very thorough discussion.</p>
                <p>We observe in conclusion that the canonical authority of Scripture does not
                    depend on the church or its councils.</p>
                <p>The primitive church may be cited as a witness for it; that is all. Canonical
                    authority lies in the Scripture itself; it is inherent in the books so far as
                    they contain a revelation or declaration of the divine will. Hence there is
                    truth in the statement of old theologians that the authority of Scripture is
                    from God alone. The canonicity of the books is a distinct question from that of
                    their authenticity. The latter is a thing of historic criticism, the former of
                    doctrinal belief.</p>
