                    following year, found vent in a romantic scheme for the discovery of the North
                    West Passage, in pursuance of which he departed for America in 1790. The passage

                    failure of the duke of Brunswick’s invasion he retired to England, where he
                    lived obscurely for several years, gaining an intimate acquaintance with English
                    literature, and elaborating <hi rend="italic">The Natchez,</hi> a prose epic

                        <hi rend="italic">René,</hi> have acquired universal renown; but the work as
                    a whole, to say nothing of the unreality of its pictures of savage life, belongs
                    to that unfortunate compromise between the forms of prose and poetry in a manner
                    imposed upon the French language by the penury of its poetic diction, but
                    incapable of the perfection of either poetry or prose. Chateaubriand’s first
                    publication, however, was the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Revolutions (ì
                        7$7).</hi> ln this remarkable work, which the author subsequently retracted,
                    but took care not to suppress, he appears as a mediator between royalist and
                    revolutionary ideas, a freethinker in religion, and in philosophy imbued with
                    the spirit of Rousseau. A great change in his views was, however, at hand,
                    induced, as he would have us believe, by the death of his mother in the same
                    year. It is certain that upon his restoration to his country three years
                    subsequently, the <hi rend="italic">Genius of Christianity</hi> was already in
                    an advanced state. Before publishing it, however, he determined to make an essay
                    with an episode of his romance. <hi rend="italic">Atala,</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">The Loves of Two Savages,</hi> appeared in 1801, and
                    immediately raised the author to the summit of literary distinction. Exquisite
                    style, impassioned eloquence, and glowing descriptions of nature, gained
                    indulgence for the incongruity between the rudeness of the personages and the
                    refinement of the sentiments, and for the distasteful blending of prudery with
                    sensuousness; the latter was indeed conformable to the example of the author’s
                    models and predecessors. Alike in its merits and defects, the piece is a more
                    emphatic and highly-coloured “Paul and Virginia;” it has been justly said that
                    Bernardin Saint Pierre models in marble and Chateaubriand in bronze. Encouraged
                    by his success, the author resumed his <hi rend="italic">Genius of
                        Christianity,</hi> which appeared in the following year, just upon the eve
                    of Napoleon’s re-establishment of the Catholic religion, for which it thus
                    almost seemed to have prepared the way. No coincidence could have been more
                    opportune, and Chateaubriand might almost be pardoned for esteeming himself the
                    counterpart of Napoleon in the intellectual order, as be certainly did. In
                    composing his work he had borne in mind the admonition of his friend Joubert,
                    that the public would care very little for his erudition and very much for his
                    eloquence. It is consequently an inefficient production from the point of view
                    of serious argument. The considerations derived from natural theology are but
                    commonplaces rendered dazzling by the magic of style; and the parallels between
                    Christianity and antiquity, especially in arts and letters, are at best
                    ingenious sophistries. The less polemical passages, however, where the author
                    depicts the glories of the Catholic liturgy and its accessories, or expounds its
                    symbolical significance, are splendid instances of the effect produced by the
                    accumulation and judicious distribution of particulars gorgeous in the mass, and
                    individually treated with the utmost refinement of detail Taken altogether, the
                    work is a masterpiece of literary art, and its immediate effect was very
                    considerable. It admirably subserved the statecraft of Napoleon, who appointed
                    the writer attaché at Rome, and when his insubordinate and intriguing spirit
                    compelled his recall, transferred him as envoy to the canton of the Valais. The
                    murder of the duke of Enghien took place during his absence on this mission.
                    Chateaubriand, to his honour, immediately resigned his post, and subsequently
                    manifested great courage in his indirect censures of Napoleon in a journal of
                    which he had become proprietor, and which was ultimately suppressed. Ere this he
                    had departed on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, undertaken, as he subsequently
                    acknowledged, less in a devotional spirit than in quest of new imagery, and in
                    deference to the wishes of a lady friend. The journey produced (1811) a record
                    of travel distinguished by his habitual picturesqueness, and also inspired his
                    prose epic of <hi rend="italic">The Martyrs,</hi> published two years
                    previously. This work may be regarded as the argument of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Genius of Christianity</hi> thrown into an objective form. Moore’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Epicurean,</hi> and the more ambitious passages of Bulwer’s
                    earlier romances, may convey an adequate notion of it to the merely English
                    reader. As in the <hi rend="italic">Epicurean,</hi> the professed design is the
                    contrast between Paganism and Christianity, which fails of its purpose partly
                    from the absence of real insight into the genius of antiquity, and partly
                    because the heathen are the most interesting characters after all. Two years
                    previously had appeared <hi rend="italic">Rene,</hi> another detached episode of
                        <hi rend="italic">The Natchez,</hi> and perhaps Chateaubriand’s most
                    characteristic production. The connecting links in European literature between
                        <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold,</hi> it
                    paints with wonderful mastery the misery of a morbid and dissatisfied soul, the
                    type of a character blighted by over-sensitiveness on the one hand, and an
                    egotism thinly disguised by poetical sentiment on the other. The representation
                    is mainly from the life, and Chateaubriand must certainly be acquitted of the
                    unreality and affectation which so frequently characterize similar delineations
                    of the poetic temperament. René’s morbid despondency is but the too faithful
                    protrait of the desolation begotten in his own mind by the unnatural alliance
                    between opulence of imagination and poverty of heart. His sister Lucile is the
                    Amélie of the story. <hi rend="italic">The Natchez,</hi> of which <hi
                        rend="italic">René</hi> was to have formed an episcde, was not published
                    until 1826, at which time also appeared the beautiful tale of <hi rend="italic"
                        >The Last of the Abencerrages,</hi> written about 1809, and, as the author
                    asserts, withheld from publication on account of the Peninsular War. With this
                    composition Chateaubriand’s career as an imaginative writer is closed; and we
                    have henceforth chiefly to consider him as a politician. His character in this
                    point of view may be comprised in a sentence; he was equally formidable to his
                    antagonists when in opposition and to his friends when in office. His poetical
                    receptivity and impressionableness rendered him honestly inconsistent with
                    himself, while his vanity and ambition, too morbidly acute to be restrained by
                    the ties of party allegiance, made him dangerous and untrustworthy as a
                    political associate. His pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Bonaparte and the
                        Bourbons,</hi> published in 1814, while the fate of Napoleon yet trembled in
                    the balance, was as opportune in the moment of its appearance as the <hi
                        rend="italic">Genius of Christianity,</hi> and produced a hardly less signal
                    effect. Louis XVIII. declared that it had been worth a hundred thousand men to
                    him. Chateaubriand was called to his councils, accompanied him to Ghent during
                    the Hundred Days, and for a time associated himself with the excesses of the
                    royalist reaction. Political bigotry, however, was not among his faults; he
                    gradually drifted into liberalism and opposition, anti upon a change of
                    ministry, obtained the London embassy, from which he was transferred to
                    represent his country at the Congress of Verona. He here made himself mainly
                    responsible for the iniquitous invasion of Spain,—an expedition undertaken, as
                    he himself admits, with the puerile idea of restoring French prestige by a
                    military parade. He next received the portfolio of foreign affairs, which he
                    soon lost by his desertion of his colleagues on the question of a reduction of
                    the interest on the national debt. After another interlude of effective
                    pamphleteering in opposition, he accepted the embassy to Rome under the
                    Martignac administration, resigned it at Prince Polignac’s accession to office,
                    and on the downfall of the elder branch of the Bourbons, made one last extremely
                    brilliant but inevitably fruitless protest from the tribune in defence of the
                    principle of legitimacy. During the first half of Louis Philippe’s reign he was
                    still active with his pen, and was regarded as the most efficient champion of
                    the exiled dynasty, but as years increased upon him, and the prospect <pb

                    diminished, he relapsed into an attitude of complete discouragement, and
                    contributed to chill the ardour of his own party. His narrative of his share in
                    the Congress of Verona, the <hi rend="italic">Life of Rance,</hi> and his
                    translation of Milton, belong to the writings of these later days. He expired on
                    July 4, 1848, wholly exhausted and thoroughly discontented with himself and the
                    world, but affectionately tended by his old friend Madame Récamier, herself
                    deprived of sight. His remains were interred in Grand Bey, a lonely islet off
                    the coast of Brittany. Shortly after his death his memory was powerfully
                    revived, and at the same time exposed to much adverse criticism, by the
                    publication, with sundry mutilations as has been suspected, of his celebrated
                        <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Outre-Tombe,</hi> the composition of which had occupied him at intervals
                    during the greater part of his life. These memoirs undoubtedly reveal his
                    vanity, his egotism, the frequent hollowness of his professed convictions, and
                    his incapacity for sincere attachment, except, perhaps, in the case of Madame
                    Récamier. They abound, on the other hand, with beauties of the first order, and
                    much of the rough treatment they have experienced is attributable to the
                    animosity of party. Their principal literary defect is the frequent encroachment
                    of the historical element upon the autobiographical, the writer’s exaggerated
                    estimate of his own consequence leading him to allow a disproportionate space to
                    transactions in which he had in fact but little share.</p>
                <p>Chateaubriand ranks rather as a great rhetorician than as a great poet, rather as
                    a great writer than a great man. Something of affectation or unreality commonly
                    interferes with the enjoyment of his finest works. The <hi rend="italic">Genius
                        of Christianity</hi> is a brilliant piece of special pleading; <hi
                        rend="italic">Atala</hi> is marred by its unfaithfulness to the truth of
                    uncivilized human nature, <hi rend="italic">René</hi> by the perversion of
                    sentiment which solicits sympathy for a character rather deserving of contempt.
                    Chateaubriand’s fame owes much to the timeliness of his appearances in print,
                    and even more to the genuine conviction of his countrymen that French literature
                    and European literature are practically convertible terms. They have hence made
                    his position in the former the standard of his influence over the latter, which,
                    for an author so widely read and so generally admired, has in reality been but
                    small. Even in France he is chiefly significant as marking the transition from
                    the old classical to the modern romantic school. He belongs to the latter by the
                    idiosyncrasy of his genius, to the former by the comparative severity of his
                    taste. The fertility of ideas, vehemence of expression, and luxury of natural
                    description, which he shares with the romanticists, are controlled by a
                    discipline imbibed in the school of their predecessors. His palette, always
                    brilliant, is never gaudy; he is not merely a painter but an artist. He is a
                    master of epigrammatic and incisive sayings, and has contributed as much as any
                    great French writer to foster the disastrous national partiality for <hi
                        rend="italic">la phrase.</hi> Perhaps, however, the most truly
                    characteristic feature of his genius is the peculiar magical touch which Mr
                    Arnold has indicated as a note of Celtic extraction, which reveals some occult
                    quality in a familiar object, or tinges it, one knows not how, with “the light
                    that never was on sea or land.” This incommunicable gift is of necessity
                    genuine, and supplies an element of sincerity to Chateaubriand’s writings which
                    goes far to redeem the artificial effect of his calculated sophistry and set
                    declamation. It is also fortunate for his fame that so large a part of his
                    writings should directly or indirectly refer to himself, for on this theme he
                    always writes weiZ Egotism was his masterpassion, and beyond his intrepidity and
                    the loftiness of his intellectual carriage his character presents little to
                    admire. He is a signal instance of the compatibility of genuine poetic emotion,
                    and sympathy with the grander aspects both of man and nature, and even
                    munificence in pecuniary matters, with absorption in self and general sterility
                    of heart.</p>
