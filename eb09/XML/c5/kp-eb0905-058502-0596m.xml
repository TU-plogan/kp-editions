                    in the form employed by themselves, <hi rend="italic">Tsaraglιee,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Chelake,</hi> a tribe of North American Indians, now settled in
                    the Indian Territory, where they occupy an area of 5960 square miles in the
                    north-east and a strip along the north of about 8500. Before their removal
                    thither they possessed a large tract of country now distributed among the States
                    of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, and the western part of Florida.
                    They were then distinguished into two great divisions, the Ottare or Otari, who
                    dwelt in the moun tainous districts, and the Airate or Erati, who inhabited the
                    lower grounds; and they were further divided into seven clans, each of which
                    prohibited intermarriage between its own members. They attached themselves to
                    the English in the disputes and contests which arose between the European
                    colonizers, formally recognized the English king in 1730, and in 1755 ceded a
                    part of their territory and permitted the erection of English forts.
                    Unfortunately this amity was interrupted not long after; but peace was again
                    restored in 1761. The tribe was gradually advancing in civilization when the
                    Revolutionary War broke out, and they sided with the Royalist party. This, of
                    course, led to their subjugation by the new republic, and they were forced to
                    surrender that part of their lands which lay to the south of the Savannah and
                    east of the Chattahoochee. Peace was made in 1781, and in 1785 they recognized
                    the supremacy of the United States, and were established in their possessions.
                    The gradual advance of immigration soon led to disputes with the settlers, and
                    the Cherokees were treated with the most high-handed injustice by the States,
                    and more especially by Georgia. Exodus after exodus took place; a small part of
                    the tribe desired a complete removal to another district; but the main body was
                    neither to be bribed nor frightened from their country. An appeal was made to
                    the United States Government; but it lent a deaf ear to their prayers, and in
                    Congress voted that a treaty concluded with a miserable minority should be
                    regarded as binding on the whole tribe, which about that time numbered 27,000. A
                    force of 2000 men was accordingly sent under General Scott, which compelled them
                    to emigrate to their present position. After the settlement various
                    disagreements between the Eastern and Western Cherokees continued for some time;
                    but in 1839 a union was effected. In the civil war of 1862 they all at first
                    sided with the South; but before long a strong party joined the North, and this
                    led to a disastrous internecine struggle. On the close of the contest they were
                    confirmed in the possession of their territory, but were forced to give a
                    portion of their lands to their emancipated slaves. Since then they have
                    peacefully advanced in prosperity and civilization; and under the influence of
                    the Moravian, Baptist, Methodist, and Congregational missions they have been
                    partially Christianized. In 1873 their numbers amounted to 17,217; their private
                    property was worth $5,000,000; there were 63 schools attended by 1884 pupils;
                    89,250 acres were under cultivation, and their stock included 15,000 horses,
                    103,302 cattle, 3050 sheep, and <pb break="no"

                    and maintain industrial habits. Their territory is distributed into eight
                    districts; and their chief town is Tahlequah, situated in the south-east corner
                    of the country. A newspaper is published in the capital in English and Cherokee,
                    and a literature is being gradually formed. Their language consists of two
                    dialects,—a third, called Gidoowa, having bee¢i lost. The syllabic alphabet
                    invented in 1821 by Georg« Guess is the character employed.</p>
