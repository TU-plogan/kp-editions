                    “when properly diluted and combined with other scents it produces a very
                    pleasing effect, and possesses a much more <hi rend="italic">floral</hi>
                    fragrance than musk, indeed it would be impossible to imitate some flowers
                    without it” (RimmeΓs <hi rend="italic">Art of Perfumery).</hi> There are three
                    species of civet-producing <hi rend="italic">Viverridoe.</hi> The Civet <hi

                    >civetta)</hi> is a native of North Africa and extends as far south and west as
                    Fernando Po. It is from 2 to 3 feet in length, exclusive of the tail, which is
                    half the length of the body, and stands from 10 to 12 inches high. It is covered
                    with long hair, that on the middle line of the back being longest and capable of
                    being raised or depressed at will, of a dark-grey colour, with numerous
                    transverse black bands and spots. It is chiefly nocturnal, and is by preference
                    carnivorous, feeding on birds and the smaller quadrupeds, in pursuit of which it
                    climbs trees, but it is said also to eat fruits, roots, and other vegetable
                    matters. In a state of captivity it is never completely tamed, and is only thus
                    kept for the sake of the civet, which is obtained in largest quantity from the
                    male, especially when he is in good condition and is subjected to irritation. It
                    is scraped from the pouch with a small spoon usually twice a week. The Zibeth
                    (<hi rend="italic">Viverra</hi><hi rend="italic">zibetha)</hi> is a widely
                    distributed species extending from Arabia to Malabar, and throughout several of
                    the larger islands of the Indian Archipelago. It is smaller than the civet, and
                    wants the dorsal crest. In the wild state it is exceedingly ferocious, doing
                    great damage among poultry, and frequently making off with the young of the
                    swine and sheep. “To the rapacity of the wolf,” says Captain Williamson, “it
                    joins the agility of the cat and the cunning of the fox.” When hunted it makes a
                    determined resistance, and emits a scent so strong as even to sicken the dogs,
                    who nevertheless are exceedingly fond of the sport, and cannot be got to pursue
                    any other game while the stench of the zibeth is in their nostrils. In
                    confinement, however, it becomes comparatively tame, and civet is obtained from
                    it in considerable quantity. In preparing this for the market it is usually
                    spread out on the leaves of the pepper plant in order to free it from the <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0810-0797"/> hairs that have become detached from the pouch.
                    The Rasse (<hi rend="italic">Viverra</hi><hi rend="italic">rasse)</hi> is the
                    fiercest and most carnivorous of its kind, and remains untamed in confinement.
                    It is a native of Java, where it is found not unfrequently in forests at a
                    moderate elevation above the sea level. It is almost 3 feet long including the
                    tail, and is prettily marked with dark longitudinal stripes, and with spots
                    which have a distinctly linear arrangement. Its perfume, which is extracted in
                    the same way as in the two preceding species, is highly valued and much used by
                    the Javanese, who, according to Dr Horsfield, apply it to their dresses, and by
                    means of various unguents and mixtures of flowers to their persons. British
                    imports of civet are chiefly from the Indian Archipelago, and when pure it is
                    worth about <hi rend="italic">£2</hi> per ounce. It is frequently adulterated
                    with butter or lard. Fossil remains of extinct civets are found in the Miocene
                    strata of Europe.</p>
