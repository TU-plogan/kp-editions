                    political ability which gained for him the title of “the Wise.” From the age of
                    nineteen to that of twenty-three, during the exile of his father, a period of
                    great disturbance and difficulty, he ruled as lieutenant of the kingdom. The
                    first States-General which he summoned, led by Stephen Marcel, president of the
                    tiers-état, and Robert le Coq, president of the clergy, refused to raise levies
                    or subsidies, and demanded, first, the trial before judges nominated by
                    themselves of the ministers of justice and of finance, whom they accused of
                    corruption; secondly, the establishment of a council chosen from the three
                    chambers to be consulted in all cases by the dauphin; and lastly, the release of
                    the king of Navarre. Next year (1357) they were equally determined; they forced
                    the dauphin to give his assent to an ordinance which greatly extended the
                    authority of the States, and the commission appointed to carry it out ruled for
                    some time with dictatorial power. The authority of Marcel also was such that he
                    was bold enough to enter the palace of the dauphin, and slay two of his chief
                    officers,—the marshals of Champagne and Normandy. At the same time another
                    enemy, Charles, the king of Navarre, was enjoying unbounded popularity among the
                    people of Paris, and maintaining their cause. France, indeed, seemed ripe for
                    revolution, for its condition was wretched in the extreme. The heartless ravages
                    of the English, of the free companies, and of the French nobles themselves had
                    laid waste the country, and maddened the peasantry till, under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">La Jacquerie,</hi> they burst into hideous revolts, in which they
                    committed the most brutal outrages against the hated nobility. But after a few

                <p>sinatioιι of Marcel, aud the support of the nobles and of the provincial States,
                    Charles regained the supremacy. When he again appealed to the States-General, in
                    order to obtain the rejection of the ruinous treaty of London, which John had
                    signed in his eagerness to procure his own release, he also received from them
                    troops and money to carry on the war in Picardy. But he never again convoked
                    them, except on one occasion (in 1369), when they are said to have proved
                    extremely submissive. Ever after he had recourse to assemblies of notables, or
                    to the provincial States, which never ventured to offer him serious
                    opposition.</p>
                <p>From 1360 to 1364 John, ransomed by the treaty of Bretigny, ruled in person; but
                    in the latter year, to save his honour, he returned to London, and in April he
                    died there, leaving the crown to Charles.</p>
                <p>Charles at once set himself vigorously to the task of binding up the wounds of
                    the kingdom, and preparing to expel the English. He employed Duguesclin, an able
                    soldier of Brittany, to lead 30,000 men of the free companies into Spain, and to
                    set Henry of Transtamare upon the throne. Thus he not only freed the country
                    from a grievous scourge, but also obtained the friendship of the Spanish king.
                    He had already made alliances with the king of Castile, with the count of
                    Flanders, with Scotland, and even with Charles of Navarre; and after having
                    carefully fortified the principal towns, he provoked a renewal of the war with
                    England. The wise policy on which he had resolved was carried out with great
                    firmness. Pitched battles were avoided, and the enemy, being repu!sed by the
                    towns, had nothing left but to ravage the country, with the result of deepening
                    the hatred of the people. The Bretons were gained over, and soon all the land to
                    the north of the Garonne ceased to belong to the English (1373). In 1380 the
                    conquest of Guienne by the French left them only Bayonne, Bordeaux, Brest, and
                    Calais.</p>
                <p>At the same time Charles crushed his other great enemy, the king of Navarre.
                    After accusing him of various plots against himself and other members of the
                    royal family, he took his two sons as hostages, executed two of his ministers,
                    and raised up enemies against him who seized great part of his territory, and
                    forced him to give up twenty places as security for peace.</p>
                <p>But Charles’s last aggressive attempt was not equally successful He summoned the
                    duke of Brittany before him, and when he failed to appear, declared his dukedom
                    confiscated to the crown. The result, however, was that the people recalled the
                    duke, who had previously been banished, and formed an alliance with England.
                    While affairs were in this condition Charles died at Vincennes, on the 16th
                    September 1380.</p>
                <p>His reign had left many important results. The country bad been freed for a
                    time—though, unfortunately, only for a time—from its two great scourges, the
                    free companies and the English. The residence of a pope at Avignon under the
                    influence of the king tended to make the Gallican Church more independent. The
                    privileges of the nobility were somewhat invaded by Charles’s favour to the
                    burgesses of Paris. Something was done to increase the purity of the
                    administration of justice, and the parliament of Paris was allowed to become
                    self-elective,—a reform which, however, was only temporary, a retrogressive
                    change being made under Charles VII. On the other hand, the States-General were
                    silenced; the personal power of the king was increased; and the weight of taxes,
                    often from their nature peculiarly oppressive, was greatly multiplied, for,
                    notwithstanding the grievous war expenses, Charles set no limit to the free
                    indulgence of his tastes. He left several costly specimens of the expensive art
                    of architecture, including the splendid palace of Saint Paul and the strong
                    walls of the Bastille ,∙ and he distinguished himself still more honourably by
                    founding the royal library at Paris.</p>
