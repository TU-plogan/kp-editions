                <p><label type="entry">CHURCH HISTORY</label>. In this article we shall consider (1)
                    The Definition, (2) The Sources, (3) The Method, and (4) The Literature of the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>’ Considered as a department of universal knowledge, church history forms a
                    special section of the religious history of mankind. It is an account of the
                    growth and the transactions of the religious community which is marked out from
                    others by its attachment to Christianity. This definition already excludes from
                    consideration a region of inquiry important in itself, which is sometimes
                    regarded as forming an integral part of the subject. Starting from that idea of
                    the church which is represented etymologically by the undoubtedly false
                    derivations of the word from the German <hi rend="italic">küren,</hi> to choose,
                    or the Greek κυρίου oικos, the (figurative) house of the Lord, various writers
                    have assumed the church to be that special section of mankind who in any age
                    have enjoyed the true revelation of God as given by himself, and they have in
                    consequence regarded church history as bound to deal first with the Old
                    Testament church and then with the church of the New Dispensation. This,
                    however, involves an amount of dogmatic prepossession to which history, simply
                    as such, cannot commit itself. Surveying the field of mere objective fact,
                    history can single out, under the general appellation of the church, a great
                    society whose origin can be distinctly traced up to the personal activity of
                    Christ, who, for this society, forms a definite and wholly new historical
                    commencement. Whatever etymology we assign to the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >church</hi> under its various modifications of <hi rend="italic">ldrche, kirk,
                    kerk, cyrkeu), zerkow,</hi> &lt;fcc.,—whether we follow the derivation suggested
                    by Walafrid Strabo in the 9th century, and extensively held since, from το
                    κυριακόν, the Lord’s house, as a term introduced by the Greek missionaries into
                    the language of the heathen tribes whom they converted, or whether we adopt the
                    not less probable conjee ture of Lipsius, and ascribe its origin to “circ” or
                    “cere” (connected with the Latin <hi rend="italic">dr</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >eus),</hi> the local name for the temple of Northern paganism, adopted by
                    ancient and medi&amp;eval Christianity, in conformity with its principle of
                    accommodating itself as far as possible to the usages of its proselytes—there
                    can be no doubt that the community and the movement, which, under some form of
                    the name <hi rend="italic">church</hi> among the Germanic races, and of the name
                    <hi rend="italic">ecclesia,</hi> such as <hi rend="italic">église,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">chiesa,</hi> &lt;fcc., among the Latin nations, succeeded in
                    subjugating the Roman empire, along with extensive regions beyond it on all
                    sides, to a religion whose personal centre is Christ, form a fresh phenomenon in
                    the history of mankind, as distinct and individual in its character as
                    Hellenism, Hinduism, or Mohammedanism. In the view of history proper, therefore,
                    the history of Judaism cannot be taken as forming a part of the history of the
                    church.</p>
                <p>For the same reason history cannot take action upon a class of distinctions
                    recognized by many who assume the functions of the church historian. Such
                    writers, adopting some strict and special definition of the church, confine the
                    work of church history to that section of professing Christians whose condition
                    satisfies the terms of their definition, any other so-called division of
                    Christendom coming in for a share of attention only in the narrative of the
                    opposition encountered by the church. History, in the proper sense, cannot
                    undertake to decide questions of this description. To say which among many
                    competing churches is the true church involves a dogmatic deliverance, which is
                    beyond its province. It must do its work in a more rough and general fashion.
                    Under the name church it comprehends all organizations avowedly basing
                    themselves upon Christianity and recognizing Christ as in some sense their head
                    and leader. It undertakes to delineate the story of these in the aggregate; and
                    with regard to the distinctions between them, and their pretensions to condemn
                    and exclude each other, it confines itself to narrative, without attempting
                    adjudication.</p>
                <p>Another limitation has to be introduced into the definition of church history,
                    when regard is had to the exact point of time at which it ought to begin. The
                    church did not come into full-formed existence in a moment. Regarded as a
                    community with more or less of an organization upon a Christian basis, and
                    conscious of itself and of its aim in the history of the world, it was the
                    result of the activity of Christ and his more immediate apostles and followers
                    The history of what they did in giving existence to the church, as such, is a
                    different thing from the history of the church when once existing in that
                    character. The case resembles the difference between embryology and biography in
                    the history of the individual. The precise point of time at which the formative
                    activity of the church founders issues in the actual church is probably to be
                    determined by the emergence of the consciousness of a common Christian life and
                    aim among the separate communities originally established by apostolic labour.
                    By some writers this is placed as low as the destruction of Jerusalem, by others
                    as high as the first rallying of Christ’s <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n774/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0774-0761"/> followers after his own disappearance from the
                    world. In any case church history is relieved of a large amount of work with
                    which it is sometimes burdened, but which does not properly fall to its
                    share.</p>
                <p>What church history has to do within the limits thus indicated will perhaps be
                    best understood by considering its province as a department of scientific
                    theology, and its relations to the theological disciplines with which it stands
                    most closely connected, those, namely, of dogmatics and the history of doctrine.
                    Strictly speaking, the history of doctrine is part of the history of the church.
                    To exhaust its task, a history of the church must embrace at least <hi
                    rend="italic">five</hi> departments of inquiry and narrative,— <hi rend="italic"
                    >one</hi> connected with the external relations of the church to the world at
                    large and its political institutions, the remaining <hi rend="italic">four</hi>
                    treating of developments and relations internal to the church itself. (1) The
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Progress</hi> of the church must be described, either
                    positively, in respect of its advance, or negatively, with reference to its
                    retrogression, at any given period. To exist at all, it must exist under one or
                    other of these conditions; it must be either attaining or missing, approaching
                    or receding from, its rightful influence on the social condition and political
                    organization of mankind. (2) Its <hi rend="smallcaps">Constitution</hi> must be
                    described. The church exists as such, in virtue of its constitution. It is not
                    the church until it is to some extent organized, and the growth and forms of
                    this organization must be recorded. (3) The <hi rend="smallcaps">Doctrine</hi>
                    of the church at the various points of its development must be set forth.
                    Doctrine is the full and finished expression of conviction, and since the church
                    owes its existence to certain convictions, some religious, some moral, the
                    history of doctrine occupies the very central position of the church’s history.
                    (4) <hi rend="smallcaps">Worship,</hi> under one form or another, is an
                    essential development of church life, as well as one of the modes in which it
                    announces its existence, and calls for historical recognition. (5) <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Life,</hi> as exhibited in the number and character of the
                    members of the church, completes the division of the matter of its history.
                    Doctrine and worship are directed to certain practical ends, either of making
                    proselytes to the church, or of perfecting the character of those who already
                    belong to it, and any such results must be collected and presented both in their
                    numerical and their moral aspects.</p>
                <p>But while the history of the church, in the strict and comprehensive sense, must
                    treat fully these various classes of activity, there is a narrower, if also a
                    somewhat looser sense in which it may be taken, for ends of practical
                    convenience. We may distinguish between the organization and its life, between
                    the church and Christianity. On this view, doctrine, worship, and hfe fall to be
                    treated collectively by the history of the Christian religion or in separate
                    histories, while the history of the church becomes a narrative of the successes
                    or defeats experienced in the world by the Christian community and the varying
                    forms of its constitutional framework, with only such allusions to the internal
                    and religious side of its life as are necessary to explain its constitutional
                    changes and external fortunes. By this division it becomes possible to treat
                    both the inner and the outer sides of the subject, each for itself, and
                    therefore more fully and vividly. In this way, since doctrine lies at the
                    foundation of worship and hfe, and even constitution, the history of doctrine
                    becomes the key to the whole history of the church, and the indispensable
                    preliminary to a scientific comprehension of it. The hfe and action of the
                    church in the world are simply the expression of the ideas by which it is
                    governed; and it is the business of the historian of doctrine to record the
                    vicissitudes and developments of these, whether he writes in the interests of
                    mere knowledge and with absolute impartiality, or, as is more common, though
                    less scientific, with a bias in favour of a certain class of ideas, all
                    divergences from which he chronicles as errors. The difference between church
                    history read in the light of the history of doctrine and apart from it is like
                    the difference which the phenomena of health and disease present to minds that
                    possess or that want an acquaintance with the principles of physiology.</p>
                <p>Church history, including or co-ordinate with history of doctrine, stands in an
                    important relation to dogmatics. Dogmatics (which also contributes the formal as
                    well as, in part, the material element in Christian ethics) is charged with the
                    scientific statement and proof of whatever is held to be the true doctrine. In
                    the sphere of statement the history of the church is necessary, both as
                    introduction and commentary. Doctrine is a growth, an evolution of part after
                    part, under the influence of special circumstances at special times. The full
                    meaning of doctrine can therefore often be understood only in the light of its
                    antithesis, and its relative importance as essential or accidental ascertained
                    only from the practical crisis which demanded its declaration,—aids for which
                    recourse must be had to the history of the church and its doctrine. As regards,
                    therefore, the scientific articulation, proportioning, and interpretation of
                    doctrine, church history stands in the position of an essential preliminary to
                    dogmatics.</p>
                <p>As regards actual church life, and any new expression of it in worship,
                    constitution, or propagandist effort, that assumes to be based on scientific
                    principle, the history of the church is indispensable, not only for the extended
                    view of present circumstances that may be requisite, but also to enable the
                    church fully to know and judge its own mind. The existing church consciousness
                    is the product of all the past, and cannot be fully understood and criticized
                    except in the light of its history.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Sources</hi> of church history are either Monumental
                    or Documentary. Monumental sources yield such intimatious of past transactions
                    as are to be found on avowed monuments, memorial tablets, gravestones, churches,
                    and other public edifices or private dwellings, or upon articles of antiquity,
                    seals, crucifixes, furniture, vestments, pictures, coins, weapons, &amp;c.
                    Documentary sources, as their name implies, include all manuscript or printed
                    information, whether originals, copies, or oral traditions committed to record.
                    In point of comparative value, the documentary sources are, of course, the more
                    important, being, from the nature of the case, so immeasurably richer in
                    information. At the same time, within their own range, monumental sources are
                    often more valuable than documentary. Forgery has less chance of success in
                    monuments than in documents; and certain classes of facts are frequently
                    commemorated on them which writers do not think of recording. Dates and names
                    and the like have been fixed by inscriptions on coins, &lt;fcc., where documents
                    have proved defective or wrong.</p>
                <p>Documentary sources may be divided from the point of view of their destination
                    into (1) Public and (2) Private, and from that of their authorship into (3)
                    Direct and (4) Indirect. Under the head of public documents we have all
                    deliverances of an official character, such as decrees of councils, Papal bulls,
                    civil legislation affecting the church, rules of life for monastic institutions,
                    liturgies, confessions of faith, and even sermons, theological treatises, <hi
                    rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> Private documents, again, consist of personal memoirs
                    and journals, letters, secret correspondence, and papers not originally intended
                    for the public eye. Then by direct documentary sources are meant those in which
                    we have the actual word of a writer or actor in any event testifying to the
                    nature of the opinion or transaction about which information is desired.
                    Indirect documentary sources are those in which we obtain information about the
                    opinions of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n775/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0775-0762"/> an author or the actions of any historical
                    character, not from statements of his own, but from the testimony of some one
                    else about him. Thus a letter of Constantine would be a direct document in
                    reference to some purpose or performance of his own, while it might be an
                    indirect document in reference to the history or opinions of Athanasius or
                    Arius.</p>
                <p>In collecting and sifting these sources so as to place all and only the right
                    materials available before the church historian, recourse must be had to the
                    sciences of antiquities, bibliography, and diplomatics. Antiquities, in its
                    various divisions of numismatics, ecclesiology, heraldry, &lt;fcc., marshals all
                    the relevant monumental testimony and discriminates the spurious from the
                    genuine; bibliography, taken in its widest sense, as the science which
                    enumerates, classifies, and values all that has been written upon the various
                    heads of human knowledge, states what documentary material is likely to be
                    available at the different stages of inquiry, and where it is to be found; while
                    diplomatics, or the science of documents, defines the genuineness, completeness,
                    and general trustworthiness of the material so indicated.</p>
                <p>Besides these more immediate sources there are collateral sources on which church
                    history must draw in fulfilling its task. These are mainly ecclesiastical
                    philology, the general history of Christendom, with ecclesiastical geography,
                    statistics, and chronology. Ecclesiastical philology points to acquaintance with
                    those languages, more particularly Greek and Latin, in which the chief part of
                    the historical materials is expressed, whether as original or translation. The
                    necessity of this is obvious. Besides this, some knowledge of the general
                    history of Christendom is indispensable to an understanding of the history of
                    the church, just as the special history of the church is essential to a
                    comprehension of general history. The events of the church and of the world are
                    so inextricably bound up together that the one are intelligible only in the
                    light of the other. Hence the history of policy, law, philosophy, literature,
                    and art must be laid under contribution in constructing a full history of the
                    church. Clear treatment further requires acquaintance with ecclesiastical
                    geography and statistics, the distribution of the world into Christian and
                    non-Christiau sections, divisions by patriarchates, dioceses, parishes, ⅛c., and
                    the physical characteristics and social habits of different localities. And
                    along with this, ecclesiastical chronology, the correct arrangement of persons
                    and events, both in their contemporaneous appearance and in their succession to
                    others, is requisite to complete the list of auxiliaries to church history,</p>
                <p>3. After the Sources, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Method</hi> of dealing with them,
                    so as to produce history, falls to be considered. Method here comprises two main
                    divisions,—(1) Criticism and (2) Construction. In the criticism of the materials
                    two qualities have to be called into exercise,—the judicial faculty and historic
                    insight. The judicial faculty has to determine two questions,—first, How far are
                    the sources to be relied on? and second, If to be relied on, what do they really
                    say? The question how far the sources are to be relied on depends on both the
                    ability and the willingness of the writer to tell the truth. As to his ability,
                    we must consider how far he was in a position to be aware of the facts, and to
                    what extent his judgment and penetration are to be trusted in matters of fact.
                    He may have been credulous, or an incompetent or careless observer, or he may
                    have been so greatly biassed by party feeling or personal animosity as to be
                    incapable of forming an impartial opinion. Then, besides the writer’s ability to
                    tell the truth, there must be considered further his willingness to tell it. A
                    writer may be perfectly able to tell the truth, if he liked. But he may not
                    like. He may have reasons or motives of his own for withholding the truth, or
                    even for substituting untruth. In using his sources the historian must be able
                    to judge exactly how far they are in these respects to be relied on. Then
                    supposing he has decided that they may be relied on in a given degree, he must
                    next be able to take from them precisely the testimony as to past fact which
                    they convey, neither more nor less. That is to say, he must be
                    impartial,—capable of holding the scales of fairness evenly, of controlling his
                    mind so as to prevent any preferences of his own from weakening or distorting
                    the statement of fact derivable from his authorities, in favour of his own
                    opinions. The historic insight, which, in addition to the judicial faculty, is
                    essential to the thorough criticism of the materials, is the power of fully
                    comprehending the significance and connection of the facts yielded by the
                    sources, by realizing the point of view of the actors or writers to whom the
                    facts dealt with are due, and determining their import as related to a general
                    philosophy of history, and embraces three forms of insight, which may be called
                    philosophic, psychologic, and Christian. Philosophic insight implies, first of
                    all, ability to enter into the various forms of speculative thought,
                    metaphysical, ethical, or whatever else, that have appeared within the church’s
                    history, and have in greater or less degree influenced its movements. It implies
                    further an ability to see the whole recorded facts and their connection under
                    the light of the philosophy of history; but as this obviously cannot take place
                    until the facts in themselves have been completely understood, this aspect of
                    philosophic insight will come into play only when the others have discharged
                    their function. By psychologic insight is meant knowledge of human nature
                    affected by scientific observation of mind and its operations. The facts of
                    history are created by individuals, and each of them may be interpreted as an
                    exhibition of the will and intellect, of the general subjective state of some
                    one man or body of men. This subjective state, again, may be accounted for, in
                    part at least, by the action of certain preceding facts upon the mind of the man
                    or men in question, which facts again are to be explained as a manifestation of
                    the mind of some preceding man or men, and so on. In short, history is the
                    product of human nature, affected by and dealing with certain external data,
                    natural or supernatural, furnished by God; so that, to understand it, there is
                    needed the ability to place before the imagination what human nature is at any
                    point in or between the moral extremes of goodness and wickedness, and the
                    intellectual extremes of wisdom and folly. By Christian insight is meant special
                    capacity for sympathizing with the spirit and ideas of Christianity. What we
                    have in the history of the church is centrally the mind and motive of Christ
                    organizing itself in a living institution that it may enter into conflict with
                    the evil of the world, and by persuasion subdue it to willing submission. To
                    comprehend the development of facts produced during the activity of such an
                    institution, there would seem to be requisite at the very outset an
                    understanding of the thought and feeling that constitute its inner life; that is
                    to say, there must be an intelligent sympathy with the spirit of the New
                    Testament, which, as the primitive record of the action of Christ’s spirit and
                    career, is, were it on no other ground, the authoritative exposition and medium
                    of the mind of Christ. And not only must there be this acquaintance with the
                    ideas and spiritual impulses of the New Testament, but there would appear to be
                    also necessary some experience of their power. If Christianity be not merely a
                    series of intellectual propositions, but a spiritual force penetrating to the
                    motives of the soul, it can scarcely be adequately comprehended by any one who
                    has not known what it is to yield in his innermost being to Christian
                    influences. For while many of the greatest occurrences in the history of the
                    church have sprung from the spirit of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n776/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0776-0763"/> evil, and are fully intelligible to the historian
                    only in virtue of his own experience of at least germinal evil, a vast number of
                    other events are due to men who were in their degree reproductions of Christ,
                    animated by the single desire to bring about what they believed he would have
                    sought had he been in their circumstances, and ready to submit to any sacrifices
                    that might be demanded as the price of success. To understand fully the genesis
                    of transactions arising out of such a spirit would seem possible only to those
                    who possess the key to their explanation in what is essentially Christian
                    experience.</p>
                <p>The historical materials having been subjected to criticism of the kind
                    indicated, the way is open for the actual construction of the history.
                    Construction embraces arrangement, proportion, and style. Under the head of
                    arrangement there falls to be considered how the material of history is to be
                    divided so as to give the most complete and just conception of what has occurred
                    within the time to be dealt with. It is obvious that we cannot take in all the
                    events of so great a narrative at one view. We must break it up into a
                    succession of parts, and study each by itself; and the question is on what
                    principle should this partition of time be made. In history the element of time
                    has to be considered in two phases—succession and contemporaneousness. Biography
                    properly records succession alone. An individual can do only one thing at once;
                    whereas a society like the church, consisting of a number of individuals, can be
                    doing a number of different things at one and the same time. Proselytism,
                    worship, the development of sacred art, the formation of doctrine, the
                    activities of Christian life, may all be in progress simultaneously. Biography
                    is a thread; history is a web, in which time is broad as well as long. In
                    dividing the breadth or contemporaneous movement of the church, no other
                    classification is possible than that natural one, which has already been
                    mentioned, into some such categories as progress, constitution, doctrine,
                    worship, and life. But in dividing history lengthwise, there may be a choice of
                    prin ciples, unless indeed it be denied that events hang together by a causal
                    nexus. The time was when such a denial would have been maintained, when the
                    history of the church was regarded as determined by a series of special
                    interpositions of the Divine will, resulting in a succession of events among
                    which it was not given to human reason to trace the sway of law. That view of
                    things, however, has passed away, and for the modern mind, whatever may be
                    thought of the origin of the church, its history is a sequence of cause and
                    effect, in which the moving forces and tendencies can be accounted for, and
                    their operation traced as the evolution of internal ideas dominating the events
                    of distinct periods, and shaping them into orderly processes. Hence arises the
                    possibility of a natural and an artificial division of history. Arbitrary
                    periods such as centuries or half centuries may be chosen, and an acquaintance
                    with the events of one of such sections acquired before proceeding to those of
                    its successor. This is the artificial mode of division. It has no reference to
                    the nature of the progress made by the church as a growth which is determined by
                    an inner formative thought. But a division in harmony with this latter view of
                    things is possible. There are for instance in the history of the church greater
                    or smaller crises continually occurring, for which the intermediate events are
                    preparations; or there is a certain character stamped upon one era different
                    from that which belongs to another. The conversion of Constantine, or the
                    sitting of the Councils of Nice, Trent, or the Vatican, is an instance of the
                    one; the prevalence of the ancient and patristic, the mediaeval and scholastic,
                    the modern and scientific mode of thought is an instance of the other. Divisions
                    of the matter of church history according to such events or characteristics are
                    natural divisions; they correspond with the nature of the thing, and rise out of
                    the subject itself, instead of being imposed upon it from without, like the
                    division into centuries and half-centuries, which in many cases may lead to a
                    misconception of the meaning of history, cutting into the very middle of a
                    development before it has reached its climax, so rendering both parts
                    unintelligible, or at all events misrepresenting both. The natural division is
                    thus much better adapted than the artificial to impart a view of the subject as
                    it exists in its real parts. If a framework is to be taken to pieces, with a
                    view to understand its structure, it ought to be separated at the joints, not
                    broken, as it were, across the bones. At the same time, within the great natural
                    periods, once their limits and determining conditions are clearly understood,
                    the subdivision into more or less artificial periods of years facilitates the
                    taking up of all the requisite information as we go along, very much as in a
                    long journey, when once we know the direction or destination of travel, it is
                    necessary to divide the intervening space into such arbitrary stages as are
                    suitable to our footsteps or other modes of progress.</p>
                <p>Proportion has to be considered in the construction of church history for two
                    reasons,—one depending on the relative prominence of different phases of church
                    life at different times, the other on the relation of church life to its
                    territorial or sectarian distribution. As regards the first of these reasons,
                    while the categories of progress, constitution, doctrine, worship, and life
                    furnish, in the order of interdependence, a summary of headings under which the
                    movement of the church at any time may be exhaustively described, it is obvious
                    that whichever of these categories represents the main feature of the
                    ecclesiastical condition during any particular period should receive a
                    corresponding prominence and fulness of treatment in the history of the period.
                    At one time the progress of the church in the conquest of adverse religions may
                    be the most striking thing about it, at another it may be the formation of
                    doctrine, at another development of ritual, and so on. To be a faithful reflex
                    of the facts, history must proportion its treatment to the case, assigning the
                    principal place to the principal thing, and grouping the rest around it. The
                    other reason for observing proportion in historical treatment lies in the
                    territorial and sectarian distribution of the church’s life. National almost
                    necessarily imply ecclesiastical distinctions. The German, Swiss, French,
                    English, Scottish churches, &amp;c., have all separate domestic histories, so
                    that while one has been growing in one direction, another may have been growing
                    in a direction entirely different. Controversial differences have had the same
                    result. The Eastern and Western churches for example, ever since the period of
                    the final schism, have had in each case a self-contained development. The same
                    remark applies also to Protestantism and Catholicism, in regard to that vast
                    extent of thought and action in which they are separated from one another. This
                    state of things compels many to specialize their work, and to pursue one
                    national or sectional stream of ecclesiastical movement to the end, before
                    exploring another; but wherever church history on anything like the universal
                    scale is attempted, the writer must determine where and how the vitality and
                    force of the church are for the time evolving themselves most characteristically
                    and influentially, and give to such localities or forms the central position in
                    his delineations. Thus in the earlier centuries, the East, the conquest of
                    paganism and the rise of theology may claim his chief attention; in the Middle
                    Ages, Rome and the Papacy, or scholasticism; in the Reformation period Germany
                    may seem the centre of Christendom; in the modern period the disintegrating
                    influence of philosophy and historical criticism may be regarded as the leading
                    phenomenon, &amp;c.</p>

                <p>With respect to style, apart from the general canons on the matter derivable from
                    the science of rhetoric, there are one or two special conditions dictated to the
                    church historian by the nature of his subject. He is engaged on a description of
                    what is a lively and varied panorama of events— his model, therefore, should be
                    the picture, not the inventory. He is dealing with the progress of a divine idea
                    through the ages—he is bound to leave a certain impression of majesty on the
                    mind of his reader. He is handling matters that concern all men, and that have
                    moved the profoundest and the most passionate natures to the very depth of their
                    being—his pages should be alive wth genuine biographical interest and every
                    relevant form of human sympathy.</p>
                <p>4. The history of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Literature</hi> of the subject divides
                    itself naturally into three periods, which may be called the Unscientific, the
                    Transition, and the Scientific periods. Speaking roughly, the Unscientific
                    period may be said to have lasted until the Reformation, the Transition from the
                    Reformation to the time of Mosheim, and the Scientific since then.</p>
                <p>The Unscientific period of church history is marked by the absence of
                    impartiality, of thorough criticism, of natural arrangement, and of what, since
                    the days of Polybius, has been called the pragmatic method, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ix.,</hi> the treatment of historical phenomena with reference to their causes.
                    The idea of the subjection of history to law had not yet emerged. The church
                    especially was governed by arbitrary divine interpositions, whose effects could
                    not, in any degree, be calculated beforehand; and as the conception of general
                    councils as the organs of the Holy Spirit gained ground, that of ecclesiastical
                    events, and particularly doctrine, as developments in the sequence of ordinary
                    cause and effect vanished more completely if that were possible. History was
                    simply a collection of incidents, often incredibly marvellous, threaded by no
                    connection except that of appearing to intimate the favour of God for the
                    Catholic Church, and with no other arrangement than the arbitrary one of years,
                    or decades of years, or of the reigns of emperors or popes. This was simply the
                    period of the collection of materials for subsequent scientific history to sift
                    and work into proper form. During the six first centuries the Greek Church
                    furnished almost all that was valuable in church history, but after that it
                    ceased to be productive, and Latin writers took possession of the field. At the
                    head of the Greek School stands Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea in the earlier part
                    of the 4th century, usually called the father of church history, although that
                    title strictly belongs to Hegesippus, who about the middle of the 2d century
                    wrote certain ecclesiastical memorials, all of which have perished, with the
                    exception of a few fragments mostly preserved by Eusebius himself. The history
                    or chronicle of Eusebius, coming down to 324 <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.,</hi>
                    although impaired in value by the writer’s avowed resolution to record only what
                    would reflect honour on the church, is rich in material, the archives of the
                    empire having been placed at his command by Constantine, who held him in
                    peculiar esteem. The other Greek historians were simply continuators of
                    Eusebius. Socrates and Sozomen brought down the narrative to 439, and Theodoret
                    to 428. Of these Socrates writes the best style, while Theodoret gives most new
                    documents and information, especially as to the East. Evagrius treated of
                    affairs from 431 to 594, while Philostorgius, most of whose work is lost, wrote,
                    in the Arian interest, a history from the rise of Arianism to 423. The only
                    other Greek historians of any note are Eutychius of Alexandria, about 940, who
                    is chiefly valuable on the relations of Mohammedanism and Christianity, and
                    Nicephoros Callisti of Constantinople, about 1350, who, with the assistance of
                    the documents in the library of St Sophia, wrote a church history to the end of
                    the 6th century. To these may be added, as completing the Greek sources, the
                    ecclesiastical allusions in the long line of Byzantine civil historians from 500
                    to 1500.</p>
                <p>Among the earlier Latin writers, Rufinus translated Eusebius and added an
                    indifferent continuation of his own to the end of the 4th century. Sulpicius
                    Severus, a terse writer, sometimes called the Christian Sallust, wrote a history
                    from the creation to the year 400. Cassiodorus, in the middle of the 4th
                    century, first a Government official of theOstro-Gothic empire, and latterly
                    prior of a monastery, caused a condensed translation of Socrates, Sozomen, and
                    Theodoret to be made, which continued to be authoritative until the revival of
                    letters. From this time to the Reformation, a great amount of historical
                    material was produced both in the form of chronicles and of special and general
                    history. Among the chroniclers may be mentioned the venerable Bede, Regino, Otto
                    of Freisingen, Hermannus Contractus, Lambert of Aschaffenburg, Siegbert of
                    Gemblour, with such anonymous chronicles as that of Monte Casino, the Great
                    Belgian, the Saxon, &lt;fcc., to which maybe added, although it forms perhaps
                    more of a general history, the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pontificalis,</hi> or lives of the popes to 885, of uncertain authorship. Of
                    the writers of special histories are worthy of mention—Gregory of Tours, the
                    historian of the French Church during the 5th and 6th centuries, and the father
                    of French church history; the venerable Bede, the father of English church
                    history, and its narrator to the middle of the 8th century; Paul the deacon, who
                    did the same office for the same period in the case of the Lombards; Adam of
                    Bremen, the authority for Scandinavian church history from the 9th to the 11th
                    century; and Kranz, who died the year that witnessed the outbreak of the
                    Reformation, and who furnished sources for the ecclesiastical history of Saxony
                    and Westphalia. Of histories of the universal church during this period may be
                    mentioned those of Haymo of Halberstadt in 840, embracing the four first
                    centuries; of Odericus Vitalis, from the Christian era to the 12th century; and
                    of Bartholomew of Lucca to the 14th; while the greatest work of preReformation
                    times on the subject is the <hi rend="italic">Summa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Historialis</hi> of Antoninus of Florence, narrating events from the creation
                    of the world to 1459. All these works, it must be remembered, are full of
                    legends and fables, and exhibit a credulous spirit.</p>
                <p>The Transition period in church history may be taken as beginning with the
                    Reformation. It was marked on all sides by a more searching and comprehensive
                    survey of the sources, and on some sides by an absence of the credulity, which
                    accepted tradition as genuine, and every act and utterance of the dominant
                    church as divinely guided. It was, however, still for the most part devoid of
                    the spirit of impartiality and of the idea of law as traceable in the succession
                    of events, and consequently recognized no great and gradually evolved crises in
                    history, naturally dividing it into periods. It was an approach to the
                    scientific, without actually reaching it. It was stimulated and aided by the
                    same causes which assisted the Reformation itself. The spirit of inquiry was
                    abroad. Already, in the field of the history of the church, Laurentius Valla had
                    led the way in the direction of true criticism by discrediting the legend of the
                    donation of Constantine, in which he had been followed to a certain extent even
                    by Antoninus. The rise of humanism, consequent on the fall of Constantinople and
                    migration of Greek scholars to the West, had unlocked the store-house of
                    material contained in that language, while the invention of printing, by
                    bringing the sources under the eye of an immensely enlarged and practically
                    unlimited circle of observers, increased proportionally the chances of unpledged
                    criticism. It was the shock of the Reformation <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n778/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0778-0765"/> itself, however, which gave the impetus to the
                    new movement in the construction of church history. As Protestantism had
                    everywhere broken more or less completely with tradition, it was for its
                    interest to show that Catholicism had departed from primitive purity, and that
                    the history of the church had been a steady course of declension, while
                    Catholicism was equally interested in proving the contrary. This polemical
                    animus, if it was prejudicial to impartiahty of investigation, added to its
                    keenness and thoroughness; and as the spirit of sectarianism developed, within
                    Catholicism, between Ultramontanism and Gallicanism, Jesuitism and Jansenism,
                    and, within Protestantism, between Lutheranism and Philippism, Calvinism and
                    Arminianism, Presbyterianism and Episcopacy, the zeal of each party to vindicate
                    for itself an exclusive apostolical pedigree, led to an unflinching, if
                    one-sided, sifting of history, especially of primitive antiquity. The way was
                    led in this direction by the <hi rend="italic">Magdeburg Centuries,</hi> so
                    called from the place of first publication in 1559. This was a work written by a
                    staff of Lutheran scholars, in the interest of their phase of Protestantism,
                    under the superintendence of Matthias Flacius, and was, from its own point of
                    view, a performance of great ability and learning, continuing for a century to
                    be the store-house of general Protestant polemics. As its name implies, it
                    adopts the artificial division into centuries, discussing the doctrine,
                    heresies, councils, ceremonies, church rulers, &lt;fcc., in each. The published
                    portion stops with the 13th century. The <hi rend="italic">Centuries</hi> evoked
                    on the Catholic side, in 1588, the <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Annals</hi>
                    of Caesar Baronius, afterwards cardinal, bringing the history down to the end of
                    the 12th century; and this, with the continuations of Raynaldus and others, and
                    the critical commentary of Pagi, forms, from its richness in documents that
                    would otherwise have remained inaccessible, a very valuable contribution to
                    general church history, although written avowedly to present Catholicism in the
                    most favourable light. These great polemical histories led the way for a train
                    of successors on both sides. Kortholt, Spanheim, Casaubon, and Basnage
                    criticized with learning and vigour the one-sidedness of Baronius. On the
                    Catholic side, a brilliant French school of church history arose, whose chief
                    ornaments were—Alexander Natalis (Noel), whose history (1676), valuable for its
                    learned excursuses, though placed in the Index on account of its Gallicanism,
                    continues under the corrective commentaries of Noncaglia and Mansi to hold a
                    deservedly high place even in Catholic esteem; Bossuet, whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Variations of Protestantism</hi> (1688) exhibits the dexterous
                    controversialist not less than his <hi rend="italic">Discourse on Universal
                    History,</hi> displays the philosophical historian; Fleury, who narrates, with a
                    tinge of Gal· licanism, the story of fourteen Christian centuries in a style as
                    popular and flowing as Natalis, is crowded with erudite discussion; and
                    Tillemont, the Jansenist, who in his <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    Emperors</hi> (to Anastasius) (1690), and his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs for the
                    Church History of the six first centuries</hi> (1693), has ransacked the whole
                    field of available materials, and presented, with much skill and fidelity, his
                    narrative in the exact words of his authorities. In the meantime a school of
                    history had developed itself in England, also in answer to controversial wants,
                    of which Jewel <hi rend="italic">{Apology,</hi> 1562), Pearson, <hi
                    rend="italic">{Vindicioe,</hi> 1672), Beveridge <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Syn,odicoη,</hi> 1672), Cave <hi rend="italic">{Primitive Christianity, Lives
                    of the Apostles and Fathers,</hi> 1672-77), and Bingham <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Antiquities,</hi> 1708-22) may be mentioned as leaders in the defence, on
                    historical grounds, of the position of the Anglican Church both against
                    Catholicism and Puritanism.</p>
                <p>The Scientific period of church history may be said to commence with the great
                    work of Mosheim in 1755, based on an earlier but inferior performance. Isolated
                    attempts had indeed been made before his time to rise above the heated polemical
                    atmosphere of the Reformation struggle and its results, into a region of calmer
                    contemplation. The celebrated Calixtus of Helmstadt had, during the earlier part
                    of the 17th century, laboured hard to show that the tendency to the
                    multiplication of dogma characteristic of his time is foreign to the genius of
                    Christianity, whose essence, in his view, may be reduced to a very few points of
                    faith; and Gottfried Arnold, sometime professor at Giessen, had, in 1699,
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Impartial History of the Church and the
                    Heretics,</hi> the practical issue of which was to show that the heretics were
                    quite as often in the right as the church; but the only immediate result of
                    their efforts was to raise a violent storm of opposition and abuse against
                    themselves, proving that the time was not ripe for applying the maxim of <hi
                    rend="italic">audi alteram partem</hi> to ecclesiastical questions. But by the
                    middle of the 18th century, a different state of things had arisen. The living
                    fire had died out of theological and ecclesiastical controversy, leaving behind
                    only confused piles of dogma, charred and cold, to which none thought of
                    repairing for heat. The speculations of Descartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Wolf, Ac.,
                    had given the world something deeper to think about than the disputes of
                    ecclesiastics, and had engendered that spirit of thorough inquiry after reality,
                    which in the theological sphere came to be called rationalism, and in physics
                    the inductive or Baconian method. In the latter form it had exploded the
                    conception of continued arbitrary supernatural interference in the course of
                    events, and established the belief in the reign of law, the statutes against
                    witchcraft having been abolished even in England by 1736, a few years after the
                    last execution there for that imaginary crime.</p>
                <p>Mosheim may be called the first fruits of this spirit in the region of church
                    history. His <hi rend="italic">Institutes of Ecclesiastical History</hi> is
                    constructed avowedly in the interests of science and not of party, with the sole
                    view of stating the facts, fully and exactly as they occurred—ascertaining and
                    declaring the objective reality, independently of subjective partialities or
                    wishes. His fidelity to his principle is conspicuous, and his success in
                    overturning many previous misrepresentations arising from the neglect of it is
                    undoubted. His conception of Christian history as a growth under the law of
                    cause and effect is also unmistakable, although he leaves it to be inferred, not
                    so much from the presence of any avowed pragmatic treatment in his pages, as
                    from the absence of everything else. Although he retains the artificial division
                    into centuries out of deference to custom, he acknowledgesits objectionableness,
                    and combines with it a natural division “bounded by great revolutions and
                    changes in the state of the church.” Mosheim has had a train of successors on
                    his own line of investigation, whose name is legion, and in whose hands the
                    scientific method has been steadily developed, and has yielded an increasing
                    harvest of results. Only a few can be mentioned. Schröckh, an ornament of the
                    Göttingen school of history, second only to Mosheim himself, whose pupil he was,
                    laboured for forty-one years (1768-1809) at a <hi rend="italic">Universal
                    History of the Church,</hi> and brought it down well through the period of the
                    Reformation, two supplementary volumes by Tzschirner, not unworthy of their
                    place, completing the period. This work, in 45 volumes, a huge monument of
                    erudition, clearness, and fairness, is still the quarry of compilers. Gieseler,
                    improving on the method of Tillemont, which had already been partially followed
                    by Schmidt and Danz, in 1824 began his <hi rend="italic">Universal History of
                    the Church</hi> on the plan of exhibiting in his text merely such an outline of
                    the results of his researches as should, without discussion, present a rapid and
                    succinct view of the march and evolution of events, giving in ample, notes the
                    evidence from the sources on which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n779/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0779-0766"/> the statements in the text are based. As a means
                    by which a careful student may rapidly test the value of historical conclusions,
                    Gieseler’s work has no superior. A year afterwards, Neander, inspired by
                    Schleiermacher, afterwards epitomized by Guericke, and popularized by Hagenbach,
                    issued the first instalment of his <hi rend="italic">General History of the
                    Christian Religion and Church.</hi> The distinguishing characteristic of this
                    great work is its emphatic recognition of the function of history to explain
                    events from their causes, as well as to state them in their objective reality.
                    Neander treats ecclesiastical institutions and events as the necessary outgrowth
                    and embodiment of the peculiar condition of Christian ideas and aims at the
                    given time, and his undoubted and profound sympathy with the essential spirit
                    and conception of Christianity, and capacity for tracing these under various
                    forms of manifestation, enable him to throw a light upon the facts of the
                    church’s history, and to account for them in ways that are always interesting,
                    sometimes even fascinatingly so, whatever opinion may be ultimately taken of
                    their critical accuracy. Ranke, although his work has been confined to special
                    histories, has exercised a great influence on the course of scientific church
                    history. In his <hi rend="italic">History of the Popes</hi> (1834-6), and
                    especially in his <hi rend="italic">German History of the Reformation
                    Period</hi> (1839-47), he has furnished a brilliant example of the method in
                    which ecclesiastical facts in all their relations are to be investigated,
                    arranged, and explained. But probably no writer of the century has left a deeper
                    impress on the method of studying and constructing church history than F. C.
                    Baur, who, from 1835 to his death in 1860, gave to the world a series of works
                    bearing on this subject, and culminating in his great <hi rend="italic">Church
                    History,</hi> which, for wealth of erudition and variety of genius, give him a
                    unique position even in the land of great scholars that claims his fame.
                    Whatever may be thought of his special conclusions, it is certain that since his
                    labours, the study of the history of Christianity, especially during the earlier
                    centuries, must be a far more thorough and profound thing than ever it was
                    before. He may, as has been said of him, be too unwilling to admit the
                    possibility of an entirely new germ of spiritual force in the inception of
                    Christianity, he may be too much warped by a Hegelian tendency to resolve all
                    historical movements into an alternation of antagonisms and conciliation, but
                    his vast mastery of details and marvellous power of marshalling far-scattered
                    facts in support of a startling and unexpected theory have necessitated a new
                    and more penetrating scrutiny of early sources, which is far from being
                    completed at this hour. Some of his results will probably be found of permanent
                    value, and it is certain that in his-conception and working out of the history
                    of dogma he has explained the formation of general ideas in theology, and their
                    power in shaping the course of the church’s history, in a way that was needed to
                    counterbalance and supplement at once the objectivity of Gieseler, and the
                    sentimentality of Neander.</p>
                <p>In the Roman Catholic Church, of course, scientific church history in the true
                    sense is not to be expected; but there have been movements towards it, and
                    painstaking contributions have been made, which may prove useful in the hands of
                    an unfettered writer. The great collectors of the Acts of Councils, Labbé,
                    Hardouin, and above all, Mansi, we owe to the Catholic Church. Stolberg,
                    Katercamp, Ritter, and Locherer have written the. history of their church from
                    separate points of view that are full of interest, while the names of Möhler,
                    Döllinger, and Montalembert do not need to be further characterized. The manuals
                    of Alzog and Krauz are of great value. Hefele’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Councils</hi> is a mine of thoroughly sifted information.</p>
                <p>Besides the powerful but one-sided ecclesiastical chapters of Gibbon, the
                    original researches of Routh and Burton, and the splendid works of Milman on
                    Christianity and Latin Christianity, replete with critical sagacity, graphic
                    power, and philosophic insight, Great Britain has not produced anything that
                    deserves to be set beside the Continental masterpieces. Much valuable material
                    in the form of historical monographs, biographies, and archaeological issues by
                    individuals and societies has been produced both in England and Scotland, but
                    nothing that deserves the name of a great church history, whether special or
                    universal The tractarian movement has stimulated a certain amount of antiquarian
                    research, and Canon Robertson of Canterbury has compiled a useful history of the
                    church to the period of the Reformation.</p>
