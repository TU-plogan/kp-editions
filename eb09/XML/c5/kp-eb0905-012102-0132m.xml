                    doing so we find ourselves at the beginning not at the end of our difficulty.
                    Fanfani, whose dictionary is constructed on the basis of the Della Crusca
                    vocabulary, gives only “Carnevale.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>But the Della Crusca <hi rend="italic">vocαbolαriα</hi>
                    itself, as well as Du Cange, Mπratori, and other authorities, give either form,
                    Carnevale or Carnovale.</p></note> Moroni also in his ecclesiastical dictionary
                    gives both “Carnevale” and “Carnovale.” Boiste, following the “Académie,” gives
                    “Carnaval,” as the French form. Facciolati in his appendix of low Latin terms
                    gives only <hi rend="italic">Carnispriviĭirn.</hi> Our mode of writing
                    “Carnival” would seem, therefore, to be the only possible way of spelling the
                    word which is unsupported by the authority of other languages; yet, if that
                    which seems to be the most obvious, and is the most generally accepted meaning
                    and derivation of the word, be the correct one, “Carnival” is surely the most
                    natural form of a word intended to express “farewell to flesh-meat,”— <hi
                    rend="italic">Car</hi><hi rend="italic">ni-</hi><hi rend="italic">vale.</hi> But
                    there are sufficiently strong reasons for doubting whether such be really the
                    etymology of the word. And the generally received notion seems to have naturally
                    suggested itself to those who, understanding the term in its modern, popular,
                    and specially non-Italian meaning, to signify the few last days of licence and
                    feasting immediately preceding Lent, have supposed that this feasting was meant
                    as a sort of valedictory consolation for the privations about to follow. But
                    such is not the proper meaning of the term, and it is hardly yet popularly so
                    understood in Italy. It is still very commonly taken there to signify the whole
                    of the time from the first day of the year to Shrove Tuesday inclusive. But
                    neither is this accurately correct. Carnival time properly begins with the day
                    following the festival of the Epiphany, that is the 7th of January, and lasts
                    till midnight on Shrove Tuesday. Now, although it may be natural enough for
                    those who consider “Carnival” to mean the three or four days of revelry which
                    immediately precede Lent to imagine that such revelry celebrates their coming
                    forty days of abstinence, it is hardly likely that a season of the year
                    beginning between two and three months before such “farewell to flesh” should be
                    named from that circumstance. The Della Cruscans, with Du Cange and Muratori,
                    suppose the word to be derived from <hi rend="italic">Carn-avallare
                    (avallare,</hi> Ital. to swallow), from the greater quantity of flesh-meat used
                    at that time of the year. But the Spaniards,following the older low Latin phrase
                    “Carnis-privium,” speak of Carnival as <hi rend="italic">Carnes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tollendas.</hi> And the phrase met with in the older
                    ecclesiastical writers, <hi rend="italic">Cαrnis-priυium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sacerdotum,</hi> (applied to the period beginning with Sexagesima Sunday, from
                    the fact of the regular clergy of most rules having practised a partial
                    abstinence from that day till the beginning of Lent), would not seem to favour
                    the supposition. It is to be observed also that there is another name for the
                    period of carnival, once quite as common in Italy as that of which we are
                    speaking, though now nearly obsolete, <hi rend="italic">Carnαsciale</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and Mura tori says that he has nothing to oppose to those
                    who think that <hi rend="italic">Carnevale</hi> is merely another form of <hi
                    rend="italic">Camasciale,</hi> the meaning of which is to abound in (or use
                    unrestrictedly) flesh,— <hi rend="italic">came scialare.</hi> Ferrario, on the
                    other hand, maintains that the word was originally merely the same with
                    “Carnalia,” indicating an <pb break="no"

                    observance, and used in the same way as “Saturnalia,” “Liberalia,” &amp;c.</p>
                <p>And, in fact, whatever may have been the origin of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >word,</hi> there can be little doubt that the origin of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >thing</hi> dates from ante-Christian times. The Bacchanalian festivals of
                    antiquity were celebrated by the Romans, who adopted them from older nations,
                    twice in the year, indicating the early connection of those rites with the
                    phenomena of the solar system, in the winter and in the summer. And the
                    primitive church, finding it, doubtless, impossible to suppress, as it would
                    fain have done, those popular revels, adopted its usual policy of at least
                    fitting them in to its system, and assigning to them a meaning connected with
                    its own practices and observances. The Lupercalian festival in honour of Pan and
                    Ceres, observed in February (which Pope Gelasius I., who died in 496, strove to
                    supersede by substituting for them the festival of the Purification of the
                    Blessed Virgin, with special illumination of candles on the altar <hi
                    rend="italic">Candlemass)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> also coincided with the
                    period of carnival, as did also (at a little earlier period of the year) the
                    mediaeval celebration of the Festival of Fools, equally a survival of the same
                    old Pagan midwinter revelling. Specially the use of masks and torches can be
                    traced as the continuation of ancient practices.</p>
                <p>The spirit of compromise, which has so generally characterized the dealings of
                    the church with “the world” is very notable in its attitude towards the popular
                    observances of carnival; and more especially so, as needs must have been the
                    case, in those cities in which the Pope was temporal ruler as well as spiritual
                    pastor. For many generations past these carnival gala doings, especially at
                    Rome, were recognized as an important element in the material prosperity of the
                    city. They were good for trade. They induced large numbers of people, foreigners
                    and provincials, to throng to Rome. The Government of the popes, accordingly,
                    not only looked leniently on carnival excesses, but took active steps to promote
                    and assist the revelry. But the Pope was at the same time the universal bishop
                    of souls! And, as the writer of Moroni’s dissertation on the subject says, “If
                    the church tolerates the inveterate custom of carnivalesque diversions,
                    especially the masquerades, groaning all the while, it promotes exercises of
                    piety at the same time, since the consequences of these travesties are
                    dangerous, as affording opportunités for immoral conduct. And the Bacchanalian
                    revelries of carnival, which are nothing else than an imitation of the
                    abominable debauches of Pagans, when they abandon themselves to their passions,
                    have been constantly denounced by the voice of reason, by that of the gospel, by
                    the sacred canons, by the councils, and by all the pontiffs and zealous pastors
                    of the churches, from the earliest ages down to our own days. The church from
                    Septuagesima Sunday covers her altars, and her ministers assume vestments of
                    penitence. She suspends the song of Hallelujah, and mingles tearsand sighs of
                    sadness with the joyous accents of the people. She assumes purple-coloured
                    vestments and altar-cloths in sign of mourning, supresses her hymns, and
                    proposes for our contemplation the fatal fall of our first parents, and the
                    lamentable effects of that great sin.” But at the same time the Cardinal Vicar,
                    in whose hands was the police of Rome, was giving special permission for the
                    wearing of masks in the streets, naming the days when people might pelt each
                    other with sham comfits, regulating the exact size and nature of these, and
                    planning the whole arrangement of the revels. Clement IX. (ob. 1669) meanwhile
                    used to shut himself every year during carnival in the convent of St Sabina cn
                    the Aventine, that he might at least not see what he could not avoid tolerating.
                    Clement XL, in 1719 and 1721, issued two apostolical briefs with the view of
                    repressing the licence of carnival. Benedict XIIL (ob. 1730) always passed the
                    carnival in the strictest retirement in the Dominican convent of St Sixtus.
                    Benedict XIV, (ob. 1758) strove, by an encyclical letter of the 1st of January
                    1748, to moderate some of the worst excesses of licentiousness to which the
                    carnival every year gave rise. But his efforts mainly restricted themselves to
                    the merely formal points of insisting that the revelry should not be prolonged
                    beyond the midnight of Shrove Tuesday, and forbidding the appearance of masks in
                    the streets on Sundays and Fridays; adding a promise of plenary indulgence to
                    all who would contribute to counterbalance the sins of carnival by the practice
                    of certain extra devotional exercises during those days. Nevertheless, in the
                    last years which preceded the destruction of the Pope’s temporal power, when the
                    inhabitants of Rome were bent on manifesting by every possible means their
                    discontent at the ruling order of things, and their desire to associate
                    themselves with the rest of liberated and united Italy, and for this reason were
                    disposed to abstain from all carnival rejoicings, the priestly Government did
                    everything in its power to promote the usual holiday doings, and excite the
                    people to the accustomed revelry.</p>
                <p>The Roman Carnival is recorded by several contemporary writers of records and
                    diaries to have-been especially splendid during the papacy of the great Farnese
                    Pope Paul III., 1534-1549,—days when Rome was still overflowing with wealth sent
                    thither by all tributary Christendom. And the year 1545 is mentioned by several
                    chroniclers as having been marked by special magnificence. The carnival sports
                    seem at that time to have consisted mainly of three divisions, the races in the
                    Corso (which, formerly called the Via Lata, took its present name from them),
                    and the spectacular pageants of the “Agona,” now the Piazza Navona, and of the
                    Testaccio. The races seem to have taken place on each of the eight days which
                    were then held to constitute the period devoted to holidaymaking. These races
                    seem to have prevailed in one form or another from time immemorial; and before
                    they were run in the Corso, as at present, took place in the open space in the
                    neighbourhood of the Porta St Sebastiano, not far from the present Protestant
                    cemetery. It was in the time of Paul II. (ob. 1471) that they were moved to the
                    Corso. The Piazza del Popolo, which now forms the starting-place, was not then
                    in existence. The races started from the Arch of Domitian, in the immediate
                    vicinity of the Palazzo Fiano, and terminated in the Piazza di Venezia, so named
                    from the huge palace, now the property of Austria, which the Venetian Pope Paul
                    II. (Barbò) had just built. “In these races,” says the writer in Moroni’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Dizionario,</hi> “ran, during the eight days of carnival, old and
                    young, boys, Jews, horses, asses, and buffaloes, the prizes consisting in a
                    certain flag or banner called <hi rend="italic">palio.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,i</hi> The institution of these races as they existed
                    subsequently, and still exist to the present day, belongs to a subsequent
                    period. The principal feature of the carnival, however, in the days we are
                    speaking of, consisted in the so-called sports, “giuochi,” of the Agona and the
                    Monte Testaccio. The former seem to have consisted of little more than one of
                    those colossal processions of which that age was so fond. A full account of
                    those processions may be found in a MS. preserved in the Albani library,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">The True Progression of the Festival of A gone and

                <p>The following account of the games at Monte Testaccío is abridged from
                    Crescimbeni, who has preserved the description left by a contemporary writer.
                    The Testaccio is an artificial mound of considerable size, composed of
                    potsherds, the accumulation of many generations, long since well covered with
                    turf.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0134-0123"/>
                <p>“This place,” says Crescimbeni, “is the finest and most convenient for spectacles
                    that can be imagined. To the west there is the Monte Testaccio; to the east a
                    little eminence on which the monastery of St Saba once stood; on the north that
                    part of the Aventine which Paul III. has fortified, and a few vine-dressers’
                    cottages; to the south are the walls of Rome, with a tower at every hundred
                    feet. All these positions were crowded with people, and all could see
                    conveniently. Besides these commanding positions there were a great number of
                    stands and scaffoldings. In the midst is the large open meadow, on the northern
                    side of which was the dais raised for Madama (the beautiful Julia, sister of
                    Paul Ill., whose recumbent statue may be seen on that Pontiff’s tomb in St
                    Peter’s), which was entirely surrounded by infantry and cavalry.” Then came a
                    procession like that described in the work referred to above, and then
                    “commenced the great hunting match, in which thirteen bulls were slain, and six
                    cars were sent down from Monte Testaccio, on each of which was a red standard
                    and a live pig, in scrambling for which no less efforts were made than in
                    slaying the bulls. Among the many liveried companies seen that day was one of
                    thirty-six mountebanks clad in red, with iron-shod poles in their hands; and
                    these were the first to assail the bulls. But the most splendid thing seen was a
                    company of six cavaliers, consisting of the Cardinal Farnese, the Cardinal Santa
                    Fiorà, the duke of Camerino, the duke of Melfi, the count of Santa Fiora, and
                    the prince of Macedonia. These were dressed as knights of old, and their
                    garments were of gold, and silver, and silk with embroidery and lace, and
                    needlework upon needlework,—such an elegance that I (says the worthy canon) have
                    neither the patience nor the courage to describe it! Their horses, too, were
                    adorned with the same splendour, and they performed such feats of horsemanship
                    (these cardinals !) that the people thought it a miracle! Then three races were
                    run, the first for riderless horses, with a banner of gold brocade for the
                    prize; the second for ridden horses, with a banner of crimson velvet for the
                    prize; and the third, for mares, the prize being a banner of purple velvet. On
                    the last day of carnival there was a race of asses and buffaloes, and as usual
                    there was revelling and tumult in abundance. At night there was a comedy in the
                    Caffarelli palace. On the first day of Lent there was a procession to Santa
                    Sabina, which was so grand that many disputed whether the Carnival or Lent was
                    the finest at Rome !” Many other descriptions, some of them extending to great
                    length, may be found in print among the vast quantity of volumes concerning the
                    Eternal City; there is one especially relating to the doings of 1372. But there
                    is evidence that these games were practised from a much greater antiquity. They
                    were somewhat modified from generation to generation; but ostentation,
                    magnificence in dress, and blood-thirsty cruelty to animals were the unchanging
                    characteristics of them.</p>
                <p>Church writers may represent the excesses of carnival as abhorrent to the church,
                    and may point to the various ordinances of mortification and repentance which
                    she has appointed as a means for atoning for the guilt then contracted by the
                    city. But nothing is more certain than that many of the popes were great patrons
                    and promoters of carnival keeping. Paul IL, the Venetian Barbò, was one of the
                    most notable in this respect. In his time the Jews of Rome were compelled to pay
                    yearly a sum of 1130 golden florins (the thirty being added as a special
                    memorial of Judas and the thirty pieces of silver), which was expended on the
                    carnival. And we have a decree of Paul II. minutely providing for, and arranging
                    the diversions which were to take place in it. Among other things his Holiness
                    orders that four rings of silver gilt should be provided, two in the Piazza
                    Navona, and two at the Monte Testaccio,—one at each place for the burghers and
                    the other for the retainers of the nobles to practise riding at the ring. The
                    Pope also orders a great variety of races, the expense of which are to be paid
                    from the Papal exchequer,—one to be run by the Jews, another for Christian
                    children, another for Christian young men, another for sexagenarians, a fifth
                    for asses, and a sixth for buffaloes. Under Julius III. we have long accounts of
                    bull-hunts—bull-baits we should rather say—in the Forum, with gorgeous
                    descriptions of the magnificence of the dresses, and enormous suppers in the
                    palace of the Conservatori in the Capitol, where seven cardinals, together with
                    the Duke Orazio Farnese, supped at one table, and all the ladies by themselves
                    at another. After the supper the whole party went into the court-yard of the
                    palace, which was turned into the semblance of a theatre, “to see a most
                    charming comedy which was admirably played, and lasted so long that it was not
                    over till ten o’clock !” Even the austere and rigid Caraffa, Paul IV. (ob.
                    1559), used to keep carnival by inviting all the Sacred College to dine with
                    him. The vigorous and terrible Sixtus V., who was elected in 1585, set himself
                    to the keeping of carnival after a different fashion. Finding that the licence
                    then customary and permitted gave rise to much abuse and no few crimes, he
                    prepared for carnival, to the no small dismay and terror of the Romans, by
                    setting up sundry gibbets in several conspicuous places of the town, as well as
                    whipping posts,—the former as a hint to robbers and cut-throats, the latter in
                    store for minor offenders. We find, further, from the provisions made at the
                    time, that Sixtus reformed the evil custom of throwing dirt and dust and flour
                    at passengers, permitting only flowers or sweetmeats to be thrown. The <hi
                    rend="italic">barbèri</hi> (riderless horses) had by this time begun to run
                    regularly every carnival in the Corso; and Sixtus caused a lane to be enclosed
                    with palisades in the centre of the street, along which the horses might run
                    without the danger of causing the accidents which, it seems then, as now, were
                    frequently the result of this sport. He also compelled the people to desist from
                    the old practice of using every kind of violence and trick to impede the <hi
                    rend="italic">barbèri</hi> in their course, for the purpose of favouring this or
                    the other among the competitors.</p>
                <p>It was formerly the custom, especially in the 16th and 17 th centuries, to
                    suspend all carnival observances during the <hi rend="italic">Anno Santo</hi> or
                    jubilee year. Gregory XIII., when he celebrated the eleventh jubilee in 1575,
                    forbade any of the usual carnival celebrations, and ordered that all the money
                    usually expended for the purpose by the Apostolic Chamber should be used for the
                    assistance of poor pilgrims. Clement X., just a hundred years later, on the
                    occasion of the jubilee of 1675, prohibited all carnival celebration, and
                    granted to the Archconfraternity of Pilgrims of the Holy Trinity the 6000 crowns
                    which the Apostolic Chamber was at that period in the habit of spending on the
                    carnival rejoicings, at the same time compelling the Jews to pay over to the
                    same purpose the sums they annually furnished for the barbèri and the prizes of
                    the races. The carnival celebrations have also been frequently suspended on
                    account of the appointed day or days for them having fallen on the date of some
                    church festival. When in the pontificate of Innocent XII. the Wednesday in the
                    last week of carnival chanced to fall on the festival of the Purification of the
                    Virgin, the race of the barbèri which ought to have taken place on the vigil of
                    that festival, was changed to the previous Sunday. On many subsequent occasions
                    the days of the sports have from similar causes been sometimes postponed,
                    sometimes anticipated, and sometimes suppressed. In 1808 Pius VII. forbade all
                    carnival manifestations on account of the French invasion, nor would he permit
                    any to take place in 1809, notwithstanding that the French in the occupation of
                    the city had proclaimed the celebration of the carnival. Of course the Pope had
                    no power to enforce his wish that no sort of carnival rejoicing should take
                    place. But it is remarkable, as indicating the feeling of the population at the
                    time, that the Corso remained entirely deserted and aU the shops shut.</p>
                <p>The later Popes for the most part restricted the public festivities of the
                    carnival to the last six or seven days immediately preceding Ash Wednesday. The
                    municipal authorities of the city, on whom the regulation of such matters now
                    depend, allow ten days. The public are not, however, permitted to do all the
                    things which are understood to constitute the celebration of carnival on all
                    these days indifferently. Some days are appointed for a “gala corso,” i.e., a
                    processional driving up and down the Corso of all those who choose to take part
                    in it, with the handsomest carriages and the finest liveries and horses,
                    &amp;c., they can compass; and on these days consecrated to finery and
                    ostentation nothing save flowers is permitted <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n135/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0135-0124"/> to be thrown, either from the balconies and
                    windows to the carriages, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Other days are
                    set apart for the throwing of “coriandoii,” as they are termed, little round
                    pellets about the size of a pea made of plaster, and manufactured and sold in
                    enormous quantities. These <hi rend="italic">coriandoii</hi> are supposed to
                    represent comfits, which tradition declares to have been the only things thrown
                    in the olden time before the spirit of carnival was, as is supposed, spoiled and
                    vulgarized by the influx of strangers from the north. But the reader has already
                    seen that the flinging of dust, flour, and disagreeable things of all sorts had
                    to be repressed at a very early time. At the present day the principal fun seems
                    to consist in flinging down bushels on bushels of these plaster <hi
                    rend="italic">coriandoii</hi> on the passers in the streets, mainly in the
                    Corso, from the balconies, and in the return fire of these from the cars which
                    pass up and down the Corso. These cars are huge machines, of which a large
                    waggon forms the basis, built up sometimes in the form of a ship, or a castle,
                    or other such device, and made gay-looking with garlands and abundant bright
                    coloured calico. Some dozen or so of young men, generally in uniform fancy
                    dresses, stand on these machines, and work hard at returning, with such best
                    vigour and activity as they may, the pelting they endure from the balconies. The
                    ladies are mainly the occupants of these. All are masked; those who are prudent
                    wear masks of wire gauze, for a handful of these <hi rend="italic"
                    >coriandoii</hi> vigorously and dexterously thrown point blank into the face is
                    not an attack to be despised. Meanwhile everybody shrieks at the top of his
                    voice, the masks affect a counterfeit and high falsetto note, with which they
                    invariably address the unmasked and each other. Then at a given signal begins
                    the running of the <hi rend="italic">barbèri,</hi> or riderless horses. Some ten
                    of them are led to the starting place in the Piazza del Popolo, with loosely
                    hanging little spiked machines, contrived to act as spurs, hanging to their
                    sides, and crackers attached to them, which are fired at the moment of starting.
                    A gun gives the signal for the compact crowd in the Corso to make a lane for the
                    horses to run through.</p>
                <p>By the aid of the police and soldiers this is more or less satisfactorily
                    accomplished, and the horses dash through it, the crowd closing behind them as
                    they ran. Rarely, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say never, does a
                    Carnival pass without two or three accidents, frequently fatal ones, in
                    consequence of incautious persons getting knocked down by the rashing horses.
                    The race is ran in about two minutes. The winning “post” is a sheet hung across
                    the street at the spot hence called <hi rend="italic">Riprcsa dci Barberi,</hi>
                    in the Piazza di Venezia. The prizes consist, as in olden time, of certain
                    standards of velvet, gold lace, and the like, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >“palio,”</hi> which are after the race paraded through the Corso. In these days
                    sums of money, 300 or 400 francs, are usually added by the municipality. The
                    {»rice of these prizes was formerly furnished by the Jews, as has »een seen. And
                    popular tradition says that the Jews were permitted to furnish the horses and
                    prizes as a concession to humanity, in lieu of running themselves in <hi
                    rend="italic">propria persona.</hi> It is undoubtedly true that they were so
                    compelled to ran. But it would seem that they did not do so <hi rend="italic"
                    >exclusively,</hi> other categories of persons, as the boys,, the youths, the
                    old men, having done the same. These races of the barbèri were abolished in the
                    year 1874, but were re-established in 1876, in accordance with the wishes of a
                    large portion of the Romans. It remains to mention the peculiar diversion of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Moccolciti</hi> (tapers), which takes place immediately after
                    sunset on Shrove Tuesday. Everybody in the streets, in the balconies and
                    windows, and in the carriages, carries a taper, and everybody endeavours to
                    extinguish the tapers of his neighbours, principally by means of flapping with
                    handkerchiefs, and keep his own alight. All the other features of a modern
                    carnival are common to all the principal Italian cities, but the <hi
                    rend="italic">Moccoletíi</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Barbèri</hi> are
                    peculiar to Rome. The fun ends by burning at midnight on Shrove Tuesday a
                    colossal figure supposed to represent the carnival. These are the public and
                    out-door aspects of carnival. But besides this all the theatres have masked
                    balls, called <hi rend="italic">Veglioni</hi> (from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vigilare,</hi> watch or keep awake., <hi rend="italic">Veglia,</hi> a vigil, or
                    keeping awake; the addition of the intensitive termination <hi rend="italic"
                    >one</hi> gives the word the signification of “a great keeping awake,” i.e., a
                    festival to last nearly all night). In all classes of society also carnival is
                    deemed the especial season for balls, and for festivities of all kinds.</p>
                <p>Of the other Italian cities, besides Rome, Venice used in old times to be the
                    principal home of carnival. But small remains of it are to be seen there now. A
                    stage, gay with coloured draperies and gas, set up by the municipality in the
                    great square of St Mark, on which a few masked and dominoed figures go and dance
                    to music provided by the town, constitutes pretty well the whole of the once
                    celebrated carnival of Venice. Turin, Milan, Florence, Naples, all put forth
                    competing “programmes” for the carnival, all induced by the same motive,—the
                    good of trade. The institution has become everywhere a matter of pure
                    money-getting speculation. Milan and Naples are now the most active competitors
                    with Rome in this respect. In old times Florence was conspicuous for the
                    licentiousness of its carnival; and the <hi rend="italic">Canti</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Camascialcscfli,</hi> or Carnival Songs, of Lorenzo de’ Medici
                    remain still, though a somewhat rare book, to shew to what extent that licence
                    was carried. (T. A. T.)</p>
