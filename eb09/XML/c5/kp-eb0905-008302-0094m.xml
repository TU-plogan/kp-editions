                    rend="smallcaps">Kara wan,</hi> is a Persian word, adopted into the later Arabic
                    vocabulary, but rarely employed in speech and never in writing within the limits
                    of Arabia proper, where other designations of strictly Arabic origin such as
                    “Rikb” (assembled riders) or “Kafileh” (wayfaring band) are in ordinary use.</p>
                <p>In common acceptance, then, throughout Syria, Mesopotamia, and Asiatic Turkey
                    generally, besides Persia, a caravan denotes a body of peaceable citizens,
                    merchants, salesmen, and the like, travelling together on business for some
                    considerable distance. The principal reasons which in the Asiatic region induce
                    people of this class thus to unite for their journeys, and that in as large
                    numbers as practicable, are, firstly, the greater security thus insured, or at
                    least expected, against robbers, and in particular against marauding parties of
                    Bedouins, Kurds, Tartars, and the like, whose grazing-grounds the proposed route
                    may traverse; and, secondly, mutual assistance in the matter of provisions,
                    water, and so forth. Bad government, or not rarely the absence of any government
                    whatever, necessitates the first precaution; want of inns, baitingplaces, and
                    perhaps of habitations altogether, the second. It should also be remembered that
                    no roads, in the European sense of the word, but merely tracks, and those
                    difficult and often interrupted, exist throughout Asiatic Turkey and Persia
                    generally,—a fact that speaks badly for the “Public Works Department” in both
                    empires. These conditions having existed more or less from time immemorial in
                    the major part of Western Asia, and still existing, caravans always have been in
                    that part of the world, and still are the principal means for conveying
                    merchandize from one commercial centre to another.</p>
                <p>In these companies camels are most generally employed for the transport of heavy
                    goods, especially where the track, hke that between Damascus and Baghdad, for
                    example, lies across level, sandy, and arid districts. The camels are harnessed
                    in strings of fifty and more at a time, a hair-rope connecting the rear of one
                    beast with the head of another; the leader is gaily decorated with partycoloured
                    trappings, tassels, and bells; an unladen ass precedes the file, for luck, say
                    some, for guidance, say others—a not inappropriate allusion to human affairs in
                    general. Where the route is rocky and steep, as that between Damascus and
                    Aleppo, mules, or even asses, are used for burdens. The wealthier individuals of
                    the party accompany it, where possible, on horseback. Every man carries arms;
                    but these are in truth more for show than for use, and are commonly flung away
                    in the presence of any serious robber-attack; of wild beasts there is little
                    danger, none of formidable size or disposition existing in the Levantine East.
                    Should greater peril than ordinary be anticipated from Bedouins or the like, the
                    protection of a company of soldiers is habitually pre-engaged,—an expen sive,
                    and ordinarily a useless adjunct. A leader or director, called “Karawan-Bashi”
                    (headman), or, out of compliment, “Karawan-Seraskier” (general), both terms of
                    Perso-Turkish composition, but most often simply designated as “Reïs” (chief),
                    is before starting appointed by common consent. His duties are those of general
                    manager, spokesman, arbitrator, and so forth; his remuneration indefinite. But
                    in the matter of sales or purchases, either on the way or at destination, each
                    member of the caravan manages as best he can for himself.</p>
                <p>The number of camels or mules in a single caravan varies from forty or so up to
                    six hundred and more; sometimes, as on the reopening of a long-closed route, it
                    reaches a thousand. The movements of caravans are chiefly regulated by the
                    seasons,—the summer and early autumn, when the heat is at its fiercest and water
                    scarce, being, when possible, avoided, as also, though for opposite reasons, the
                    brief but severe cold of a Levantine winter. Hence the ordinary caravan-seasons
                    are the months of spring, early summer, and later autumn. Friday, in accordance
                    with a recommendation made in the Koran itself, is the favourite day for setting
                    out, the most auspicious hour being that immediately following noonday prayer.
                    The first day’s march never does more than just clear the starting-point by a
                    couple of miles, or thereabouts. Subsequently each day’s route is divided into
                    two stages,—the first being from 3 or 4 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.μ.</hi> to about
                    10 in the forenoon; a halt follows, then travelling is resumed between 2 and 3
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">p m.</hi> and continued till 6, or even 8 in the evening.
                    Thus the time passed daily on the road averages from ten to twelve hours, and,
                    as the ordinary pace of a laden camel does not exceed 2 miles an hour, that of a
                    mule being 2f, it follows that a distance varying from 23 to 28 miles is gone
                    over every marching day. But prolonged halts of two, three, four, and even more
                    days are often interpolated, as business, fatigue, or fear of danger may
                    suggest.</p>
                <p>The hours of halt, start, and movement, the precise lines of route, and the
                    selection or avoidance of particular localities are determined by common consent
                    and the necessity of acting in concert, influences to which the “Reïs” himself,
                    apart from his personal recommendations, is indebted for whatever authority he
                    may possess. But if, as sometimes happen <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> s, the
                    services of a professional guide, or those of a military officer have been
                    engaged, their will has to be deferred to in such matters. Indeed many a caravan
                    has been plundered, or even totally destroyed, through the treachery of a hired
                    guide. Partnership may unite interests in the East, but paid hire more certainly
                    disunites them,—a hint worth a traveller’s remembrance. While the caravan is on
                    its way, the five stated daily prayers are, within certain limits, anticipated,
                    deferred, or even curtailed, so as the better to coincide with the regular and
                    necessary halts,—a practice authorized by the most orthodox Mahometan custom and
                    tradition.</p>
                <p>Two caravans, the one of Ishmeelites, probably “Must” <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n95/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0095-0084"/> arebs,” or semi-Syro-Arabs of early times, to
                    whom also Joseph was sold, the other of Midianites, or natives of the Hawran
                    district, are mentioned in Genesis ch. xxxvii.; the route on which they were
                    passing seems to have coincided with that nowadays travelled by Syrian caravans
                    on their way to Egypt. Other allusions to caravans may be found in the Hebrew
                    records, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the book of Job, in Isaiah, and in the
                    Psalms. Eastern literature is, of course, full of mention of them.</p>
                <p>The yearly pilgrim-bands, bound from various quarters of the Mahometan world to
                    their common destination Mecca, are sometimes, but inaccurately, styled by
                    European writers caravans; their proper designation is “Hajj,” a collective word
                    for pilgrimages and pilgrims. Some description of them may however not
                    unsuitably find a place here.</p>
                <p>The two principal pilgrim caravans, or “Hajj,” start yearly, the one from
                    Damascus, or, to speak more exactly, from Mozareeb, a village station three
                    days’ journey to the south of the Syrian capital, the other from Cairo in Egypt.
                    This latter is joined on its route, near Akabah of the Red Sea, by the
                    Moghrebee, or North African “Hajj,” collected from Tripoli, Marocco, and Tunis;
                    the former gathers up bands from Anatolia, Kurdistan, Mesopotamia, and Syria.
                    Besides these a third, but smaller “Hajj” of Persians, chiefly sets out from
                    Sook-esh-Sheyoukh, in the neighbourhood of Meshed Alee, on the lower Euphrates;
                    a fourth of Negroes, Nubians, Darfurees, &amp;c., unites at Yembo on the Hejaz
                    coast, whither they have crossed from Koseyr in Upper Egypt; a fifth of Indians
                    and Malays, centres at Jiddah; a sixth and seventh, of southern or eastern Arabs
                    arrive, the former from Yemen, the latter from Nejd.</p>
                <p>The Syrian “Hajj” is headed by the Pasha of Damascus, either in person or by a
                    vicarious official of high rank, and is further accompanied by the “Sorrah
                    Ameer,” or “Guardian of the Purse,” a Turkish officer from Constantinople,
                    charged with the imperial contribution to the expense of the route, but chiefly
                    with presents, or, to put it more truly, black mail, for the benefit of the
                    independent Arab tribes, through whose lands the wayfarers must pass. The
                    Egyptian company is commanded by an “Ameer,” or ruler, appointed by the Cairene
                    Government, and is accompanied by the famous “Mahmal,” or sacred pavilion. The
                    other bands above mentioned have each their own “Ameer,” besides their
                    “Mekowwams” or agents, whose business it is to see after provisions, water, and
                    the like, and are not seldom encumbered with a numerous retinue of servants and
                    other attendants. Lastly, a considerable force of soldiery, one, two, or more
                    regiments strong, accompanies both the Syrian and the Egyptian “Hajj.”</p>
                <p>No guides properly so called attend these pilgrim-caravans, the routes followed
                    being invariably the same, and well known. But Bedouin bands generally offer
                    themselves by way of escort, and not seldom designedly lead their clients into
                    the identical dangers from which they bargained to keep them safe. This they are
                    the readier to do that, in addition to the personal luxuries with which many of
                    the pilgrims provide themselves for the journey, a large amount of wealth, both
                    in merchandize and coins, is habitually to be found among the travellers, who,
                    in accordance with Mahometan tradition, consider it not merely lawful but
                    praiseworthy to unite mercantile speculation with religious duty. Nor has any
                    one, the Pasha himself or the Ameer and the military, when present, excepted,
                    any acknowledged authority or general control in the pilgrim-caravans; nor is
                    there any orderly subdivision of management of service. The pilgrims do, indeed,
                    often coalesce in companies among themselves for mutual help, but necessity,
                    circumstance, or caprice governs all details, and thus it happens that numbers,
                    sometimes as many as a third of the entire “Hajj,” yearly perish by their own
                    negligence or by misfortune,—dying, some of thirst, others of fatigue and
                    sickness, others by robbers on the way. In fact the principal routes are in many
                    places lined for miles together with the bones of camels and men.</p>
                <p>The numbers which compose these pilgrim-caravans are much exaggerated by popular
                    rumour; yet it is certain that the Syrian and Egyptian sometimes amount to 5000
                    each, with twenty-five or thirty thousand camels in train. Large supplies of
                    food and water have to be carried, the more so at times that the pilgrim season,
                    following as it does the Mahometan calendar, which is lunar, falls for years
                    together in the very hottest season, though, indeed, the Hejaz portion of the
                    route is always hot enough even in winter. Hence, too, the journey is usually
                    accomplished by night marches, the hours being from 3 to 4 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >p.m.</hi> to 6 or 7 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> of the following day.
                    Torches are lighted on the road; the pace is slower than that of an ordinary
                    caravan, and does not exceed two miles an hour.</p>
                <p>For the ceremonial and religious peculiarities of these pilgrim-caravans, or
                    “Hajj,” see Burckhardt’s <hi rend="italic">Travels in Arabia,</hi> and Lane’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Modern Egyptians,</hi> cc. xxiv. and xxv. In other respects
                    the “Hajj” does not differ materially from an ordinary caravan, and it is from
                    this point of view that it finds place in the present notice. (w. G. p.)</p>
