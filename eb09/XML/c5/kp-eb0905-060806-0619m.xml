                    south called the Zerghát. The high tableland of the Bálághát lies for the most
                    part upon the great basaltic formation which stretches across the Sátpurás as
                    far east as Jabalpur. The country consists of a regular succession of hills and
                    fertile valleys, formed by the small ranges which cross its surface east and
                    west. The average height of the uplands is 2500 feet, but there are many points
                    of greater elevation. The appearance of the Zerghát below the hills is generally
                    open and undulating. The <pb break="no"

                    which the Kanhán is the most considerable. Near the hills and along the streams
                    are strips and patches of jungle; the villages are usually surrounded λvith
                    picturesque groves of tamarind, mango, and other shade-giving trees. The total
                    population of the district, as ascertained by the census of 1872, is 159,116
                    males and 156,979 females; total 316,095, classified as follows :—Hindus,
                    191,669; Muhammadans, 9747; Buddhists and Jains, 574; Christians, 105; “other
                    denominations,” consisting of aboriginal tribes, 114,000. The average density of
                    the population is 80 ’ 72 per square mile. Three towns are returned as
                    containing a population of upwards of 5000, viz.: Chhindwárá, the administrative
                    head-quarters of the district, population 8626; Lodhikerá, population 5219; and
                    Pandhurna, population 5218. Important discoveries of coal have been made here of
                    late years; it is estimated that the area under which coal lies is over 250
                    square miles, some of the seams being as much as 18 feet in thickness. The
                    forests of Chhindwárá are very extensive, and lie principally on the southern
                    slopes of the Sátpurás. The total revenue of the district in 1873-74 amounted to
                    £31,513, of which £21,687, or 68’8 per cent., was derived from the land-tax. For
                    the protection of person and property, and administration of justice, the
                    district contains 6 magisterial and 5 civil and revenue courts, together with a
                    regular police of 361 men of all ranks, maintained at a cost of £5037. The cost
                    of the district officials and police amounted to £10,514. Two charitable
                    dispensaries are maintained for the relief of the sick. In the hill country the
                    climate is temperate and healthy. In the cold season ice is frequently seen in
                    the small tanks at an elevation of about 2000 feet. Until May the hot wind is
                    little felt, while during the rains the weather is cool and agreeable. The
                    average annual rainfall amounts to 36 inches.</p>

                    for nearly two miles in length, and is well wooded. It is considered very
                    healthy, and forms a resort for European visitors from Nágpur and Kámthí during
                    the hot weather. The conservancy arrangements are good, aud the town is clean
                    and cheerful. The population of the town in 1872 was returned as follows
