                <p><label type="entry">CELANO</label>, a town of Italy, in the province of Abruzzo
                    Ulteriore and district of Avezzano, about seven miles east of the town of that
                    name. It is finely situated on a hill about four miles from the former bed of
                    Lake Celano, and has an interesting mediaeval castle of the 15th century,
                    celebrated for its connection with the unfortunate Countess Covella. Though the
                    town never recovered from the vengeance inflicted on it in 1223 by Frederick
                    II., it continued to be the centre of a countship which was bestowed in 1463 on
                    Antonio Piccolomini. The chapel of this family, in the Convent of Valle Verde,
                    not far from the town, is worthy of notice for the paintings of Giulio Romano;
                    and the town itself has the honour of being the birthplace of Beato Tommaso the
                    probable author of the <hi rend="italic">Dies Iroe.</hi> The population of the
                    commune is 6673.</p>
                <p>The neighbouring lake, known to the ancients as <hi rend="italic">Lacus
                        Fucinus,</hi> had till the beginning of this century an area of 37,990
                    acres, and was remarkable for its frequent changes of level. As early as the 1st
                    century, the Emperor Claudius constructed a subterranean passage by which the
                    surplus waters found an outlet to the Liris or Garigliano. No fewer than 30,000
                    workmen were employed for a space of eleven years; and the undertaking seems to
                    have been as successful as it was bold. But in the following reign the passage
                    was allowed to fall into disrepair; and it has been reserved to the present
                    generation to see the old Roman works not only restored but surpassed. From 1793
                    to 1810 the lake had been gradually rising till it was 30 feet above its former
                    level; and the attention of the Neapolitan Government was directed to the
                    danger. Little, however, was effected till 1852, when the necessary works were
                    undertaken by a company, under the direction of Mr C. Hutton Gregory, who
                    proceeded to widen the emissarium and support the walls with arched work. The
