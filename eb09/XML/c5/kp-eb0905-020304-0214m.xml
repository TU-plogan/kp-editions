                    development may have its origin in either of two opposite causes, or in a
                    combination of the two—in the desire, namely, to fulfil the laws, or in the
                    desire to evade them, or in a conflict of these desires.</p>
                <p>Of these principles a remarkable illustration is given by the Jews. Governed as
                    they were by.the written precepts of Moses, they were continually confronted by
                    questions which did not clearly come under any one rule, but of which a solution
                    was required by their extreme reverence for the smallest dicta of their code.
                    This worship of every jot and tittle of the law, which was the most remarkable
                    characteristic of their conscientiousness, determined the nature of their
                    casuistry. It was exact, detailed, unbending, and, though often wise and noble,
                    often useless and merely external. Thus it forbade the wearing of a girdle on
                    the Sabbath, decided to a yard how far one might walk on that day, and declared
                    the consequences of an oath by the gift on the altar to be most serious, while
                    an oath by the altar itself was perfectly safe. Its loosest requirements were
                    those which concerned marriage, for it was practically possible to divorce a
                    wife at will. Of these rules some may be found in the Apocrypha, but their great
                    repository is the encyclopaedic Talmud, which entered into the minutiae of
                    conduct with a detail which tended to prevent real obedience to great laws, and
                    which was disastrous to individual freedom. It must, however, be remembered in
                    considering the religious casuistry of the Jews that— as is also remarkably the
                    case with the Mahometans—their religious code was intended to be at the same
                    time their civil law, and that, consequently, part of their casuistry is
                    comprised in our law-books. In fact, the task of our judges is to solve
                    questions of legal casuistry, and the precedents which they make are, so far,
                    comparable to t∙x e traditions of the elders.</p>

                <p>The early Greeks and the early Romans, in the bright joyousness or the laborious
                    activity of objective life, fully occupied by the pleasures of art or the
                    business of war and politics, with no minutely-detailed code or body of
                    traditions to guide them, troubled themselves little about such problems. When,
                    however, the Greek philosophers and their Roman followers developed moral
                    systems, attention began to be given to this department; at length, such
                    questions as how far suicide is justifiable, or whether duty to the state is
                    more important than duty to a friend, became favourite subjects of debate <hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">and,</hi> during the first two centuries
                    of the Christian era, elaborate treatises on the subject were produced by the
                    famous Stoic philosophers Epictetus, Seneca, and Μ. Aurelius.</p>
                <p>Christianity brought in a new method of settling casuistical questions—a method
                    directly opposed to that of most of the Jewish scribes, iu the midst of whom it
                    had its origin, and consisting in an appeal to the true spirit of great
                    principles. Naturally this method would have left particular cases to the
                    decision of each man’s conscience; but the extreme recoil from reckless
                    self-indulgence which gave birth to the monastic ascetic system produced a new
                    kind of casuistical literature. It found its first great representative in
                    Tertullian, a contemporary of Μ. Aurelius, with whom nearly all sin was mortal,
                    one repentance at most being possible after baptism. The same type of casuistry
                    was taught by others of the fathers, but with the greatest acuteness and power
                    by Augustine, who laid special stress upon the subjective or spiritual side of
                    Christian ethics, insisting upon the principle that the moral worth of action
                    depends upon the disposition of the agent as much as upon the objective nature
                    of the act.</p>
                <p>In the Roman Catholic Church, the practice of confession gave rise to a system of
                    casuistry, expressed in the <hi rend="italic">Libri</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Poenitentiales,</hi> which were intended to guide the confessor as to the
                    imposition of penance and the giving of advice. Among the most important of
                    these are the <hi rend="italic">Summoe</hi> of Raimund of Pennaforti, Angelus,
                    Antonius Augustinus, Pacificus, and Prierias, the work of the last (who was a
                    vigorous opponent of Luther) being an alphabetical compilation from those of his
                    predecessors. Later examples are Amort’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionαrium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">casuum</hi><hi rend="italic">conscientioe</hi> (1784), and
                    Sobiech’s <hi rend="italic">Compendium theologicas moralis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pro</hi><hi rend="italic">utilitate</hi><hi rend="italic">confessariorum</hi>
                    (1824). Indeed, throughout the Middle Ages, the doctrines of the church being
                    universally accepted as the supreme rules of conduct, the casuistical was the
                    department of moral science which was best developed. In Petrus Lombardus, in
                    Alexander of Hales, and in Aquinas’s famous treatise, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Secunda</hi><hi rend="italic">Secundae,</hi> we find the uncompromising
                    strictness of the ancient fathers but slightly modified. Abelard, though
                    earlier, took a more indulgent view, but his teaching was condemned by the
                    church, in the synod of Sens (1140).</p>
                <p>One of the most favourable conditions for the growth of a system of casuistry is
                    that in which a people, having lost its reverence for the law it once held
                    supreme, and ceased to find obedience tolerable, does not yet dare to deny its
                    authority. Such was the condition in which, during the 16th century, there took
                    place the worst development of casuistry which the world has seen. Men no longer
                    were willing that their liberty should be repressed by the dead rules of a
                    corrupt church, and the Jesuits, animated by the single object of adding to the
                    power of their order, were always ready to make concessions and to soften
                    disagreeable requirements. The most remarkable doctrine which they promulgated—a
                    doctrine which it is hard to believe that any one ever ventured to assert—is
                    that of “Probabilism,” according to which any opinion which has been expressed
                    by a “grave doctor” may be looked upon as possessing a fair amount of
                    probability, and may, therefore, be safely followed, even though one’s
                    conscience may insist upon the opposite coursa With principles so liberal it was
                    hard if one could not find an authority to his mind among Escobar, Suarez,
                    Sanchez, Velasquez, Molina, Bauny, Busenbaum, Toletus, Filiutius, Less, Ponce,
                    and an innumerable host of other “grave” and, as a rule, obliging doctors. Such
                    was the popularity of some of their works that Busenbaum’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Medulla</hi><hi rend="italic">casuum</hi><hi rend="italic">con scientioe</hi>
                    (1645) ran through fifty-two editions, and Escobar’s <hi rend="italic">Theologia
                    Moralis</hi> (1646) through forty. One of the most amusing of their ruses was
                    that by which they avoided the condemnation of usury. That “money should breed
                    money” was regarded universally in those days as unnatural; but borrowing was
                    necessary, and no one could be expected to lend without being paid for his risk,
                    and for the use of his capital. The remedy for the Jesuit was easy. There is no
                    sin if you only call the payment not interest but “fair profit;” or if you look
                    upon it as a grateful return by the borrower for the favour done him; or
                    thirdly, if you prefer it, you can avoid the least appearance of evil by making
                    a “Mohatra' ’ bargain, that is, you sell to the person who wants money a
                    quantity of goods, which he at once sells to you again at a lower rate. For
                    these devices, however, the Jesuits are to be judged the less hardly, since
                    almost all moralists found it necessary to evade the mistaken law. It was mainly
                    by their teaching on the fundamental question of the duty of veracity that they
                    made themselves a by-word and a reproach among men. To settle the limits of this
                    duty is, indeed, one of the most difficult problems in practical ethics; but the
                    Jesuits removed it entirely from the category of obligation. Thus Filiutius and
                    others, from the principle that it is the intention which determines the quality
                    of the action, argue that lying can be avoided by mental reservation, by
                    equivocation, or by introducing words <hi rend="italic">sotto</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">voce,</hi> and that promises are not binding when the promiser in
                    making them had no intention to bind himself. Equally notorious were their views
                    on murder, which was authorized in revenge for a box on the ear, or to prevent
                    the loss of a trifling sum; and with regard to some other questions, they
                    entered into such prurient details that their bitterest enemies would not quote
                    their words even for the purpose of condemning them. In short, virtue, according
                    to Father Le Moine’s <hi rend="italic">Devotion made Easy,</hi> is not at all
                    the “cross· tempered dame” men represent her as being. The rites and
                    requirements of the church also were modified to suit the taste of the people.
                    For example, if a whole mass be found wearisome, greater expedition can be
                    obtained by having different parts performed simultaneously; and iu his <hi
                    rend="italic">Paradise opened to Phιlagio in One Hundred Devotions to the Mother
                    of God, easily practised,</hi> Father Bauny shows how easily the heart of the
                    Virgin may be won; a prayer once a day, or even the wearing of an amulet, is
                    enough; nor is it necessary, or, indeed, becoming, that the favoured worshipper
                    should give his heart—“that poor little slave ”—to his benefactress as a token
                    of his gratitude It was impossible that absurdities such as these could fail to
                    bring upon their authors the severest punishment. War was declared against them
                    by the great Jansenist, Antoine Arnauld; and in 1656 and 1657 Pascal attacked
                    them with an incisive wit, the edge of which none of their attempts could turn.
                    The order became a jest; the clergy were aroused to examine the ponderous folios
                    which contained its casuistry, and to condemn them in a general assembly. The
                    attack was afterwards followed up by the polished satire of Boileau, and by a
                    second exposure of the <hi rend="italic">Morale des Jesuites</hi> by Nicole
                    Perrault (1667); and the influence of the <hi rend="italic">Provincial
                    Letters</hi> was at once spread far and wide by means of their immediate
                    translation into Latin, Italian, German, Spanish, and English. It was in vain
                    that the Pope condemned them (September 1657) <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0216-0205"/> the attempts of Pirot and other Jesuits to
                    justify the base maxims they exposed, only increased the disgrace of the order;
                    and Father Daniel’s endeavour to prove them inaccurate was a complete failure.
                    The chief Roman Catholic casuists since that time are St Ignatio (who produced a
                    complete treatise in 1707, and an <hi rend="italic">Ethica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Am&lt;rris</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">vι</hi> 1709), Stattier (1782), Lambertini
                    (1766-1794), and Amort and Sobiech, who have been already mentioned.</p>
                <p>The casuistry of the Reformers was similar, in origin, to that of the early
                    fathers; and, with the marked exception of the question of celibacy, the two
                    systems greatly resemble one another in their severity. This strictness was most
                    extreme in the Calvinistic Church, as is displayed in the stern rules of its
                    founder, and in the works of the German Danaeus (who, in fact, usually follows
                    Augustine), of the English Perkins, and the Dutch Amesius. A more genial spirit
                    prevailed in the Lutheran Church, which produced the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Consiiïa</hi> of Melanchthon, and the treatises of Baldwin of Wittenberg,
                    Olearus, Osiander, and Spener. In the <hi rend="italic">Pia Desideria</hi> of
                    the last we find the commencement of a more ascetic but specially subjective
                    casuistry, founded upon the pietism of Thomas à Kempis. During the 17th century,
                    several other Protestant works on casuistry appeared in England. Those of
                    Bishops Hall and Barlow are not marked by much power. Perkins’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Cases of Conscience</hi> (1606), starting from a discussion of the
                    authority of Scripture and the nature of the Godhead, of repentance and the
                    sacraments, arrives at conclusions which often display vigorous sense, and
                    always a straightforward and even stern honesty. Thus he declares that a
                    promise, though extorted under compulsion or by means of deceit, is binding so
                    long as the loss to be sustained is merely temporary and private; and he
                    condemns the striving for more riches than is necessary for the health of the
                    body, the culture of the mind, and the satisfaction of one’s obligations to
                    one’s family and to others. His most fanciful argument is that in which he
                    founds the validity of an oath by a creature on the curious ground that “God is
                    seen” (ι.e., manifests himself) ' <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> in the
                    creature.” The still more famous Latin treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Obligatione conscientiae</hi> (1660) —of which the best known
                    section, the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Juramenti
                    Obligatione</hi> appeared separately in 1647—by Sanderson, professor of theology
                    at Oxford, is distinguished by an equal directness of moral aim, and by much
                    learning and vigour. But the most renowned of all, Jeremy Taylor’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Ductor Dubitantium</hi> (1660) has not the merit of similar
                    clearness; as guides of conscience he mixes up the laws of revelation and
                    nature, the laws ecclesiastical and civil of princes and governors, and “the
                    fame or the public reputation of things, expressed by proverbs, &amp;c.,” while
                    the place of careful original thought is often taken by profuse quotations.</p>
                <p>During the last two centuries, the study of morals has developed itself in a
                    totally different direction. Free discussion being opened up as to the
                    fundamental questions of religion and morality, modern writers on ethics more
                    generally content themselves with the treatment of great principles, without
                    laying down specific rules for their practical application. (τ. <hi
