                <p><label type="entry">CHEESE</label>, a solidified preparation from milk, the
                    essential constituent of which is the proteinous or nitrogenous substance <hi
                        rend="italic">casein.</hi> All cheese contains in addition some proportion
                    of fatty matter or butter, and in the more valuable varieties, the butter
                    present is often greater in amount than the casein. Cheese being thus a compound
                    substance of no definite chemical composition is found in commerce of many
                    different varieties and qualities; and such qualities are generally recognized
                    by the names of the localities in which they are manufactured. The principal
                    distinctions arise from differences in the composition and condition of the milk
                    operated upon, from variations in the method of preparation and curing, and from
                    the use of the milk of other animals besides the cow, as, for example, the goat
                    and the ewe, from the milk of both of which cheese is manufactured on a
                    commercial scale.</p>
                <p>The quality and the composition of the milk operated on are of prime importance
                    in cheese-making. Not only does this substance vary widely in richness and
                    flavour owing to the breed, the nature of the food, and the state of the health
                    of the animal yielding it, and many other circumstances; but in cheese-making
                    the differences are still further increased, in some cases by adding cream to
                    it, and in others by using it as skim-milk or milk deprived of a portion of its
                    fat. Taking as a standard the ordinary sweet milk of cows, the following
                    analyses (No. 1 given on the authority of Dr Parkes, and No. 2 by Dr Voelcker)
                    may be taken to represent its average composition :—</p>

                <p>The object of the cheese-maker is to obtain in a solid form as large a proportion
                    as possible of the casein and butter contained in the milk dealt with. The
                    poverty in these constituents of the whey or liquid matter separated in the
                    process of making cheese is therefore, to some extent, a measure of the success
                    of the operation. The average composition of the whey drained off may be thus
                    stated :—</p>

                <p>Milk, as is well known, if allowed to stand for some time, becomes thick, and is
                    then separable into two portions— a solid white curd, and a greenish liquid
                    whey. Such a coagulation and separation is essential in the making of cheese;
                    but only to a small extent, in Holland and some other localities, is the natural
                    acid coagulation taken advantage of. It has been assumed that the solid
                    constituents of milk are held in solution by an alkaline substance, and that
                    coagulation is the result of the neutralization of the alkali by the development
                    within the fluid of lactic acid, as in the case of sour milk, or by the addition
                    of an acid substance as is sometimes the practice; but this theoιy does not
                    satisfactorily account for all the phenomena of coagulation. Acid substances,
                    however, do readily curdle cheese, and hydrochloric acid, tartaric acid,
                    vinegar, and cream of tartar have all been employed to produce coagulation for
                    cheese-making. The curding is also, in practice, produced by the action of such
                    substances as the juice of figs, and decoctions of thistle tops, artichoke
                    flowers, the butter-wort, and other plants. But the substance used uniformly in
                    Great Britain, and in all great cheese-producing districts, is rennet, a
                    preparation of the fourth or digesting stomach of the suckling calf. Rennet is
                    prepared by cutting up the membrane in strips, salting, smoking, and sometimes
                    treating it with spices and aromatics. The influence of rennet is due to the
                    fact of its exciting a kind of fermentative action;· but that it thereby changes
                    the sugar of milk (lactin) into lactic acid, and so coagulates the casein, has
                    been denied by Dr Voelcker, who holds its action to be “<hi rend="italic">sui
                        generis,</hi> and as yet only known by its effects.”</p>
                <p>In the practice of cheese-making it is found necessary, in order to hasten the
                    coagulating action of rennet, and to produce a curd of sufficient hardness, to
                    heat the milk to a temperature which varies from 72° to 85° or 90° Fahr. The
                    lower temperature, it is found, yields a soft cheese, retaining <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0467-0456"/> much whey aud ripening soon; while the
                    increased heat produces a firm curd and a solid slow-ripening cheese. After due
                    coagulation the curd is broken, and by a variety of manipulative processes as
                    much as possible of the whey is drained away, and the curd is reduced to
                    comparatively dry crumbly fragments. At this stage, sometimes, but not
                    frequently, the curd is salted; it is then collected into a clean cheese-cloth,
                    placed in a cheese vat of the form and size of the cheese to be made, and
                    submitted to pressure in the cheese press. While in the press it is frequently
                    turned, a good deal of whey meantime continuing to exude; and it is found that
                    the amount of pressure has much influence on the solidity and rate of ripening
                    of the cheese. As soon as a sufficient skin has formed on the cheese to preserve
                    its shape, it is removed from the press and salted by repeated rubbings of salt
                    over its surface. The cheese is then put aside in a clean, cool, airy situation
                    for ripening, a process which takes a variable period according to the quality
                    of the cheese, its method of preparation, and other circumstances.</p>
                <p>The ripening of cheese is the result of a slow process of decay caused by a
                    spontaneous fermentative action. In hard, solid, poor cheeses it acts very
                    slowly, while in those which contain butter in large proportions its action is
                    very energetic, and they cannot be preserved for any considerable period. Cheese
                    when newly made has an acid reaction, but by degrees from without inwards the
                    acid reaction becomes less apparent, and the cheese ripens. A portion of the
                    casein suffers decomposition, evolving ammonia and ammoniacal bases which
                    neutralize the acid of the cheese. In a similar way the fat is partly
                    decomposed, and the resulting fatty acids also combine with the ammonia evolved
                    by the casein. When this action is allowed to proceed too far the cheese becomes
                    alkaline, putrefactive decay ensues, free ammonia is evolved, an offensive odour
                    is produced, and sometimes even poisonous compounds are formed. A satisfactory
                    indication of ripening found in Stilton and other rich cheeses is the appearance
                    of a green mould, streaked throughout the mass, produced by the fungus <hi
                        rend="italic">Aspergillus</hi><hi rend="italic">glaucus.</hi> A red mould

                    great rapidity in inconceivable numbers.</p>
                <p>In England the milk of cows only is used in the manufacture of cheese. Excluding
                    the so-called cream cheeses— a preparation of a soft buttery consistence made
                    from cream gently pressed, which must be used new and fresh, —British cheese may
                    be divided into three classes:—1st, that made with whole milk plus cream; 2d,
                    that made with whole milk; and 3d, that made with milk minus cream, or
                    skim-milk. Stilton and double Gloucester belong to the first class, being made
                    of morning milk to which the cream of the previous evening’s milking is added.
                    Whole milk cheeses are represented by single Gloucester, Cheshire, Cheddar, and
                    Dunlop; and the ordinary country cheese used by the labouring classes represents
                    the third class. It must, however, be understood that all gradations in richness
                    are met with in cheese, as seen by the table below, and that quality depends on
                    other circumstances besides proportion of butter. Of foreign cheese imported
                    into Great Britain, the most important in point of quantity and value is
                    American; and since the introduction of the factory system of cheesemaking in
                    the United States, this has greatly improved in quality and become an important
                    and extensive article of commerce. A large quantity of cheese, both fat and
                    poor, is also made and exported from Holland. Parmesan cheese and Gruyère
                    cheese, which are highly relished on account of their flavour, are skim-milk
                    products, the former being coloured and artificially flavoured with saffron. The
                    celebrated French Roquefort cheese is made from ewe’s milk, and matured in the
                    caves of Roquefort, where a uniform low temperature is found throughout the
                    year. The accompanying table, compiled from various sources, gives the average
                    composition of the principal kinds of cheese at present known in commerce: —</p>

                <p>As an article of food cheese is used in a double capacity. Rich cheese in an
                    advanced stage of ripeness is eaten in small quantities partly on account of its
                    piquancy, and partly also as a digestive stimulant. Skim-milk cheese, and all
                    the varieties poor in fat, again, are valuable articles of food on account of
                    their high percentage of nitrogenous matter, and the cheaper qualities are, on
                    this account, extensively consumed among the classes by whom other animal food
                    is not usually obtainable. As an article of ordinary diet, cheese labours under
                    the disadvantage of being hard of digestion; and especially when it is toasted,
                    as is frequently the practice, it really is, as has been observed, ‘ about as
                    digestible as leather.” According to Dr Frankland’s experiments, the maximum
                    amount of force produced by the complete &lt;Jxidation of I lb of Cheshire
                    cheese within the human body is 2704 foot-tons.</p>
                <p>The imports of cheese into Great Britain during the year 1875 amounted to
                    1,626,413 cwt., of an estimated value of £4,705,229; of this quantity about
                    one-half was imported from the United States and one-fourth came from Holland.
                    Of course the imports only represent a small proportion of the total quantity
                    consumed.</p>
