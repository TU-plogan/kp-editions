                <p><label type="entry">CHARITIES</label>. There are few features of English society
                    more remarkable than the strength of its charitable organization. It is not
                    merely that the voluntary contributions of individuals to the purposes usually
                    described as charitable are on the largest scale, but that endowments in aid of
                    every variety of public use abound in all parts of the country. These endowments
                    are mostly of private foundation, and but for comparatively recent legislation,
                    would be almost entirely beyond the cognizance or control of the state. So far,
                    indeed, as real property is concerned, the state has for various reasons
                    discouraged its application to such purposes. During the feudal period of
                    English law, the rights of the lords of the soil were continually being invaded
                    by the alienation of land to ecclesiastical corporations. These societies had
                    perpetual succession, whereby the rights of the superior incidental to the
                    tenancy of individuals were destroyed. It was to prevent such alienations that
                    the Mortmain Acts were passed. The statute De Religiosis, 7 Edward I. st. 2, c.
                    1, and the statute of Westminster 2d enacted t∖at if anybody politic,
                    ecclesiastical or lay, sole or aggregate, should buy or sell lands or by any
                    engine oι craft appropriate lands in such a way that they should in anywise come
                    into mortmain, the lord of the fee might enter within a year of the alienation,
                    and in default of the mesne lord, the land should go to the king. The 15 Rie.
                    II. c. 5 extended this statute to all lands, &lt;fcc., purchased to the use of
                    guilds and fraternities, &amp;c. When testamentary power over freehold lands was
                    established iu the reign of Henry VIII., bodies politic and corporate were
                    expressly excepted from the benefit of the statute. Alienations in mortmain, as
                    they were called, were not absolutely void, but voidable only at the option of
                    the intermediate lords or the king, and the licence of the lords and the king
                    confirmed the alienation. A devise of realty to a corporation was ineffectual,
                    and the land descended to the heir, either for his own use or charged with the
                    trust imposed on it by the intended devise. The preamble to the important
                    statute 43 Eliz. c. 4 gives us an idea of the number and variety of the public
                    objects on which testators and other donors were in the habit of expending their
                    wealth :— “Whereas.land, tenements, rents, annuities, profits, hereditaments,
                    goods, chattels, money, and stocks of money have been heretofore given, limited,
                    appointed, and assigned, as well by the Queen and her progenitors as by sundry
                    other well-disposed persons; some for relief of aged, impotent, and poor people;
                    some for maintenance of sick and maimed soldiers and mariners, schools for
                    learning, for schools and scholars in universities; some for repair of bridges,
                    ports, havens, causeways, churches, sea-banks, and highways; some for education
                    and preferment of orphans; some for or towards relief, stock, or maintenance of
                    houses of correction; some for marriages of poor maids; some for supportation,
                    aid, and help for young tradesmen, handicraftsmen, and persons decayed; and
                    others for relief or redemption of prisoners or captives, and for aid or ease of
                    any poor inhabitants, concerning payments of fifteens, setting out of soldiers,
                    and other taxes, which lands, tenements, &amp;c., have not been employed
                    according to the charitable intent of the givers and founders thereof, by reason
                    of frauds, breaches of trust, &amp;c.” The statute gives the Lord Chancellor
                    power to appoint commissioners to inquire into such cases. A charity under the
                    statute has been defined to be a gift to a general public use, which extends to
                    the rich as well as to the poor. By a series of judicial interpretations, the
                    power of devising lands to corporations for charitable uses was established, and
                    the subject of the Mortmain Acts was to a certain extent frustrated.</p>
                <p>The Act 9 Geo. II. c. 36 takes notice of the public mischief caused by
                    alienations or dispositions made by languishing or dying persons to uses called
                    charitable uses, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n413/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0413-0402"/> to the disherison of their lawful heirs. It 13
                    accordingly enacted that no real property, or money to be laid out in the
                    purchase of real property, shall be transferred in any way in trust for the
                    benefit of any charitable use whatsoever, unless such gift be executed by deed
                    at least twelve months before the donor’s death, and enrolled in the Court of
                    Chancery within six months of its execution. Gifts to the universities and
                    colleges are excepted under the Act. Gifts to uses which are superstitious
                    within the Acts of Henry VI∏. and Edward VI. are still held to be void.</p>
                <p>Many Acts have been passed within the present century for the better regulation
                    of charities. The Lord Chancellor was always understood to have a prerogative
                    jurisdiction, as representing the king, who is <hi rend="italic">parens
                    patrioe,</hi> over these public trusts. The Act of Elizabeth, as we have seen,
                    gave him authority to appoint commissioners of inquiry, and under that Act the
                    Court of Chancery developed some very important doctrines regarding charities.
                    The chancellor’s commissions fell into disuse, and it was found more convenient
                    to proceed by way of information on the part of the Attorney-General. It will be
                    easily understood that great abuses must have sprung up under a system of
                    control which was by its very nature casual, litigious, and intermittent. In the
                    case of charitable corporations with visitors of their own, the power of the
                    court to interfere was to a certain extent restricted by the visitatorial
                    jurisdiction. In 1818 began a series of public investigations into charitable
                    funds, which has by no means yet come to an end. At the instance of Lord
                    Brougham, a commission was appointed to inquire into the educational charities,
                    but the universities and large schools were exempted from its operation. A
                    second commission with further powers was appointed under the 59 Geo. III. c.
                    81, and continued until 1830. Charities under special visitors were still
                    exempted, but this exemption was discontinued when the third commission, under 1
                    and 2 Will. IV. c. 34, was appointed. In the reports of the commission it is
                    stated that the worst cases of abuse and maladministration were found in
                    charities having special visitors. Grammar schools in that position are
                    described as being especially deplorable. A fourth commission was appointed in
                    1835. The reports of these various commissions, and of a House of Commons
                    committee on the same subject, called public attention to the abuses of charity
                    administration. After many efforts the Charitable Trusts Act of 1853 was passed.
                    By this and the amending Acts, permanent commissioners were appointed with
                    extensive powers. It is their duty to inquire into the management of charities,
                    and to insist on accounts being laid before them, and they are now enabled to
                    undertake the administrative business in respect of charities which belonged to
                    the Court of Chancery. Contentious business is still remitted into court, but
                    the rest is carried through in the office of the commissioners. In cases
                    requiring such intervention, they send a certificate to the Attorney-General,
                    who takes such proceedings thereon as he may think proper. The universities and
                    their colleges, cathedrals, and generally all charities connected with religious
                    worship, or supported solely by voluntary contributions, are exempted from the
                    jurisdiction of the commissioners. Endowed schools were, by the Endowed Schools
                    Act 1869, handed over to a separate commission, and the powers of the Court of
                    Chancery and Charity Commissioners were restricted with respect to them. More
                    recently the Endowed Schools Commission has been allowed to expire, and its
                    duties have been assigned to the Charity Commission. There are still many
                    charities in England which the powers of the Charity Commissioners do not seem
                    to be able to reach.</p>
