                <p><label type="entry">CASAUBON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Isaac</hi></label>
                    (1559-1614), was born at Geneva, 18th February 1559, of French refugee parents.
                    On the publication of the edict of January 1561, the family returned to France
                    and settled at Crêst in Dauphiné, where Arnold Casaubon, Isaac’s father, became
                    minister of a Huguenot congregation. Till he was nineteen, Isaac had no other
                    instruction than what could be given him by his father amid the distractions of
                    those troubled years. Arnold was away from home whole years together, in the
                    Calvinist camp, or the family were flying to the hills to hide from the
                    fanatical bands of armed Catholics who patrolled the country. Thus it was in a
                    cave in the mountains of Dauphiné that Isaac received his first lesson in Greek,
                    the text-book being <hi rend="italic">Isocrates ad Demonicum.</hi></p>
                <p>At nineteen Isaac was sent to the Academy of Geneva, where he read Greek under
                    Francis Portus, a native of Crete. Portus died in 1581, having recommended
                    Casaubon, then only twenty-two, as his successor. At Geneva he remained as
                    professor of Greek till 1596. Here he married twice, his second wife being
                    Florence, daughter of the celebrated scholar-printer, Henri Estienne. Here,
                    without the stimulus of example or encouragement, with few books and no
                    assistance, in a city peopled with religious refugees, and struggling for life
                    against the troops of the Catholic dukes of Savoy, Casaubon made himself the
                    consummate Greek scholar, and master of ancient learning, which he became. He
                    gave himself up to a study of the classical remains with a zeal and persistency
                    which were fed only by an innate love of acquisition. His great wants were books
                    and the sympathy of learned associates, both of which were wanting at Geneva. He
                    spent all he could save out of his small salary in buying books, and in having
                    copies made of such classics as were not then in print. Henri Estienne, Beza,
                    and Leet were, indeed, men of superior learning. But Henri, in those last years
                    of his life, was no longer the Estienne of the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus;</hi>
                    was, besides, never at home, and would not suffer his son-in-law to enter his
                    library. “He guards his books,” writes Casaubon, “as the griffins in India do
                    their gold !” Beza was engrossed by the cares of administration, and retained,
                    at most, an interest for theological reading. Leet, a lawyer, had left classics
                    for the active business of the council. The sympathy and help which Casaubon’s
                    native city could not afford him, he endeavoured to supply by cultivating the
                    acquaintance of the learned of other countries. Geneva, as the metropolis of
                    Calvinism, received a constant succession of visitors. The Continental tour of
                    the young Englishman of birth was not complete without a visit to Geneva. It was
                    there that Casaubon made the acquaintance of young Henry Wotton, who lodged in
                    his house, and borrowed his money. Of more consequence to Isaac Casaubon was the
                    acquaintance of Richard Thomson of Clare, for it was through Thomson that the
                    attention of Scaliger, settledin 1593 at Leyden, was directed to Casaubon.
                    Scaliger and Casaubon first exchanged letters in 1594. Their intercourse, which
                    was wholly by letter, for they never met, passes through the stages of civility,
                    admiration, esteem, regard, and culminates in a tone of the tenderest affection
                    and mutual confidence. Influential French men of letters, the Protestant
                    Bongars, the Catholic De Thou, and the Catholic convert Canaye de Fresne, aided
                    him by presents of books and encouragement, and endeavoured to get him invited,
                    in some capacity, to France.</p>
                <p>This was effected in 1596, in which year Casaubon accepted an invitation to the
                    university of Montpellier, with the title of “conseiller du roi” and “professeur
                    stipendié aux langues et bonnes lettres.” In Montpellier he never took root. He
                    held the professorship there only three years, with several prolonged absences.
                    He was not, at any time, insensible to the attractions of teaching, and his
                    lectures at Montpellier were followed not only by the students, but by men of
                    mature age and position. But the love of knowledge was gradually growing upon
                    him.</p>

                <p>and becoming a devouring passion which excluded all other ambition. He began to
                    perceive that the editing Greek books was an employment more congenial to his
                    peculiar powers than teaching. At Geneva he had first tried his hand in some
                    notes on Diogenes Laertius and on Theocritus, of small account. His <hi
                    rend="italic">debut</hi> as an editor had been a complete Strabo (1587), of
                    which he was so ashamed afterwards that he apologized for its crudity to
                    Scaliger, calling it “a miscarriage.” This was followed by the text of
                    Polyaenus, an <hi rend="italic">editio princeps,</hi> 1589; a text of Aristotle,
                    1590; and a few notes contributed to Estienne’s editions of Dionysius of
                    Halicarnassus and Pliny’s <hi rend="italic">Epistoloe.</hi> It is not till we
                    come to his edition of Theophrastus’s <hi rend="italic">Characteres,</hi> 1592,
                    that we have a specimen of that peculiar style of illustrative commentary, at
                    once apposite and profuse, which distinguishes Casaubon among annotators. At the
                    time of his removal to Montpellier he was engaged upon what is the capital work
                    of his life, his edition of, and commentary on, Athenaeus.</p>
                <p>In 1598 we find Casaubon at Lyons, superintending the passage of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Athenaeus</hi> through the press. Here he lived in the house of De
                    Vic, “surintendant de la justice,” a Catholic, but a man of acquirements, whose
                    connections were with the circle of liberal Catholics in Paris. In the suite of
                    De Vic, Casaubon made a flying visit to Pans, and was presented to Henry IV. The
                    king was very gracious, and said something about employing Casaubon’s services
                    in the “restoration” of the fallen university of Paris.</p>
                <p>With the hopes thus excited he returned to Montpellier. In January 1599 he
                    received a summons to repair to Paris. But the terms of the letter missive were
                    so vague, that, though it bore the sign manual, Casaubon hesitated to act upon
                    it. However, he resigned his chair at Montpellier, but instead of hastening to
                    Paris, he lingered more than a year at Lyons, in De Vic’s house, waiting for the
                    appointment to a Paris professorship. None came, but instead there came a
                    summons from De Vic, who was in Paris, to come to him in all haste on an affair
                    of importance. The business proved to be the Fontainebleau Conference. Casaubon
                    allowed himself to be persuaded to sit as one of the referees who were to
                    adjudicate on the challenge sent to Du Plessis Mornay by Cardinal Duperron. By
                    so doing he placed himself in a false position, as Scaliger said: “Non debebat
                    Casaubon interesse colloquio Plessiaeano; erat asinus inter simias, doctus inter
                    imperitos” <hi rend="italic">(Scali-</hi><hi rend="italic">gerana</hi> 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> α</hi>). The issue was so contrived that the Protestant
                    party could not but be pronounced to be in the wrong. By concurring in the
                    decision, which was unfavourable to Du Plessis Mornay, Casaubon lent the
                    prestige of his name to a court whose verdict would without him have been
                    worthless, and confirmed the suspicions already current among the Reformed
                    churches that, like his friend and patron Canaye de Fresne, he was meditating
                    abjuration. From this time forward he became the object of the hopes and fears
                    of the two religious parties; the Catholics lavishing promises, and plying him
                    with arguments; the Reformed ministers insinuating that he was preparing to
                    forsake a losing cause, and only higgling about his price. We now know enough of
                    Casaubon’s mental history to know how erroneous were these computations of his
                    motives. But, at the time, it was not possible for the immediate parties to the
                    bitter controversy to understand the intermediate position between Genevan
                    Calvinism and Ultramontanism to which Casaubon’s reading of the fathers had
                    conducted him.</p>
                <p>Meantime the efforts of De Thou and the liberal Catholics to retain him in Paris
                    were successful. The king repeated his invitation to Casaubon to settle in the
                    capital, and assigned him a pension. No more was said about the university. The
                    recent reform of ths university of Paris had closed its doors to all but
                    Catholics; and though the chairs of the College de France were not governed by
                    the statutes of the university, public opinion ran so violently against heresy,
                    that Henry IV. dared not appoint a Calvinist to a chair, even if he had desired
                    to do so. But it was designed that Casaubon should succeed to the post of
                    sub-librarian of the royal library when it should become vacant, and a patent of
                    the reversion was made out in his favour. In November 1604, Jean Gosselin died
                    in extreme old age; and Casaubon succeeded him as sublibrarian, with a salary of
                    400 livres in addition to his pension.</p>
                <p>In Paris Casaubon remained till 1610. These ten years were the brightest period
                    of his life. He had attained the reputation of being, after Scaliger, the most
                    learned man of the age,—an age in which learning formed the sole standard of
                    literary merit. He was placed above penury, though not in easy circumstances. He
                    had such facilities for religious worship as a Huguenot could have, though he
                    had to go out of the city to Hablon, and afterwards to Charenton, for them. He
                    enjoyed the society of men of learning, or who took an interest in learned
                    publications. He had the best opportunities of seeing men of letters from
                    foreign countries as they passed through Paris. Above all, he had wealth of
                    Greek books, both printed and in MS., the want of which he had felt painfully at
                    Geneva and Montpellier, and which no other place but Paris could at that period
                    have supplied.</p>
                <p>In spite of all these advantages we find Casaubon restless, and ever framing
                    schemes for leaving Paris, and settling elsewhere. It was known that he was open
                    to offers, and offers came to him from various quarters,—from Nîmes, from
                    Heidelberg, from Sedan. His friends Leet and Diodati wished, rather than hoped,
                    to get him back to Geneva. The causes of Casaubon’s discomfort in Paris were
                    various, but the principal source of uneasiness lay in his religion. The life of
                    any Huguenot in Paris was hardly secure in these years, for it was doubtful if
                    the police of the city was strong enough to protect them against any sudden
                    uprising of the fanatical mob, always ready to reenact the St Bartholomew. But
                    Casaubon was exposed to persecution of another sort. Ever since the
                    Fontainebleau Conference an impression prevailed that he was wavering. It was
                    known that he rejected the <hi rend="italic">outre</hi> anti-popery opinions
                    current in the Reformed churches; that he read the fathers, and wished for a
                    church after the pattern of the primitive ages. He was given to understand that
                    he could have a professorship only by recantation. When it was found that he
                    could not be bought, he was plied by controversy. Henry IV., who liked Casaubon
                    personally, made a point of getting him to follow his own example. By the king’s
                    orders Duperron was untiring in his efforts to convert him. Casaubon’s knowledge
                    of the fathers was that of a scholar; Duperron’s that of an adroit polemist; and
                    the scholar was driven to admit that the polemist was often too hard for him.
                    These encounters mostly took place in the king’s library, over which the
                    cardinal, in his capacity of aumônier, exercised some kind of authority; and it
                    was therefore impossible for Casaubon to avoid them. On the other hand the
                    Huguenot theologians, and especially Du Moulin, chief pastor of the church of
                    Paris, accused him of conceding too much, and of having departed already from
                    the lines of strict Calvinistic orthodoxy.</p>
                <p>When the assassination of Henry IV. gave full rein to the Ultramontane party at
                    court, the obsessions of Duperron became more importunate, and even menacing. It
                    was now that Casaubon began to listen to overtures which had been faintly made
                    before, from the bishops and the court of England. In October 1610 he came to
                    this country in the suite of the ambassador. Lord Wotton of Marley. He <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n185/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0185-0174"/> had the most flattering reception from James I.,
                    who was perpetually sending for him, to have theological talk. The English
                    bishops were equally delighted to find that the great French scholar was an
                    Anglican ready made, and had arrived, by independent study of the fathers, at
                    the very <hi rend="italic">via media</hi> between Puritanism and Romanism, which
                    was becoming the fashion in the English Church. Casaubon, though a layman, was
                    collated to a prebendal stall in Canterbury, and had a pension of £300 a year
                    assigned him from the exchequer. Nor were these merely paper figures. When Sir
                    Julius Caesar made a difficulty about payment, James sent a note in his own
                    hand: “Chanceler of my excheker, I will have Mr Casaubon paid before me, my
                    wife, and my barnes.” He still retained his appointments in France, and his
                    office as librarian. He had obtained leave of absence for a visit to England,
                    and his permanent settlement here was not contemplated. In order to retain their
                    hold upon him, the Government of the queen regent refused to allow his library
                    to be sent over. It required a special request from James himself to get leave
                    for Madame Casaubon to bring him a part of his most necessary books. Casaubon
                    continued to speak of himself as the servant of the regent, and to declare his
                    readiness to return when summoned to do so.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile his situation in London gradually developed unforeseen sources of
                    discomfort. Not that he had any reason to complain of his patrons, the king and
                    the bishops. James continued to the last to delight in his company, and to be as
                    liberal as the state of his finances allowed. Overal had received him and his
                    whole family into the deanery of St Paul’s, and entertained him there for a
                    year. Overal and Andrewes, then bishop of Ely, were the most learned men of a
                    generation in which extensive reading was more general among the higher clergy
                    than it has ever been since. These two were attracted to Casaubon by congenial
                    studies and opinions. With the witty and learned bishop of Ely, in particular,
                    Casaubon was always happy to spend such hours as he had to spare from the
                    labours of the study. Andrewes took him to Cambridge, where he met the most
                    gratifying reception from the notabilities of the university. They went on
                    together to Downham, where Casaubon spent six weeks of the summer of 1611. In
                    1613 he was taken to Oxford by Sir H. Savile, where, amid the homage and
                    feasting of which he was the object, his principal interest is for the MSS.
                    treasures of the Bodleian. The honorary degree which was offered him he
                    declined.</p>
                <p>But these distinctions were far from compensating the serious inconveniences of
                    his position. Having been taken up by the king and the bishops, he had to share
                    in their rising unpopularity. The courtiers looked with a jealous eye on a
                    pensioner who enjoyed frequent opportunities of taking James I. on his weak
                    side—his love of book talk,—opportunities which they would have known how to
                    use. Casaubon was especially mortified by Sir H. Wotton’s persistent avoidance
                    of him, so inconsistent with their former intimacy. His windows were broken by
                    the roughs at night, his children pelted in the streets by day. On one occasion
                    he himself appeared at Theobald’s with a black eye, having received a blow from
                    some ruffian’s fist in the street. Mr Hallam thinks that he had “become
                    personally unpopular;” but these outrages from the vulgar seem to have arisen
                    solely from the Cockney’s antipathy to the Frenchman. Casaubon, though he could
                    make shift to read an English book, could not speak English, any more than Mme.
                    Casaubon. This deficiency not only exposed him to insult and fraud, but
                    restricted his social intercourse. It excluded him altogether from the circle of
                    the “wits;” either this or some other cause prevented him from being acceptable
                    in the circle of the lay learned—the “antiquaries.” Camden he saw but once or
                    twice. Casaubon had been imprudent enough to correct Camden’s Greek, and it is
                    possible that the ex-headmaster of Westminster kept himself aloof in silent
                    resentment of Casaubon’s superior learning. With Cotton and Spelman he was
                    slightly acquainted. Of Selden we find no mention. Though Sir Henry Savile
                    ostensibly patronized him, yet Casaubon could not help suspecting that it was
                    Savile who secretly prompted an attempt by Montagu to forestal Casaubon’s book
                    on Baronius. Besides the jealousy of the natives, Casaubon had now to suffer the
                    open attacks of the Jesuit pamphleteers. They had spared him as long as there
                    were hopes of getting him over. The prohibition was taken off, now that he was
                    committed to Anglicanism. Not only Eudaemon-Joannes, Rosweyd, and Scioppius, but
                    a respectable writer, friendly to Casaubon, Schott of Antwerp, gave currency to
                    the insinuation that Casaubon had sold his conscience for English gold.</p>
                <p>But the most serious cause of discomfort in his English residence was that his
                    time was no longer his own. He was perpetually being summoned out of town to one
                    or other of James’s hunting residences that the king might enjoy his talk. He
                    had come over from Paris in search of leisure, aud found that a new claim on his
                    time was established. The king and the bishops wanted to employ his pen in their
                    literary warfare against Rome. They compelled him to write first one, then a
                    second, pamphlet on the subject of the day,—the royal supremacy. At last,
                    ashamed of thus misappropriating Casaubon’s stores of learning, they set him
                    upon a refutation of the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> of Baronius, then in the
                    full tide of its credit and success. Upon this task Casaubon spent his remaining
                    strength and life. He died in great suffering, 1st July 1614. His complaint was
                    an organic and congenital malformation of the bladder; but his end was hastened
                    by an unhealthy life of over-study, and latterly by his anxiety to acquit
                    himself creditably in his criticism on Baronius. He was buried in Westminster
                    Abbey. The monument, by which his name is there commemorated, was erected many
                    years later by his friend Thomas Morton, then (1632) become bishop of
                    Durham.</p>
                <p>Besides the editions of ancient authors which have been mentioned, Casaubon
                    published with commentaries Persius, Suetonius, the <hi rend="italic">Scriptores
                    Historice</hi><hi rend="italic">Augustoe.</hi> Polybius, on which he had spent
                    vast labour, he left unfinished. His most ambitious work was his revision of the
                    text of Athenaeus, with commentary. The Theophrastus perhaps exhibits his most
                    characteristic excellencies as a commentator. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exercitationes</hi><hi rend="italic">in Bar</hi><hi rend="italic">onium</hi>
                    are but a fragment of the massive criticism which he contemplated, and failed in
                    bringing before the reader the uncritical character of Baronius’s history. His
                    correspondence (in Latin) was finally collected by D’ Almeloveen (Rotterdam,
                    1709), who prefixed to the letters a careful life of Isaac Casaubon, But this
                    learned Dutch editor was only acquainted with Casaubon’s diary in extract. This
                    diary <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides,</hi> of which the MS. is preserved in the
                    chapter library of Canterbury, was printed in 1850, by the Clarendon Press. It
                    forms the most valuable record we possess of the daily life of a scholar, or man
                    of letters, of the 16th century.</p>
                <p>For a characteristic of Casaubon’s labours as a commentator and critic, a
                    detailed account of his life, and a chronological list of his publications, the
                    reader is referred to a work by the writer of the present article, <hi
                    rend="italic">Isaac Casaubon</hi> (1559-1614), 8vo, Lond., 1875. (Μ. P.)</p>
