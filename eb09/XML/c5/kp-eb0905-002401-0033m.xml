                <p><label type="entry">CANOVA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Antonio</hi></label>
                    (1757-1822), one of the leading sculptors of modern times, was born on the 1st
                    of November 1757, at Passagno, an obscure village situated amid the recesses of
                    the hills of Asolo, where these form the last undulations of the Venetian Alps,
                    as they subside into the plains of Treviso. At three years of age Canova was
                    deprived of both parents, his father dying and his mother remarrying. Their
                    loss, however, was compensated by the tender solicitude and care of his paternal
                    grandfather and grandmother, the latter of whom lived to experience in her turn
                    the kindest personal attention from her grandson, who, when he had the means,
                    gave her an asylum in his house at Rome. The father and grandfather of our
                    artist followed the occupation of stone-cutters or minor statuaries; and it is
                    said that cheir family had for several ages supplied Passagno with members of
                    that calling. As soon as Canova’s hand could hold a pencil, he was initiated
                    into the principles of drawing by his affectionate grandfather Pasino. The
                    latter possessed some knowledge both of drawing and of architecture, designed
                    well, and showed considerable taste in the execution of ornamental works. To his
                    art he was greatly attached; and upon his young charge he looked as one who was
                    to perpetuate, not only the family name, but also the family profession.</p>
                <p>The early years of Canova were passed in study. The bias of his mind was to
                    sculpture, and the facilities afforded for the gratification of this
                    predilection in the workshop of his grandfather were eagerly improved. In his
                    ninth year he executed two small shrines of Carrara marble, which are still
                    extant. Soon after this period he appears to have been constantly employed under
                    his grandfather. Amongst those who patronized the old man was the patrician
                    family Falier of Venice, and by this means young Canova was first introduced to
                    the senator of that name, who afterwards became his most zealous patron. Between
                    the younger son, Giuseppe Falier, and the artist a friendship commenced which
                    terminated only with life. From the interest which was excited in this family
                    for Canova, the senator Falier was induced to receive him under his immediate
                    protection. It has been related by an Italian writer, and since repeated by
                    several biographers, that Canova was indebted to a trivial fortuitous
                    circumstance,—the moulding of a lion in butter,—for the warm interest which
                    Falier took in his welfare. The anecdote may or may not be true. By his kind
                    patron Canova was placed under Bernardi, or, as he is generally called by
                    filiation, Torretto, a sculptor of considerable eminence, who had taken up a
                    temporary residence at Pagnano, a village in the vicinity of the senator’s
                    mansion. This took place whilst Canova was in his thirteenth year; and with
                    Torretto he continued about two years, making in many respects considerable
                    progress. This master returned to Venice, where he soon afterwards died; but by
                    the high terms in which he spoke of his pupil to Falier, the latter was induced
                    to bring the young artist to Venice, whither he accordingly went, and was placed
                    under a nephew of Torretto. With this instructor he continued about a year,
                    studying with the utmost assiduity. After the termination of this engagement he
                    began to work on his own account, and received from his patron an order for a
                    group on the subject of Orpheus and Eurydice. The first figure, which represents
                    Eurydice in flames and smoke, in the act of leaving the infernal realms, was
                    completed towards the close of his sixteenth year. It was highly esteemed by his
                    patron and friends, and the artist was now considered qualified to appear before
                    a public tribunal. The kindness of some monks supplied him with his first
                    workshop, which was the vacant cell of a monastery. Here for nearly four years
                    he laboured with the greatest perseverance and industry. He was also regular in
                    his attendance at the academy, where he carried off several prizes. But he
                    relied far more on the study and imitation of nature. From his contemporaries he
                    could learn nothing, for their style was vicious. From their works, therefore,
                    he reverted to living models, as exhibited in every variety of situation. A
                    large portion of his time was also devoted to anatomy, which science was
                    regarded by him as “the secret of the art.” He likewise frequented places of
                    public amusement, where he carefully studied the expressions and attitudes of
                    the performers. Not a day was allowed to pass without his making some visible
                    advances in his profession. He formed a resolution, which was faithfully adhered
                    to for several years, never to close his eyes at night without having produced
                    some design. Whatever was likely to forward his advancement in sculpture he
                    studied with ardour. On archaeological pursuits he bestowed considerable
                    attention. With ancient and modern history he rendered himseif well acquainted,
                    and he also began to acquire some of the Continental languages.</p>
                <p>Three years had now elapsed without any production coming from his chisel. He
                    began, however, to complete the group for his patron, and the Orpheus which
                    followed evinced the great advance he had made. The work was universally
                    applauded, and laid the foundation of his fame. Several groups succeeded this
                    performance, amongst which was that of Daedalus and Icarus, the most celebrated
                    work of his noviciate. The simplicity of style and the faithful imitation of
                    nature which characterized them called forth the warmest admiration. His merits
                    and reputation being now generally recognized, his thoughts began to turn from
                    the shores of the Adriatic to the banks of the Tiber, for which he set out at
                    the commencement of his twentyfourth year.</p>
                <p>Before his departure for Rome, his friends had applied to the Venetian senate for
                    a pension, to enable him to pursue his studies without embarrassment. The
                    application was ultimately successful. The stipend amounted to three hundred
                    ducats (about £60 per annum), and was limited to three years. Canova had
                    obtained letters of introduction to the Venetian ambassador, the Cavaliere
                    Zulian, an enlightened and generous protector of the arts, and was received in
                    the most hospitable manner. His arrival in Rome, 28th December 1780, marks a new
                    era in his life. It was here he was to perfect himself by a study of the most
                    splendid relics of antiquity, and to put his talents to the severest test by a
                    competition with the living masters of the art. The result was equal to the
                    highest hopes cherished either by himself or by his friends. The work which
                    first established his fame at Rome was Theseus vanquishing the Minotaur. The
                    figures are of the heroic size. The victorious Theseus is represented as seated
                    on the lifeless body of the monster. The exhaustion which visibly pervades his
                    whole frame proves the terrible nature of the conflict in which he has been
                    engaged. Simplicity and natural expression had hitherto characterized Canova’s
                    style; with these were now united more exalted concern-tions<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n34/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0034-0025"/> of grandeur and of truth. The Theseus was
                    regarded with rapturous admiration,</p>
                <p>Canova’s next undertaking was a monument in honour of Clement XIV.; but before he
                    proceeded with it he deemed it necessary to request permission from the Venetian
                    senate, whose servant he considered himself to be, in consideration of the
                    pension. This he solicited in person, and it was granted He returned immediately
                    to Rome, and opened his celebrated studio in the Via del Babuino. He spent about
                    two years of unremitting toil in arranging the design and composing the models
                    for the tomb of the pontiff. After these were completed, other two years were
                    employed in finishing the monument, and it was finally opened to public
                    inspection in 1787. The work, in the opinion of enthusiastic <hi rend="italic"
                    >dilettanti,</hi> stamped the author as the first artist of modern times. After
                    five years of incessant labour, he completed another cenotaph to the memory of
                    Clement XIII., which raised his fame still higher. Works now came rapidly from
                    his chisel. Amongst those which belong to the period in question is Psyche, with
                    a butterfly, which is placed.on the left hand, and held by the wings with the
                    right. This figure, which is intended as a personification of man’s immaterial
                    part, is considered as in almost every respect the most faultless and classical
                    of Canova’s works. In two different groups, and with opposite expression, the
                    sculptor has represented Cupid with his bride; in the one they are standing, in
                    the other recumbent. These and other works raised his reputation so high that
                    the most flattering offers were sent him from the Russian court to induce him to
                    remove to St Petersburg, but these were declined. “Italy,” says he, in writing
                    of the occurrence to a friend, “Italy is my country —is the country and native
                    soil of the arts. I cannot leave her; my infancy was nurtured here. If my poor
                    talents can be useful in any other land, they must be of some utility to Italy;
                    and ought not her claim to be preferred to all others <hi rend="italic"
                    >1</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi></p>
                <p>Numerous works were produced in the years 1795 97, of which several were
                    repetitions of previous productions. It is only necessary to notice the
                    celebrated group representing the Parting of Venus and Adonis. This famous
                    production was sent to Naples. The French Revolution was now extending its
                    shocks over Italy; and Canova sought obscurity and repose in his native
                    Γassagno. Thither he retired in 1798, and there he continued for about a year,
                    principally employed in painting, of which art also he had some knowledge. He
                    executed upwards of twenty paintings about this time. One of his productions is
                    a picture representing the dead body of the Saviour just removed from the cross,
                    surrounded I y the three Marys, the beloved disciple, Joseph of Arimathea, and,
                    somewhat in the background, Nicodemus. Above appears the Father, with the mystic
                    dove in the centre of a glory, and surrounded by a circle of cherubs. This
                    composition, which was greatly applauded, he presented to the parochial church
                    of his native place. Events in the political world having come to a temporary
                    lull, he returned to Rome; but his health having been impaired from arduous
                    application, he took a journey through a part of Germany, in company with his
                    friend Prince Rezzonico. He returned from his travels much improved, and again
                    commenced his labours with renewed vigour and enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>Canova’s sculptures have been distributed under three heads:—(!) Heroic
                    compositions; (2) Compositions of grafce and elegance; and (3) Sepulchral
                    monuments and rilievos. In noticing the works which fall under each of these
                    divisions, it will be impossible to maintain a strict chronological order, but
                    perhaps a better idea of his productions may thus be obtained. Their vast
                    number, however, prevents their being all enumerated.</p>
                <p>Soon after his return appeared his Perseus with the Head of Medusa. The moment of
                    representation is when the hero, flushed with conquest, displays the head of the
                    “snaky Gorgon,” whilst the right hand grasps a sword of singular device. By a
                    public decree, this work was placed in one of the <hi rend="italic">stanze</hi>
                    of the Vatican hitherto reserved for the most precious works of antiquity; but
                    it would be a mistake to say that it sustains this comparison, or that it rivals
                    the earlier realization of the same subject in Italian art, that by Cellini. In
                    1802, at the personal request of Napoleon, Canova repaired to Paris to model a
                    bust of the First Consul. The artist was entertained with munificence, and
                    various honours were conferred upon him. The statue, which is colossal, was not
                    finished till six years after. On the fall of the great Napoleon, Louis XVIII.
                    presented this statue to the British Government, by whom it was afterwards given
                    to the duke of Wellington. Palamedes, Creugas and Damoxenus, the Combat of
                    Theseus and the Centaur, and Hercules and Lichas may close the class of heroic
                    compositions, although the catalogue might be swelled by the enumeration of
                    various others, such as Hector and Ajax, and the statues of Washington, King
                    Ferdinand of Naples, and others. The group of Hercules and Lichas is considered
                    as the most terrible conception of Canova’s mind, and in its peculiar style as
                    scarcely to be excelled.</p>
                <p>Under the second head, namely, compositions of grace and elegance, the statue of
                    Hebe takes the first place in point of date. Four times has the artist embodied
                    in stone the goddess of youth, and each time with some variation. The only
                    material improvement, however, is the substitution of a support more suitable to
                    the simplicity of the art. Each of the statues is, in all its details, in
                    expression, attitude, and delicacy of finish, strikingly elegant. The Dancing
                    Nymphs maintain a character similar to that of the Hebe. The Graces and the
                    Venus are more elevated. The Awakened Nymph is another work of uncommon beauty.
                    The Mother of Napoleon, his consort Maria Louisa (as Concord), to model whom the
                    author made a further journey to Paris in 1810, the Princess Esterhazy, and the
                    muse Polymnia (Elisa Bonaparte) take their place in this class, as do the ideal
                    heads, comprising Corinna, Sappho, Laura, Beatrice, and Helen of Troy.</p>
                <p>The cenotaphs and funeral monuments fall next to be noticed. Of these the most
                    splendid is the monument to the Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria,
                    consisting of nine figures. Besides the two for the Roman pontiffs already
                    mentioned, there is one for Alfieri, another for Emo, a Venetian admiral, and a
                    small model of a cenotaph for Nelson, besides a great variety of monumental
                    rilievos.</p>
                <p>The events which marked the life of the artist, during the first fifteen years of
                    the period in which he was engaged on the above-mentioned works, are of so
                    little importance as scarcely to merit notice. His mind was entirely absorbed in
                    the labours of his studio, and, with the exception of his journeys to Paris, one
                    to Vienna, and a few short intervals of absence in Florence and other parts of
                    Italy, he never quitted Rome. In his own words, “his statues were the sole
                    proofs of his civil existence.” There was, however, another proof, which modesty
                    forbade him to mention, an ever-active benevolence, especially towards artists.
                    In 1815 he was commissioned by the Pope to superintend the transmission from
                    Paris of those works of art which had formerly been conveyed thither under the
                    direction of Napoleon. By his zeal and exertions, for there were many
                    conflicting interests to reconcile, he adjusted the affair in a manner at once
                    creditable to his judgment and fortunate for his country. In the autumn of this
                    year he gratified a wish he had long entertained of visiting London, where he
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n35/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0035-0026"/> received the highest tokens of esteem. The artist
                    for whom he showed particular sympathy and regard in London was Haydon, who
                    might at the time be counted the sole representative of historical painting
                    there, and whom he especially honoured for his championship of the Elgin
                    marbles, then recently transported to England, and ignorantly depreciated by
                    polite connoisseurs. Canova returned to Rome in the beginning of 1816, with the
                    ransomed spoils of his country’s genius. Immediately after, he received several
                    marks of distinction,—by the hand of the Pope himself his name was inscribed in
                    “the Golden Volume of the Capitol,” and he received the title of marquis of
                    Ischia, with an annual pension of 3000 crowns, about £625.</p>
                <p>He now contemplated a great work, a colossal statue of Religion. The model filled
                    Italy with admiration; the marble was procured, and the chisel of the sculptor
                    ready to be applied to it, when the jealousy of churchmen as to the site, or
                    some other cause, deprived the country of the projected work. The mind of Canova
                    was inspired with the warmest sense of devotion, and though foiled in this
                    instance he resolved to consecrate a shrine to the cause. In his native village
                    he began to make preparations for erecting a temple which was to contain, not
                    only the above statue, but other works of his own; within its precincts were to
                    repose also the ashes of the founder. Accordingly, in prosecution of this
                    design, he repaired to Passagno in 1819. Ata sumptuous entertainment which he
                    gave to his workmen, there occurred an incident which marks the kindliness of
                    his character. When the festivities of the day had terminated, he requested the
                    shepherdesses and peasant-girls of the adjacent hamlets to pass in review before
                    him, and to each he made a present, expending on the occasion about £400. We
                    need not therefore be surprised that a few years afterwards, when the remains of
                    the donor came to be deposited in their last asylum, the grief which the
                    surrounding peasantry evinced was in natural expression so intense and
                    irrepressible as to eclipse the studied solemnity of more pompous mourning.</p>
                <p>After the foundation-stone of this edifice had been laid, Canova returned to
                    Rome; but every succeeding autumn he continued to visit Passagno, in order to
                    direct the workmen, and encourage them with pecuniary rewards and medals. In the
                    meantime the vast expenditure exhausted his resources, and compelled him to
                    labour with unceasing assiduity when age and disease had set their seal upon his
                    frame. During the period which intervened between commencing operations at
                    Passagno and his decease, he executed or finished some of his most striking
                    works. Amongst these were the group Mars and Venus, the colossal figure of Pius
                    VI., the Pietà, the St John, the recumbent Magdalen. The last performance which
                    issued from his hand was a colossal bust of his friend the Count Cicognara. In
                    May 1822 he paid a visit to Naples, to superintend the construction of wax
                    moulds for an equestrian statue of the perjured Bourbon king Ferdinand. This
                    journey materially injured his health, but he rallied again òn his return to
                    Rome. Towards the latter end of the year he paid his annual visit to the place
                    of his birth, when he experienced a relapse. He proceeded to Venice, and expired
                    there on the 13th of October 1822, at the age of nearly sixty-five. His disease
                    was one which had affected him from an early age, caused by the continual use of
                    carving-tools, producing a depression of the ribs. The most distinguished
                    funeral honours were paid to his remains, which were deposited in the temple at
                    Passagno on the 25th of the same month.</p>
                <p>Canova, in a certain sense, renovated the art of sculpture in Italy, and brought
                    it back to that standard from which it had declined when the sense both of
                    classical beauty and moderation, and of Titanic invention and human or
                    superhuman energy as embodied by the unexampled genius of Michelangelo, had
                    succumbed to the overloaded and flabby mannerisms of the 17th and 18th
                    centuries. His finishing was refined, and he had a special method of giving a
                    mellow and soft appearance to the marble. He formed his models of the same size
                    as the work he designed was intended to be. The prominent defect of Canova’s
                    attractive and highly trained art is that which may be summed up in the word
                    artificiality,—that quality, so characteristic of the modern mind, which seizes
                    upon certain properties of conception and execution in the art of the past, and
                    upon certain types of beauty or emotion in life, and makes a compound of the
                    two—regulating both by the standard of taste prevalent in contemporary “high
                    society,” a standard which, referring to cultivation and refinement as its
                    higher term, declines towards fashion as the lower. Of his moral character a
                    generous and unwearied benevolence formed the most prominent feature. The
                    greater part of the vast fortune realized by his works was distributed in acts
                    of this description. He established prizes for artists and endowed all the
                    academies of Rome. The aged and unfortunate were also the objects of his
                    peculiar solicitude. His titles were numerous. He was enrolled amongst the
                    nobility of several states, decorated with various orders of knighthood, and
                    associated in the highest professional honours. (See the <hi rend="italic">Life

                    >anstatt,</hi> a town of Wurtemberg, in the circle of the Neckar, about 2∣ miles
                    N.E. of Stuttgart, in 48° 48' 22" N. lat. and 9° 12' 49" E. long. It is situated
                    in the most fertile and populous part of the country, at a point where the high
                    roads of the circle converge, and now forms one of the most flourishing towns in
                    Germany. Its public buildings comprise a cathedral of the 15 th century,
                    dedicated to Uffo, a beautiful town-hall, the royal theatre, the market-house,
                    and various educational institutions. The Wilhelma palace, built in 1842-51 as a
                    summer residence for the late king William, is an elaborate example of the
                    Saracenic style, and is surrounded by extensive and beautiful gardens. A very
                    considerable industry is carried on in the town,—the most important branches
                    being woolspinning, dyeing, cotton-weaving, and the manufacture of steel and
                    machines. The transit trade is still more important and various. A large
                    temporary population is attracted to the town by the fame of its mineral
                    springs. These are about forty in number, for the most part of tepid water,
                    which is used both for drinking and bathing, and is said to be highly beneficial
                    in dyspepsia and weakness of the nervous system. Besides the usual bathing
                    establishments, there are several medical institutions for the treatment of
                    special diseases. Sielberg, a hill in the neighbourhood, upwards of 600 feet in
                    height, is interesting for its caverns and the numerous fossils which it has
                    preserved. Not far distant is the princely seat of Rosenstein (previously known
                    as Kahlenstein), which was built in 1824-30; and on the neighbouring height of
                    the Rothenberg was formerly the ancestral castle of the house of Würtemberg.
                    Canstatt is mentioned as early as ths 8th century, under the name of Condistat,
                    as the seat of a great court held by Charlemagne for the trial of the rebellious
                    dukes of Alemannia and Bavaria. From Louis the Bavarian it received the same
                    imperial rights and privileges as were enjoyed by the town of Esslingen. Down to
                    the middle of the 15 th century it remained the capital of Würtemberg; and as an
                    important place of transport it has been frequently the object of military
                    operations. In <pb break="no"
