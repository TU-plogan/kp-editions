                    which is used as a model for a large picture in fresco, oil, or tapestry. It was
                    also formerly employed in glass and mosaic work. When cartoons are used in
                    fresco-painting, the back of the design is covered with black-lead or other
                    colouring matter; and, this side of the picture being applied to the wall, the
                    artist passes over the lines of the design with a point, and thus obtains an
                    impression. According to another method the outlines of the figures are pricked
                    with a needle, and the cartoon, being placed against the wall, is “pounced,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a bag of black colouring-matter is drawn over the
                    perforations, and the outlines are thus transferred to the wall. In
                    fresco-painting, the portions of the cartoon containing figures were formerly
                    cut out and fixed (generally in successive sections) upon the moist plaster.
                    Their contour was then traced with a pointed instrument, and the outlines
                    appeared lightly incised upon the plaster after the cartoon was withdrawn. In
                    the manufacture of tapestries upon which it is wished to give a representation
                    of the figures of cartoons, these figures are sometimes cut out, and laid behind
                    or under the woof, to guide the operations of the artist. In this case the
                    cartoons are coloured.</p>
                <p>Cartoons have been executed by some of the most distinguished masters; the
                    greatest extant performances in this line of art are those of Raphael. They are
                    seven in number, coloured in distemper; and at present they adorn the South
                    Kensington Museum in London, having beén removed thereto from their proper home,
                    the palace of Hampton Court. With respect to their merits, they count among the
                    best of Raphael’s productions, Lanzi even pronounces them to be in beauty
                    superior to anything else the world has ever seen. Not that they all present
                    features of perfect loveliness, and limbs of faultless symmetry,—this is far
                    from being the case j but in harmony of design, in the universal adaptation of
                    means to one great end, and in the grasp of soul which they display, they stand
                    among the foremost works of the designing art. The history of these cartoons is
                    curious. Leo X. employed Raphael in designing (in 1515-16) a series of
                    Scriptural subjects, which were first to be finished in cartoons, and then to be
                    imitated in tapestry by Flemish artists, and used for the decoration of the
                    Sixtine Chapel. Two principal sets of tapestries were accordingly executed at
                    Arras in Flanders; but it is supposed that neither Leo nor Raphael lived to see
                    them. The set which went to Rome was twice carried away by invaders, first in
                    1527, and afterwards in 1798. In the first instance they were restored in a
                    perfect state , but after their return in 1814 one was wanting—the cupidity of a
                    Genoese Jew having induced him to destroy it for the sake of the precious metal
                    which it contained. Authorities differ as to the original number of cartoons,
                    but there appear to have been twenty-five,— some by Raphael himself, assisted by
                    Francesco Penni, others by the surviving pupils of Raphael. The cartoons after
                    which the tapestries were woven were not, it would seem, restored to Rome, but
                    remained as lumber about the manufactory in Arras till after the revolution of
                    the Low Countries, when seven of them which had escaped destruction uere
                    purchased by Charles I., on the recommendation of Rubens. They were found much
                    injured, “holes being pricked in them for the weavers to pounce the outlines,
                    and in other parts they were almost cut through by tracing.” It has never been
                    ascertained what became of the other cartoons. Three tapestries, the cartoons of
                    which by Raphael no longer exist, are in the Vatican,—representing the Stoning
                    of St Stephen, the Conversion of St Paul, and St Paul in prison at Philippi.</p>
                <p>Besides the cartoons of Raphael, two, to which an extraordinary celebrity in
                    art-history attaches, were those executed in competition by Leonardo da Vinci
                    and by Michelangelo,—the former named the Battle of the Standard, and the latter
                    the Cartoon of Fisa—Soldiers bathing, surprised by the approach of the enemy.
                    Both these great works have perished, but the general design of them has been
                    preserved. In recent times some of the most eminent designers of cartoons have
                    been masters of the German School,—Cornelius, Kaulbach, Steinle, Fuhrich,
                    &lt;fcc.; indeed, as a general rule, these artists appear to greater advantage
                    in their cartoons than in the completed paintings of the same compositions. In
                    England cartoon-work took <pb break="no"

                    when a competition was going on for the decoration of the new Houses of
                    Parliament. Dyce and Maclise have left examples of uncommon mark in this line.
