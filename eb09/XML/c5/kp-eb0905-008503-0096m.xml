                    <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> O), an acid sul
                    stance forming one of the numerous constituents of coal-tar, was first described
                    by Runge in 1834. Its constitution was investigated by Laurent in 1841, who,
                    regarding it as a hydrated oxide of the compound radical phenyl, termed it the
                    hydrate of phenyl. Among other names it has received are phenic acid, phenyl
                    alcohol, and creosote; but though the latter is popularly applied to an impure
                    mixtare of carbolic acid and the allied cresylic acid, it properly belongs to an
                    altogether distinct substance. In addition to being an abundant constituent of
                    coal-tar, carbolic acid is formed by the action of heat upon salicylic acid; it
                    can be obtained by the dry distillation of gum-benzoin and other resinous
                    substances; traces of it are found in the urine of the horse, the ox, and man;
                    and to it castoreum owes its peculiar odour.</p>
                <p>Commercial carbolic acid is prepared solely from coal-tar by a method of which
                    the following is an outline. When coal-tar is distilled the most volatile
                    products—benzol, toluol, cumol, &amp;c., first come away, after which when the
                    temperature rises from 150° C. to 200° C. crude carbolic acid distils over. This
                    distillate is mixed with a strong solution of caustic potash, and the resulting
                    carbolate of potash is in its turn treated with sulphuric acid, which decomposes
                    the carbolate, liberating carbolic acid, which rises to the surface as an oily
                    layer, and is removed by a syphon. The product is purified by washing and
                    repeated rectification, and finally cooled down to 10° C., when it forms whitish
                    acicular crystals, from which the unsolidified acid is drained away.
                    Crystallized carbolic acid of commerce retains a strong naphthalic odour, from
                    which it may be freed for medicinal or other purposes by a method recommended by
                    Professor Church. Into 1 tt&gt; of the crystallized acid he pours 20 &amp; of
                    cold distilled water, care being taken that the whole of the acid shall not be
                    dissolved. The mixture is repeatedly shaken till from 2 to 3 ounces of the acid
                    only remains undissolved, in which residue the whole of the impurities are
                    retained. From this, the aqueous solution is syphoned off, and if necessary,
                    filtered, and then pure powdered common salt is added to it till the salt will
                    no longer dissolve. After standing some time the whole of the carbolic acid
                    rises to the surface, and floats as a yellow oily layer, which as it contains 5
                    per cent, of water will not crystallize. It may be crystallized by distilling
                    from a little lime, and the product collected up to 185° C. will possess only a
                    faint pleasant aromatic odour. Pure carbolic acid crystallizes in long
                    colourless needles; it melts at 35° C., and boils about 187° C. It is soluble in
                    all proportions in alcohol, ether, and strong acetic acid, but dissolves only
                    sparingly in water. It does not redden litmus paper; it exerts a powerful
                    corrosive action on the skin; its aqueous solution coagulates albumen; and it
                    unites with animal substances, preserving them from decomposition, and removing,
                    the offensive odour from putrefying matter.</p>
                <p>The extensive manufacture and employment of carbolic acid are, in a large degree,
                    owing to the exertions of the late Professor Crace Calvert, who was the first to
                    manufacture it in the crystalline form. The development of the aniline colour
                    industry also communicated an impetus to the manufacture of carbolic acid, as
                    the one is, in a sense, a secondary product of the other. A great many useful
                    applications have opened up for the employment of the acid in addition to its
                    extensive medicinal and antiseptic uses (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Antiseptics).</hi> For domestic, sanitary, and medicinal use, carbolic acid is
                    prepared in various states of purity and strength. Toilet and medicated soaps,
                    tooth powder, disinfecting powder, &lt;fcc., are all prepared containing
                    definite proportions of the acid. A large quantity of crude carbolic acid is
                    employed under the name of creosote for impregnating wood for railway sleepers
                    and piles, and for engineering purposes generally,—a method of preserving wood
                    discovered and patented by Mr John Bethell.</p>
                <p>Carbolic acid is, however, most largely consumed in the preparation of several
                    dyeing materials, which are second only in importance to the colours derived
                    from aniline. Picric or carbazotic acid is a brilliant yellow dye-stuff, much
                    used for wool and silk dyeing, prepared by very cautiously addingin small
                    quantities nitric acid to crystallized carbolic acid, or to a mixture of
                    carbolic acid with sulphuric acid. From picric acid in its turn two derivatives
                    are obtained.</p>

                <p>isopurpuric acid and picramic acid, but these have only a limited application in
                    dyeing. Coralline, a dye in extensive use, yielding a variety of fine red
                    shades, is obtained by heating together two parts of oxalic acid, three of
                    carbolic acid, and four of sulphuric acid to a temperature of from 140° C. to
                    150° C. Peonine, or red coralline, is a product of coralline obtained by acting
                    on it at a temperature of about 130 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> C. with a
                    concentrated solution of ammonia. It yields on wool and silk a very rich durable
                    Turkey-red-like shade. Aurine, or yellow coralline, is made by mixing together
                    oxalic acid, carbolic acid and sulphuric acid, the same as for ordinary
                    coralline, but the mixture is submitted to a less elevated temperature. It dyes
                    fine yellow and orange shades on animal fibres. Phénicienne, or rothine, is a
                    dye producing shades varying from a deep garnet red to a chamois colour, made by
                    adding to carbolic acid a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids. Fol’s yellow is
                    manufactured by heating to 100° C. a mixture of five parts of carbolic acid and
                    three of powdered arsenic acid. Besides these various other dyes having carbolic
                    acid for their basis have been introduced and some of them are commercially
                    established.</p>
