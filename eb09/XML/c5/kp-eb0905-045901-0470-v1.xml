                <p>HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.—The acquaintance of the ancients with the modes of
                    extracting several of the metals from their ores, and also with the arts of
                    dyeing, tanning, and glassmaking, and their recognition of various kinds of
                    salts, earths, and inflammable substances show that they must have been
                    possessed of a knowledge of a considerable number of chemical facts; but that
                    this knowledge was to any extent gained by experimental research rather than by
                    mere accident, or that when acquired it was applied to the classification of
                    chemical phenomena, or to the establishment of any theory explanatory of them,
                    there is no evidence to show. Until comparatively recent times the principles of
                    metaphysical philosophy were not recognized as distinct from those of chemistry;
                    men of learning gave themselves up to speculation upon the obvious physical
                    characteristics of matter, whilst they neglected the indirect observation of
                    their intrinsic and specific properties; analogies were a sufficient basis for
                    the classification of bodies, and a consideration of their external
                    peculiarities—“a decomposition of bodies,” to use the words of Whewell, “into
                    adjectives, not into substantives ”—stood in the place of analysis. Thus we find
                    that the qualities of the “elements” of the school of Aristotle are all
                    physical, they are dry or humid, warm or cold, light or heavy; the idea of
                    substances distinguished by special chemical properties was as yet no less
                    foreign to men’s minds than a knowledge of their ultimate composition.</p>
                <p>Ideas similar to those of Aristotle concerning the elementary constitution of the
                    universe were early prevalent in the East, whence they appear to have found
                    their way into Europe. The elements, according to the Hindus, were earth, air,
                    fire, water, and ether , and in the fourth book of “Chow,” forming part of the
                    Chinese historical records known as the <hi rend="italic">Shoo King,</hi> there
                    is a document supposed to date from 2000 B.C., in which is given an account of
                    the five elements, namely, earth, fire, water, metal, and wood. Of what
                    precisely was meant by an “element” in the language of the ancient philosophers
                    and early chemists it is difficult to get any definite idea; the term could
                    hardly, in fact, be used otherwise than in a vague sense before the exact
                    processes of chemical analysis had shown that the properties of matter vary
                    according to the presence or absence within it of definite quantities of certain
                    substances, distinct in properties from one another, and un-resolvable into
                    other substances.</p>
                <p>To the doctrine of a plurality of elements, as opposed to the systems of Thales
                    and Heraclitus, may be ascribed the origin of the conception that by the
                    analysis and synthesis of bodies the various kinds of matter with all their
                    diversity of physical features might be produced, a conception that took
                    practical shape in the processes of alchemy, which, as Liebig has remarked, “was
                    never at any time different from chemistry.” During the alchemistical period a
                    knowledge of the properties of bodies was acquired; afterwards chemistry showed
                    the relations, connections, and limits of these properties. The first mention of
                        <hi rend="italic">chemistry (χημeia)</hi> is found in the dictionary of
                    Suidas, who flourished in the 11th century; he defines it as “the preparaticn of
                    silver and gold,” and relates that Diocletian, lest the Egyptians should become
                    rich and capable of resisting the Roman power, caused their books on chemistry
                    to be burnt. He further asserts that the art was known as early as the period of
                    the Argonautic expedition, the golden fleece being a treatise written on skins
                    (δ∈pμασι) concerning the making of gold. The belief in the art of making gold
                    and silver, held by the Greeks from the 5th to the 15tlι century, was by them
                    communicated to the Arabs, possibly not long after the conquest of Egypt in 640;
                    and from the 11th to the 15th century alchemy was diligently studied by the
                    philosophers of Italy, France, Germany, and England.</p>
                <p>That the claims of alchemy, notwithstanding repeated demonstrations of their
                    futility, so long received the serious attention of mankind, is attributable to
                    various causes. Not only did impostors find free scope in the credulity of an
                    age of ignorance for the exercise of their arts; but men of talent and culture,
                    relying on tradition, were led honestly to support the doctrine of the
                    transmutation of metals. The existence of the philosopher’s stone having once
                    been accepted as an ascertained fact, it is not extraordinary that Isaacus
                    Hollandus is able to indicate the method of its preparation from “adamic” or
                    “virgin” earth, and its action when medicinally employed; that Roger Bacon,
                    Raymond Lully, Basil Valentin, and John Price know the exact quantities of it to
                    be used in transmutation; and that George Rippel, in the 15th century, has
                    grounds for regarding its action as similar to that of a ferment. In the view of
                    some alchemists, the ultimate principles of matter were Aristotle’s four
                    elements, the proximate constituents were sulphur and mercury, the father and
                    mother of the metals; gold was supposed to have attained to the perfection of
                    its nature by passing in succession through the forms of lead, brass, and
                    silver; gold and silver were held to contain very pure red sulphur and white
                    quicksilver, whereas in the other metals these materials were coarser and of a
                    different colour. Geber, judging from an analogy instituted between the healthy
                    human being and gold, the most perfect of the metals, regarded silver, mercury,
                    copper, iron, lead, and tin in the light of lepers that required to be
                    healed.</p>
                <p>To the evidence of their imaginations the alchemists were able to add that of
                    actual observation; the fact that many ores resembling metals were changed and
                    decomposed by heat could not but offer support to theories formed at a time when
                    the nature of chemical combination was not understood; and the apparent
                    transition of many bodies into one another, as, for example, that of clouds into
                    water, was not less wonderful to them than the transmutation of the lighter
                    metals into gold.</p>
                <p>It was in the 16th century that a new race of alchemists, or spagyrists, as they
                    were termed, arose, who, abandoning the search for the philosopher’s stone,
                    began to direct their energies to the discovery of chemical remedies for the
                    various diseases of the body. “The true use of chemistry,” says Paracelsus
                    (1493—1541) “is not to make gold, but to prepare medicines.” Rejecting the
                    teaching of Galen, he admitted three or four elements, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >star,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">root,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                        >element,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">sperm</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >true seed,</hi> which were originally confounded together in the <hi
                        rend="italic">chaos</hi> or <hi rend="italic">yliados</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi> these elements he asserted were composed of the three principles <hi
                        rend="italic">sideric salt</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sulphur</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">mercury,</hi> the cause respectively of the qualities of
                    fixity, combustibility, and fluidity and volatility. The theories of Paracelsus
                    found many advocates, amongst whom may be mentioned Thurneysser (1531-1596),
                    Bodenstein, Taxites, Dorn, Sennert, and Duchesne; and with some modifications
                    they were maintained in the 17th century by Dr Willis (1621-1675), the
                    celebrated English anatomist and iatro-chemist, and by Lefebvre and Lémery in
                    France, according to whose system matter consisted of the active principles <hi
                        rend="italic">mercury</hi> or <hi rend="italic">spirit, sulphur</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">oil,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">salt,</hi> and the passive
                    principles <hi rend="italic">water</hi> or <hi rend="italic">phlegm</hi> and <hi

                <p>Among the contemporaries but not the followers of Paracelsus, the German
                    metallurgist Agricola (1494-1555) deserves mention; his great work, <hi
                        rend="italic">De Re Metallica,</hi> is the most valuable contribution to
                    practical chemistry that appeared in the 16th century. Libavius also, who diedin
                    1616, did much to forward chemical science at this period. From his writings,
                    however, in which he puts forward the views both of Paracelsus and of Aristotle
                    concerning the constitution of bodies, it does not appear that his notions of
                    chemical combination were more definite than those of his predecessors.</p>
                <p>J. B. Van Helmout (1577-1644), who, like Paracelsus, repudiated the doctrines of
                    the Galenists, held opinions that in many respects were no advance upon those of
                    the former. He looked upon water as the true principle of all existing things,
                    inclusive of the three principles salt, sulphur, and mercury, which therefore
                    were not elements; to air, however, he granted the rank of a true element. The
                        <hi rend="italic">archoeus</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> something without
                    form, and independent of the elements—he imagined to draw all bodies from water,
                    to which its generating spirit was attracted by the odour of a <hi rend="italic"
                        >ferment</hi> or <hi rend="italic">aura</hi><hi rend="italic">vitalis.</hi>
                    The vapour produced by the fermentation of water was, according to Van Helmont,
                    a gas, and the same term was by him for the first time applied to carbon
                    dioxide, which he termed <hi rend="italic">gas</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >sylvestre,</hi> and to other bodies resembling air.</p>
                <p>To Francis de la Boë Sylvius (1614-1672), who studied with care the works of Van
                    Helmont and of Descartes, is due the foundation of the iatro-chemical sect among
                    physicians. In his view the health of the human frame depends upon the relation
                    of its fluids, which were acid and alkaline <hi rend="italic">(acidum</hi> aud
                        <hi rend="italic">lixivum),</hi> and these by union produced a neutral and
                    milder substance; two kinds of diseases were distinguished, the result either of
                    alkaline or of acid acridity. The new doctrine served to explain many chemical
                    facts, and led to the establishment by Lémery and Macquer of a distinction
                    between acid and alkaline or, as they were afterwards called, basic compounds.
                    This recognition of this chemical difference in bodies and their consequent
                    disposition to unite prepared the way for the conception of chemical attraction
                    or affinity.</p>
                <p>In the works of Glauber (1604-1668), alchemy, the preparation of chemical
                    medicines, and the processes employed by him for that end are treated of. His
                        <hi rend="italic">Miraculum</hi><hi rend="italic">Mundi</hi> has for its
                    subject the virtues of the <hi rend="italic">sal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >mirabile,</hi> sulphate of sodium, or Glauber’s salt, of which he was the
                    discoverer; and in other of his works he describes various chlorides of the
                    metals, the sulphates of iron and copper, aud sulphuric, nitric, and
                    hydrochloric acids, but with respect to their ultimate constitution he advances
                    no theory; he variously states in his different works that mercury and salt are
                    the principles of all metals, that salt is the origin of all things, aud again
                    that water and earth have produced all the minerals and metals.</p>
                <p>The first to attempt to overthrow the doctrines of the iatro-chemists was Robert
                    Boyle (1627-1691), who in 1661 published the first edition of <hi rend="italic"
                        >The Sceptical Chemist, or Ghymico-Physical Doubts and Paradoxes touching
                        the Experiments whereby vulgar Spagyrists are wont to endeavour to evince
                        their Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury to be the true Principles of Things,</hi> a
                    treatise in which he shows the doubtful character of the doctrine of the
                    threefold constitution of matter, and lays stress upon the influence of heat in
                    the formation of new bodies, not necessarily preexistent as such in the
                    substances from which they are produced. If, as he tells us, he is somewhat too
                    indulgent of suspicion against the hypotheses or arguments of other chemists, he
                    is only acting in compliance with the advice of Aristotle, and bending a crooked
                    stick the contrary way, to reduce it at length to straightness. Into the mouth
                    of</p>
                <p>“Themistius” he puts the complaint that “Aristotle’s hypothesis had not been
                    called in question till in the last century Paracelsus and some few other sooty
                    empiricks, having their eyes darkened and their brains troubled with the smoke
                    of their furnaces, began to rail at the Peripatetick doctrine, which they were
                    too illiterate to understand, and to tell the credulous world that they could
                    see the three ingredients in mixed bodies, which, to gain themselves the repute
                    of inventera, they endeavoured to disguise by calling them—instead of earth, and
                    fire, and vapour—salt, sulphur, and mercury, to which they gave the canting
                    title of hypostatical principles.” Boyle inclines to a belief in “but one
                    universal matter of things, as it is known that the Aristotelians themselves
                    acknowledge, who called it <hi rend="italic">ĭnateria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >prima;</hi> the portions of this matter seem to differ from one another in
                    certain qualities or accidents, fewer or more.” He thinks that elementary
                    corpuscles are of various sizes, and of more sorts than three or four or five;
                    and that the combination of two of these corpuscles may give rise to a new body
                    as really one as either of the corpuscles before they were mingled or
                    confounded, this concretion being endowed with distinct qualities, and no more
                    by fire or any known way of analysis divisible into the corpuscles that had
                    first concurred to make it, than either of them could by the same means be
                    subdivided into other particles. He furthermore deduces from his arguments the
                    corollary, “That it may as yet be doubted whether or no there be any determinate
                    number of elements; or, if you please, whether or no all compound bodies do
                    consist of the same number of elementary ingredients or material principles.” In
                    another work, <hi rend="italic">The Imperfections of the Chemical Doctrine of
                        Qualities,</hi> Boyle points out the arbitrary nature of Sylvius’s
                    classification of all substances as acids and alkalies, and the needlessness and
                    unsatisfactory character of his hypotheses. Iatro-chemistry was opposed also by
                    Conring (1606—1681), Sydenham (1624-1689), Pitcairne (1652-1713), and his pupil
                    Boerhaave (1668-1738), the author of the excellent <hi rend="italic"
                        >Elementa</hi><hi rend="italic">Chemiae;</hi> and though vigorously
                    supported by De Blegny, Borrichius, Viridet, Vieussens, and others, it gradually
                    lost repute, and was finally overthrown by F. Hoffmann (1660-1742).</p>
                <p>Of the labours of Kunckel (1630-1703) in the cause of chemistry it is impossible
                    to give an account within the com- 'pass of the present sketch; but whilst the
                    science was enriched by means of his numerous researches, amongst which may be
                    mentioned those on phosphorus, it received no assistance from his theoretical
                    views concerning the constitution of bodies; thus, for instance, he rejected the
                    belief in the three principles of Paracelsus, yet maintained that all metals
                    contained common quicksilver; and though their increase in weight by calcination
                    was not, according to him, due to the absorption of ponderable fiery material,
                    the explanation he offered of this phenomenon was even less satisfactory.</p>
                <p>To Becher (1635-1682) and to Stahl (1660-1734) chemistry owes the introduction of
                    the first consistent theory of the constitution of compounds and of chemical
                    action. Becher held that the primary ingredients of matter were water and earth,
                    and that from these were produced three earths—the fusible or stony, the fatty,
                    and the fluid earths,—improperly called salt, sulphur, and mercury. Stahl, who
                    developed the doctrines of Becher, enumeratedfour elements—water, acid, earth,
                    and phlogiston. Becher had explained the calcination of metals on the
                    supposition that they consisted of an earth and a something of which they became
                    deprived on ignition; the burning of brimstone was, in like manner, thought to
                    be its resolution into an acid and true sulphur, or that combustible part which
                    was dispelled by heat. It was this supposed combustible body to which the name

                    spirits assigned to metals and salts by the alchemists, or to what Geber called
                    the “humidity,” and Cardan the “celestial heat” of metals. When by means of
                    charcoal a metallic calx was reduced, or a compound containing sulphur was
                    obtained from fused sodium sulphate, phlogiston was supposed to be absorbed from
                    the charcoal, which with <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> amp black and other
                    reducing agents came in time to be regarded as nearly pure phlogiston. Bodies
                    that would not burn were thought to have already parted with their phlogiston.
                    From a consideration of the insolubility of most combustible substances arose
                    the idea that phlogiston was a dry and earthy body, capable of receiving a
                    motion of great velocity—the <hi rend="italic">motus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >verticillaris</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> manifested when ignition or
                    flame was produced. John Rey had in 1630 remarked that metals grow heavier when
                    calcined by the absorption of “thickened air,” but had given no general theory
                    of combustion, or explanation why many substances become lighter or are lost
                    sight of when heated. Boyle, too, bad noticed the increase of weight caused by
                    the calcination of metals, and had attributed it to the combination of the
                    latter with heat particles; and Stabel and others were not slow to object that
                    this fact negatived the supposition that calcination consisted in a subtraction
                    of phlogiston; the Stahlians, however, met the difficulty by declaring that
                    substance to be the principle of levity or negative weight.</p>
                <p>F. Hoffmann, who contributed greatly to the progress of analytical chemistry in
                    Germany, held with Stahl that sulphur consisted of acid and phlogiston, and that
                    combustible bodies contained something which might be described as phlogiston,
                    but thought it possible that the calces of metals were formed, not by the
                    subtraction of phlogiston, but by the combination of the metals with an acid
                    material. Boerhaave, without directly attacking the phlogistic theory, casts
                    doubts upon the assumption of the existence of a combustible principle and of
                    earthy substances in the metals. The view of Homberg (1652-1715) was that the
                    principle of combustibility in inflammable minerals and in vegetable substances
                    was sulphur; and E. F. Geoffroy (1672-1731) regarded phlogiston as a sulphurous
                    or oily principle. Amongst the most active supporters of the doctrines of Stahl
                    were Neumann (1683-1737); J. II. Pott (1692-1777), distinguished for his
                    researches on the behaviour of mineral substances at high temperatures; Marggraf
                    (1709-1782); and Macquer (1718-1784), the discoverer of arsenic acid. Other
                    celebrated chemists who flourished during the phlogistic period were Réaumur
                    (1683- 1757), Hellot (1685—1766), and Duhamel du Monceau (1700-1782), who first
                    proved the nature of the base of common salt.</p>
                <p>The phlogistic theory of Stahl, though incorrect, was of no small assistance
                    towards a true understanding of chemical phenomena. It was based upon
                    experimental data, the interpretation of which served for the correlation of
                    facts of which but vague and enigmatic explanations had formerly been given. The
                    supposed subtraction of phlogiston in the calcination of metals, though
                    equivalent in reality to the addħion of oxygen, was yet a loss of potential
                    energy, by virtue of the combination of the metal with the gas; and the gain of
                    phlogiston was an increase of potential energy, attendant on the removal of
                    oxygen.</p>
                <p>It was only in the latter part of the 18th century that the influence of the
                    presence of air upon the formation of many chemical compounds was generally
                    perceived, and that through the use of the balance the nature of gases began to
                    be comprehended and such airy nothingness became commonly regarded as an
                    intimate and necessary constituent of various solid and fluid bodies. The
                    phlogistic theory gave to its adherents so plausible and moreover so
                    circumstantial an account of the modes of chemical action, that facts and
                    observations which caused at a later time a complete revolution in the theory of
                    chemistry, such, for instance, as regarded the existence and properties of
                    oxygen, remained without explanation, and almost unheeded. Robert Hooke, so
                    early as 1665, in his <hi rend="italic">Micrograplιia,</hi> foreshadowed the
                    discoveries of Priestley and his contemporaries, when he advanced the opinion
                    that in common air there existed a substance like, if not the same as, that
                    fixed in saltpetre, and which at an elevated temperature dissolved combustibles
                    such as sulphurous bodies with a rapidity sufficient to occasion the motion of
                    fire, and to create light; this solvent he considered to he far less for a given
                    bulk of air than of saltpetre. The investigations of Mayow (1645-1679) are
                    particularly interesting. In treatises published at Oxford in 1668 and 1674
                    oxygen is actually described by him under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >fire-air, aerial spirit,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nitre-air</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> all acids are said to contain it, and it is necessary
                    for combustion and respiration, processes which are therefore analogous; it is
                    the nitre-air of the atmosphere that causes fermentation and the souring of
                    wines, that produces sulphuric acid from sulphur, and effects the calcination of
                    metals.</p>
                <p>Early in the 18th century Newton in his <hi rend="italic">Opticks</hi> indicated
                    the nature and the modes of formation of gases. “Dense bodies,” he tells us, “by
                    fermentation rarefy into several sorts of air; and this air by fermentation, and
                    sometimes without it, returns into dense bodies ;” and further on he remarks
                    that the particles shaken off from bodies by heat or fermentation, so soon as
                    they are beyond the reach of the attraction of the body, recede from it, and
                    also from one another with great strength, so as sometimes to take up above a
                    million of times more space than they did before in the form of a dense body.
                    This vast contraction and expansion seem to him unintelligible by feigning the
                    particles of air to be springy and ramous, or rolled up like hoops, or by any
                    other means than a repulsive power; the particles of fluids which do not cohere
                    strongly are most easily rarefied into vapour; but those which are grosser, or
                    cohere by a stronger attraction, are not separated without a stronger heat, or
                    perhaps not without fermentation; being rarefied by fermentation they become
                    true permanent air, those particles receding from one another with the greatest
                    force, and being most difficultly brought together, which upon contact adhere
                    most firmly.— <hi rend="italic">(Opticks,</hi> bk. iii., qu. 30 and 31,
                    1730.)</p>
                <p>In 1727 Dr Stephen Hales (1677-1761), who had for some years been engaged in
                    investigations similar to those of Mayow, gave to the world in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Statical Essays</hi> the collective results of his
                    observations. The atmosphere he describes in this work as a fine elastic fluid,
                    with particles of very different natures floating in it, whereby it is fitted to
                    be the breath of life of vegetables as well as of animals. The effect of
                    respiration and of the burning of sulphur in air is to deprive it of its
                    elasticity; and country air is cleaner and more elastic than that of towns.
                    Elasticity, we read, is not an essential immutable property of air particles;
                    “they are easily changed from an elastic to a fixed state by the strong
                    attraction of the acid, sulphureous, and saline particles, which abound in the
                    air. Whence it is reasonable to conclude that our atmosphere is a chaos,
                    consisting not only of elastic, but also of unelastic air particles, which in
                    great plenty float in it.”— <hi rend="italic">(Stat. Ess.,</hi> vol. i. 4th ed.,
                    1769.) Hales did not, however, attempt to determine the distinctive properties
                    of the various gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, and of the substances on
                    which he experimented: all are indiscriminately designated <pb break="no"

                    fermentation, and that contributes to the briskness of Pyrmont and other mineral
                    waters; 108 cubic inches of air are procured from a cubic inch of iron filings
                    and the same quantity of oil of vitriol; and 33 cubic inches of air are the
                    result of distilling a cubic inch of dog’s blood. Hales determined also the
                    volume of air to be obtained by distilling certain quantities of amber, chalk,
                    coal, grey pyrites, aqua-fortis, antimony, tobacco, and other materials, but
                    apparently with no other end in view than the establishment of the fact that air
                    is contained in a great number of substances. He had learned to interrogate, but
                    not to cross-examine nature.</p>
                <p>The first important step towards a knowledge of the specific properties of the
                    various gaseous bodies was that made in the middle of the 18th century by Dr
                    Black, who experimentally proved that the causticity acquired on ignition by
                    mild magnesia and lime was attributable not to the entrance into them of
                    ponderable caloric, but to the expulsion of a peculiar kind of air, which
                    occurred fixed, or in a state of combination, in the unburnt or mild earths, and
                    caused them to be heavier before than after exposure to heat. He found it
                    possible, in fact, to impart to these substances a large amount of heat, which
                    became latent, whilst at the same time their weight was lessened by the loss of
                    “fixed air” (carbon dioxide). It was discovered by Black that alkalies in
                    contact with quicklime became caustic by giving up their fixed air to the lime,
                    which was thereby increased in weight and rendered mild. It was thus, by
                    employing the balance as an experimental test of the composition of bodies, that
                    Black laid the foundation of quantitative chemistry, and in so doing gave the
                    first occasion to the strife that twenty years later began to rage between the
                    followers of Stahl and the antiphlogistians.</p>
                <p>Foremost in the number of those who after Black distinguished themselves as
                    pneumatic chemists, was Dr J. Priestley (1733-1804). His first discovery, made
                    in 1772, was nitric oxide gas, which he soon employed in the analysis of air.
                    Boyle, more than a century before Priestley began his experiments, had stated in
                        <hi rend="italic">The Sceptical Chemist,</hi> that “without the addition of
                    any extraneous body, quicksilver may by fire alone, and that in glass vessels,
                    be deprived of its silver-like colour, and be turned into a red body; from this
                    red body, without addition, likewise may be obtained a mercury bright and
                    specular as it was before.”— <hi rend="italic">(Boylds Works,</hi> ed. Birch, p.
                    352, Lond. 1744.) On the 1st of August, 1774, Priestley discovered that the red
                    oxide of mercury evolved a gas when heated. This gas (oxgyen) being superior
                    even to the air as a supporter of combustion was regarded by him as <hi
                        rend="italic">dephlogisticated air</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the
                    incombustible part of the atmosphere he supposed to be saturated with
                    phlogiston, on the assumption that a gas was so much the better adapted for
                    supporting combustion as it contained within itself a smaller quantity of that
                    body. Common air, by drawing phlogiston from burning substances, became, as he
                    thought, phlogisticated air, and on that account had no longer any attraction
                    for phlogiston, or, in other words, any power of supporting combustion. The
                    phlogiston evolved in the burning of combustibles and in the calcination of
                    metals was supposed to unite with the atmosphere or the dephlogisticated air
                    contained therein, and that which was produced by the action on the atmosphere
                    of the phlogiston lost by the metals was the cause of the increased weight of
                    their calces. The opinion that the air given off during the solution of metals
                    in acid was their combustible constituent had been advanced in 1700 by Lémery;
                    and Priestley, guided apparently by the notion suggested by Cavendish’s
                    experiments, that to unite with acids metals must part with their phlogiston,
                    considered inflammable air (hydrogen) either as identical with or at least very
                    rich in that principle. In 1788, in order to explain the formation of water from
                    a mixture of inflammable and dephlogisticated air, he put forward the hypothesis
                    that water entered into the composition of these and of fixed and other airs;
                    inflammable air, he thought, might be the principle of alkalinity,
                    dephlogisticated air, as Lavoisier had shown, being the principle of acidity. To
                    the last Priestley was an advocate of the phlogistic philosophy, and though
                    unquestionably one of the fathers of modern chemistry was always, to quote the
                    words of Cuvier, “un père qui ne voulut jamais reconnoitre sa fille.” Besides
                    nitric oxide and nitrogen, Priestley first made known sulphurous acid gas,
                    gaseous ammonia and hydrochloric acid, and carbon monoxide; and he it was who,
                    by showing that the condition of ammoniacal gas and of common air is altered by
                    the transmission of electric sparks, led to Berthollet’s analysis of ammonia,
                    and Cavendish’s discovery of the composition of nitric acid.</p>
                <p>Henry Cavendish (1731-1810), who, like Priestley, was of the phlogistic school,
                    contributed by his discoveries and carefully conducted investigations,
                    especially as regards gases, scarcely less than that experimenter to the advance
                    in chemical knowledge which before the beginning of the 19th century effected
                    the subversion of the Stahlian philosophy. To him chemists are indebted for the
                    invention of the pneumatio trough, and to him is due the first recognition of
                    the importance of determining the specific gravities of the various gases. He
                    established the radical difference between hydrogen and nitrogen, and discovered
                    in 1781 that hydrogen and dephlogisticated air (oxygen), when exploded in a
                    close vessel in proportions sufficient almost entirely to phlogisticate the
                    burnt air, produced pure water; and that water was also formed when a mixture of
                    common air and inflammable air was exploded, a reduction of one-fifth of the
                    bulk of the former air being then observable. According to Cavendish, water
                    consisted of phlogiston and dephlogisticated air; inflammable air, of phlogiston
                    and water; the action of dephlogisticated upon inflammable air when exploded
                    with it was to unite with its phlogiston to form water, and consequently to set
                    free the water of the inflammable air; thus both airs became water.— <hi
                        rend="italic">(Trans. Roy. Soc.,</hi> 1784 and 1785.) Lavoisier had shown in
                    1770 the incorrectness of the notion prevalent among chemists that water by
                    continued boiling and redistillation could be transformed into an earth.
                    Cavendish’s discovery deprived it of the rank of an element, to which, according
                    to the vague Aristotelian doctrines of the time, it was entitled, and thus
                    prepared the way for the acceptation of correct and definite views concerning
                    the elementary bodies. Lavoisier, availing himself of the facts ascertained by
                    Cavendish, taught that oxygen, the so-calleddephlogisticated air, was an
                    element, and that combined with it was imponderable caloric; inflammable air, or
                    hydrogen, as he termed it, was another element, which had the power of
                    disengaging from caloric a weight equal to its own of oxygen, with which it
                    united to form water. The new doctrine did not, however, meet with very ready
                    acceptance from the phlogistians. “It is inconceivable,” writes one of them,
                    “how water, which is absolutely incombustible, should have so combustible a body
                    as inflammable gas is for one of its component parts; whereas, by admitting pure
                    air in its whole substance to be one of the component parts of water, and the
                    other to consist of the base only of inflammable gas, which being burnt by the
                    passage of the electric spark through it, its phlogiston is converted into light
                    and heat, the whole doctrine of the generation of water becomes plain and
                    easy.”—(Hopson, <hi rend="italic">Chemistry,</hi> 1789.)</p>
                <p>Among the most eminent of the contemporaries of Priestley and Cavendish that
                    cherished a belief in the existence of phlogiston was the Swedish chemist

                    measured quantities of common air, when kept in contact with certain substances,
                    e.y., solution of potassium sulphide or moist iron-filings, contracted in
                    volume, and became incapable of supporting combustion. As the specific gravity
                    of the air had not augmented, the decrease of bulk, Scheele concluded, could not
                    be due, as he had at first conjectured, to the absorption of phlogiston; the
                    atmosphere must, therefore, consist of two distinct bodies. One of these, the
                    residual air, he assumed to be incapable of combining with phlogiston; the
                    other, having a strong attraction for that substance, had united with it,
                    forming heat, which had penetrated through the walls of the vessel containing
                    it— hence the diminution of the original volume of air. Heat, Scheele
                    considered, was decomposed by means of bodies which had a strong attraction for
                    its phlogiston, such as the calces of gold, silver, and mercury, and oil of
                    vitriol mixed with black manganese ore, and consequently the other constituent
                    of heat, empyreal or fire-air (oxygen), became isolated. Heat could be
                    synthesized, for it was produced by the union of the phlogiston of coals with
                    fireair. Light, like heat, was a compound of fire-air and phlogiston, but was
                    richer in the latter constituent, to the varying proportions of which it owed
                    its differences of colour. Subsequently, when it became impossible for Scheele
                    to ignore the consideration of the increase observable in many substances after
                    burning or calcination, he so far modified his views as to regard fire-air as a
                    compound containing, with a very little phlogiston, a saline principle <hi
                        rend="italic">(principium salinum)</hi> and water, which last gave to
                    fire-air the greater part of its weight. When fire-air formed heat oy combining
                    with phlogiston, it gave up its water to the materials it dephlogisticated, and
                    thus it was that they were rendered heavier by ignition. Such, in brief, were
                    the theoretical conceptions of Scheele; it is upon his work as a practical
                    chemist that his fame must rest. Tartaric acid was isolated by him in 1769, and
                    he made the discovery in 1774 of baryta and of dephlogisticated muriatic acid
                    (chlorine), and in 1779 of glycerine, the properties of which he pointed out in
                    1784; in 1781 he demonstrated the nature of hydrofluoric acid, first obtained by
                    him in 1771, and prepared tungstic acid, before unknown; and between the years
                    1776 and 1786 he discovered benzoic, molybdic, lactic, mucic, oxalic, malic, and
                    gallic acids, and made important observations on the compounds of arsenious
                    acid.</p>
                <p>The advance made during the last part of the 18th century in analytical chemistry
                    is attributable in great measure to the labours of Torbern Bergman of Upsala
                    (1735-1784), who devised systematic methods of examining compounds by the wet
                    way, and by means of the blow-pipe, and first rendered it possible to analyze
                    minerals insoluble in acids by fusing them with an alkali or alkaline carbonate.
                    In 1718 E. F. Geoffroy had published tables in which he exhibited the reciprocal
                    chemical affinities of various substances, and these tables had been improved
                    upon by Gellert in his <hi rend="italic">Metallurgic Chemistry,</hi> 1751, and
                    by Limbourg, 1761. Bergman, in 1775, gave in a dissertation on <hi rend="italic"
                        >elective attractions,</hi> as he named affinity, an arrangement in 59
                    columns of all the chemical substances known at the time, in which was shown the
                    order of their decomposition when in solution, and when exposed to a strong
                    heat. The nature of the compounds formed by the mixture of reagents depended, in
                    Bergman’s estimation, on the sum of their attractions. Bergman contributed also
                    in some measure to the determination of the constitution of neutral salts—a
                    subject treated of by Homberg in 1699, and, after Bergman and Kirwan,
                    investigated by Wenzel in his <hi rend="italic">Vorlesungun</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">über</hi><hi rend="italic">die</hi><hi rend="italic">chemische
                        Verwandtschaft der Körper,</hi> published in 1777. From Wenzel’s
                    observations the idea of equivalency took its rise. He showed that the products
                    of the mutual decomposition of two neutral salts were themselves neutral, or, in
                    other words, that the same weight of base satisfies definite quantities of two
                    different acids. Thus, according to his experiments, 123 parts of lime and 222
                    of potash must be considered equivalent to each other, being both competent to
                    neutralize 181 ’ 5 parts of sulphuric, or 240 parts of nitric acid.</p>
                <p>In England, ten years previously to the publication of Wenzel’s treatise,
                    Cavendish described certain quantities of fixed alkali and marble as “equivalent
                    ;” and in 1788 he stated that a quantity of oil of vitriol sufficient to produce
                    100 parts of plumbum ponderosum with sugar of lead would dissolve 33 of marble,
                    since he found by experiment that so much oil of vitriol would saturate as much
                    fixed alkali as a quantity of nitrous acid sufficient to dissolve 33 of marble.—

                <p>In 1792, J. B. Richter (1762-1807) published a work on <hi rend="italic"
                        >Stöchiometrie,</hi> or the Art of Measuring Chemical Elements, in which he
                    gave in two series of tables the weights of different bodies which neutralized
                    1000 parts of various acids, and the weights of acids that similarly
                    corresponded to 1000 parts in the case of the bases, and pointed out the
                    proportionality that existed between the weights of the bases, as also of the
                    acids, in each series. There was, he remarked, a constant ratio between the
                    quantity of an acid and the quantity of oxygen in the weights of the bases
                    needed for its complete saturation,—a fact afterwards restated by Berzelius, who
                    show ed that a simple and uniform relation was observable between the amounts of
                    oxygen in the acid and basic portions of salts of the same class.</p>
                <p>Although neither the science of chemistry nor yet a change in its objects can be
                    said to have originated with Lavoisier (1743-1794), the means he introduced of
                    attaining those objects, the ideas he put forth concerning the constitution of
                    bodies, and the explanations he gave of various phenomena were new, and gave to
                    the science in the twenty years preceding his death a completely altered aspect.
                    The mine of chemistry had yielded rich returns long before Lavoisier came to
                    labour in it; he availed himself of the old workings and, extending them, opened
                    the main lode. “He discovered,” says Liebig, “no new body, no new property, no
                    natural phenomenon previously unknown; but all the facts established by him were
                    the necessary consequences of the labours of those who preceded him. His merit,
                    his immortal glory consisted in this—that he infused into the body of the
                    science a new spirit; but all the members of that body were already in
                    existence, and rightly joined together.”— <hi rend="italic">(Letters on
                        Chemistry,</hi> ii.) In the first of his papers, in 1765, Lavoisier
                    indicates no doubt of the existence of phlogiston. In 1775 he still spoke of it,
                    but in the following year he expressed his conviction that, for the elucidation
                    of certain phenomena, one must ascribe to phlogiston other qualities than those
                    assigned to it by Stahl. It was in 1775 that he presented to the French Academy
                    a memoir <hi rend="italic">On the Nature of the Principle which combines with
                        the Metals during their Calcination, and which augments their Weight,</hi>
                    in which he describes the formation of fixed air from charcoal in the reduction
                    of calces, and the preparation and properties of oxygen; but he makes no
                    allusion to the fact that Priestley had in November of the foregoing year made
                    him acquainted with that gas, or to the observations of Bayen in the <hi

                    effect that the change of a metal into a calx is attributable to the fixation of
                    an aerial fluid, and that the red oxide of mercury is reduced by heat without
                    the addition of anything, and loses in weight by reduction.</p>

                <p>In 1776 Lavoisier, by experiments with phosphorus and sulphur, confirmed results
                    already arrived at by him— that the atmosphere contained two gases, azote or
                    nitrogen, and a highly respirable air, the absorption of which by burning
                    substances accounts for their increase in weight. In 1777 he combated the
                    assertion of Priestley that air is rendered irrespirable by becoming loaded with
                    phlogiston, and showed that air in which candles were burnt furnished about
                    two-fifths of its volume of fixed air, and that pure or dephlogisticated air
                    under the same conditions became almost completely transformed into that gas. In
                    a paper received by the Academy in 1778 Lavoisier broached his theory that the
                    dephlogisticated air of Priestley was the universal acidifying or <hi
                        rend="italic">oxygenizing</hi> principle, which by combination with
                    charcoal, sulphur, nitrogen, and phosphorus formed carbonic, vitriolic, nitric,
                    and phosphoric acids, and with metals, calces; all the phenomena of combustion,
                    Lavoisier contended, were explicable without the supposition of the existence of
                    phlogiston, of which there was no evidence. In 1783, when he had determined to
                    discover by carefully conducted experiments the nature of the product of the
                    combustion of hydrogen, Lavoisier learned that Cavendish had ascertained that
                    body to be water. He therefore repeated Cavendish’s experiments, and with the
                    aid of Meusnier proved that water contains hydrogen, by passing steam through a
                    red-hot porcelain tube containing iron wire. Lavoisier had long been unable to
                    hold the doctrine that hydrogen was the phlogiston of metals, seeing that the
                    calces were actually heavier than the metals supposed to contain them, and that
                    the hydrogen supposed to be evolved by the metals, though light, certainly had
                    weight. Lavoisier now explained the production of hydrogen during the solution
                    of metals in acids on the assumption that water was decomposed, its oxygen
                    uniting with the metals, whilst its hydrogen escaped. In the case, however, of
                    nitric acid, oxygen was supposed to be supplied by the acid. The effect of
                    Lavoisier’s reasonings upon his contemporaries is illustrated by Priestley’s
                    remark <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1788, p. 155) that, “the doctrine
                    of the <hi rend="italic">decomposition of water</hi> being set aside, that of
                        <hi rend="italic">phlogiston</hi> (which in consequence of the late
                    experiments on water has been almost universally abandoned) will much better
                    stand its ground.” But the fate of the Stahlian philosophy was sealed; and in
                    1792 Klaproth and the Berlin Academy gave in their adhesion to the new
                    doctrines. Gren and Wiegleb in Germany, Delametherie in France, and Kirwan in
                    England endeavoured but in vain, to support the phlogistic theory; and ere long
                    Lavoisier’s innovations could be regarded not simply as the anti-phlogistic, but
                    as the universally accepted system of chemistry. “It was the glory of
                    Lavoisier,” wrote Davy in 1814, “to lay the foundation of a sound logic in
                    chemistry by showing that the existence of this principle (phlogiston), or of
                    other principles, should not be assumed where they could not be detected.” In
                    1789 was published Lavoisier’s <hi rend="italic">Traite élémentaire de
                        Chimie,</hi> in which the new chemical doctrines were set forth with
                    remarkable clearness and ability. A list of 33 “simple substances” is given in
                    the 2d part of the 1st vol. of this work, wherein light and caloric are included
                    with oxygen, azote, and hydrogen as elements of bodies; but as to whether light
                    was a modification of caloric, or caloric a modification of light, it was
                    impossible, Lavoisier considered, to decide <hi rend="italic">(Traité
                        élément.,</hi> tom. 1. part ii. chap. 1). Under the head of “oxidable or
                    acidifiable substances” he placed sulphur, phosphorus, carbon, and the muriatic,
                    fluoric, and boracic radicals; the “oxidable and acidifiable metals” are
                    antimony, silver, arsenic, bismuth, cobalt, copper, tin, iron, manganese,
                    mercury, molybdenum, nickel, gold, platinum, lead, tungsten, and zinc; and the
                    “simple earthy and salifiable substances” are lime, magnesia, baryta, alumina,
                    and silica. Of metallic oxides, he says <hi rend="italic">(Traité élément.,</hi>
                    tom. i. part i. chap, vil), “they ought not to be considered as completely
                    saturated with oxygen, because their action on that principle is balanced by the
                    force of attraction exercised upon it by caloric. Oxygen, then, in the
                    calcination of metals, obeys really two forces —that exercised by the caloric
                    and that exercised by the metal.” Davy, who by his experiments on the effects of
                    friction on ice did much to dispel the belief in the materiality of heat, but
                    who regarded light as a body in a peculiar state of existence, and consisting of
                    minute particles, held the view that light in <hi rend="italic">phosoxygen</hi>

                <p>Lavoisier was assisted in the establishment of his system by Fourcroy
                    (1755-1809), Monge (1746-1818), Guyton de Morveau (1737-1816), and Berthollet
                    (1748-1822); Lavoisier’s theory that oxygen was the principle of acidity was
                    not, however, accepted by Berthollet. In 1803 appeared Berthollet’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Chemical Statics,</hi> in which Bergman’s conclusions with
                    respect to the laws of the combination of acids and bases were disputed.
                    Affinity, it was argued, could not be simply an attraction, for then no
                    decomposition, but only an addition of constituents would take place when
                    solutions of different compounds were mixed together; affinity might be regarded
                    as an attraction between combining substances probably like that existing
                    between the planetary bodies—an attraction dependent on mass, not on elective
                    force, so that combination between the various kinds of matter could take place
                    in all sorts of proportions. The complete removal of a constituent of a compound
                    by means of a decomposing agent was attributed by Berthollet to its elasticity
                    or insolubility in the free state. Thus, he considered that barium sulphate was
                    precipitated by solution of potassium sulphate because it was insoluble in
                    water, but that a triple compound was formed when solutions of the sulphates of
                    sodium and potassium were mingled. The decomposition of ammonium carbonate by
                    sulphuric acid he asserted to be due to the elasticity of the carbonic acid gas
                    that escaped. Berthollet’s hypotheses found an opponent in Proust (1755-1826),
                    who had already written on the constancy of the relations by weight of the
                    component parts of bodies, and had shown that tin and antimony unite with
                    oxygen, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n476/mode/1up"

                    proportions respectively. In a controversy with Berthollet that extended over
                    some years he successfully demonstrated that all compounds are definite, and
                    contain only certain determinate proportions of their constituents.</p>
                <p>In August 1804, Dalton (1766-1844) communicated to Dr Thomson his theory of the
                    atomic composition of bodies. Dalton’s ideas had been vaguely foreshadowed by W.
                    Higgins of Pembroke College, Oxford, in a publication entitled <hi rend="italic"
                        >A Comparative View of the Phlogistic and Antiphlogistic Theories,</hi>
                    where we read that—</p>
                <p>“In volatile vitriolic acid a single ultimate particle of sulphur is intimately
                    united only to a single particle of dephlogisticated air; and in perfect
                    vitriolic acid every single particle of sulphur is united to two of
                    dephlogisticated air, being the quantity necessary to saturation. As two cubic
                    inches of light inflammable air require but one of dephlogisticated air to
                    condense them, we must suppose that they contain equal number of divisions, and
                    that the difference of their specific gravity depends chiefly on the size of
                    their ultimate particles; or we must suppose that the ultimate particles of
                    light inflammable air require two or three or more of dephlogisticated air to
                    saturate them. If this latter were the case, we might produce water in an
                    intermediate state, as well as the vitriolic or the nitrous acid, which appears
                    to be impossible; for in whatever proportion we mix our acids, or under whatever
                    circumstance we combine them, the result is invariably the same.”—(2d nd.,
                    1791.)</p>
                <p>The atomic theory first suggested itself to Dalton during his investigations on
                    marsh-gas, or light carburetted hydrogen, and olefiant gas. He calculated that
                    if the weight of carbon in each of these compounds were reckoned to be the same,
                    then marsh-gas contained exactly twice the weight of hydrogen present in
                    olefiant gas. He further observed that the quantity of oxygen in carbonic acid
                    gas was twice as much as in carbonic oxide gas. These and similar facts he
                    conceived might be explained by assuming the ultimate particles of matter to be
                    incapable of further division, or, in other words, <hi rend="italic">atoms,</hi>
                    possessing definite weights, the ratios of which could be denoted by numbers,
                    the weight of an atom of hydrogen being taken as unity. The combination of these
                    atoms with one another would account then for the definite proportions in which
                    the elements united. For clearness the atoms were represented by symbols, thus

                <p>The weight of the smallest particle of a compound was therefore, according to
                    Dalton’s theory, to be obtained by adding together the weights of its
                    constituent atoms; the laws discovered by Wenzel and Richter were thus included
                    within the law of atomic weights.</p>
                <p>The new theory was promulgated in Dr Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">System of
                        Chemistry,</hi> 3d edit., 1807. In the same year Thomson showed that the
                    amount of oxalic acid required to form strontium binoxalate was twice as great
                    as that jn the case of the oxalate, supposing the weight of strontium in each
                    salt to be the same; and Dr WoUaston proved that three potassium oxalates were
                    obtainable, to form which a definite amount of potash needed weights of oxalic
                    acid in the proportion of I: 2: 4.</p>
                <p>In 1808, the year of the publication of Dalton’s <hi rend="italic">New System of
                        Chemical Philosophy,</hi> Gay-Lussac made known to the world the laws of the
                    combinations of gases by volume— to which his attention had been directed by the
                    discovery which he and A. Von Humboldt had made, that a definite volume of
                    oxygen combined with exactly twice its bulk of hydrogen. He pointed out that
                    there is a simple relation between the volumes of two gases which unite
                    together, and also between their collective volume in the uncombined and in the
                    combined condition. Thus, three volumes of hydrogen combine with one of nitrogen
                    to form two volumes of ammonia; one volume of chlorine with one of hydrogen
                    produces two volumes of hydrochloric acid gas; and two volumes of nitrogen and
                    one of oxygen give two volumes of protoxide of nitrogen. The law of definite
                    proportions was shown to hold good with respect to the volumes as well as to the
                    weights of combining bodies.</p>
                <p>In 1811 Avogadro, remarking that equal variations of temperature and pressure
                    produce in all gases and vapours the same changes of volume, enunciated the
                    hypothesis that equal volumes of any gas or vapour contain the same number of
                    atoms, and the same doctrine was brought forward in 1814 by Ampère. On this
                    hypothesis the density of equal volumes of gases was shown to represent the
                    relative weights of their atoms; and thus, as it had been discovered that gases
                    frequently do not unite volume for volume, a distinction came to be drawn
                    between atomic weights and equivalents. If we say atom for volume, wrote
                    Berzelius, we find in Gay-Lussac’s discovery one of the most direct arguments in
                    favour of Dalton’s hypothesis.</p>
                <p>Berzelius (1779-1848), from considerations based on the law of combination by
                    volume, accounted the atoms of elements distinct from their equivalents. Thus
                    two volumes of hydrogen were recognized as the equivalents of one volume of
                    oxygen, the relative weights of equal volumes of the two gases being those of
                    their atoms. Berzelius adopted 100 parts of oxygen as his standard of atomic
                    weight, the atomic weight of hydrogen was therefore 6 <hi rend="superscript">
                        -</hi> 24, its equivalent, 12 ’ 48. He considered that the atoms of
                    aluminium, arsenic, antimony, bromine, chlorine, fluorine, hydrogen, iodine,
                    nitrogen, and some other elements had a weight equal to only half that of their
                    equivalents, which latter were double and inseparable atoms. In place of the
                    symbols used by Dalton to denote the proportions in which the elements combine
                    by weight, he employed a notation in which letters were used to indicate the
                    names of the elements. He introduced also an abridged notation, in which the
                    equivalents or double atoms were represented by drawing a bar through the symbol
                    of the element. A dot being used to signify an atom of oxygen, the formula of
                    water was written H: and HC4 denoted hydrochloric acid, which was viewed as
                    consisting of a double atom of hydrogen united to a double atom of chlorine,—an
                    hypothesis which left unexplained the fact that the combination of the so-called
                    double atoms of hydrogen and chlorine resulted always in the formation of two
                    molecules, instead of one, of hydrochloric acid gas. Berzelius constructed a
                    table of atomic weights and equivalents, which the discovery by Dulong and Petit
                    in 1819 of the connection between the specific heats and the atomic weights of
                    the elements, and that of the law of isomorphism by Mitscherlich in 1820,
                    enabled him to modify and improve. The equivalent notation of Berzelius was
                    adopted by Gay-Lussac, and displaced in time that founded upon the atomic
                    weights; but it was not generally applied with strictness to all compounds,
                    molecular and not equivalent formulae being employed in some cases. It had this
                    objection, that it masked the relative atom-fixing <pb break="no"

                    AgO.JPO <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> did not express the tribasic character of a
                    molecule of phosphoric acid, and its relations to the molecules of acids of less
                    basicity. Observing the ratio between the oxygen of bases and acids, Berzelius
                    was led to the conception of the dualistic theory, according to which all
                    compounds consist of paired constituents or groups of constituents. This theory
                    was applied to both organic and inorganic substances, and received considerable
                    support from the development of the doctrine of compound radicles, of which
                    Berzelius was the chief supporter.</p>
                <p>De Morveau, in a memoir <hi rend="italic">On the Development of the Principles of
                        Methodical Nomenclature,</hi> had in 1787 given the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">radicles</hi> to the “acidifiable bases” of acids, and
                    Lavoisier in his <hi rend="italic">Traité élémentaire</hi> had spoken of the
                    “hydrocarbon radicles” in oils, starch, sugar, and gum. In 1817' Berzelius,
                    following Lavoisier, held the opinion that all inorganic oxides contained simple
                    radicles, and organic oxides compound radicles. In 1832 Liebig and Wöhler
                    discovered the composition of bitter-almond oil, which they showed, on the
                    assumption of the existence of a radicle C <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 5</hi> O, might be compared with the compounds of
                    potassium and other metals. Berzelius at first accepted their explanation of the
                    constitution of benzoyl-compounds, but afterwards rejected it, as his
                    electro-chemical theory did not support the view that oxygen could be a
                    constituent of a radicle. Benzoic acid was represented by him as a compound
                    containing the radicle C <hi rend="subscript"> 44</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                        5</hi>, thus :—C <hi rend="subscript"> 14</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">

                    radicle CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, or 2(CH <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>).O.</p>
                <p>In 1834 Dumas made known his observations on the substitution of hydrogen by
                    other elements; and Laurent subsequently concluded from numerous experiments
                    that, when hydrogen is substituted by an equivalent of chlorine or bromine,
                    these elements take the place occupied by the hydrogen, performing to a certain
                    extent the functions of the latter in the new compound, which is therefore
                    analogous to that from which it has been produced. Thus was given the first blow
                    to the dualistic theory. The discovery of trichloracetic acid by Dumas gave
                    considerable aid in the establishment of the new doctrine,- but Berzelius and
                    others, who were unable to reconcile with fhe electrochemical theory the
                    substitution of an electro-positive by an electro negative element, sought to
                    explain the facts of substitution in accordance with dualistic notions.
                    Berzelius considered that a compound in which <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    oxygen was a fourth element was at once an oxide and a chloride; trichloracetic
                    acid was, in his opinion, a copulated compound of sesquichlυride of carbon with
                    sesquioxide of carbon (oxalic acid) C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> C1 <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + HO; acetic acid, on the other hand, was a
                    trioxide of acetyl (C <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi>) with the formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + HO. The
                    substitution-compounds discovered by Malaguti and Régnault were in like manner
                    represented dualistically; dichloroformic ether, for example, was written 2C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H.O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H.Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 2C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + C <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> q</hi>.CL; such complex formulae, however, which implied
                    in most cases a widely different constitution for bodies obviously related in
                    properties, were received with but little favour by chemists. At length Meisens,
                    by converting trichloracetic acid into acetic acid, gave decisive evidence as to
                    the truth of the principle of the substitution theory.</p>
                <p>Gerhardt, who regarded all compounds as simple molecules, certain atoms of which
                    were displaceable by double decomposition, discarded entirely the conception of
                    radicles. He classified organic substances according to the number of carbon
                    atoms contained in their molecules; hence the recognition of homologous series
                    of organic compounds. What he termed <hi rend="italic">residues</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">—</hi> molecules deprived of certain of their
                    constituents—were in many instances identical with the radicles employed by
                    Berzelius, but were not held necessarily to pre-exist in compounds. Gerhardt was
                    the means of re-introducing, in a modified form, the atomic notation of
                    Berzelius. Observing that the smallest quantities by weight of carbonic acid gas
                    and water produced in reactions were expressed by the formulae C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> and H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, he concluded that
                    these must represent the molecules of the two bodies, which might be more
                    conveniently written CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and H <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> O, the atomic weights of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon being taken as
                    1, 16, and 12 respectively. He made the atomic weights of bromine, chlorine,
                    fluorine, hydrogen, iodine, nitrogen, and other of the elements equal to those
                    given by Berzelius, thus enabling the formulae of water and most volatile
                    compounds to be expressed in agreement with the law of Gay-Lussac; but he halved
                    the old atomic weights of most of the metals, supposing that all metallic oxides
                    were similar in constitution to water, or contained two atoms of metal to one of
                    oxygen. Régnault afterwards proved that, according to the law of Dulong and
                    Petit, this alteration ought to be made in the case only of the atomic weights
                    of the metals lithium, potassium, sodium, and silver; many metals were
                    accordingly to be regarded as having oxides of the general formula RO. Such
                    metals, being compared with the diatomic radicles of organic chemistry, were
                    called diatomic by Cannizzaro in 1858. Thus originated the idea of the
                    polyatomicity of the metals.</p>
                <p>The theory of types dates from the time of the discovery of trichloracetic acid
                    by Dumas, who observed that this body and others similarly obtained must be of
                    the same <hi rend="italic">chemical type</hi> with the hydrogenated substances
                    from which they are derived. The discovery by Wurtz of the compound ammonias,
                    and by Hofmann of diethylamine and triethylamine, led to the creation of the <hi
                        rend="italic">ammonia type</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Williamson, by
                    the discovery in 1850 of the mixed ethers, was enabled to refer ether, alcohol,
                    and acids to the <hi rend="italic">water type,</hi> and to predict the existence
                    of acetic anhydride, which, as well as benzoic anhydride, was discovered in 1852
                    by Gerhardt. To these types Gerhardt added two others, those of hydrogen and
                    hydrochloric acid, and with the former associated the aldehydes, ketones, and
                    many hydrocarbons, e.y., the radicles discovered by Frankland and Kolbe. The
                    theory of types was still further’ extended by Williamson, to whom the
                    conception of condensed types is due; by Odling, who first suggested the idea of
                    representing the relations of compounds by the use of mixed types; and by Kekulé
                    and numerous other investigators.</p>
                <p>The foundation of electro-chemical science may be said to have been laid by
                    Nicholson and Carlisle, who in 1800 discovered the decomposition of water by the
                    agency of the voltaic pile; but the earliest electro-chemical experiments were
                    those made by Priestley in 1775 upon ammonia gas, and by Deiman and Van
                    Troostwijk in 1789 upon water, by means of frictional electricity. Cruickshank
                    by experiments with the chlorides of magnesium, sodium, and ammonium
                    demonstrated that when those salts are decomposed by the electric current,
                    alkali always appears at the negative, and acid at the positive pole.</p>
                <p>In 1803 Berzelius and Hisinger published their observations on the electrical
                    decomposition of salts and some of their bases; oxygen, acids, and oxidized
                    bases, they said, appear at the positive pole; combustible bodies, alkalies, and
                    earths at the negative. Later experimenters, however, showed that it is the
                    metal, not the oxide, that appears at the negative pole when salts are
                    electrolyzed, and that oxides cannot be supposed to exist ready formed in salts.
                    Davy, whose electrical experiments were commenced in 1800, undertook in 1806 a
                    course of investigations which led him to the discovery of the metals of the
                    alkalies and alkaline earths. In 1807 he expressed the opinion that bodies
                    having an affinity for one another are in different states of electricity, and
                    “that chemical and electrical <pb break="no"

                    acting in the one case on particles and in the other on masses of matter.”</p>
                <p>In 1834: Faraday discovered that the decompositions effected by the voltaic
                    current indicate the quantity by weight in which the elements combine, or the
                    weights of the atoms of the atomic theory,. thus adding to the probability of
                    the correctness of the supposition that the operations of the same agent are
                    exhibited in both chemical and electrical phenomena. Latterly, the discovery of
                    the action of the copper-zinc couple by Gladstone and Tribe has opened out a new
                    field of electro-chemical research, aIready productive of important results. To
                    mention, however, the numerous advances that have been made in recent times,
                    whether in chemical physics or in chemistry proper—especially as regards the
                    constitution and synthesis of the compounds of carbon—would be to exceed the
                    scope of the present introductory notice. The reader must, therefore, be
                    referred to the treatises and original memoirs of those whose labours have
                    effected the modern development of chemistry, and have raised it to the high
                    position which it occupies as a science at the present time. <hi

                <p>The examination of all the various substances met with in nature has led to the
                    discovery of sixty-four different bodies, from which it is impossible by any
                    means <hi rend="italic">now</hi> at our disposal to separate simpler substances;
                    they are consequently termed “elementary or simple bodies,” or “elements.” It is
                    not asserted that such substances are absolutely simple, or that they may not be
                    found hereafter to yield more than one kind of matter, but merely that so far as
                    our knowledge extends it is so; indeed, recent spectroscopic researches favour
                    the impression that some at least of the elements are, perhaps, compounds of
                    simpler bodies.</p>
                <p>It is the study of the laws which regulate the combination of the elements with
                    one another, and to which their compounds are subject in their mutual actions,
                    and of the properties of the elements and of the compounds formed by their
                    union, which constitutes the science of chemistry.</p>
                <p>The majority of the elements are of comparatively rare occurrence, whilst many of
                    them are extremely rare, being met with only in certain localities. Gold and a
                    few others almost always occur as such, and our atmosphere, we know, consists
                    chiefly of the two elements, oxygen and nitrogen, in the free state; also some
                    others, such as carbon, copper, silver, and sulphur, are occasionally met with
                    in the uncombined state, but in general two or more elements are found united.
                    The number of elements of which the materials are made up which principally
                    compose the earth and the plants and animals living upon it is, however,
                    exceedingly small. Thus, plants consist chiefly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,
                    and animals chiefly of these three elements together with nitrogen; water
                    consists entirely of oxygen and hydrogen. The solid earth is mainly composed of
                    substances such as quartz or silica, chalk or limestone, and various silicates
                    like felspar and clay,—the elements which are the chief constituents of these
                    substances being oxygen, silicon, carbon, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, iron,
                    and potassium. The only elements which appear to be absolutely essential to
                    vegetable or animal life are carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur,
                    phosphorus, calcium, iron, potassium, sodium, magnesium, silicon, and chlorine;
                    and the remainder are to us, so to speak, merely of artificial value.</p>
                <p>Four of the elements—chlorine, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen—are gases; and
                    fluorine, which is not known with certainty in the free state, is probably also
                    a gas; two are liquid at ordinary atmospheric temperatures, viz., mercury and
                    bromine; and the element gallium, recently discovered in certain zinc ores, but
                    as yet obtained in only very small quantities, is also said to be a liquid. The
                    remaining elements are solids.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of the elements now known, arranged in alphabetical
                    order. The most important elements are distinguished in the table by capitals;
                    whilst those which at present are of slight importance, on account of their rare
                    occurrence, or of our insufficient knowledge of their properties, are printed in
                    italics.</p>

                <p>The proportions in which elements unite together are definite and constant, a
                    given compound always consisting of the same elements united in the same
                    proportions.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n479/mode/1up"

                <p>Chloride of silver, for example, in whatever manner it may be prepared,
                    invariably consists of chlorine and silver in the proportions by weight of 35’36
                    parts of the former and 107’66 of the latter.</p>
                <p>But it is often the case that elements combine together in several proportions;
                    whenever this occurs the several proportions in which the one element unites
                    with the other invariably bear a simple relation to one another. Thus, 1 part by
                    weight of hydrogen unites with 8 parts by weight of oxygen, forming water, and
                    with 16 or 8 × 2 parts of oxygen, forming peroxide of hydrogen. Again, in
                    nitrous oxide we have a compound of 8 parts by weight of oxygen and 14 of
                    nitrogen; in nitric oxide a compound of 16 or 8 × 2 parts of oxygen and 14 of
                    nitrogen; in nitrous anhydride a compound of 24 or 8 × 3 parts of oxygen and 14
                    of nitrogen; in nitric peroxide a compound of 32 or 8 × 4 parts of oxygen and 14
                    of nitrogen; and lastly, in nitric anhydride a compound of 40 or 8 × 5 parts of
                    oxygen and 14 of nitrogen. This law is known as the law of combination in
                    multiple proportions.</p>
                <p>The proportions in which two elements combine with a third also represent the
                    proportions in which, or in some simple multiple of which, they will themselves
                    combine. For instance, 35 ’ 36 parts of chlorine and 79’75 parts of bromine
                    combine with 107’66 parts of silver; and when chlorine and bromine unite it is
                    in the proportion of 35 36 parts of the former to 79’75 parts of the latter.
                    Iodine unites with silver in the proportion of 126’53 parts to 107’66 parts of
                    the latter, but it combines with chlorine in two proportions, viz., in the
                    proportion of 126’53 parts either to 35’36 or to three times 35’36 parts of
                    chlorine. This is known as the law of combination in reciprocal proportions.</p>
                <p>In explanation of these three laws deduced entirely from experimental
                    observations, chemists have adopted the atomic or molecular theory which was
                    first introduced into the science by Dalton at the commencement of this century.
                    According to this theory the exceedingly small masses or <hi rend="italic"
                        >molecules</hi> of which it is supposed matter consists are composite, being
                    made up of indivisible particles or <hi rend="italic">atoms</hi> (see the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Atom,</hi> vol. iii. p. 36). The molecules of the
                    elements are assumed to consist of similar atoms, whereas those of compounds are
                    congeries of dissimilar atonis; and the molecules which constitute a given kind
                    of matter, it is supposed, are alike in weight and general properties, but
                    differ from those of which all other kinds of matter are composed, so that every
                    molecule belongs to one of a definite number of species. The study of the
                    alterations which take place in the composition of molecules under the influence
                    of various forces, and which result from their action upon one another, is the
                    work of the chemist; whilst it is the province of the physicist to study the
                    influences of those forces upon matter which affect entire molecules without in
                    any way altering their composition.</p>
                <p>The chemist has no means of ascertaining, nor does he attempt to ascertain, the
                    absolute weights of the atoms or of the molecules of the various elements and
                    their compounds; he concerns himself merely with their relative weights,
                    hydrogen being adopted as the standard of reference since it is the lightest of
                    all known elements. The relative weight of the atoms of the various elements
                    referred to that of hydrogen regarded as 1 are given in the third column of the
                    table on page 467. The determination of the exact atomic weight of an element is
                    an operation of extreme difficulty, and one requiring the greatest analytical
                    skill, so that as yet the atomic weights of only a limited number of elements
                    have been ascertained with more than approximate accuracy. The most accurately
                    determined atomic weights are those of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine,
                    bromine, iodine, lithium, potassium, sodium, silver, and thallium. Apparently
                    the numbers obtained for these elements are practically perfect.</p>
                <p>The manner in which the relative weights of the atoms of the elements are
                    determined will be evident from the following considerations.</p>
                <p>If, instead of comparing together the relative weights of the elements which
                    enter into combination, the volumes which they occupy in the state of gas (at
                    the same temperature and under the same pressure) before and after combination
                    are compared, it is found that gases always unite together in very simple
                    proportions, viz., either in equal volumes, or in volumes which bear some simple
                    relation such as 1: 2, 1: 3, 1: 4, 2: 3, &lt;fcc. Moreover, whatever the number
                    of volumes before combination, it always is reduced to two on combination. Thus,
                    equal volumes of hydrogen and chlorine gases unite without condensation to form
                    hydrochloric acid gas; in the production of water 2 volumes of hydrogen and 1 of
                    oxygen combine, but form only 2 volumes of water-gas or steam; and if ammonia
                    gas be decomposed by heat or a series of electric sparks, 2 volumes of the gas
                    yield 3 volumes of hydrogen and 1 of nitrogen.</p>
                <p>Now, according to the law of Boyle and Mariotte, the volume of a given mass of
                    any gas varies inversely as the pressure, provided that the temperature remains
                    the same; for instance, the quantity of air which is contained in a vessel of
                    the capacity of 1 pint under the pressure of 1 atmosphere, or 15 lb upon the
                    square inch, may be contained in a vessel of half a pint capacity if the
                    pressure be doubled.</p>
                <p>According to the law of Charles and Gay-Lussac, on the other hand, all gases
                    expand equally by heat, provided the pressure remains constant,—the rate of
                    expansion being <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ∣ <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> of
                    the volume at 0° C. for each rise of l <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> C. in
                    temperature; or in other words, the volume of a gas varies directly as the
                    absolute temperature.</p>
                <p>A gas which strictly conforms to these two laws is said to be a perfect gas, but
                    none of the gases with which we are acquainted are perfect in this sense. Thus,
                    Andrews’s experiments show that carbonic anhydride, which under a pressure of 36
                    atmospheres at 0° C. is reduced to the liquid state, condenses more than it
                    should according to Boyle’s law. Again, the density of chlorine gas referred to
                    air, according to Stas’s determination of the atomic weight of this element,
                    should be 2’4501. The following table exhibits its density at various
                    temperatures from 20° to 200° C.,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    evident that it is higher than it should be at all temperatures below 200° C.

                <p>From the few accurate observations which have been made on this subject it
                    appears that, in general, the departure from the laws of Boyle and Charles is
                    greater the more the temperature of the gas approaches to that at which it
                    becomes liquid; and chlorine affords an instructive illustration of this, since
                    it is readily condensed to a liquid under the pressure of 4 atmospheres at 15
                        <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 5 C., or by cooling in a bath of solid
                    carbonic anhydride and ether.</p>
                <p>The general resemblance in the behaviour of gases under the influence of pressure
                    and heat is very great, however, although not in absolute accordance with the
                    laws of Boyle and Charles; by this we are led to the assumption that their
                    physical constitution must be similar, and, therefore, to the acceptance of the
                    proposition, originally stated by Avogadro in 1811, that equal volumes of
                    different gases contain equal numbers of molecules. Obviously, therefore, if the
                    relative weights of equal volumes of different gases are determined under the
                    same conditions as to temperature<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n480/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0480-0469"/> and pressure, the temperature and pressure
                    chosen being that at which the gases most closely approximate to the
                    requirements of the laws above stated, an estimate of the relative weights of
                    their molecules is obtained. For example, the density of nitrogen referred to
                    hydrogen is 14, since a given volume of nitrogen is found to weigh 14 times as
                    much as an equal volume of hydrogen at the same temperature and under the same
                    pressure; hence, according to Avogadro’s hypothesis, the molecules of nitrogen
                    are fourteen times as heavy as the hydrogen molecules.</p>
                <p>In the formation of hydrochloric acid gas equal volumes of chlorine and hydrogen
                    unite without condensation. The density of chlorine gas referred to hydrogen is
                    35'36, and the simplest possible hypothesis of the composition of hydrochloric
                    acid is that it consists of an atom of hydrogen weighing 1, and an atom of
                    chlorine weighing 35'36, so that its molecule, therefore, must weigh 33'36. But
                    since the density of hydrochloric acid gas is ascertained by experiment to be
                    only 18*18 as compared with that of hydrogen, and, according to Avogadro’s
                    hypothesis, equal volumes of hydrogen and hydrochloric acid gas contain equal
                    numbers of molecules, it follows that the weight of the hydrogen molecule as
                    compared with that of hydrochloric acid must be 2, or in other words, <hi
                        rend="italic">that the hydrogen molecule consists of two atoms.</hi> The
                    chlorine molecule in like manner must consist of two atoms, each weighing 35'36,
                    and in the formation of hydrochloric acid from hydrogen and chlorine two
                    molecules of hydrochloric acid are produced from a molecule of hydrogen and a
                    molecule of chlorine: in the one molecule half the hydrogen is displaced by
                    chlorine, in the other half the chlorine is displaced by hydrogen. It may be
                    proved that the assumption is correct that the molecule of hydrochloric acid
                    contains only a single atom of chlorine, weighing 35'36, and that it does not
                    consist, for example, of two atoms of chlorine each weighing 17'68, by comparing
                    the various volatile compounds containing chlorine. In the first place their
                    densities in the state of gas are determined, and a knowledge is thus obtained
                    of the relative weights of their molecules as compared with that of the hydrogen
                    molecule; the percentage of chlorine they contain is then ascertained by careful
                    analysis. The density referred to hydrogen as unity multiplied by 2 gives the
                    molecular weight of the compound; and the percentage of chlorine being known,
                    the amount contained in the quantity expressed by the molecular weight is
                    ascertained by a simple calculation. For example, the density of sulphur
                    chloride is found to be 57 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 36, and its molecular
                    weight is therefore 57'36 × 2 or 114'72; it contains 61'64 per cent, of
                    chlorine, so that in 114'72 parts there are 70'72 of chlorine When the numbers
                    thus deduced are compared it is seen that the lowest amongst them is 35'36, and
                    that all the higher numbers are simple multiples of this; 35'36 is accordingly
                    adopted as the number which expresses the weight of the atom of chlorine
                    relatively to that of the hydrogen atom. A number of volatile chlorine compounds
                    are thus compared in the following table :—</p>

                <p>In like manner, on comparing the various volatile compounds which contain oxygen,
                    it is found that the number 16 represents the least weight of oxygen contained
                    in the molecular weight of any of its compounds; 16 is therefore taken as the

                <p>The determination of the density of bodies in the state of gas is thus an
                    operation of fundamental importance. The precise manner in which the
                    determination is effected is described in most of the text-books on chemistry.
                    The methods ordinarily employed in the case of liquids and solids which by the
                    application of heat can be converted into vapour or gas without undergoing
                    decomposition are known respectively as Dumas’s and Gay-Lussac’s, a modification
                    of the latter method of great value has recently been introduced by Hofmann. By
                    Dumas’s method the weight of substance is ascertained which will furnish a
                    certain volume of gas at a certain temperature and pressure; by Gay-Lussac’s
                    method, however, and by Hofmann’s modification of it, the volume of gas is
                    measured which is furnished by a given weight of the substance at a certain
                    temperature and pressure. By either method we arrive finally at a knowledge of
                    the weight (w) of a certain volume <hi rend="italic">(f)</hi> of the gas at a
                    temperature <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and pressure <hi rend="italic">p</hi>; and
                    its density (D) referred to hydrogen Is then found by dividing the weight <hi
                        rend="italic">w</hi> by the weight <hi rend="italic">(w')</hi> of an equal
                    volume of hydrogen at the same temperature <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and pressure
                        <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi></p>
                <p>D = ^ <hi rend="italic">w</hi> ’</p>
                <p>Or the density referred to air may be calculated in a similar manner, and then
                    converted into the density referred to hydrogen by multiplication by 14'43,— the
                    number which expresses the density of air referred to hydrogen. Both methods
                    require that the substance be heated to the temperature at which its vapour most
                    closely approximates to the laws of Boyle and Charles, which is readily
                    ascertained by experiment; this temperature, however, is often very considerably
                    above the boiling point of the substance, and acetic acid may be cited as an
                    illustration of this. Thus, although this acid boils at 119° C., its vapour does
                    not exhibit the required density until it is heated to 250° C., as will be
                    evident from the following table—the theoretical vapour density of acetic acid
                    vapour referred to hydrogen being about 30 :—</p>

                <p>Owing to unavoidable experimental errors, and, in many cases, probably to the
                    circumstance that the vapours of solid and liquid bodies are very imperfect
                    gases at temperatures not much above their boiling points, the determination of
                    the vapour density of a substance does not, as a rule, furnish a result of more
                    than approximate accuracy,—the result being the more accurate, however, the more
                    rarefied the vapour and the higher the temperature at which the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n481/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0481-0470"/> density is determined, provided always that
                    the temperature be not so high as to cause decomposition. But the relative
                    proportions in which the elements combine, and the composition of compounds may
                    usually be ascertained with very great—in many cases with almost
                    absolute—accuracy by chemical analysis; and the determination of the density in
                    the state of gas simply serves to prove which of the several multiple
                    proportions, in which it is found that the elements combine together, is the
                    true atomic weight. For instance, analysis shows that marsh gas is a compound of
                    carbon and hydrogen exactly in the proportions of 1 part of the latter with 3 of
                    the former; that carbonic anhydride consists of carbon and oxygen in the
                    proportion of 16 parts or an atom of the latter and 6 or 3 × 2 parts of carbon;
                    and carbonic oxide of the same elements, in the proportion, however, of 16 of
                    oxygen and 12 or 3 × 4 of carbon. The question, therefore, is, Which of the
                    numbers, 3, 6, or 12, represents the relative weight of the carbon atom; that is
                    to say, is marsh gas a compound of an atom of hydrogen and an atom of carbon
                    weighing 3, of two atoms of hydrogen and an atom of carbon weighing 6, or of
                    four atoms of hydrogen and an atom of carbon weighing 12 î The molecular weights
                    of three such compounds would be respectively 3 + 1 or 4, 6 + 2 or 8, and 12 + 4
                    or 16; and the corresponding theoretical densities referred to hydrogen 2, 4,
                    and 8. Finding, however, by experiment that the density of marsh gas is, say,
                    7'5, we at once conclude that the atomic weight of carbon is 12 and not 6 or 3,
                    because the observed density of marsh gas most closely accords with that
                    required on this assumption. The difference between theory and experiment is
                    practically seldom, if ever, so large as in this case, which is merely given as
                    an illustration of the principle involved.</p>
                <p>The equivalent of an element—that is to say, the amount of it which is capable of
                    combining with or displacing one part by weight, or one atom, of hydrogen—being
                    known, its atomic weight is not absolutely fixed by the determination of the
                    density in the state of gas of its compounds with other elements; we are at most
                    enabled to say from this that the atomic weight cannot exceed a certain value,
                    —for instance, that the atomic weight of chlorine cannot exceed 35 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 36, because all its compounds contain either this
                    amount or some simple multiple of it in their molecules. It is nevertheless <hi
                        rend="italic">possible</hi> that 35 ’ 36 is not the weight of one but of
                    several atoms of chlorine; the probability that 35 ’ 36 is the true atomic
                    weight is enormously increased, however, as compound after compound is examined
                    and found to contain 35 ’ 36 or some simple multiple of 35 36 parts of chlorine
                    in its molecule.</p>
                <p>In the case of those elements of which stable volatile compounds have not been
                    obtained, the study of their specific heats is of great importance, and moreover
                    furnishes most important confirmation of the atomic weights deduced by the aid
                    of Avogadro’s hypothesis. To raise the temperature of equal weights of different
                    substances the same number of degrees, from 0° to 1° C. for instance, very
                    different amounts of heat are required; and on the other hand very different
                    amounts of heat are given out when equal weights of different substances are
                    cooled from the initial temperature <hi rend="italic">t°</hi> to a lower
                    temperature <hi rend="italic">t'</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ο</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">.</hi> Of all bodies except hydrogen water has the greatest
                    capacity for heat, and is, therefore, adopted as the standard of reference,—the
                    number which expresses the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of
                    a given weight of a body a certain number of degrees, or which is given out by
                    it in cooling through a certain number of degrees, as compared with that
                    required to raise the temperature of an equal weight of water the same number of
                    degrees, being termed its specific heat. Thus, the specific heat of lithium is ’
                    940b; that is to say, to raise the temperature of a given weight of lithium—1
                    gramme, for example—from 0° to 1° C. only requires <hi rend="superscript">

                    solid state of the various elements of which the atomic weights have been

                <p>On comparing the numbers in the fourth column of this table it will be seen that
                    they vary within comparatively narrow limits; and if certain of the elements are
                    excepted, viz., boron, carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, silicon, and selenium, the
                    agreement becomes much closer, the average product obtained by multiplying
                    specific heat into atomic weight being about 6 ’ 3. From this it would appear
                    that the specific heats of these elements are, at least approximately, inversely
                    proportional to their atomic weights. From the observation of this relation in
                    the case of only a small number of elements Dulong and Petit, in 1811, were led
                    to infer that the atoms of all simple bodies have the same capacity for heat.
                    The specific heat of a body varies, however, with the temperature; an extreme
                    instance of this is afforded by the elements carbon, boron, and silicon, as will
                    be evident on inspecting the following table of the specific heat of carbon in
                    the form of diamond at various temperatures :—</p>

                <p>Hence, owing to the circumstance that the determinations of specific heat have
                    not been made at temperatures which are comparable for the different elements,
                    there is no doubt that many of the results which have been obtained are
                    defective; but from Weber’s recent researches it appears that in the case of the
                    solid elements there is a point for each element, after which the increase in
                    specific heat with increase of temperature is insignificant, and when this point
                    is reached the product of specific heat into atomic weight—the so-called atomic
                    heat—varies within comparatively narrow limits. These limits, according to
                    Weber, are from 5’5 to 6 ’ 5, but it appears probable that the superior limit is
                    slightly greater than this, and as a matter of fact the atomic heats of nearly
                    all the elements are nearer 6 ’ 5 than 5 ’ 5,—the latter number being
                    characteristic of the so-called non-metallic elements, the atomic weights of
                    which can be determined by the aid of Avogadro’s hypothesis.</p>
                <p>In consequence of this relation between the specific heat of an element and its
                    atomic weight, we can readily determine<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0482-0471"/> the atomic weights of elements which do not
                    furnish volatile compounds, it being merely necessary to ascertain the
                    equivalent of the element by analyzing its compounds, and to multiply the
                    equivalent by such a number that the product when multiplied by the specific
                    heat of the element will furnish a number not less than 5 ’ 5, and not much
                    greater than 6 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5. As an instance of the
                    application of the method, the metal indium, one of the most recently discovered
                    elements, may be cited. Analysis showed that the equivalent of indium was 37'8,
                    but this number was doubled on account of the many points in which indium
                    resembles zinc,—the latter metal having the equivalent 32 ’ 45, but the atomic
                    weight 64 ’ 9. For some time, until Bunsen determined its specific heat, <hi
                        rend="italic">75’6</hi> was accepted as the atomic weight of indium, but he
                    found that it was necessary to multiply the equivalent by 3 in order that the
                    product of specific heat into atomic weight should correspond to that ordinarily
                    observed, thus raising the atomic weight to 113 ’ 4.</p>

                    determined from the observation of their specific heats alone :—</p>

                <p>The only elements of which at present the atomic weights have not been
                    ascertained, either by the vapourdensity or specific heat method, are erbium,
                    thorium, uranium, and yttrium. Even the equivalent of gallium is not yet
                    known.</p>
                <p>Often, also, information which is of service in determining the atomic weights of
                    elements may be obtained by observing the manner in which their compounds
                    crystallize, for it is found that in many instances a given element in a
                    compound may be displaced by another without altering the crystalline form; for
                    example, in ordinary alum, which is a double sulphate of potassium and
                    aluminium, the potassium may readily be displaced by sodium, or the aluminium by
                    chromium, and yet the resulting compounds crystallize in precisely the same
                    manner as the alum. Substances which thus agree in crystalline form <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> are said to be <hi rend="italic"
                        >isomorphous.</hi> A great number of isomorphous substances have been
                    examined by chemists; and they have been led to infer that, as a rule, when two
                    compounds containing similar elements agree in crystalline form they contain the
                    same number of atoms; and hence the quantity of an element which is capable of
                    displacing an atom of another element in a compound without altering its
                    crystalline form is regarded as its atomic weight. This is by no means always
                    the case, however, and the occurrence of isomorphism cannot alone be taken as a
                    proof of the atomic weight of an element; it is of service rather as a check on
                    the determinations made in other ways, and as a stimulus to investigation in the
                    case of elements which have not been sufficiently examined. For instance,
                    certain phosphorous and arsenic minerals of similar composition were known to be
                    isomorphous with a vanadium mineral, vanadinite, the composition of which,
                    according to the received atomic weight of vanadium, exhibited no analogy with
                    them. Roscoe was led by this to investigate anew the compounds of vanadium and
                    to determine its atomic weight, and he found that what had hitherto been
                    regarded as vanadium was really an oxide of the element, and that when the
                    composition of the mineral vanadinite was calculated from the true atomic weight
                    of vanadium, it was precisely similar to that of the minerals with which it was
                    known to be isomorphous.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Molecular Weights.</hi></p>
                <p>We have pointed out (p. 469) that it is to be supposed that the molecule of
                    hydrogen consists of two atoms; hence, if the atomic weight of hydrogen be taken
                    as .1 its molecular weight is 2. In order to ascertain the molecular weights of
                    other elements—that is to say, the relative weights of their molecules referred
                    to that of hydrogen— it is merely necessary to determine their densities
                    referred to hydrogen as unity, and then to multiply the densities by 2.
                    Unfortunately, owing to the high temperature at which most of the elements are
                    converted into vapour, the densities of only very few of them are as yet
                    known.</p>
                <p>When, however, the molecular weights of the elements are compared with their
                    atomic weights it is found that they are not always, as in the case of hydrogen,
                    double their atomic weights; hence it is inferred that the molecules of elements
                    do not all contain two atoms. In a few cases the atomic weight and molecular
                    weight agree, which necessitates the conclusion that the molecules are monatomic
                    or consist of a single atom <hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi> a
                    few other cases the molecular weight is either 4 or 6 times the atomic weight,
                    and the molecules are therefore regarded as tetratomic or hexatomic.</p>

                <p>It will be seen that two numbers are given for sulphur This is because at
                    temperatures above 80.0° C. the density of sulphur vapour is such as to indicate
                    that the sulphur molecule consists of 2 atoms, whereas its density at about 500°
                    C. is three times as great, and, consequently, it is to be supposed that the
                    molecules are hexatomic. Selenium, which is closely allied to sulphur, exhibits
                    a very similar behaviour, its vapour at about 1400° C. containing only diatomic
                    molecules, but as the temperature sinks its density <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n483/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0483-0472"/> rapidly increases. These two elements, in
                    fact, afford striking examples of the resolution of complex molecules into
                    simpler molecules by heat; and it is by no means improbable that the tetratomic
                    phosphorus and arsenic molecules will be found to behave similarly if
                    sufficiently heated.</p>
                <p>No method is known by which it is possible to determine the molecular weights of
                    elements or compounds in any other state than that of gas, and the behaviour of
                    sulphur is alone sufficient to prove that we are not justified in assuming that
                    the molecular weights of liquid or solid elements or compounds are identical
                    with their molecular weights as gases. Indeed it is in the highest degree
                    probable that the molecules of solid and liquid bodies are very frequently far
                    more complex than the molecules of the same bodies in the state of gas.</p>

                <p>Opposite the name of each element in the second column of the table on p. 467,
                    the symbol is given which is always employed to represent it. This symbol,
                    however, not only represents the particular element, but a certain definite
                    quantity of it. Thus, the letter H always stands for 1 atom or 1 part by weight
                    of hydrogen, the letter N for I atom or 14 parts of nitrogen, and the symbol Cl
                    for 1 atom or 35 ’ 36 parts of chlorine. Compounds are in like manner
                    represented by writing the symbols of their constituent elements side by side,
                    and if more than one atom of each element be present, the number is indicated by
                    a numeral placed on the right of the symbol of the element either below or above
                    the line. Thus, hydrochloric acid is represented by the formula HC1, that is to
                    say, it is a compound of an atom of hydrogen with an atom of chlorine, or of 1
                    part by weight of hydrogen with 3536 parts by weight of chlorine; again,
                    sulphuric acid is represented by the formula H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, which is a statement that it consists of 2
                    atoms of hydrogen, 1 of sulphur, and 4 of oxygen, and consequently of certain
                    relative weights of these elements. A figure placed on the right of a symbol
                    only affects the symbol to which it is attached, but when figures are placed in
                    front of several symbols all are affected by it, thus 2H <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> means H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> taken twice.</p>
                <p>The distribution of weight in chemical change is readily expressed in the form of
                    equations by the aid of these symbols; the equation</p>
                <p>2HC1 + Zn = ZnC ’ ∣ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + H <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, for example, is to be read as meaning that from certain definite weights
                    of hydrochloric acid and zinc certain definite weights of two different bodies,
                    zinc chloride and hydrogen, are produced. The + sign is invariably employed in
                    this way either to express combination or action upon, the meaning usually
                    attached to the use of the sign = being that from such and such bodies such and
                    such other bodies are formed.</p>
                <p>Usually, when the symbols of the elements are written or printed with a figure to
                    the right, it is understood that this indicates a molecule of the element, the
                    symbol alone representing an atom. Thus, the symbols H <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> and P <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> indicate that the molecules of
                    hydrogen and phosphorus respectively contain 2 and 4 atoms. Since, according to
                    the molecular theory, in all cases of chemical change the action is between
                    molecules, such symbols as these ought always to be employed. Thus, the
                    formation of hydrochloric acid from hydrogen and chlorine is correctly
                    represented by the equation</p>
                <p>H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2HCb that is
                    to say, a molecule of hydrogen and a molecule of chlorine give rise to two
                    molecules of hydrochloric acid; whilst the following equation merely represents
                    the relative weights of the elements which enter into reaction, and is not a
                    complete expression of what is supposed to take place :—</p>
                <p>H + C1 = HC1</p>
                <p>As the molecular weights of comparatively few of the elements have been
                    determined, however, it is possible only in a limited number of cases to employ
                    such symbols. The molecular weights of the larger number of compounds are also
                    unknown, but in all cases it is usual to represent them by formulae which to the
                    best of our knowledge express their molecular composition in the state of gas,
                    and not merely the relative number of atoms which they contain; thus, acetic
                    acid consists of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the proportion of one atom of
                    carbon, two of hydrogen, and one of oxygen, but the determination of its vapour
                    density shows that it has a molecular weight corresponding to the formula C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which therefore is always employed to represent
                    acetic acid. When chemical change is expressed with the aid of molecular
                    formulae, not only is the distribution of weight represented, but from mere
                    inspection of the symbols it is possible to deduce the relative volumes which
                    the agentsand resultants occupy in the state of gas if measured at the same
                    temperature and under the same pressure. Thus, the equation</p>
                <p>2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O not only represents that certain definite weights
                    of hydrogen and oxygen furnish a certain definite weight of the compound which
                    we term water, but that if the water in the state of gas, the hydrogen, and the
                    oxygen are all measured at the same temperature and pressure, the volume
                    occupied by the oxygen is only half that occupied by the hydrogen, whilst the
                    resulting water-gas will only occupy the same volume as the hydrogen. In other
                    words, 2 volumes of oxygen and 4 volumes of hydrogen furnish 4 volumes of water
                    gas. A simple equation like this, therefore, when properly interpreted, affords
                    a large amount of information. One other instance may be given; the equation</p>
                <p>2NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 3H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, represents the decomposition of ammonia gas into
                    nitrogen and hydrogen gases by the electric spark, and it not only conveys the
                    information that a certain relative weight of ammonia consisting of certain
                    relative weights of hydrogen and nitrogen is broken up into certain relative
                    weights of hydrogen and nitrogen, but also that the nitrogen will be contained
                    in half the space which contained the ammonia, and that the volume of the
                    hydrogen will be one and a half times as great as that of the original ammonia,
                    so that in the decomposition of ammonia the volume becomes doubled.</p>
                <p>Formulae which merely express the relative number of atoms of the different
                    elements present in a compound are termed empirical formulae, and the formulae
                    of all compounds whose molecular weights are undetermined are necessarily
                    empirical. The molecular formula of a compound, however, is always a simple
                    multiple of the empirical formula, if not identical with it; thus, the empirical
                    formula of acetic acid is CH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, and its molecular
                    formula is C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, or twice CH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. If the
                    vapour density of a compound cannot be ascertained, its molecular formula can
                    only be ascertained, with .more or less approximation to truth, by considering
                    its properties, and especially its relations to allied compounds of known
                    molecular weight. For example, chromic anhydride is represented as CrO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and, although it cannot be vaporized, this is held
                    to be.its molecular formula chiefly on account of the formation from chromic
                    anhydride of a volatile chromium oxychloride, the molecular weight of which is
                    found to accord with the formula CrO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>

                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0484-0473"/> chemists are in the habit of employing
                    various kinds of rational formulae, called constitutional formulae, graphic
                    formulae, &amp;c., which not only express the molecular composition of the
                    compounds to which they apply, but also embody certain assumptions as to the
                    manner in which the constituent atoms are arranged, and convey more or less
                    information with regard to the nature of the compound itself, viz., the class to
                    which it belongs, the manner in which it is formed, and the behaviour it will
                    exhibit under various circumstances. Before explaining these formulae it will be
                    necessary, however, to consider the differences in combining power exhibited by
                    the various elements.</p>
                <p>It is found that the number of atoms of a given element, of chlorine, for
                    example, which unite with an atom of each of the other elements is very
                    variable. Thus, hydrogen unites with but a single atom of chlorine, zinc with
                    two, boron with three, silicon with four, and phosphorus with five. Those
                    elements which are equivalent in combining or displacing power to a single atom
                    of hydrogen are said to be <hi rend="italic">univalent</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >monad</hi> elements; whilst those which are equivalent to two atoms of
                    hydrogen are termed bivalent or dyad elements; and those equivalent to three,
                    four, five, or six atoms of hydrogen triad, tetrad, pentad, or hexad elements.
                    But not only is the combining power or valency (atomicity) of the elements
                    different, it is also observed that one element may combine with another in
                    several proportions, or that its valency may vary; for example, phosphorus forms
                    two chlorides represented by the formulae PCl <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> and
                    PC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, and nitrogen the series of oxides represented
                    by the formulae</p>
                <p>N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, NO, N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 5</hi>.</p>
                <p>In explanation of these facts it is supposed that each element has a certain
                    number of “units of affinity,” which may be entirely, or only in part, engaged
                    when it enters into combination with other elements; and in those cases in which
                    the entire number of units of affinity are not engaged by other elements, it is
                    supposed that those which are thus disengaged neutralize each other, as it were.
                    For example, in pentachloride of phosphorus the five units of affinity possessed
                    by the phosphorus atom are satisfied by the five monad atoms of chlorine, but in
                    the trichloride two are disengaged, and, it may be supposed, satisfy each other.
                    Compounds in which all the units of affinity of the contained elements are
                    engaged are said to be <hi rend="italic">saturated,</hi> whilst those in which
                    the affinities of the contained elements are not all engaged by other elements
                    are said to be <hi rend="italic">unsaturated.</hi> According to this view, it is
                    necessary to assume that, in all unsaturated compounds, two, or some even number
                    of affinities are disengaged; and also that all elements which combine with an
                    even number of monad atoms cannot combine with an odd number, and <hi
                        rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> —in other words, that the number of units of
                    affinity active in the case of any given element must be always either an even
                    or an odd number, and that it cannot be at one time an even and at another an
                    odd number. There are, however, a few remarkable exceptions to this “law.” Thus,
                    it must be supposed that in nitric oxide, NO, an odd number of affinities are
                    disengaged, since a single atom of dyad oxygen is united with a single atom of
                    nitrogen, which in all its compounds with other elements acts either as a triad
                    or pentad. When nitric peroxide, N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, is converted into gas, it decomposes, and at about
                    180° C. its vapour entirely consists of molecules of the composition NO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; while at temperatures between this and 0° C. it
                    consists of a mixture in different proportions of the two kinds of molecules, N
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> and NO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. The oxide NO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> must be
                    regarded as another instance of a compound in which an odd number of affinities
                    of one of the contained elements are disengaged, since it contains two atoms of
                    dyad oxygen united with a single atom of triad or pentad nitrogen. Again, when
                    hexachloride of tungsten is converted into vapour it is decomposed into chlorine
                    and a pentachloride, having a normal vapour density, but as in the majority of
                    its compounds tungsten acts as a hexad, we apparently must regard its
                    pentachloride as a compound in which an odd number of free affinities are
                    disengaged. Hitherto no explanation has been given of these exceptions to what
                    appears to be a law of almost universal application, viz., that the sum of the
                    units of affinity of all the atoms in a compound is an even number.</p>
                <p>The number of units of affinity active in the case of any particular element is
                    largely dependent, however, upon the nature of the element or elements with
                    which it is associated. Thus, an atom of iodine only combines with one of
                    hydrogen, but may unite with three of chlorine, which never combines with more
                    than a single atom of hydrogen; an atom of phosphorus unites with only three
                    atoms of hydrogen, but with five of chlorine, or with four of hydrogen and one
                    of iodine; and the chlorides corresponding to the higher oxides of lead, nickel,
                    manganese, and arsenic, PbO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, Ni <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, MnO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and As <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 5</hi> do not exist as stable compounds, but only the
                    lower chlorides, PbCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, NiCl <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi>, MnCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >AsC1</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 3</hi>, are known.</p>
                <p>It is difficult, therefore, to classify the elements according to their
                    valencies; indeed, an absolute classification is scarcely possible. In the
                    following table a number of the elements are arranged mostly according to their
                    apparent maximum valencies :—</p>

                    trioxidβ of sulphur is usually regarded as a compound of an atom of hexad
                    sulphur with three atoms of dyad oxygen, and this hypothesis is illustrated by
                    the graphic formula</p>
                <p>O=S=O</p>
                <p>II ο</p>
                <p>When this oxide is brought into contact with water it combines with it forming
                    sulphuric acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>,
                    and it is <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n485/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0485-0474"/> supposed that in this compound only two of
                    the oxygen atoms are wholly associated with the sulphur atom, each of the
                    remaining oxygen atoms being united by one of its affinities to the sulphur
                    atom, and by the remaining affinity to an atom of hydrogen; thus—</p>
                <p>0</p>
                <p>II</p>
                <p>H—O—S-O—H</p>
                <p>II ο</p>
                <p>Again, the reactions of acetic acid, C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, show that the four
                    atoms of hydrogen which it contains have not all the same function, and also
                    that the two atoms of oxygen have different functions; the graphic formula which
                    we are led to assign to acetic acid, viz.,—</p>
                <p>H</p>
                <p>I</p>
                <p>H—C—H</p>
                <p>I</p>
                <p>O=C—0—H</p>
                <p>serves in a measure to express this, three of the atoms of hydrogen being
                    represented as associated with one of the atoms of carbon, whilst the fourth
                    atom is associated with an atom of oxygen which is united by a single affinity
                    to the second atom of carbon, to which, however, the second atom of oxygen is
                    united by both of its affinities. It is not to be supposed that there are any
                    actual <hi rend="italic">bonds</hi> of union between the atoms; graphic formulae
                    such as these merely express the hypothesis that certain of the atoms in a
                    compound come directly within the sphere of attraction of certain other atoms,
                    and only indirectly within the sphere of attraction of others,—an hypothesis to
                    which chemists are led by observing that it is often possible to separate a
                    group of elements from a compound, and to displace it by other elements or
                    groups of elements.</p>
                <p>Rational formulae of a much simpler description than these graphic formulae are
                    generally employed. For instance, sulphuric acid is usually represented by the
                    formula SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which
                    indicates that it may be regarded as a compound of the group SO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> with twice the group OH. Each of these OH groups is
                    equivalent in combining or displacing power to a monad element, since it
                    consists of an atom of dyad oxygen associated with a single atom of monad
                    hydrogen, so that in this case the SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> group is
                    equivalent to an atom of a dyad element. This formula for sulphuric acid,
                    however, merely represents such facts as that it is possible to displace an atom
                    of hydrogen and an atom of oxygen in sulphuric acid by a single atom of
                    chlorine, thus forming the compound SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> HC1; and
                    that by the action of water on the compound SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> twice the group OH, or water minus an atom of
                    hydrogen, is introduced in place of the two monad atoms of chlorine—</p>
                <p>SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2HOH = SO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2HC1.</p>
                <p>Water. Sulphuric acid.</p>
                <p>Constitutional formulae like these, in fact, are nothing more than symbolic
                    expressions of the character of the compounds which they represent, the
                    arrangement of symbols in a certain definite manner being understood to convey
                    certain information with regard to the compounds represented.</p>
                <p>Groups of two or more atoms like SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and OH, which
                    are capable of playing the part of elementary atoms (that is to say, which can
                    be transferred from compound to compound), are termed compound radicles, the
                    elementary atoms being simple radicles. Thus, the atom of hydrogen is a monad
                    simple radicle, the atom of oxygen a dyad pimple radicle, whilst the group OH is
                    a monad compound radicle.</p>
                <p>It is often convenient to regard compounds as formed upon certain types; alcohol,
                    for example, may be said to be a compound formed upon the water type, that is to
                    say, a compound formed from water by displacing one of the atoms of hydrogen by
                    the group of elements C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">

                <p><hi rend="italic">Chemwcd Action.</hi></p>
                <p>Chemical change or chemical action may be said to take place whenever changes
                    occur which involve an alteration in the composition of molecules, and may be
                    the result of the action of agents such as heat, electricity, or light, or of
                    two or more elements or compounds upon each other.</p>
                <p>Three kinds of changes are to be distinguished, viz., changes which involve
                    combination, changes which involve decomposition or separation, and changes
                    which involve at the same time both decomposition and combination. Changes of
                    the first and second kind, according to our present views of the constitution of
                    molecules, are probably of very rare occurrence; in fact, chemical action
                    appears almost always to involve the occurrence of both these kinds of change,
                    for, as already pointed out, we must assume that the molecules of hydrogen,
                    oxygen, and several other elements are diatomic, or that they consist of two
                    atoms. Indeed, it appears probable that with few exceptions the elements are all
                    compounds of similar atoms united together by one or more units of affinity,
                    according to their valencies. If this be the case, however, it is evident that
                    there is no real distinction between the reactions which take place when two
                    elements combine together and when an element in a compound is displaced by
                    another. The combination, as it is ordinarily termed, of chlorine with hydrogen,
                    and the displacement of iodine in potassium iodide by the action of chlorine,
                    may be cited as examples; if these reactions are represented, as such reactions
                    very commonly are, by equations which merely express the relative weights of the
                    bodies which enter into reaction, and of the products, thus—</p>
                <p>H + Cl = HC1</p>
                <p>Hydrogen, chlorine. Hydrochloric acid.</p>
                <p>KI + Cl = KC1 + I</p>
                <p>Potassium iodide. Chlorine. Potassium chloride. Iodine.</p>
                <p>they appear to differ in character; but if they are correctly represented by
                    molecular equations, or equations which express the relative .number of
                    molecules which enter into reaction and which result from the reaction, it will
                    be obvious that the character of the reaction is substantially the same in both
                    cases, and that both are instances of the occurrence of what is ordinarily
                    termed double decomposition—</p>
                <p>H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2HC1 Hydrogen.

                    2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Potassic iodide. Chlorine. Potassic chloride. Iodine.</p>
                <p>For chemical action to take place between two bodies it is necessary that they
                    should be in contact, and, therefore, generally speaking, that one of them
                    should be in the state of liquid or gas.</p>
                <p>In all cases of chemical change energy in the form of heat is either developed or
                    absorbed, and the amount of heat developed or absorbed in a given reaction is as
                    definite as are the weights of the substance engaged in the reaction. Thus, in
                    the production of hydrochloric acid from hydrogen and chlorine 22,000 units of
                        heat<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A unit of heat

                            stated that a certain amount of heat is developed in the production of a

                            weight in grammes is to be understood. Thus, in the above case, the
                            production of hydrochloric, hydrobromic, and hydriodic acids means the
                            production respectively of 36’36, 8Γ75, and 127’53 grammes of these

                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0486-0475"/> developed; in the production of hydrobromic
                    acid from hydrogen and bromine, however, only 8440 units of heat are developed;
                    and in the formation of hydriodic acid from hydrogen and iodine 6040 units of
                    heat are absorbed.</p>
                <p>This difference in behaviour of the three elements, chlorine, bromine, and
                    iodine, which in many respects exhibit considerable resemblance, may be
                    explained in the following manner. We may suppose that in the formation of
                    gaseous hydrochloric acid from gaseous chlorine and hydrogen, according to the
                    equation</p>
                <p>H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = HC1 + HC1, a
                    certain amount of energy is expended in separating the atoms of hydrogen in the
                    hydrogen molecule, and the atoms of chlorine in the chlorine molecule, from each
                    other; but that heat is developed by the combination of the hydrogen atoms with
                    the chlorine atoms, and that, as more energy is developed by the union of the
                    atoms of hydrogen and chlorine than is expended in separating the hydrogen atoms
                    from each other and the chlorine atoms from one another, the result of the
                    action of the two elements upon each other is the development of heat,—the
                    amount finally developed in the reaction being the difference between that
                    absorbed in decomposing the elementary molecules and that developed by the
                    combination of the atoms of chlorine and hydrogen. In the formation of gaseous
                    hydrobromic acid from liquid bromine and gaseous hydrogen-H <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 2</hi> + Br <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = HBr+HBr, in addition to the
                    energy expended in decomposing the hydrogen and bromine molecules, energy is
                    also expended in converting the liquid bromine into the gaseous condition, and
                    probably less heat is developed by the combination of bromine and hydrogen than
                    by the combination of chlorine and hydrogen, so that the amount of heat finally
                    developed is much less than is developed in the formation of hydrochloric acid.
                    Lastly, in the production of gaseous hydriodic acid from hydrogen and solid
                    iodine—</p>
                <p>H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = HI + HI, so
                    much energy is expended in the decomposition of the hydrogen and iodine
                    molecules and in the conversion of the iodine into the gaseous condition, that
                    the heat which it may be supposed is developed by the combination of the
                    hydrogen and iodine atoms is insufficient to balance the expenditure, and the
                    final result is therefore negative; hence it is necessary in forming hydriodic
                    acid from its elements to apply heat continuously.</p>
                <p>These compounds also afford examples of the fact that, generally speaking, those
                    compounds are most readily formed, and are most stable, in the formation of
                    which the most heat is developed. Thus, chlorine enters into reaction with
                    hydrogen, and removes hydrogen from hydrogenized bodies, far more readily than
                    bromine; and hydrochloric acid is a far more stable substance than hydrobromic
                    acid, hydriodic acid being greatly inferior even to hydrobromic acid in
                    stability.</p>
                <p>When two substances which by their action upon each other develop much heat enter
                    into reaction, the reaction is usually complete without the employment of an
                    excess of either; for example, when a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, in the
                    proportions to form water—</p>
                <p>2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2OH <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is exploded, it is entirely converted into water.
                    This is also the case if two substances are brought together in solution, by the
                    action of which upon each other a third body is formed which is insoluble in the
                    solvent employed, and which also does not tend to react upon any of the
                    substances present; for instance, when a solution of a chloride is added to a
                    solution of a silver salt, insoluble silver chloride is precipitated, and almost
                    the whole of the silver is removed from solution, even if the amount of the
                    chloride employed be not in excess of that theoretically required.</p>
                <p>But if there be no tendency to form an insoluble compound, or one which is not
                    liable to react upon any of the other substances present, this is no longer the
                    case. For example, when a solution of a per-salt of iron is added to a solution
                    of potassium thiocyanate, a deep red coloration is produced, owing to the
                    formation of thiocyanate of iron. Theoretically the reaction takes place in the
                    case of the pernitrate of iron in the manner represented by the equation Fe <hi

                    thiocyanate. Potassium nitrate, but it is found that even when more than sixty
                    times the amount of potassium thiocyanate required by this equation is added, a
                    portion of the ferric nitrate still remains unconverted, doubtless owing to the
                    occurrence of the reverse change—</p>
                <p>Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (CNS) <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> + 6KNO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (NO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> + 6KCNS.</p>
                <p>In this, as in most other cases in which substances act upon one another under
                    such circumstances that the resulting compounds are free to react, the extent to
                    which the different kinds of action which may occur take place is dependent upon
                    the mass of the substances present in the mixture. As another instance of this
                    kind, the decomposition of bismuth chloride by water may be cited. If a very
                    large quantity of water be added, the chloride is entirely decomposed in the
                    manner represented by the equation—</p>
                <p>BiCl <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = BiOCl +
                    2HC1,</p>
                <p>Bismuth chloride. Bismuth oxychloride.</p>
                <p>the oxychloride being precipitated; but if smaller quantities of water be added
                    the decomposition is incomplete, and it is found that the extent to which
                    decomposition takes place is proportional to the quantity of water employed, the
                    decomposition being incomplete, except in presence of large quantities of water,
                    because of the occurrence of the reverse action—</p>

                <p>Chemical change which merely involves simple decomposition is also influenced by
                    the presence of the products of decomposition. Thus when calcium carbonate is
                    strongly heated in an open vessel, it is entirely decomposed into carbon dioxide
                    gas and calcium oxide—</p>
                <p>CaCO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + CaO.
                    calcium carbonate, carbon dioxide. Calcium oxide.</p>
                <p>When it is heated in a confined space, the decomposition only goes on until the
                    liberated gas has attained a certain tension, and as long as the temperature
                    does not vary, the tension remains the same, and is independent of the pro-.
                    portion of the compound decomposed, that is to say, of the amount of calcium
                    oxide present; but the tension increases if the temperature is raised, and
                    diminishes if it is lowered, owing to the recombination of a portion of the
                    carbon dioxide with the calcium oxide; for example, at 800° C. the tension is
                    equivalent to a column of mercury 85 millimetres high, but at1040° C. it is
                    equivalent to a column of 520 mm. Deville applies the term dissociation to
                    changes which occur in this manner; the term only applies to those cases of
                    decomposition in which products are obtained which under the conditions of the
                    experiment are capable of reuniting to form the original substance<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n487/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0487-0476"/>. When such substances are heated in a
                    confined space, not only does decomposition take place, but a certain proportion
                    of the decomposition products recombine, and for each degree of temperature a
                    definite relation exists between the number of molecules broken up and the
                    number of molecules reconstituted; an equilibrium is thus maintained, and the
                    tension remains constant. But as the temperature rises, a larger number of
                    molecules are decomposed and a proportionally smaller number reformed than at
                    the lower temperature, so that the tension rises with the temperature. When,
                    however, a substance like calcium carbonate is heated in an open vessel, the
                    carbon dioxide escapes as it is formed, and therefore it is impossible for
                    recomposition to occur, and ultimately the whole of the carbonate is decomposed.
                    Apparently whenever solid substances undergo dissociation and furnish a solid
                    and a gaseous product, the tension of dissociation is always independent of the
                    amount of the solid decomposition product present.</p>

                <p>The metals are mostly bodies of high specific gravity; they exhibit, when
                    polished, a peculiar brilliancy or metallic lustre, and they are good conductors
                    of heat and electricity; whereas the non-metals are mostly bodies of low
                    specific gravity, and bad conductors of heat and electricity, and do not exhibit
                    metallic lustre. The non-metallic elements are also sometimes termed metalloids,
                    but this appellation, which signifies metal-like substances, strictly belongs to
                    certain elements which do not possess the properties of the true metals although
                    they more closely resemble them than the non-metals in many respects; thus,
                    selenium and tellurium, which are closely allied to sulphur in their chemical
                    properties, although bad conductors of heat and electricity, exhibit metallic
                    lustre and have relatively high specific gravities.</p>
                <p>But when the properties of the elements are carefully contrasted together it is
                    obvious that no strict line of demarcation can be drawn dividing them into two
                    classes; and if they are arranged in a series, those which are most closely
                    allied in properties being placed next to each other, it is evident that there
                    is a more or less regular alteration in properties from term to term in the
                    series.</p>
                <p>When binary compounds, or compounds of two elements, are decomposed by an
                    electric current,the two elements make their appearance at opposite poles. Those
                    elements which are disengaged at the negative pole are termed electropositive,
                    or positive, or basylous elements, whilst those disengaged at the positive pole
                    are termed electro-negative, or negative, or chlorous elements. But the
                    difference between these two classes of elements is one of degree only, and they
                    gradually merge into each other; moreover the electric relations of elements are
                    not absolute, but vary according to the state of combination in which they
                    exist, so that it is just as impossible to divide the elements into two classes
                    according to this property as it is to separate them into two distinct classes
                    of metals and non-metals. The following, however, are negative towards the
                    remaining elements which are more or less positive :—</p>

                <p>Elements which readily enter into reaction with each other, and which develop a
                    large amount of heat on combination, are said to have a powerful affinity for
                    each other. The tendency of positive elements to unite with positive elements,
                    or of negative elements to unite with negative elements, is much less than that
                    of positive elements tα∙ unite with negative elements, and the greater the
                    difference in properties between two elements the more powerful is their
                    affinity for each other. Thus, the affinity of hydrogen and oxygen for each
                    other is extremely powerful, much heat being developed by the combination of
                    these two elements; when binary compounds of oxygen are decomposed by the
                    electric current, the oxygen invariably appears at the positive pole, being
                    negative to all other elements, but the hydrogen of hydrogen compounds is.
                    always disengaged at the negative pole. Hydrogen and oxygen are, therefore, of
                    very opposite natures, and this is well illustrated by the circumstance that
                    oxygen combines,, with very few exceptions, with all the remaining elements,
                    whilst compounds of only a very limited number with hydrogen have been
                    obtained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hydrides.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The only elements which
                    are known to form, binary compounds with hydrogen are fluorine, chlorine^
                    bromine, iodine, oxygen, sulphur, selenium, tellurium, carbon, silicon,
                    nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and copper. Palladium has the property
                    of absorbing a large volume of hydrogen gas, and it is supposed forms a definite
                    compound with it; sodium and potassium, when heated to 350° to 400° C., also
                    absorb hydrogen and appear to form definite compounds. With the exception of
                    carbon, which furnishes an enormous number of compounds with hydrogen, the
                    above-named elements unite with hydrogen only in one proportion, or at most in
                    two or three different proportions. Excepting oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, and
                    bromine, they do not readily enter into reaction with hydrogen, so that in most
                    cases, in order to obtain their compounds with hydrogen, it is necessary to
                    resort to indirect methods of preparation. The compounds of the elements with
                    hydrogen may all be included under the general title of hydrides, but usually
                    they possess specific names; thus, the hydride of oxygen is known as water, and
                    the hydride of nitrogen as ammonia. Some of the hydrides of carbon are gases,
                    but the majority are either liquids or solids; the two known hydrides of oxygen,
                    water and the so-called peroxide of hydrogen, are liquids; a gaseous and a
                    liquid hydride of sulphur are known; three hydrides of phosphorus are said to
                    exist, one of which is liquid, one solid, and one gaseous; hydride of copper is
                    a solid; and the hydrides of the remaining elements are gases. Excepting the
                    hydride of copper, all are colourless substances. The following is a list of the
                    known hydrides, including, however, only the first or simplest hydride of carbon

                <p><hi rend="italic">Oxides.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The element oxygen is
                    known to form compounds with all the elements excepting fluorine, but the
                    affinity of the various elements for oxygen, and consequently the stability of
                    the compounds resulting from their union with oxygen, varies within very wide
                    limits; the oxides of many elements which have but a weak affinity for oxygen
                    can only be obtained by indirect means.</p>
                <p>Although many of the elements unite with oxygen in several proportions, none are
                    known to furnish more than •five distinct oxides, and these belong to a certain
                    limited number of forms, since they contain one, two, three, four, or five atoms
                    of oxygen in the molecule. But as the same number of atoms of oxygen may unite
                    with a given element in more than one proportion, each of these five classes
                    includes sub-classes. The composition of the oxides may be best illustrated and
                    their behaviour explained by regarding them as formed on the type of the two
                    oxides of hydrogen, hydrogen monoxide or water, OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    and hydrogen dioxide, O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi>.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">monoxides</hi> are formed on the type of a single molecule
                    of water, that is to say, they may be regarded as derived from a single molecule
                    of water by the displacement of the two atoms of hydrogen by the equivalent
                    amount of other elements. If two atoms of a monad element, or single atom of a
                    dyad element, or of a polyad element which functions as a dyad, displace the two
                    atoms of hydrogen, normal monoxides result, examples of which are potassium
                    monoxide, K' <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, and copper oxide, Cu"O. But
                    monoxides are known in which two atoms of a dyad or it may be polyad element
                    displace the two atoms of hydrogen in water; it is supposed that in this case
                    the two atoms of polyad metal are united together and therefore function as a
                    dyad compound radicle. Monoxides of this kind are usually termed suboxides; the
                    suboxide of copper, (Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>)"O, and the suboxide of
                    palladium, (Pd <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>)"O, may be cited as examples. The
                    supposed constitution of the three classes of monoxides is represented by the
                    following graphic formulae :—</p>

                <p>Two classes of <hi rend="italic">dioxides</hi> may be distinguished :—the one
                    formed from two molecules of water by the displacement of the four atoms of
                    hydrogen by a single tetrad atom, such as carbon dioxide, C <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,τ</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and tin dioxide,
                    Su <hi rend="superscript"> lτ</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> j the other
                    formed from a single molecule of hydrogen dioxide by the displacement of the two
                    atoms of hydrogen either by two monad atoms, or by a single dyad atom, such as
                    potassium dioxide, K' <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi>, barium dioxide, Ba"O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and manganese
                    dioxide, Mn"O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. These two kinds of dioxide differ
                    enormously in chemical properties; their supposed constitution is represented by
                    the following graphic formtdae :—</p>

                <p>Carbon dioxide. Potassium dioxide. Barium dioxide.</p>
                <p>The dioxides derived from hydrogen dioxide are usually termed peroxides.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">trioxides</hi> are divisible into three classes, but all
                    may be regarded as derived from three molecules of water. In the one class the
                    six atoms of hydrogen are displaced by a single hexad atom, as in sulphur
                    trioxide, S <hi rend="superscript"> τ,</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and
                    tungsten trioxide, W <hi rend="superscript"> τι</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi>; in the second class the six atoms of hydrogen are displaced by two
                    polyad (tetrad 1) elements, which together function as a hexad compound radicle,
                    as in ferric oxide, (Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) <hi rend="superscript">
                        τ,</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and chromic oxide, (Cr <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>)' ’ O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. A third class
                    may be regarded as formed by the displacement of the six atoms of hydrogen by
                    two triad atoms, and includes boron trioxide, B"' <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and bismuth trioxide, Bi"' <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. There are
                    considerable differences in properties between these three classes of trioxides;
                    their graphic formulae are as follows :—</p>
                <p>ø Fe=O Bi=O</p>
                <p>II O&lt; I θ&lt;</p>

                <p>Sulphur trioxide. Ferric oxide. Bismuth trioxide.</p>
                <p>As examples of <hi rend="italic">tetroxides,</hi> osmium tetroxide, OsO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, antimony tetroxide, Sb <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, the so-called magnetic oxide of iron,
                    Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, and lead
                    tetroxide, Pb <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, may
                    be quoted. These oxides undoubtedly belong to different classes, but too little
                    is known of them for their relations to each other to be defined.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the few <hi rend="italic">pentoxides</hi> which are known may, with
                    scarcely an exception, be regarded as derived from five molecules of water, the
                    ten atoms of hydrogen being displaced by two pentad atoms. This is illustrated
                    by the following graphic formulae of phosphorus and arsenic pentoxides ;—</p>

                <p>Phosphorus pentoxide. Arsenic pentoxide.</p>
                <p>Several of the oxides of chlorine and of nitrogen, and one of the oxides of
                    sulphur, are gases; the oxides of hydrogen, and the oxides of chlorine and of
                    nitrogen which are not gaseous, are liquid; and the remaining oxides are solid
                    bodies.</p>

                        rend="italic">—</hi> Many oxides have an extremely powerful affinity for
                    water, and readily combine with it; but the compounds formed in this manner by
                    different oxides differ remarkably in properties. For example, when sulphur
                    trioxide, SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is added to water, a solution is
                    obtained which has the property of changing the colour of blue vegetable
                    colouring matters, such as litmus, to red, and possesses a sharp sour taste; but
                    when the oxide of a highly positive metal, such as barium oxide, is added to
                    water, a solution capable of restoring the blue colour to reddened litmus is
                    obtained. In both cases the water combines with the oxide, the sulphur trioxide
                    being converted into <hi rend="italic">sulphuric acid:</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >—</hi></p>

                <p>Sulphuric acid and barium hydroxide are representatives of two most important
                    classes of compounds, the <hi rend="italic">acids</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >bases</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the oxides which furnish acids when
                    combined with water are conveniently termed <hi rend="italic">acid oxides,</hi>
                    whilst those which furnish bases may be termed <hi rend="italic">basic
                        oxides.</hi></p>
                <p>The acid oxides, however, unite with the basic oxides to form a third class of
                    compounds called <hi rend="italic">salts,</hi> which are usually neutral bodies,
                    that is to say, they have no action either on red or on blue litmus; thus,
                    sulphur trioxide and barium oxide unite to form the salt barium sulphate:—</p>
                <p>SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + BaO = SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> Ba.</p>
                <p>The term acid is applied by some chemists to what are here called acid oxides,
                    and what we have called basic oxides are frequently spoken of as bases, the
                    acids being regarded as salts of hydrogen; this view of the constitution of
                    acids is adopted because they are formed by the union of oxides of negative
                    elements with the oxide of the positive element hydrogen, just as what are
                    ordinarily <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n489/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0489-0478"/> termed salts are formed by the union of
                    oxides of negative with oxides of positive elements. In this article, however,
                    the term acid is restricted to compounds containing hydrogen.</p>
                <p>The acids formed from the oxides of the various elements in the manner above
                    explained all enter into reaction with bases, and with especial readiness with
                    those derived from the highly positive elements, in such a manner that salts are
                    produced, the hydrogen of the acid being displaced by the metal of the base, and
                    water formed; for example,</p>
                <p>H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + Ba"O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = BaSO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + 2OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Sulphuric acid.
                    Barium hydroxide. Barium sulphate.</p>
                <p>We may therefore define an acid to be a compound containing one or more atoms of
                    hydrogen which may be displaced by a metal by the action of a base; but, as will
                    be evident later on, although applicable to all acids, this definition is of
                    rather too wide a character.</p>
                <p>The hydrides of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine also readily enter into
                    reaction with bases, exchanging their hydrogen for other elements; and as they
                    also possess an acid taste and redden blue litmus, they are universally regarded
                    as acids. The fact that these compounds are powerful acids is of considerable
                    importance, as showing that it is the association of hydrogen with a negative
                    radicle which renders it subject to displacement by positive elements—that is to
                    say, a compound in which hydrogen is associated with a negative radicle will
                    have the properties of an acid, and the more negative the radicle the more
                    readily can the hydrogen be displaced. The composition of all known acids is
                    entirely in accordance with this view; thus, in nitric acid a single atom of
                    hydrogen is associated with the negative compound radicle NO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, in sulphuric acid two atoms of hydrogen are
                    combined with the negative compound radicle SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, and
                    in phosphoric acid three atoms of hydrogen are associated with the negative
                    compound radicle PO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>.</p>
                <p>The oxides of the most negative and most positive elements most readily combine
                    with water to form acids or bases, whilst the oxides of the feebly negative or
                    feebly positive elements either do not unite with water or form extremely
                    unstable combinations. Similarly, the oxides of the most negative and most
                    positive elements unite together to form stable salts, much heat being developed
                    by their combination, whereas the oxides of feebly negative and feebly positive
                    elements either do not unite or form very unstable salts. The several oxides of
                    an element often differ remarkably in properties, however, one oxide exhibiting
                    acid characters, whilst another has basic properties.</p>
                <p>The oxides of most of the so-called metallic elements are acted upon by acids,
                    such as sulphuric, nitric, and hydrochloric acids, a salt of the metal being
                    formed in all cases in which corresponding salts exist, and the hydro gen of the
                    acid being eliminated in combination with the oxygen of the oxide as water; for
                    example :—</p>

                <p>If corresponding salts do not exist, however, and action take place, then other
                    products are obtained. Thus, no stable sulphate corresponding with manganese
                    dioxide exists, and when this body is decomposed with sulphuric acid oxygen is
                    evolved :—</p>

                    sulphides, corresponding to the acid and basic oxides, and salts formed by the
                    union of these two classes of sulphides. With very few exceptions the sulphides
                    are solid bodies. Selenium and tellurium, which are closely allied to sulphur,
                    also form compounds with many elements more or less closely resembling the
                    sulphides, but they are of little importance.</p>

                    the chlorides are a class of bodies of the highest importance. The affinity of
                    bromine and iodine for other elements being much lower than that of chlorine,
                    and their compounds much less stable than the corresponding chlorides,

                    been little studied.</p>

                <p>We now proceed to the description of the elements and their more important
                    compounds, commencing with hydrogen, and then passing to the so-called
                    non-metallic elements, which will be considered in the following order
                    :—Hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, bromine, iodine, fluorine, sulphur, selenium,
                    tellurium, nitrogen, phosphorus, boron, carbon, and silicon; after which the
                    remaining elements will be briefly described as much as possible in the order of
                    their relationship to each other. Hydrogen is placed at the head of the list,
                    because it is the unit or standard of comparison both for the atomic weights and
                    valencies of the remaining elements, and it is now usual also to refer the
                    densities in the state of gas of all compounds to hydrogen. On account of the
                    number and variety of their compounds with other elements the non-metallic
                    elements are by far the most important, and therefore are naturally considered
                    before the metals.</p>

                    generate, on account of its forming water when burnt. It occurs in the free
                    state in the gases of volcanoes, and by the aid of the spectroscope has been
                    detected in the sun, stars, and nebulae; it chiefly exists in combination with
                    oxygen as water, and is an important constituent of all vegetable and animal
                    substances.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen is obtained by the decomposition of water in <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0490-0479"/> various ways. Thus, when two platinum plates,
                    connected with the poles of a voltaic battery, are plunged into water acidulated
                    with a few drops of sulphuric acid, hydrogen is evolved from the plate in
                    connection with the negative pole, oxygen being disengaged from the positive
                    pole. Water is also resolved into its elements when its vapour is heated by
                    passing through an intensely ignited platinum tube, or by discharging electric
                    sparks in an atmosphere of steam; but under these circumstances, owing to the
                    recombination of much of the hydrogen and oxygen, only a small quantity of the
                    mixed gases is obtained.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen may also be obtained from water by the action of the highly positive
                    metals, caesium, rubidium, potassium, sodium, and lithium, at ordinary
                    temperatures; in each case a solution of the metallic hydroxide is obtained, and
                    hydrogen evolved, thus:—</p>
                <p>2Na + 2OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2N <hi

                <p>Barium, strontium, and calcium also decompose water in the cold, and hydrogen is
                    evolved when magnesium is heated with water at temperatures below the boiling
                    point of the latter. Many other metals, such as iron, manganese, zinc, cadmium,
                    cobalt, nickel, tin, and antimony evolve hydrogen from water when its vapour is
                    passed over the metal heated to redness, the oxide of the metal being formed,
                    thus:—</p>
                <p>3Fe + 4OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 4H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + Fe <hi

                <p>Aluminium also decomposes water at a red heat, but owing to the formation of an
                    impermeable coating of aluminium oxide on the surface of the metal the action
                    soon stops. Metals like copper, mercury, silver, gold, and platinum are without
                    action even at a bright red heat. Many metals, however, which do not decompose
                    water unless heated with it, if placed in contact with a more negative element
                    cause the evolution of hydrogen at ordinary atmospheric temperatures; for
                    example, if a plate of zinc, coated with spongy copper by immersion in a
                    solution of copper sulphate, be placed in water, hydrogen is gradually evolved,
                    the reaction which occurs being as follows :—</p>
                <p>Zn + 2OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + Zn(OH)
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Zinc. Water. [Hydrogen. Zinc hydroxide.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen is usually prepared by the action of zinc or iron on a solution of
                    hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. The change which occurs is represented in the
                    following equations :—</p>
                <p>Zn l· 2HC1 = H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + ZnCl <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi></p>

                    sulphate.</p>
                <p>All metals which readily decompose water when heated readily furnish hydrogen on
                    treatment with hydrochloric and sulphuric acid, and many other metals enter more
                    or less readily (although none so readily) into reaction with these acids; also
                    many other acids may be used in place of hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, but
                    none act more readily. In all cases the action consists in the displacement of
                    the hydrogen of the acid by the metal employed, and if the acid is not one which
                    can enter into reaction with the displaced hydrogen, the latter is evolved as
                    gas. If pure hydrogen is required, it is necessary to employ pure zinc or iron;
                    the impurities in the ordinary metal communicate an extremely disagreeable odour
                    to the gas.</p>
                <p>On the large scale nearly pure hydrogen may be prepared by passing steam over
                    charcoal or coke heated to dull redness. If the temperature be kept sufficiently
                    low, hydrogen and carbon dioxide are the sole products :—</p>
                <p>C + 2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O-=2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + CO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and the latter may be removed by causing the gas tn
                    traverse a vessel filled with slaked lime; but if the temperature be allowed to
                    rise too high carbon monoxide is also produced, and cannot be removed from the
                    mixture.</p>
                <p>Pure hydrogen is a colourless, transparent, odourless and tasteless gas. It has
                    never been liquefied, and is very slightly soluble in water, 100 volumes of
                    water dissolving 1'93 volumes, of the gas at all temperatures between 0 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> β</hi> and 24° C. It is the lightest of all known
                    bodies, its specific gravity being ’ 0693, that of air being unity; one litre of
                    hydrogen at 0° C, and under the pressure of 7 60 mm. of mercury, weighs O896
                    gramme, and it is important to remember this number, since the weight of a litre
                    of any other gas may be at once found by multiplying 0896 by half the molecular
                    weight of the gas, the specific gravity of a gas referred to hydrogen being
                    always half its molecular weight (p. 471).</p>
                <p>Pure hydrogen is not poisonous, though it cannot support life; and if mixed with
                    a certain proportion of oxygen, it may be breathed for some time without
                    inconvenience. It is extremely inflammable, and burns in the air with a
                    colourless non-luminous flame forming water; a burning taper is extinguished
                    when plunged into hydrogen, and all bodies which burn in the air are incapable
                    of burning in hydrogen.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen does not spontaneously enter into reaction with any of the elements,
                    although it has a powerful affinity for several of them. Thus, when hydrogen and
                    oxygen are mixed nothing occurs, but if a burning taper or a heated wire is
                    applied, a violent explosion ensues, water being produced. Similarly, chlorine
                    and hydrogen are without action upon each other in the dark, but if the mixture
                    is exposed to a bright light or is heated by the passage of an electric spark,
                    the gases at once combine with explosive violence, forming hydrochloric acid. It
                    has already been pointed out that we must suppose that the molecules which
                    constitute free hydrogen, chlorine, and oxygen gases are diatomic, and that
                    hydrogen and chlorine, for example, do not directly combine to form hydrochloric
                    acid, but that an action occurs such as is represented by the equation—</p>
                <p>H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = HC1 + HC1, and
                    that, therefore, the combination of the atoms of chlorine and hydrogen is
                    preceded by the separation of the twσ atoms of chlorine in the chlorine
                    molecules, and of the two atoms of hydrogen in the hydrogen molecules, from each
                    other, which necessarily involves an expenditure of energy. The application of
                    heat, we may assume, serves to effect this decomposition of some of the
                    molecules of hydrogen, oxygen, and chlorine into their constituent atoms, and
                    since much heat is evolved by the subsequent combination of the atoms of
                    hydrogen and chlorine, or of hydrogen and oxygen, it is only necessary to apply
                    heat to start the reaction, because the remaining molecules are decomposed by
                    the heat developed in the formation of the first portions of water or
                    hydrochloric acid.</p>
                <p>Compounds of hydrogen with bromine, iodine, sulphur, and nitrogen may also be
                    obtained directly from these elements and hydrogen, although only with

                    boiling point, it gradually becomes covered with a red scale of mercuric oxide,
                    HgO, and when this red scale is exposed to a considerably higher temperature it
                    is broken up into oxygen and metallic mercury.</p>
                <p>The oxides of gold, platinum, and other metals which have but a slight affinity
                    for oxygen, are very readily decomposed when heated, oxygen being evolved and
                    the metal remaining. Many other metallic oxides, and especially those which may
                    be regarded as formed on the type of hydrogen dioxide, which readily breaks up
                    into water and oxygen, when more or less strongly heated, are resolved into
                    oxygen and a lower oxide :—lead dioxide, PbO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    barium dioxide, BaO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and manganese dioxide, MnO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, for example. In the case of manganese dioxide,

                    Barium dioxide when strongly heated gives up one-half of its oxygen to produce
                    barium monoxide, 2BaO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = O <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> + 2BaO; and by passing moist air over less heated barium monoxide it
                    may be reconverted into the dioxide, which may be decomposed by a stronger heat.
                    By repetitions of these processes it is possible to procure large quantities of
                    oxygen with the aid of a small quantity of barium dioxide, and it has been
                    proposed to employ this method for the preparation of oxygen on the large scale,
                    but in practice there have been found difficulties attending its use.</p>
                <p>Ordinarily when pure oxygen is required it is prepared by heating potassium
                    chlorate, which ultimately furnishes potassium chloride and oxygen: 2KC1O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = 3O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2KC1. This
                    decomposition requires a high temperature, and can only be effected in vessels
                    of <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> glass, but when the chlorate is mixed with about
                    one-eighth of its weight of a metallic oxide, such as copper oxide, ferric
                    oxide, or manganese dioxide, the oxygen is given off at a considerably lower
                    temperature, and with great rapidity; in this case, however, it is impure, being
                    always contaminated with small quantities of chlorine.</p>
                <p>When potassium chlorate is heated alone the salt fuses, but after a considerable
                    evolution of oxygen has taken place the fused mass becomes pasty, and on
                    examination it is found to consist of a mixture of potassium chloride and
                    potassium perchlorate, KC1O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, so that the first
                    stage in the decomposition may be represented by the equation—</p>
                <p>2KC1O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + KC1O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + KC1;</p>
                <p>Potassium chlorate. Oxygen. Potassium perchlorate. Potassium chloride, the
                    potassium perchlorate is resolved on further heating into oxygen and potassium
                    chloride. When a metallic oxide is mixed with the chloride, however, and heat
                    applied, the latter does not fuse, and the formation of potassium perchlorate
                    cannot be detected at any stage of the decomposition. It is difficult to explain
                    the manner in which the metallic oxide acts in promoting the decomposition of
                    the chlorate, since it is found to be unchanged at the conclusion of the
                    reaction; but it is a well-known fact that many bodies which, under ordinary
                    circumstances, do not yield oxygen, readily part with this element when another
                    substance having a tendency to combine or enter into reaction with oxygen is
                    introduced into the sphere of action. Thus, when potassium dichromate is heated
                    with concentrated sulphuric acid, oxygen is evolved, the yellow solution
                    becoming green owing to the formation of chromium sulphate—</p>

                <p>But if the dichromate is dissolved in a considerable quantity of water no change
                    of this kind takes place even after prolonged heating; when, however, a body
                    like sulphurous acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi>, which has a tendency to unite with oxygen to form sulphuric acid, is
                    added to the solution, it at once becomes green,—the dichromate being decomposed
                    as represented in the above equation, and the oxygen being fixed by the
                    sulphurous acid. Hence it is not improbable that the metallic oxide acts in
                    virtue of a tendency to form a higher oxide, which higher oxide is no sooner
                    produced, however, than it is broken up into oxygen and the lower oxide. The
                    lower oxide may again undergo conversion into the higher oxide and the latter be
                    broken up into oxygen and lower oxide, so that a relatively small quantity of
                    the metallic oxide may suffice to promote the decomposition of a relatively
                    large quantity of chlorate.</p>
                <p>When a small quantity of cobalt sesquioxide, or a few drops of a solution of a
                    cobalt salt, is added to a clear concentrated aqueous solution of bleaching
                    powder, which is then gently heated, oxygen is evolved with great regularity,
                    and the bleaching powder is completely resolved into oxygen and calcium
                    chloride—</p>
                <p>2CaCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2CaCl <hi

                <p>The bleaching powder solution is not decomposed in this manner when heated alone,
                    and there is no doubt that the cobalt oxide induces the decomposition by acting
                    as a carrier of oxygen; that is to say, it first takes oxygen away and passes to
                    a higher state of oxidation, and then gives it up again, the higher oxide being
                    an extremely unstable body.</p>
                <p>When silver oxide is added to a solution of hydrogen dioxide in water, metallic
                    silver, water, and oxygen are produced—</p>

                <p>This reaction is especially interesting, as it affords experimental evidence in
                    favour of the assumption that the molecule of oxygen consists of two atoms;
                    moreover, a very considerable quantity of heat is developed in the reaction, and
                    since there is every reason for believing that the separation of an atom of
                    oxygen from silver oxide, and of an atom of oxygen from hydrogen dioxide, are
                    both operations which involve an expenditure of energy, there can be little
                    doubt that the heat developed is due to the combination of the atoms of oxygen
                    to form molecules. In other words, this reaction affords evidence that oxygen
                    atoms have a powerful affinity for each other.</p>

                <p>No method has yet been devised of directly separating pure oxygen frem air, but
                    Graham has shown that it is possible to obtain an “air” containing about 41 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 per cent, by volume of oxygen instead of about
                    20 ’ 8 per cent., which is the amount present in ordinary air, by <hi
                        rend="italic">dialyzing</hi> air through india-rubber. For this purpose a
                    bag composed of the thinnest india-rubber supported on cloth is connected with a
                    Sprengel air-pump; if the pump is kept in action, after the air is exhausted
                    from the bag, it is found that it continues slowly to deliver “air” which,
                    however, is richer in oxygen than ordinary air in about the proportions
                    above-mentioned. The gases do not pass through actual pores, but apparently they
                    are dissolved by the rubber, which is thus <hi rend="italic">wetted through</hi>
                    by the liquefied gases, and evaporate into the vacuum on the other side of the
                    membrane, the increased amount of oxygen being doubtless due to the greater
                    solubility of oxygen in rubber.</p>
                <p>Many other methods of obtaining oxygen are known, but the above given are
                    sufficient to illustrate the nature of the changes by which it is produced.</p>
                <p>Oxygen is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless gas, which has hitherto resisted
                    all attempts to liquefy it; it is only slightly soluble in water, 160 volumes of
                    which at ordinary atmospheric temperatures dissolve about three volumes of
                    oxygen. All bodies which burn in the air burn with greatly increased brilliancy
                    and rapidity in oxygen; thus, a glowing splinter of wood bursts into flame when
                    plunged into oxygen, and burns with great brilliancy; and even iron, if heated
                    to redness before it is introduced into the gas, readily burns in it. In all
                    cases in which bodies burn in oxygen the substances burnt combine with the
                    oxygen to form new substances, and the heat and light developed are a
                    consequence of their union. The weight of the products corresponds exactly with
                    the weight of the body burned <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> the weight of the
                    oxygen consumed. The combination of two or more bodies when thus accompanied by
                    the development of heat <hi rend="italic">and light</hi> is termed combustion,
                    the body burnt being the combustible, and the body in which the burning takes
                    place the supporter of combustion. Thus, hydrogen is a combustible since it
                    burns in oxygen, but oxygen is a supporter of combustion. These terms are merely
                    relative, however, since oxygen may just as readily be burnt in hydrogen as
                    hydrogen in oxygen; and, similarly, air may be burnt in coal gas.</p>
                <p>The combination of oxygen with other elements is termed oxidation. In all cases
                    of oxidation heat is developed, but it depends entirely upon the rapidity with
                    which the oxidation is effected whether light is also produced, that is to say,
                    whether what is ordinarily termed combustion takes place. Thus, when iron is
                    burnt in oxygen, the combination of the two elements is effected with great
                    rapidity, and a large amount of heat is developed within a very short space of
                    time, and hence the product of combustion is intensely heated and becomes
                    incandescent; when, however, iron slowly oxidizes or rusts, no light is
                    produced, although actually more heat is developed than when the same weight of
                    iron is burnt in oxygen, the oxide Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> being formed in the latter and the oxide Fe <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> in the former
                    case.</p>
                <p>The various elements enter into reaction with oxygen with very various degrees of
                    readiness, but as in the case of hydrogen and oxygen it is mostly necessary at
                    least to start the reaction by the application of heat; and if the combination
                    of the two elements can give rise to the development of only a moderate amount
                    of heat, it is usually necessary to continue the application of heat until the
                    oxidation is complete. Phosphorus slowly absorbs oxygen, but the remaining
                    non-metallic elements are not affected by it at ordinary temperatures. The
                    highly positive metals readily absorb it; the majority of the metals, however,
                    when in the massive state are unacted upon in dry oxygen, but undergo oxidation
                    more or less readily in moist oxygen or air. The coating of oxide first formed
                    frequently protects the metal from more than a superficial oxidation. Some of
                    the metals when in a state of very fine division, for instance, lead as obtained
                    by the ignition of its tartrate, undergo oxidation so readily, however, that
                    spontaneous combustion results from their mere exposure to air or oxygen. The
                    spontaneous combustion of substances such as woollen refuse, greasy tow, and hay
                    is a precisely similar phenomenon,—the heat developed by their slow oxidation
                    being to a great extent retained, as they are bad conductors of heat, until
                    finally it becomes sufficient to inflame them. Most animal and vegetable
                    substances when exposed to the air decay, and it is generally supposed that they
                    simply undergo slow oxidation. Pasteur has shown, however, that the oxidizing
                    power of atmospheric oxygen is much exaggerated, and that the decay of animal
                    and vegetable substances exposed to air is not simply the result of the action
                    of the atmospheric oxygen, but of the action of oxygen assisted by microscopic
                    organisms, the decay taking place at an extremely slow and almost imperceptible
                    rate when these organisms are entirely excluded.</p>
                <p>When the colourless gas nitric oxide is mixed with oxygen, red fumes of higher
                    oxides of nitrogen are formed, and by this reaction oxygen may with facility be
                    detected and distinguished from other gases. A solution of potassium hydroxide
                    and pyrogallol, or pyrogallic acid, or an ammoniacal solution of cuprous
                    chloride, absorbs oxygen with avidity and may be employed to remove it from a
                    mixture of gases <hi rend="italic">Ozone,</hi></p>

                <p>When exposed to the action of electricity, and especially under the influence of
                    what is termed the silent discharge, oxygen undergoes a contraction of volume
                    and acquires remarkably different properties, its chemical activity being
                    greatly enhanced. It has been shown that the change consists in the conversion
                    of the oxygen into an allotropic modification which has received the name of
                    ozone (ο£ω) in allusion to its peculiar odour; and from Sir Benjamin Brodie’s
                    experiments <hi rend="italic">(R. Soc. Trans.,</hi> 1872, p. 435) there can be
                    no doubt that ozone differs from ordinary oxygen merely in that its molecule
                    contains three atoms; this difference is expressed in the following graphic
                    formulae :—</p>

                <p>Various forms of apparatus are employed in ozonizing oxygen, but all are
                    constructed on the principle of the Siemens’s induction tube. This consists of
                    two wide tubes of nearly equal diameter placed one within the other and coated
                    on their exterior surfaces with tinfoil; the coatings of tinfoil are connected
                    with the terminals of a powerful induction coil, and a current of oxygen is
                    passed through the narrow space between the two tubes, and is thus submitted to
                    the action of the electric discharge. In the apparatus employed by Brodie the
                    coatings of tinfoil are dispensed with, but the inner tube is filled with water
                    in which is placed one of the terminal wires of the induction coil, and the
                    outer tube is immersed in a vessel of water in connection with the other
                    terminal wire of the coil.</p>
                <p>It is essential that the oxygen submitted to the electric action be pure and in a

                    be done by placing fragments of ice in the interior of the tube and also in the
                    water contained in the external cylinder in which the induction tube is
                    immersed.</p>
                <p>But it is not possible in this manner to convert more than about 15 per cent, of
                    the oxygen into ozone, and Brodie’s experiments prove that there is a fixed
                    limit prescribed by the conditions of experiment, beyond which the formation of
                    ozone cannot pass. The explanation of this appears to be that the formation of
                    ozone belongs to the class of actions termed dissociation phenomena; that is to
                    say, not only is oxygen converted into ozone by the electrical action, but ozone
                    is also reconverted into oxygen, the amount of ozone actually obtained under
                    given conditions of experiment being dependent upon the extent to which these
                    two opposite kinds of change take place. We may therefore expect that the amount
                    of oxygen finally obtained in the form of ozone will be greater the less the
                    ozone is exposed to the electric action; and that this is actually the case is
                    proved by the fact that no advantage is gained by submitting the oxygen more
                    than once to the electric action or by passing it slowly through the induction
                    tube, and also by the behaviour of carbon dioxide. When this gas is submitted to
                    the action of the electric discharge, it is partially resolved into carbon
                    monoxide and oxygen, and the latter is in part transformed into ozone. Brodie
                    has shown that it is not difficult, by passing a rapid current of carbon dioxide
                    through the induction tube, to convert 75 per cent, of the oxygen eliminated
                    from the carbon dioxide into ozone, and has even succeeded in converting as much
                    as 85 per cent.</p>
                <p>Pure ozone has never yet been obtained, however. Ozone is also formed in small
                    quantity when water is decomposed by the electric current, employing plates of
                    platinum or gold as electrodes; the amount produced is greater the smaller the
                    electrodes. The slow oxidation of phosphorus in moist air is said to be attended
                    with the production of small quantities of ozone, and it is probable that ozone
                    is formed in other slow oxidations; it appears that in all such cases the
                    formation of ozone is accompanied by that of hydrogen dioxide, a fact which is
                    also true of electrolytic ozone.</p>
                <p>Traces of ozone are usually present in the atmosphere, especially in the open
                    country; and it no doubt plays an important part in the removal of organic
                    impurities from the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Ozone is a colourless gas of peculiar unpleasant odour; 100 volumes of water at
                    0° C. only absorb about ‘5 volume, so that it is considerably less soluble than
                    oxygen. Air charged with ozone exerts an irritating action upon the respiratory
                    organs. Ozone is chiefly remarkable, however, on account of its oxidizing power.
                    Thus, dry mercury, which is not in the least affected by ordinary oxygen, unless
                    heated to near its boiling point, is at once oxidized by ozone, and dry iodine
                    absorbs ozone and is oxidized by it. It bleaches a solution of indigo, which is
                    oxidized by it. It also rapidly corrodes organic substances, such as cork and
                    caoutchouc, which therefore cannot be employed in experiments with ozone.
                    Paraffin, however, is not attacked by it, and an excellent air-tight joint
                    between two glass tubes may be made by means of it. A piece of glass tube, into
                    which they exactly fit, is slipped over the two tubes, which are placed close
                    together, and a fragment of pure paraffin is placed at the external junction of
                    the tubes; on gently heating the paraffin it melts, and the liquid being
                    extremely limpid runs into and fills up the narrow space between the tubes.</p>
                <p>In the conversion of oxygen into ozone the volume contracts by one-third, three
                    molecules of oxygen furnishing two molecules of ozone.</p>
                <p>3O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>; Oxygen.
                    Ozone.</p>
                <p>but when ozone is reconverted into oxygen the volume increases to the same extent
                    that it diminishes when oxygen is converted into ozone, since</p>
                <p>2O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = 3O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Ozone.
                    Oxygen.</p>
                <p>The conversion of ozone into oxygen may be effected by heat. Thus, when ozonized
                    oxygen is passed through a glass tube heated to 110° C. slight decomposition of
                    the ozone takes place; at 200° C. the decomposition is very rapid, about 97 per
                    cent, being converted into oxygen; and below 300° C. decomposition is
                    complete.</p>
                <p>Similarly, ozone is decomposed to an unlimited extent by contact with metallic
                    silver, and by manganese dioxide, lead dioxide, and copper oxide, without the
                    substances undergoing more than an excessively minute increase of weight in the
                    reaction. These decompositions afford instances of recurrent action, the active
                    substance being alternately oxidized and reduced by the ozone; in the case of
                    silver, supposing silver monoxide is formed, although the oxide produced is
                    probably a higher oxide, the reaction may be represented in the following manner
                    :—</p>
                <p>2Ag + O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + Ag <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O;</p>

                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2Ag. Silver oxide. Ozone. Oxygen. Silver.</p>
                <p>Many reactions are known which prove that ozone has this power of effecting
                    deoxidation, although itself a most powerful oxidizing agent; thus, by its
                    action on a solution of sodium dioxide, sodium monoxide and oxygen are obtained
                    :—</p>
                <p>Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> 4- O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = 2O. <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + Na. <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. Sodium dioxide. Ozone. Oxygen. Sodium oxide.</p>
                <p>The decomposition of ozone in this manner by silver, &lt;fcc., is accompanied by
                    the development of a considerable amount of heat; thus, according to Berthelot,
                    no less than 29,600 units of heat are evolved in the reaction</p>
                <p>2O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = 3O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>A corresponding amount of energy must therefore be expended in the formation of
                    ozone from ordinary oxygen. But the conversion of ozone into ordinary oxygen is
                    to be regarded as occurring in two stages,—in the first the molecule is resolved
                    into O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 0, and in the second two atoms of oxygen
                    from two molecules of ozone unite forming a molecule of ordinary oxygen. The
                    splitting up of the ozone molecule into O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + O
                    probably requires an expenditure of energy, so that the energy developed in the
                    reaction in the form of heat is due to the combination of the atoms of oxygen to
                    form molecules, but is less than that actually developed by their combination by
                    the amount expended in the decomposition of the ozone molecules. As already
                    pointed out, the fact that so large an amount of heat is developed by the
                    combination of oxygen with oxygen indicates that the affinity of the oxygen
                    atoms for each other is very considerable. This being the case, we are enabled
                    also to understand how it is that ozone has such superior power as an oxidizing
                    agent as compared with ordinary oxygen, for it is evident that, in reactions
                    into which oxygen enters, for every 32 grammes employed an amount of energy
                    corresponding to at least 29,600 heat units must be expended in order to
                    separate-the two atoms forming the oxygen molecules from each other; whereas,
                    mostly, when ozone is employed, the amount of energy to be expended is only that
                    required to effect the decomposition of the ozone molecules into O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + O, which is probably very small.</p>
                <p>The amount of oxidation effected by the same amount of ozone varies, however,
                    according to the nature of the body <pb break="no"

                    four classes of oxidations may be effected by ozone :—</p>
                <p>In the first class of reactions one-third of the molecule is active in effecting
                    oxidation, the remaining two-thirds being obtained as oxygen, so that the volume
                    of oxygen obtained is the same as the volume of ozone operated upon, If the
                    number of atoms of oxygen active in effecting oxidation are placed within
                    brackets, this class of oxidations is expressed by the equation—</p>

                <p>In the second class of reactions, four atoms of oxygen from two molecules of

                <p>In a third class of reactions, ten atoms of oxygen from four molecules of ozone
                    are active in promoting oxidation, a single molecule of oxygen being obtained;

                <p>The oxidation of sodium sulphydrate and of hydriodic acid at 0° C. are to be
                    referred to this class.</p>
                <p>Lastly, in a fourth class of reactions, the entire molecule is active in

                <p>Examples of this class are afforded by the oxidation of tin dichloride, oil of

                    hyposulphite.</p>
                <p>That ozone can thus enter into reaction in so many different ways affords the
                    most conclusive evidence of its compound nature, aud by these reactions it may
                    be distinguished from all known gases, and estimated.</p>
                <p>The reaction with potassium iodide is usually employed for the detection of
                    ozone, the liberation of iodine being rendered evident by the addition of starch
                    paste, which with iodine furnishes a beautiful blue colour. The liberation of
                    iodine from potassium iodide is not alone sufficient proof, however, of the
                    presence of ozone. By comparing at different times the depth of colour produced
                    on exposing slips of paper moistened with starch paste and potassium iodide
                    solution to the air, for the same length of time, an estimate of the relative
                    amounts of ozone present may be obtained.</p>

                <p>Hydrogen and oxygen when mixed do not enter into reaction at the ordinary
                    temperature; but the contact of flame or of any other red-hot body, the passage
                    of the electric spark, and the contact of platinum cause reaction to take place
                    with explosion. The flame and the electric spark act by their intense heat, and
                    the nature of the influence which, perhaps, heat exercises in inducing the
                    combination of hydrogen and oxygen has already been pointed out; but the action
                    of platinum is more obscure. Spongy platinum and the fine powder of that metal
                    called platinum black, although cold, cause the mixed gases to explode as
                    readily as flame does. Even polished slips of platinum, if perfectly clean, will
                    cause the reaction to take place, although more slowly. It appears that at first
                    the absorption of the gases on the surface of the cold metal, and the consequent
                    approximation of their particles, is sufficient to induce the combination of a
                    part of the gases; this being accompanied by the development of heat, the metal
                    becomes warmed and acts more vigorously, and the combination of further
                    quantities of the gases takes place, by which more heat is developed, so that by
                    degrees the metal becomes red-hot, and if any of the mixed gases be still
                    uncombined it causes them to explode. In the case of the powder or the sponge,
                    especially the former, all this takes place so rapidly from the enormous surface
                    of the metal, that it becomes red-hot as soon as it is introduced, and fires the
                    mixture as rapidly as a flame. Now, it is well known that metallic platinum, and
                    especially spongy platinum, or platinum black, readily condenses gases upon its
                    surface; but the condensation is attended by the development of heat, and it
                    seems not improbable, therefore, that its action in causing the combination of
                    hydrogen with oxygen is of the same character as the action of flame,—that the
                    platinum, in fact, does not itself induce the combination, but that the heat
                    resulting from the condensation of the gases by the platinum is the direct cause
                    of the reaction. Graham’s researches have shown also that heated platinum
                    absorbs hydrogen, and the absorption is doubtless accompanied by the development
                    of heat; this is an additional reason for the action of platinum becoming more
                    vigorous as it becomes warmer.</p>
                <p>A series of experiments by Von Meyer <hi rend="italic">(Journal</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">für praktische Chemie,</hi> 1876, p. 121) may here be referred
                    to, as illustrating in a remarkable manner the influence of finely-divided
                    platinum in causing the combination of gases. It was first shown by Bunsen that
                    when a mixturo of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is exploded with insufficient
                    oxygen to convert these two gases respectively into water and carbon dioxide,
                    whatever the proportions employed, the quantities oxidized are always in a
                    simple molecular ratio. From Von Meyer’s experiments it appears that, when a
                    similar mixture is placed in contact with finely-divided platinum, although the
                    oxidation is effected very slowly, the same law obtains. Whereas, however, when
                    the mixture of the three gases is exploded, always relatively more hydrogen than
                    carbon monoxide is oxidized, the proportion in which the two gases are burnt
                    being on the average about as 3 to 1, the reverse is the case when their
                    oxidation is slowly effected with the aid of platinum; in the latter case the
                    number of molecules of carbon monoxide oxidized to the dioxide is from 7 to 8
                    times as great as the number of hydrogen atoms oxidized to water.</p>
                <p>When oxygen and hydrogen, from whatever cause, enter into reaction, it is always
                    in the proportions to form water, —that is, invariably in the proportion of 2
                    volumes of hydrogen gas to 1 volume of oxygen gas. Any excess of either is left
                    uncombined. If the water which is formed be measured as steam or gas, and its
                    volume compared with the volume of the mixed gases at the same temperature
                    before combination, it is found that condensation has taken place, 2 volumes of
                    water gas being obtained from 2 volumes of hydrogen and 1 volume of oxygen gas

                    compared with the volume occupied by the mixed gases that it may be neglected,

                    one-third the oxygen, which has disappeared. This enables us to use hydrogen to
                    determine the amount of free oxygen in air, or in any gaseous mixture, one-third
                    of the contraction which occurs when a measured quantity of the gas is exploded
                    with a measured excess of hydrogen representing the amount of oxygen
                    present.</p>
                <p>The affinity of oxygen for hydrogen, as measured by the heat developed by their
                    combination, is very great, 68,376 units of heat, according to Thomsen, being
                    evolved in the combination of 16 grammes of oxygen with 2O05 grammes of
                    hydrogen, the product being liquid water at 18’ C. By burning the two gases
                    together from a jet the most intense artificial heat that is known, except that
                    of the discharge of a powerful galvanic battery, is produced.</p>
                <p>It is well here to call attention to the circumstance that the equations
                    ordinarily employed to express the formation of water from its elements, and <hi
                        rend="italic">vice versa</hi> the resolution of water into its elements,

                    large amount of heat is developed, and that in the other case a corresponding
                    amount of energy is expended. These equations merely represent, in fact, the
                    distribution of weight in the changes, and therefore are but imperfect
                    expressions of what really occurs, since the development of heat in the
                    formation of water, and the absorption of heat, or the expenditure of a
                    corresponding amount of some other form of energy in its decomposition, are
                    integral parts of the changes, the amount of heat developed or absorbed, under
                    given conditions, being as definite and constant as the weights of the
                    substances which enter into reaction and are produced. The same may be said of
                    all equations employed to represent chemical change.</p>
                <p>The composition of water may be determined by burning a known weight of hydrogen
                    in an excess of oxygen, and weighing the water produced; then the difference
                    between the weight of the hydrogen burnt and of the water produced is the amount
                    of oxygen combined with the hydrogen. Or hydrogen is passed over a weighed
                    quantity of copper oxide in a tube heated to redness; the hydrogen thou <hi
                        rend="italic">reduces</hi> the oxide or removes the oxygen from it, forming
                    water, which is carefully collected and weighed, and the loss of weight which
                    the tube of copper oxide suffers is carefully determined. The loss of weight of
                    the copper oxide gives the amount of oxygen, and the difference between this and
                    the amount of water produced is the amount of hydrogen combined with this amount
                    of oxygen.</p>
                <p>The amount of oxygen combined with 2 parts by weight, or 2 atoms, of hydrogen is
                    usually stated to be 16 parts, and 16 is generally regarded as the atomic weight
                    of oxygen. But from the examination of the determinations which have been made
                    by various elements of the composition of water, Staas, to whom we are indebted
                    for the most exact determinations of atomic weights yet made, arrives at the
                    conclusion that this number is too high, and that the atomic weight of oxygen is
                    certainly not higher than 15 ’ 96. Thomsen has recently determined the amount of
                    water produced by burning 2 litres of hydrogen in an excess of oxygen, and
                    taking Regnault’s numbers for the specific gravities of oxygen and hydrogen, he
                    obtains a number for the atomic weight of oxygen which is in complete accordance
                    with that given by Staas.</p>
                <p>At the ordinary temperature of the air water is a clear, transparent, tasteless,
                    and odourless liquid; it appears colourless when seen in small quantity, but
                    that it really has a pale blue colour is apparent when a shining white object is
                    viewed through a column several feet in thickness.</p>
                <p>Water is solid at temperatures below 0° C., 0° C. being the temperature at which
                    frozen water or ice melts; the melting point is diminished by increase of
                    pressure to the slight extent of 0'00757° C. for each additional atmosphere.
                    Water expands in freezing, its density compared with water at 0° C. being <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 92. The conversion of liquid water at 0° C. into
                    solid water or ice is accompanied by the liberation of heat, and heat is
                    rendered latent or absorbed to the same extent in the melting of ice,—the
                    quantity of heat absorbed or liberated in the melting of ice or freezing of
                    water being sufficient to raise the temperature of 7 9 times its weight of water
                    from 0° to l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> C.</p>
                <p>Water evaporates at all temperatures when in contact with atmospheric air or
                    other gases, and the vapour given off has a density and tension determined by
                    the temperature; the tension of the vapour rapidly rises with the temperature,
                    until at 100° C. it is equal to the ordinary atmospheric pressure (760 mm.), and
                    the water boils. The boiling point, however, rapidly rises with increase of
                    pressure, and sinks when the pressure is diminished; thus under the pressure of
                    two atmospheres water boils at 121° C., and under the pressure of twelve
                    atmospheres at 190° C. When water boils under the ordinary atmospheric
                    temperature it is converted into 1600 times its volume of vapour. The conversion
                    into vapour is attended with the absorption of a large amount of heat,—the
                    quantity of heat absorbed or rendered latent in the conversion of water at 100°
                    C. into steam of the same temperature being sufficient to raise the temperature
                    of 536 times the weight of water converted into steam from 0° to l <hi

                <p>Water, chemically speaking, is a remarkably neutral substance, and hence its
                    great value to the chemist as a solvent. There are very few substances which are
                    not to some extent dissolved by it, but the solubility of different substances
                    is very unequal. Heat generally increases its solvent power, whilst cold
                    diminishes it; there are many exceptions to this rule, however. The dissolution
                    of substances which may again be separated from the solution undecomposed is
                    accompanied, in the majority of cases, with an absorption of heat, as will be
                    evident on inspection of the table on p. 485. In the first column the name of
                    the substance is given, and in the second its formula; the third exhibits the
                    number of molecules of water (in grammes) in which one molecule (in grammes) of
                    the substance is dissolved at about 18° C.; the fourth column shows the number
                    of units of heat developed or absorbed,the — sign indicating that heat is
                    absorbed, and the + sign that it is developed.</p>
                <p>It is extremely difficult to interpret the meaning of numbers such as are
                    contained in the table, especially as we are almost entirely ignorant of the
                    condition of substances in solution in water. But there is no doubt that the
                    heat developed or absorbed on dissolving a solid substance is the mean result of
                    several distinct operations, which partly, perhaps, involve an absorption, and
                    partly a development of heat. Thus, in the first place, there is a change of
                    state from the solid to the liquid, which in most if not all cases involves an
                    expenditure of energy; then, many substances on dissolving in water combine with
                    it, the combination probably being always attended with development of heat.
                    Contraction also generally takes place in the dissolution of salts in water, and
                    is accompanied by a considerable development of heat, arising from the great
                    resistance which water offers to compression. Chemists, moreover, are inclined
                    to the belief that very many if not all substances, even those which are
                    ordinarily regarded as stable in presence of water, enter to a greater or less
                    extent into reaction with water when dissolved in it; a solu <pb break="no"

                <p>The occurrence of reactions of this kind would in many cases involve an
                    absorption, but in others a development of heat. The only two substances
                    mentioned in the above table which develop heat to any extent when dissolved in
                    water, it will be seen, are magnesium and aluminium chlorides. Both of these,
                    however, are known to form compounds with water, and both probably enter to a
                    very considerable extent into reaction with it in the manner above pointed out.
                    It is even probable that the latter cannot exist as such when dissolved in
                    water; the development of so large an amount of heat is therefore readily
                    understood. But at present we are unable satisfactorily to account for the
                    difference observed between salts such as potassium and sodium iodides, which so
                    closely resemble each other in most respects, one of which, it will be noticed,
                    absorbs 5110 units, whilst the other develops 1220 units of heat when dissolved
                    in water.</p>
                <p>From this it will be obvious that the study of the condition of salts in solution
                    is beset with difficulties; the thermochemical method of investigation appears
                    in most cases to be the only one which is applicable, since the introduction of
                    new substances at once introduces a new set of conditions, but on account of the
                    compIexity of the phenomena attending dissolution, even the results obtained by
                    this method possess only a limited value, and at present only general
                    conclusions can be drawn from them.</p>
                <p>Water, as we have already stated, enters into combination with oxides of many of
                    the elements, forming two classes of compounds,—the acids, and the metallic
                    hydroxides or hydrates. The general properties and relations of these two
                    classes of compounds may with advantage now be discussed.</p>
                <p>The monoxides of the highly positive monad elements caesium, rubidium, potassium,
                    sodium, and lithium form with water easily soluble hydroxides, which cannot be
                    decomposed by heat; their solutions are soapy to the touch, and restore the blue
                    colour to vegetable infusions which have been reddened by an acid. These
                    hydroxides are usually termed alkalies,—a solution which has the power of
                    restoring the blue colour to reddened litmus being said to exhibit an alkaline
                    reaction. The term <hi rend="italic">alkali</hi> is of Arabic origin, and was at
                    first given to the crude sodium carbonate obtained from the ashes of sea-weed, a
                    solution of which is soapy to the touch and restores the blue colour to reddened
                    litmus, and like the above-mentioned hydroxides also has powerful cleansing
                    properties.</p>
                <p>The hydroxides derived from the monoxides of barium, strontium, and calcium,
                    which are less positive elements, also exhibit an alkaline reaction, but they
                    are not nearly so soluble in water; and, with the exception of barium hydroxide,
                    they are decomposed on ignition, yielding the oxide and water. None of the
                    remaining positive elements, except thallium, furnish soluble hydroxides which
                    exhibit an alkaline reaction.</p>
                <p>Similar differences may be observed between the oxides of negative elements,
                    which furnish acids when combined with water. Thus, the monoxide of the highly
                    negative element chlorine readily dissolves in water, but the acid produced is
                    exceedingly unstable; similarly, the acids derived from the oxides of nitrogen
                    are soluble, but of low stability. The oxides of the less negative elements,
                    sulphur and phosphorus, however, furnish very soluble acids, which exhibit
                    considerable stability, being with difficulty resolved into the oxide and
                    water.</p>
                <p>The lower oxides of the most positive elements enter into combination with water
                    in such proportions as to produce compounds containing an equal number of atoms
                    of hydrogen and oxygen; for example, sodium monoxide and water furnish sodium
                    hydroxide—</p>
                <p>Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O + OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2NaOH;</p>
                <p>Sodium monoxide. Water. Sodium hydroxide.</p>
                <p>and barium oxide and water yield barium hydroxide—</p>
                <p>BaO 4- OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = BaO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> or Ba(OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Barium oxide. Water. Barium hydroxide.</p>
                <p>Hence these hydroxides may be looked upon as combinations of the respective
                    elements with the monad compound radicle (OH)' or hydroxyl; and the various
                    compounds obtained from the oxides of the remaining elements by the action of
                    water may either be regarded as similarly constituted, or may be viewed as
                    combinations of one or more OH groups with compound radicles formed by the union
                    of the elements with oxygen. Thus, we may regard nitric acid, HNO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, as a compound of the two monad radicles, (NO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>)'and (OH)'; sulphuric acid, H <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, as a combination of the dyad radicle
                    (SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) with two OH groups; and phosphoric acid, H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> PO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, as a combination
                    of the triad radicle (PO) with three monad hydroxyl groups.</p>
                <p>The number of OH groups which may be associated with a single atom of a given
                    simple radicle or element, or with a compound radicle, entirely depends upon the
                    nature of the radicle, but does not appear ever to exceed four; the stability of
                    the compound also varies with the radicle, the tendency to form stable compounds
                    with OH being the greater the more positive the radicle. In the case of
                    compounds of feebly positive radicles with several OH groups, there is always a
                    tendency for the elements of one or more molecules of water to separate from the
                    compound, thus producing a body which is to be regarded as <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n497/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0497-0486"/> a combination of one or more OH groups with
                    an oxygenated radicle. For instance, ferric hydroxide, Fe <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> (OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, very readily loses water, forming
                    compounds such as Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O(OH) <hi rend="subscript">
                        4</hi> and Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    (OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Nearly all the bodies produced by the action of water on the oxides of the
                    non-metals are to be regarded as compounds of oxygenated radicles with hydroxyl,
                    and are more or less acid in character. As a rule, the more negative the radicle
                    with which OH is associated the more powerful will be the acid, and since the
                    addition of oxygen to the radicle renders it more negative, the acid furnished
                    by the higher oxide of an element is usually more stable, and also a more
                    powerful acid, than that furnished by the lower oxide; thus, sulphurous acid, H
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is extremely
                    unstable as compared with sulphuric acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, and a much less powerful acid, but the former may
                    be regarded as a combination of the dyad radicle (SO), and the latter as a
                    combination of the dyad radicle (SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), with twice
                    the monad radicle (OH). The behaviour of the positive elements is exactly
                    complementary of this, since the greater the amount of the negative element
                    oxygen associated with them the less is the tendency to furnish corresponding
                    hydroxides when combined with water, and the less the stability of the resulting
                    hydroxides; and, as a rule, also the basic properties both of the oxides and of
                    the hydroxides corresponding to them become much less pronounced as the relative
                    proportion of oxygen increases.</p>
                <p>In all cases in which oxides unite with water to produce stable combinations,
                    much heat is developed; the stability of the compounds formed by the combination
                    of water with oxides, in fact, appears to be directly in proportion to the
                    amount of heat developed in their formation, and it has been shown that the
                    formation of many of the most unstable hydroxides from their elements would be
                    accompanied by an absorption of heat; hence their instability is readily
                    understood.</p>
                <p>When the hydroxides are added in sufficient quantity to solutions of the acids,
                    mostly neutral solutions are produced,—that is to say, solutions which do not
                    affect either blue or red litmus. The acid is then said to be neutralized by the
                    hydroxide, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> The basic oxides which furnish
                    hydroxides, and indeed the basic oxides generally, behave in a similar manner
                    with acids. In these cases a <hi rend="italic">salt</hi> is produced; thus, by
                    the addition of sodium hydroxide to sulphuric acid the salt sodium sulphate is
                    obtained—∙</p>
                <p>2NaOH + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> = Na <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + 2H <hi

                    sulphate. Water.</p>
                <p>Obviously, we may regard the salts produced in this manner as formed by the
                    displacement of the hydrogen of the acid by more or less positive elements or
                    simple radicles, and they may actually in many cases be prepared by the action
                    of the metals on the acids; for example—</p>
                <p>Zn + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> = H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + ZnSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> Zinc. Sulphuric
                    acid. Hydrogen. Zinc sulphate.</p>
                <p>They are also obtained, as we have seen, by the union of a more or less basic
                    with a more or less acid oxide. But a large number of salts are known derived
                    from the acids by the displacement of hydrogen by compound radicles; thus, many
                    of the salts of the element vanadium are formed by the introduction of the group
                    (V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) <hi
                        rend="superscript"> lv</hi>, which functions as a tetrad element, in place
                    of the hydrogen of acids, vanadyl sulphate being (V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) <hi rend="superscript"> ιv</hi> (SO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. The ammonium salts
                    are formed in a similar manner by the displacement of hydrogen in acids by the
                    monad compound radicle (N <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                        4</hi>)'. But the hydrogen of many hydroxides may also be displaced by
                    positive elements or radicles; for example, zinc hydroxide, although insoluble
                    in water, dissolves in solutions of the alkalies, and on heating metallic zinc
                    with a concentrated solution of potassium hydroxide, it dissolves with evolution
                    of hydrogen—</p>
                <p>Zn + 2HOK = Zn''(OK) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + H <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Zinc hydroxide and similar compounds, therefore, display both basic and acid
                    functions; and it is difficult to deny the compounds formed from them by
                    introducing positive elements in place of hydrogen the title of salts.</p>
                <p>Another class of oxy-salts are formed by the union of two different oxides of the
                    same element; the compounds of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine with
                    positive elements, and of acid with basic sulphides, are also termed salts, the
                    compounds of sulphur being distinguished as sulpho-salts or thio-salts, whilst
                    those of the four other elements are distinguished as haloid salts.</p>
                <p>From this it will be obvious that the term <hi rend="italic">salt</hi> is of very
                    wide application, and that it is almost impossible to define it in a few words.
                    It is also extremely diffi cult strictly to define an acid, for, although the
                    very greatest difference is observable between the compounds of the oxides of
                    highly negative and of highly positive elements with water, the differences
                    become less and less marked as we pass from one end of the series to the other.
                    The only definition which really separates bodies which are usually regarded as
                    true acids from hydroxides possessing acid properties is afforded by the fact
                    that, whilst the hydrogen in all hydroxides which exhibit basic properties may
                    be displaced by negative and also in some instances by positive radicles, the
                    hydrogen in acids can only be displaced by positive radicles. For example, the
                    hydrogen in zinc hydroxide may be displaced by the positive radicle potassium
                    and by the negative radicle NO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, but it is only
                    possible to displace the hydrogen in sulphuric acid by positive radicles. This
                    definition is not applicable, however, to organic acids.</p>
                <p>The extent to which hydrogen may be displaced in an acid by positive radicles is
                    termed its <hi rend="italic">basicity,</hi> an acid which contains a single atom
                    of displaceable hydrogen being termed monobasic, and acids containing two or
                    three atoms of displaceable hydrogen, dibasic or tribasic. On the other hand,
                    the hydroxides and basic oxides are frequently spoken of as monacid, diacid, or
                    triacid, &lt;fcc., according as they are capable of neutralizing a single
                    molecule, two, or three molecules of a monobasic acid; thus, sodium hydroxide is
                    monacid since a single molecule neutralizes a single molecule of monobasic
                    nitric acid, forming the salt sodium nitrate—</p>
                <p>NaOH + HNO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ≈ NaNO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + OH
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, Sodium hydroxide. Nitric acid. Sodium nitrate.
                    Water.</p>
                <p>and barium hydroxide is a diacid base since it neutralizes two molecules of
                    nitric acid—</p>
                <p>BaO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2HNO <hi

                    hydroxide. Nitric acid. Barium nitrate. Water.</p>
                <p>But we may also regard the salts formed by the action of acids on hydroxides as
                    derived from the latter by the displacement of hydrogen by negative compound
                    radicles,—sodium nitrate, for example, as sodium hydroxide in which the atom of
                    hydrogen has been displaced by the monad compound radicle NO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; hence we may define the acidity of hydroxides to
                    be the extent to which hydrogen may be displaced in them by negative
                    radicles.</p>
                <p>In polybasic acids, that is to say, in acids containing two or more atoms of
                    displaceable hydrogen, it is possible to displace the hydrogen step by step;
                    thus, by the addition of a single molecule of sodium hydroxide to a single
                    molecule of sulphuric acid, only one-half the hydrogen in the acid is
                    displaced—</p>

                <p>Salts derived from acids by the partial displacement of their hydrogen are termed
                        <hi rend="italic">acid</hi> salts, those in which the hydrogen displaceable
                    by metals is entirely displaced being termed <hi rend="italic">normal</hi>
                    salts. Similarly, when the hydrogen in polyacid hydroxides is entirely displaced
                    by negative radicles, normal salts are obtained, but when it is only partially
                    displaced the so-called <hi rend="italic">basic salts</hi> are produced, which
                    bear precisely the same relation to the hydroxides that the acid salts bear to

                <p>These sales are strictly comparable with the normal and two acid salts produced

                <p>Two explanations may be given of the constitution of the salts formed by
                    displacing the hydrogen in polybasic acids by polyad elements; the formula of
                    barium sulphate, for example, may be represented by either of the following
                    formulae :—</p>

                    according as it is supposed that two atoms of hydrogen in a single molecule of
                    the acid are displaced, or that two molecules of the acid are concerned in the
                    formation of the salt, one atom of hydrogen in each being displaced by each of
                    the barium atoms. There is not at present sufficient evidence to enable us to
                    decide definitively in favour of one or the other of these views, but the great
                    tendency which the polybasic acids exhibit to form double salts appears to
                    render the latter the more probable.</p>
                <p>The formation of salts by the action of acids on metallic oxides and hydroxides
                    is in all cases attended with a development of heat. This subject has been very
                    carefully studied by several chemists, especially by Thomsen, whose results for
                    a number of acids are given in the following tables. The amount of heat
                    developed in the reaction— __ <hi rend="subscript"> zatt</hi>. <hi

                <p>that is to say, on adding a solution of α molecules (in grammes) of sodium
                    hydroxide to a solution of one molecule (iu grammes) of the acid, represented by
                    Q,—is given for a number of acids in the first of the following tables. The
                    second table exhibits the amount of heat developed in the reaction—</p>
                <p>NaOHAq , αQAq; t.e., on adding a solution of one molecule of sodium hydroxide to
                    a solution of α molecules of the acid Q. Each molecule (in grammes) of sodium
                    hydroxide was dissolved in 200 molecules (in grammes) of water, and the
                    solutions of the acids were of equivalent strength; that is to say, the number
                    of grammes of acid required to form a normal salt with 23 + 16 + 1 or 40 grammes
                    of sodium hydroxide were dissolved in 18 × 200 or 3600 grammes of water. The
                    temperature at which the two solutions were mixed in all the experiments was
                    about 18° C. The results are expressed in hundreds of heat-units, and according
                    to Thomsen they may all be relied on within 1 per cent.</p>

                <p>From these tables it will be evident—(1), that when a molecule of sodium
                    hydroxide in aqueous solution enters into reaction with an acid, the heat
                    developed is very nearly proportional to the quantity of acid present until this
                    amounts to 1, ½, ½, or ∣ molecule, according as the acid is mono-, di-, tri-, or
                    tetrabasic; but that when the amount of acid added exceeds that requisite to
                    form the normal salt, the different acids behave differently, heat being in some
                    cases developed, and in others absorbed, according to the constitution of the
                    acid; and (2), that mostly when a molecule of an acid in aqueous solution enters
                    into reaction with sodium hydroxide, the amount of heat developed increases
                    almost in proportion to the amount of the latter, and until 1, 2, 3, or 4
                    molecules are added, according as the acid is mono-, di-, tri-, or tetrabasic;
                    the further addition of sodium hydroxide is not then attended with any
                    considerable development of heat.</p>
                <p>Very different amounts of heat, it will be observed, are developed on
                    neutralizing the different acids, but there is mostly a remarkable similarity in
                    the results obtained in the case of acids which from chemical evidence are known
                    to be closely allied. Thus, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, and hydriodic acids
                    exhibit the same heat of neutralization; and the numbers for sulphuric and
                    selenic acids, and for phosphoric and arsenic acids, are very similar.
                    Hydrofluoric acid, it will be seen, differs considerably from the allied
                    monobasic acids since the addition of the first half molecule of sodium
                    hydroxide produces less heat than the second, which is not improbably owing to
                    the formation of the acid salt HF <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Na; it differs
                    also by its high heat of neutralization.</p>
                <p>The tables show also that the dibasic acids may be divided into several groups,
                    according to the amounts of heat developed on the addition of the first and
                    second molecules of sodium hydroxide. The first group includes hydrofluosilicic
                    and hydrochloroplatinic acids, the amount of heat developed by the second
                    molecule of hydroxide being equal to that developed on the addition of the first
                    molecule. The second group includes sulphuric, selenic, oxalic, and tartaric
                    acids; with these acids less heat is developed by the first than by the second
                    molecule; thus :—</p>

                <p>These differences which acids of the same basicity exhibit when submitted to
                    thermochemical investigation correspond to differences in their chemical
                    behaviour. For example, when a solution of citric acid is neutralized with
                    sodium carbonate and evaporated to crystallization, the trisodium salt Na <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 5</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> is readily obtained,
                    but when a solution of phosphoric or arsenic acid is similarly treated, the
                    disodium salt Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> HPO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>
                    or Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> HAsO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> is formed;
                    the trisodium salts of these acids can only be procured by adding sodium
                    hydroxide. Apparently the trisodium salts of phosphoric and arsenic acids are
                    partially decomposed by water, as their solutions are strongly alkaline; hence
                    the third molecule of hydroxide does not effect the complete conversion of the
                    di-into the tri-sodium salt. The behaviour of sulphuric acid will be discussed
                    later on.</p>
                <p>All soluble hydroxides when in solution appear to have nearly the same heat of

                <p>Thomsen, however, considers that the differences between the amounts of heat
                    developed when these hydroxides are dissolved in acids, and when soluble
                    hydroxides are neutralized, are due to the heat absorbed in rendering them
                    soluble; or in other words, that solutions of these hydroxides would have the
                    same heat of neutralization as solutions of soluble hydroxides.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting results of the thermochemical investigation of the
                    behaviour of acids with metallic hydroxides is the proof that when sodium
                    hydroxide, for example, is added to a mixture of two acids in insufficient
                    quantity to neutralize both, the sodium salts of the two acids are seldom formed
                    in the proportions in which the two acids are mixed. Thus, when a solution of 2
                    molecules of sodium hydroxide is mixed with a solution containing two molecules
                    of monobasic nitric acid and one molecule of dibasic sulphuric acid, two-thirds
                    of the sodium hydroxide enter into reaction with the nitric acid and one-third
                    with the sulphuric acid. The avidity, as it is termed by Thomsen, of nitric acid
                    to enter into reaction with sodium hydroxide is thus twice as great as that of
                    sulphuric acid. The avidity of hydrochloric acid for sodium hydroxide is equal
                    to that of nitric acid, but the avidities of hydrobromic, hydriodic, and
                    hydrofluoric acids are less than that of hydrochloric acid in the proportion

                <p>In concluding this brief account of the thermochemical behaviour of some of the
                    acids and hydroxides, we may observe that the interpretation of most of the
                    remarkable results to which we have alluded has not been given. The study of
                    this branch of chemistry is yet in its infancy, and is beset with difficulties,
                    but its importance can scarcely be exaggerated. At present we scarcely know more
                    than that in the formation of a given substance a certain amount of heat is
                    finally developed or absorbed, but in most cases we are ignorant of the value of
                    one or more of the several distinct operations which we believe are involved in
                    the reaction by which it is produced, so that the results given by different
                    substances cannot as a rule be satisfactorily compared.</p>
                <p>Many substances belonging to all classes of chemical compounds unite with water,
                    forming combinations from which it may be again expelled by the application of a
                    greater or less degree of heat, and from the circumstance that many of these
                    combinations are crystalline, the water is said to be present in the form of <hi
                        rend="italic">water of crystallization.</hi> Thus, potassium hydroxide
                    crystallizes with 2 molecules of water, as KHO + 2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    O; copper sulphate with <hi rend="italic">5</hi> molecules, as CuSO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + 5H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O; and sodium
                    sulphate with 7 and with 10 molecules. The water may usually be expelled from
                    these compounds by the application of a gentle heat, and many salts part with
                    their water of crystallization on exposure to the air; but others are not
                    deprived of it, or more than a part, unless very strongly heated. Copper
                    sulphate, for example, readily loses 4 of the 5 molecules of water with which it
                    combines, but the remaining molecule is only expelled by heating to about 200°
                    C.; 5 of the 7 molecules of water in crystallized magnesium sulphate are readily
                    removed, and the sixth is expelled at about 150° C., but the seventh is retained
                    at 200° C.</p>
                <p>The compounds containing water of crystallization are usually denied the title of
                        <hi rend="italic">atomic</hi> compounds ordinarily applied to combinations
                    of two or more elements in which it is supposed the constituent atoms are all
                    associated in a single molecule under the influence of the force which has
                    received the name of chemical affinity, and in contradistinction are termed <hi
                        rend="italic">molecular</hi> compounds, being regarded as combinations of
                    two or more separate molecules. This, although perhaps true of many of the
                    compounds containing water of crystallization, is certainly not true of all, and
                    notably of the sulphates which are only deprived of their water by heating to
                    high temperatures.</p>

                <p>This compound cannot be obtained directly from its elements, but there appears to
                    be little doubt that it may be formed by the combination of oxygen with water,
                    since it is produced in many cases of slow oxidation in presence of water, and
                    particularly in processes where ozone is formed. It is produced in small
                    quantity when water is decomposed by an electric current, especially when small
                    electrodes are employed. Its formation in this manner may be regarded as an
                    oxidation of water, but it has been suggested that it is the direct product of
                    electrolysis, and that the oxygen evolved is a secondary product derived from
                    the decomposition of the hydrogen dioxide; thus—</p>

                <p>Barium dioxide. Hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen dioxide. Barium chloride.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen dioxide or peroxide is an exceedingly unstable substance, and readily
                    decomposes even in aqueous solution into water and oxygen, especially on
                    heating. The solution is more stable if slightly acid. A dilute solution may be
                    concentrated by evaporation in vacuo over sulphuric acid, and hydrogen dioxide
                    was obtained in this manner by its discoverer Thénard as a colourless
                    transparent liquid, of specific gravity 1 ’ 452, which did not freeze at - 30°
                    C.; it is doubtful, however, whether it has ever been prepared quite free from
                    water. It did not redden litmus, but had a harsh bitter taste; when placed upon
                    the hand it instantly turned the cuticle white.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen dioxide exhibits the closest resemblance to ozone. Thus, it is
                    decomposed by mere contact with finely-divided metals, such as silver, gold, and
                    platinum, with evolution of oxygen. Like ozone it is a powerful reducing agent,
                    entering into reaction with silver oxide, for example, to form water, oxygen,
                    and metallic silver :—</p>

                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O + 2Ag + O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>According to Fairley, about 37,000 units of heat are developed in the production
                    of 32 grammes of oxygen by this reaction, which thus affords further proof of
                    the strength of the affinity of oxygen for oxygen, as probably the heat
                    developed is chiefly, if not entirely, due to the combination of the oxygen
                    atoms. Many other oxides are reduced by it, either to the metallic state or to
                    lower oxides, oxygen being evolved and water produced.</p>
                <p>But hydrogen dioxide is also a powerful oxidizing agent. Thus, it decolorizes a
                    solution of indigo; it converts sulphurous acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, into sulphuric acid, H <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>; lead sulphide, PbS, into lead
                    sulphate, PbSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>; and many oxides into higher oxides.
                    It decomposes a solution of hydriodic acid with separation of iodine :—</p>
                <p>H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2HI = 2H <hi

                <p>With the aid of this reaction an important series of experiments to ascertain the
                    connection between the con <pb break="no"

                    have been made by Harcourt and Esson. The experiments consisted in adding
                    successive equal portions of sodium hyposulphite to a solution containing
                    hydrogen dioxide, hydriodic acid, and a little starch. By this reagent the
                    iodine which is continually being liberated by the action of the dioxide on the
                    hydriodic acid is instantly reconverted into iodide, so that the liquid, though
                    it contain starch, and though iodine is being formed in it, remains quite
                    colourless as long as any hyposulphite is present. But when the last trace of
                    hyposulphite has been removed by the action of the iodine, the portion of iodine
                    next formed remains free, and the liquid becomes suddenly blue. The addition of
                    another small portion of hyposulphite again removes the colour, and until all
                    the hyposulphite is decomposed the solution remains colourless, and then again
                    becomes suddenly blue. The intervals at which the blue colour appeared were
                    carefully noted, and the amount of hydrogen dioxide decomposed being known from
                    the amount of hyposulphite employed, the quantity of dioxide decomposed in a
                    given time was thus determined. The observed results are given in the following

                <p>The general conclusion deducible from these experiments is, that the amount of
                    change at any moment varies directly with the amount of dioxide present in the
                    solution; iu accordance with this law, the quantities of dioxide at the end of a
                    series of times taken in arithmetical progression are themselves in geometrical
                    progression. This law of chemical action has been corroborated by the
                    investigation of other reactions, and it is probably of very general
                    application.</p>

                    their salts to a solution of hydrogen dioxide.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen dioxide, it will be evident, differs remarkably from hydrogen monoxide
                    or water. Its instability, and its tendency to enter into reaction with other
                    bodies with separation of oxygen, appear to be explained by the fact that its
                    decomposition into water and oxygen is attended with the development of a very
                    considerable amount of heat. The behaviour of ozone and hydrogen dioxide, in
                    fact, strikingly illustrates one of the most important laws of chemical action,
                    viz., that those decompositions and reactions which are attended with the
                    development of heat always take place more readily than those which require an
                    absorption of heat, and they take place the more readily the greater the amount
                    of heat which is liberated. The heat developed by the decomposition of ozone and
                    hydrogen dioxide, we have seen, is to be traced to the same cause, being due, it
                    can scarcely be doubted, to the combination of the oxygen atoms.</p>

                <p>These four elements form with metals compounds analogous to sea salt, and from
                    this circumstance the name halogens, or salt-producers (from αλs, sea-salt), has
                    been applied to them, their compounds with other radicles being frequently
                    termed haloid compounds. They are always classed together on account of their
                    close analogy in properties, but there are numerous and very important
                    distinctions between them.</p>
                <p>The element fluorine is not known in the free state, all attempts to isolate it
                    having failed on account of the impossibility of obtaining vessels which can
                    withstand its action. Chlorine is a gas of a greenish yellow colour, whilst
                    bromine, at ordinary atmospheric temperatures, is a mobile red liquid, so deep
                    in colour as to be almost opaque, and iodine is a black, crystalline, and very
                    brittle solid, which exhibits metallic lustre.</p>
                <p>None of these elements are ever met with in the free state, but their compounds
                    are very widely distributed, and they are to be detected in most rocks and
                    soils, in spring and sea-water, and in the ashes of plants and animals. Fluorine
                    occurs most abundantly in combination with calcium as fluor-spar, and chlorine
                    in combination with sodium as ordinary salt, large deposits of which exist in
                    various parts of the globe; considerable deposits of bromine in combination with
                    potassium have within recent years been discovered in Stassfurt, but no abundant
                    source of iodine has hitherto been discovered.</p>
                <p>Chlorine was discovered by Scheele in 1774, and was so named on account of its
                    colour (from χλωρός, green), but its elementary nature was first established by
                    Davy in 1810. Bromine was first described in 1826 by Balard, who obtained it
                    from <hi rend="italic">bittern,</hi> the mother liquor of seawater, after the
                    less soluble salts have been extracted by evaporation and crystallization; it
                    was named on account of its irritating odour (from <hi rend="italic"
                        >βρώμας,</hi> a stench). Iodine was discovered by Courtois in 1811, in the
                    waste liquors from the manufacture of sodium carbonate from the ashes of
                    sea-weed; it received its name from the beautiful violet colour of its vapour
                    (ioeιδι)v, violet-coloured).</p>
                <p>Chlorine is usually prepared, both in the laboratory and on the large scale, by
                    gently heating a concentrated solution of hydrochloric acid with manganese
                    dioxide; the reaction appears to take place in two stages,—the first consisting
                    in the formation of the manganese chloride corresponding to manganese
                    dioxide—</p>
                <p>MnO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 4HC1 = MnCl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + 2H

                <p>but this compound is so unstable that it breaks up into chlorine and a lower
                    chloride of manganese—</p>

                    first produced by the action of the sulphuric acid on the salt—</p>

                <p>The hydrochloric acid then enters into reaction with the manganese dioxide, as
                    explained above, but the manganese dichloride is converted into manganese
                    sulphate and hydrochloric acid by the sulphuric acid. The following equation
                    therefore expresses the final result, but does not take into account that there
                    are several stages in the reaction—</p>

                <p>Bromine and iodine are obtained in a precisely similar manner by treating the
                    liquid containing the bromide or iodide with manganese dioxide and sulphuric
                    acid.</p>
                <p>Another process for the manufacture of chlorine has been recently introduced by
                    Deacon, which consists in passing a mixture of hydrochloric acid gas and air
                    through a heated brickwork chamber filled with pieces of firebrick or marble
                    which have been soaked in a solution of copper sulphate and dried. The hydrogen
                    of the hydrochloric acid forms water with the oxygen of the air, and chlorine is
                    liberated, but the precise nature of the changes by which this is effected is
                    not known. The reaction is at its maximum at a temperature of about 500° C.,
                    which is much below that at which oxygen alone acts upon hydrochloric acid to
                    form water and chlorine; the copper sulphate is but little affected, although a
                    certain amount is always transformed into chloride. There can be no doubt,
                    however, that the decomposition is the result of recurrent action, and another
                    somewhat similar method of obtaining chlorine may be quoted in illustration.
                    Thus, when a mixture of silica and sodium chloride is heated to redness in a
                    current of oxygen, chlorine is evolved, and the chloride is converted into
                    silicate—</p>
                <p>2SiO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 4NaCl .+ O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2N
                        <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> a <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SiO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 2C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>;</p>
                <p>Silica. Sodium chloride. Oxygen. Sodium silicate, chlorine.</p>
                <p>but on passing hydrochloric acid gas over the silicate it is re-converted into
                    the chloride and silica—</p>
                <p>Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SiO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 2HC1 = SiO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2NaCl + OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Sodium
                    silicate. Hydrochloric acid. Silica. Sodium chloride. Water.</p>
                <p>Hence, by passing hydrochloric acid together with air over the mixture of silica
                    and chloride, a continuous evolution of chlorine is obtained, reaction in the
                    one direction having no sooner taken place than reaction in the opposite
                    direction sets in. There can be little doubt that the production of chlorine by
                    Deacon’s process is, in a similar manner, the result of a series of changes in
                    opposite directions, the nature of which, however, remains to be discovered.</p>
                <p>Chlorine is very readily condensed by a pressure of about 4 atmospheres at 15°
                    C., or by cold alone at about — 50° C., into a yellow mobile liquid of specific
                    gravity about 1 ∙33, but it has not been solidified. Bromine has at 0° C. the
                    specific gravity 3T 88; it boils at 59 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 5 C.,
                    yielding a dense red vapour, and solidifies at - 24° ∙5 C. Iodine melts at 107°
                    C., and boils at about 175° C., yielding a magnificent purple vapour. Chlorine
                    gas and the vapour of bromine and iodine have a pungent, irritating,
                    disagreeable odour, and are irrespirable. Water at 10° C. dissolves about 2‘5
                    times its bulk of chlorine, and about 3 per cent, of bromine, but iodine is very
                    sparingly soluble in water. "When chlorine is passed into a mixture of crushed

                    is united with a single atom of the halogen, viz. :—</p>

                <p>The conditions under which hydrogen and chlorine enter into reaction have already
                    been described, and we have seen that no change of volume occurs in the
                    formation of hydrogen chloride from its elements. A mixture of hydrogen and
                    bromine vapour does not explode on the application of flame, but hydrobromic
                    acid is slowly formed when the mixture is heated; hydriodic acid is also

                    at ordinary atmospheric temperatures are colourless transparent gases, which

                    chloride is condensed to a colourless liquid of specific gravity 1 *27, but it
                    has never been solidified; hydro-, gen bromide and iodide are still more readily

                <p>their general behaviour, show that the affinity of chlorine for hydrogen is much
                    greater than that of bromine, whilst that of bromine is greater than that of
                    iodine; and as already pointed out (p. 475), a considerable amount of heat is
                    developed in the formation of hydrogen chloride, but a less amount in the
                    formation of hydrogen bromide, and the production of hydrogen iodide from its
                    elements involves the absorption of heat. We have seen, however, that the heat
                    developed or absorbed in the formation of these compounds cannot be regarded as
                    an absolute measure of the affinity of chlorine, bromine, and iodine for
                    hydrogen, since there is an expenditure of energy due to the change of state,
                    the three compounds being gases, but one being formed from two gases, the second
                    from a gas and a liquid, and the third from a gas and a solid. Moreover, as we
                    believe that the molecules which enter into reaction consist each of two atoms,
                    the combination of the dissimilar atoms to form molecules of hydrogen chloride,
                    bromide, and iodide must be preceded by the separation of the similar atoms
                    which constitute the molecules of hydrogen, and of chlorine, bromine, and
                    iodine, and there must be an expenditure of energy to effect this separation; it
                    appears probable that different amounts of energy are expended in separating the
                    atoms of chlorine, of bromine, and of iodine from each other, and we may further
                    assume as probable that the amount of energy expended in the separation of the
                    atoms is greater in the case of chlorine than of bromine, and greater in the
                    case of bromine than of iodine, although at present there is scarcely any
                    experimental evidence which enables us to draw conclusions of any value in proof
                    of this.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen fluoride is miscible with water in all proportions, and much heat is
                    developed on mixing the two substances; hydrogen chloride, bromide, and iodide
                    are also extremely soluble in water, forming colourless strongly acid solutions.
                    Water at 0° C. absorbs ’ 825 of its own weight, or about 492 times its bulk, of
                    hydrogen chloride gas, increasing in volume about one-third, and acquiring a
                    density of about 1’23. This saturated solution consists of hydrogen chloride and
                    water in about the proportions indicated by the formula HC1 + 3H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O; it fumes strongly, and when heated it gives off
                    hydrogen chloride until at 112° C. a more dilute solution distils over,
                    corresponding approximately in composition with the formula HC1 + 8H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. A weaker solution when heated parts with water
                    until it acquires this composition, and then distils unchanged. In like manner,
                    a solution containing about 48 per cent, of hydrogen bromide distils unchanged
                    at 125° C., and a solution containing about 57 per cent, of hydrogen iodide
                    boils constantly at 127° C.; these solutions correspond approximately in
                    composition with the formulae HBr + 5H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O and 2HI +
                    11H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. A solution of hydrogen fluoride

                    unchanged at 120° C. Roscoe’s experiments have shown, however, that the
                    composition of these solutions varies with the pressure, and that there exists
                    for each pressure a solution of corresponding strength which undergoes no change
                    in composition when distilled under this pressure, and therefore has a constant
                    boiling point. Hence, the apparent constancy of composition cannot be regarded
                    as proof of the existence of a definite hydrate corresponding in composition to
                    that of the solutions obtained on distilling under a given pressure. There is no
                    evidence, however, to invalidate, but much to support the conclusion that the
                    haloid acids do not dissolve in water as such, but that they form definite
                    hydrates; and if it be admitted that their solutions contain definite hydrates,
                    their behaviour is precisely similar to that of other compounds which decompose
                    when heated, but furnish products which can reunite to form the parent

                <p>The development of so large an amount of heat, although, doubtless, in a great
                    measure arising from the change from the gaseous to the liquid state, may be
                    regarded as evidence that the acids really enter into combination with water,
                    and are not merely dissolved; it may be noticed also that the same amounts of
                    heat are developed in dissolving hydrogen bromide and iodide, and that their
                    solutions, which under the ordinary atmospheric pressure distil unchanged, have

                <p>Solutions of hydrogen chloride and bromide may be preserved unchanged, but the
                    solution of hydrogen iodide gradually becomes brown, especially on exposure to
                    light, owing to the separation of iodine, the hydrogen being oxidized by the

                    which have a tendency to enter into reaction with oxygen, water is often readily
                    decomposed in this manner by chlorine and bromine without the aid of light, but
                    iodine seldom effects this change; thus, on passing chlorine into a solution of
                    sulphurous acid, the latter is oxidized to sulphuric acid—</p>

                    powerfully by bromine, is in most cases the result of a similar change, the
                    substance bleached being usually one which has a tendency to enter into reaction
                    with oxygen.</p>
                <p>Chlorine readily displaces bromine and iodine from their compounds with hydrogen
                    and other elements, and, similarly, bromine displaces iodine; indeed the
                    affinity of chlorine for other elements, with few exceptions, is superior to
                    that of bromine, the affinity of bromine being in like manner superior to that
                    of iodine. The decomposition of many chlorine compounds by the corresponding
                    bromine and iodine compounds, and of bromine compounds by the corresponding
                    iodine compounds, would appear at first sight to be in contradiction to this
                    statement, but on examination of all such reactions it is found that they
                    involve a development of heat, and therefore are perfectly normal in character.
                    For example, silver chloride is converted into silver iodide by digestion with
                    an aqueous solution of hydriodic acid—</p>
                <p>AgCl + HI = AgI + HCl.</p>
                <p>It will be obvious that, in a molecule of silver iodide and a molecule of
                    hydrogen chloride, the same quantity of the same elements is present as in a
                    molecule of silver chloride and of a molecule of hydrogen iodide. But in the
                    formation of the latter system from its elements, less heat is developed than in
                    the formation of the former; hence reaction in the direction indicated by the
                    above equation is attended with the development of heat. Thus, in the formation

                <p>Exact comparative observations of the degrees of readiness with which the various
                    metals evolve hydrogen from a solution of hydrogen chloride have not as yet been
                    made, but from ordinary observations it appears that those act most readily
                    which develop the greatest amount of heat when dissolved. It is very difficult
                    to compare the behaviour of different metals, however, since minute quantities
                    of impurity exert a most remarkable influence; thus, ordinary zinc and iron
                    dissolve with the greatest readiness in a dilute solution of hydrogen chloride,
                    but the pure metals are only slowly dissolved.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen bromide and iodide closely resemble hydrogen chloride in their behaviour
                    with metals; mercury, however, which is not affected by hydrogen chloride or
                    bromide, slowly dissolves in hydrogen iodide. Hydrogen fluoride not only acts
                    with great readiness upon all metals which are dissolved by the other haloid
                    acids, but likewise on many which these acids do not attack,—copper and silver,
                    for example; and it also dissolves many elements which are insoluble in all
                    other acids, such as silicon, boron, titanium, tantalum, and zirconium, with
                    evolution of hydrogen. Gore has shown that anhydrous liquid hydrogen fluoride
                    and chloride are, in most cases, much less energetic in their chemical reactions
                    than their aqueous solutions; this is probably because the products which are
                    formed in the first instance, being insoluble or difficultly soluble in the
                    acid, form a coating on the surface of the substance submitted to the action of
                    the acid, and thus preserve it from further action, or cause the action to take
                    place more slowly; when water is present the product is dissolved, and thus a
                    fresh surface is continually exposed.</p>
                <p>The haloid acids readily enter into reaction with most metallic oxides, forming
                    water and the corresponding compound of the metal with the halogen; thus—</p>

                <p>Hydrogen fluoride is capable of dissolving some oxides, such as silica, SiO <hi

                    haloid acids. It is in consequence easily distinguished from the other haloid
                    acids by the powerful corrosive action which it exerts on glass.</p>
                <p>The haloid acids also readily enter into reaction with, or neutralize, the
                    hydroxides, forming water and the corresponding fluoride, chloride, bromide, or
                    iodide—</p>

                    behaviour of hydrochloric acid with hydroxides has already been discussed.</p>
                <p>Chlorine enters into reaction with many of the elements at ordinary atmospheric
                    temperatures, and with all of them, with few exceptions, at more or less
                    elevated temperatures; its union with phosphorus, and with finely divided
                    arsenic, antimony, tin, and copper, is attended with combustion. Bromine and
                    iodine closely resemble chlorine in their behaviour with other elements; the
                    union of bromine with other elements, however, appears always to take place less
                    readily, and to be accompanied by the development of less heat than is the case
                    with chlorine, and the affinity of iodine for most other elements is still
                    weaker than that of bromine. The iodides also are usually less stable than the
                    corresponding bromides, which are usually less stable than the corresponding
                    chlorides. The compounds of the halogens with metals and with positive elements
                    generally are mostly stable in presence of water, but their compounds with
                    negative elements are mostly decomposed by water, and the halogen separated in
                    the form of haloid acid.</p>
                <p>The same element does not always enter into combination with chlorine, bromine,
                    and iodine in the same proportions; thus, phosphorus forms a stable trichloride,
                    PC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and an unstable pentachloride, PC1 <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 5</hi>; a stable tribromide, PBr <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi>, and a pentabromide, PBr <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, less stable
                    than the pentachloride; but with iodine it forms the compounds PI <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> and P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> I <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. Many elements furnish compounds with fluorine
                    containing a higher proportion of fluorine than corresponds to the amount of
                    chlorine in their highest chlorides, or they form stable fluorides but unstable
                    chlorides, bromides, and iodides; for example, phosphorus pentafluoride, PF <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, is not decomposed by heat, whereas the
                    pentachloride, PC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, is readily resolved into the
                    trichloride and chlorine by heating.</p>
                <p>The halogens do not only combine with hydrogen and other elements, however, but
                    they are capable of forming compounds with each other. Thus, by the action of
                    iodine on silver fluoride, Gore has obtained iodine pentafluoride, IF <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, as a colourless highly volatile liquid; iodine at
                    once enters into reaction with chlorine, and is first converted into liquid
                    iodine chloride, ICI, but ultimately yields iodine trichloride, IC1 <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, which is a crystalline solid; with bromine iodine
                    appears to furnish only a liquid monobromide, IBr. In like manner, bromine forms
                    with chlorine a liquid bromine chloride, BrCl.</p>
                <p>On account of its great affinity for hydrogen, chlorine readily enters into
                    reaction with a large number of hydrogenized carbon compounds, and displaces the
                    hydrogen more or less completely. Thus, methane, CH <hi rend="subscript">
                    4</hi>, when submitted to the action of chlorine, is successively converted into
                    monochloromethane, CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> C1, dichloromethane, CH <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, trichloromethane,
                    CHC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and tetrachloromethane, CC1 <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>,—the displaced hydrogen being evolved as hydrogen
                    chloride. Bromine behaves similarly, but enters into such reactions much less
                    readily; iodine seldom, if ever, behaves in this way.</p>

                <p>Oxides of fluorine are unknown, and the oxides of the remaining halogens are very
                    imperfectly investigated. Three oxides of chlorine have been prepared, viz.

                    anhydride. peroxide.</p>
                <p>At ordinary temperatures these compounds are greenish-yellow gases, remarkable on
                    account of their instability, being decomposed with explosive violence by very
                    slight elevations of temperature. Their instability is accounted for by the
                    circumstance that their decomposition is attended with the development of a very
                    considerable amount of heat; thus, according to Thomsen, the formation of
                    gaseous hypochlorous anhydride from its elements would involve the absorption of
                    18,040 units of heat per molecule, and consequently this amount is developed
                    when the anhydride is resolved into its elements. The explanation of the
                    absorption of heat in the formation of the oxides of chlorine would appear to be
                    that more energy must be expended in separating the atoms of oxygen from each
                    other, and in separating the atoms of chlorine from each other, than is produced
                    by the combination of the chlorine and oxygen atoms.</p>
                <p>Oxides of bromine are also unknown, and since thermochemical investigation has
                    shown that oxygen has less affinity to bromine than to chlorine, their
                    non-formation in reactions corresponding to those by which the oxides of
                    chlorine are produced is no longer surprising.</p>
                <p>Iodine differs entirely from chlorine and bromine with regard to its affinity for
                    oxygen. Only one oxide of iodine is known, viz., iodic anhydride, I <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, but this is a white
                    crystalline substance of considerable stability, and, according to Thomsen’s
                    determination, the formation of this compound from its elements would involve
                    the <hi rend="italic">development</hi> of no less than 44,860 units of heat per
                    molecule. It has not been directly produced from its elements, although its
                    formation in this manner is not improbable.</p>
                <p>Chlorous anhydride is prepared by passing dry chlorine gas over dry mercuric
                    oxide—</p>

                <p>It may be condensed by surrounding the receiver with a mixture of ice and salt,
                    aud thus obtained as a deep red liquid which emits a vapour of a deeper colour
                    than that of chlorine, having a peculiar suffocating chlorous smell. It is with
                    the greatest readiness decomposed into chlorine and oxygen, the warmth of the
                    hand being sufficient to cause it to explode. Water dissolves about 200 times
                    its bulk of the gas, forming a pale yellow solution of hypochlorous acid, which
                    has an acid but not sour taste—</p>

                <p>By neutralizing this solution with metallic hydroxides or carbonates
                    corresponding metallic hypochlorites are formed, but these salts are usually
                    prepared by passing chlorine into water in which the metallic hydroxide or
                    carbonate is suspended or dissolved, the liquid being carefully cooled—</p>

                <p>A concentrated solution of hypochlorous acid decomposes rapidly, even when kept
                    in ice; a dilute solution is more stable, but is decomposed by boiling into
                    chloric acid, water, chlorine, and oxygen. These substances are probably the
                    products of several distinct changes, such as are represented by the following
                    equations—</p>

                <p>Hypochlorous acid, however, readily decomposes hydrochloric acid, and the
                    chlorine produced is probably the result uf reaction between these bodies—</p>
                <p>HC1 + HOC1 = C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + OH <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Hypochlorous acid is a very powerful oxidizing agent, and rapidly converts many
                    of the elements into their highest oxides, at the same time liberating chlorine;
                    indeed, in many respects it is not unlike ozone and hydrogen dioxide in its
                    chemical behaviour, and it enters into reaction with the latter in the manner
                    represented by the equation—</p>
                <p>HOC1 + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + HC1 + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O.</p>
                <p>Like chlorine, it possesses powerful bleaching properties. The hypochlorites also
                    act as bleaching agents, probably by yielding oxygen to the substance submitted
                    to their action, but less powerfully than the free acid.</p>
                <p>The bleaching powder or chloride of lime of commerce is prepared by exposing
                    slaked lime or calcium hydroxide to the action of chlorine gas. There has been
                    much discussion among chemists as to the constitution of the compound so
                    produced, and it is only quite recently that evidence has been obtained which
                    enables us to pronounce a decision. The composition of bleaching powder is
                    represented by the formula CaCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, whereas calcium
                    hypochlorite would be represented by the formula CaCl <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> j it was therefore supposed that the
                    bleaching powder was a mixture of calcium chloride and calcium hypochlorite,
                    since CaCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + CaCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2CaCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O.
                    Apparently, however, it is a distinct compound intermediate between calcium
                    chloride and calcium hypochlorite, thus—</p>

                <p>Solutions of hypochlorites are very unstable, and when boiled they furnish a

                <p>It is on this account that it is necessary in preparing hypochlorites to act on a
                    cold solution of the hydroxide, since if the solution be heated chlorate is
                    formed by the decomposition of the hypochlorite.</p>
                <p>The chlorates are very stable compounds as compared with the hypochlorites. They
                    may be obtained well crystallized, and are all soluble in water. They are
                    destitute of bleaching properties. The most important chlorate is potassium
                    chlorate, KC1O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, which is chiefly interesting as a
                    source of oxygen, and is largely employed in the manufacture of fireworks; the
                    resolution of this salt into oxygen and potassium chloride is attended with a
                    development of heat amounting to 9700 units per molecule decomposed.</p>

                <p>Chloric acid has a faint chlorous odour, and a powerfully acid reaction; it is
                    instantly decomposed by contact with organic matter, with charring, and
                    frequently even with ignition. In diffused daylight it gradually undergoes
                    spontaneous decomposition, and when heated to a little above 100° C. it is
                    rapidly converted into perchloric acid, water, chlorine, and oxygen—</p>

                <p>It is a powerful oxidizing and bleaching agent.</p>
                <p>Chloric acid serves for the preparation of the remaining oxides and oxy-acids of
                    chlorine. To prepare chlorous anhydride from it, 10 parts of pure benzene are
                    dissolved in 100 parts of concentrated sulphuric acid, and when the mixture has
                    cooled 12 parts of pulverized potassium chlorate are added. The chloric acid
                    liberated from the chlorate under these circumstances is deprived of a portion
                    of its oxygen by the benzene, which is oxidized, and at the same time, by the
                    dehydrating influence exercised by the sulphuric acid, the elements of a
                    molecule of water are removed and chlorous anhydride is liberated; thus— 2HC1O,
                    - O., - OIL = Cl.,O.,.</p>
                <p>The mixture is heated to about 50° C. in a flask having a delivery tube fitted to
                    its neck by grinding, and blown out in several places into small bulbs; the gas,
                    after passing through water contained in these bulbs, is conducted into a glass
                    tube surrounded by a mixture of ice and salt. The condensed liquid deposits
                    crystals of a hydrate of chlorous acid, and the supernatant liquid decanted
                    immediately into a small cooled glass cylinder forms the nearly anhydrous oxide
                    C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. Liquid chlorous
                    oxide or anhydride thus obtained is very mobile, is of a deep red colour, and
                    has a specific gravity of 1*330 to 1 ’ 387 at 0° C.; it boils a little above 0°
                    C., and it explodes somewhat readily at a few degrees above 0° C. The specific
                    gravity of the gaseous oxide accords with that required by the formula C1 <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. Chlorous anhydride
                    is not very soluble in water, 100 grammes of water at 23° C. dissolving 5 ’ 65
                    grammes of the oxide (Brandau). The solution of chlorous acid, HC1O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, thus obtained, has powerful bleaching and
                    oxidizing properties; when it is heated, chloric and hydrochloric acids are
                    formed and chlorine evolved. By neutralizing the solution with hydroxides of the
                    alkali or alkaline earth metals corresponding chlorites are obtained, which are
                    soluble; and from these the insoluble chlorites of lead and silver are obtained
                    by double decomposition. Chlorites are decomposed by the feeblest acids, even by
                    carbonic acid.</p>
                <p>When fused potassium chlorate is carefully treated with concentrated sulphuric
                    acid, chlorine dioxide or peroxide is evolved; the reaction by which it is
                    produced, it is stated, is represented by the following equation—</p>

                <p>The so-called <hi rend="italic">cuchlorine</hi> gas, which is obtained when a
                    mixture of a chlorate and hydrochloric acid is gently heated, appears to be a
                    mixture of chlorine peroxide with chlorine. Chlorine peroxide is gaseous at
                    ordinary temperatures, but by means of a mixture of ice and salt it may be
                    condensed to a red liquid. It has a deep greenish-yellow colour, and peculiar
                    sweet chlorous odour; a slight degree of heat and mere contact with organic
                    matters at once determine its explosion. Like all the oxides of chlorine, it
                    acts rapidly upon mercury and most metals. From Pebal’s recent experiments there
                    appears to be no doubt that chlorine peroxide is correctly represented by the
                    formula C1O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and it is, therefore, to be included
                    with nitric oxide and the few other compounds in which we must suppose an odd
                    number of affinities are free (see p. 473). It is absorbed by alkaline
                    solutions, forming a mixture of a chlorite and a chlorate—</p>

                <p>In this respect especially it differs from the other oxides of chlorine.</p>
                <p>The only remaining chlorine compound to be considered is perchloric acid, HC1O
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. It may be formed from chloric acid by
                    oxidation, but, according to Roscoe, the best method of preparing it consists in
                    boiling down a solution of chloric acid; lower oxides of chlorine escape, and a
                    solution of perchloric acid is left. It may also be obtained from potassium
                    perchlorate, farmed by heating potassium chlorate, by distilling it with
                    sulphuric acid.</p>
                <p>Aqueous perchloric acid may be concentrated by boiling till it attains a
                    temperature of 203° C., after which it passes over in the form of an oily liquid
                    which approximately has the composition HC1O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + 2H
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. By distilling this hydrate with twice its
                    volume of sulphuric acid, nearly pure perchloric acid is obtained.</p>
                <p>The pure acid is a colourless very soluble liquid, of specific gravity 1 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 782 at 15° '5 C. In this state it is one of the
                    most powerful oxidizing agents known; a single drop brought in contact with
                    charcoal, wood, or almost any organic substance, immediately causes an explosive
                    combustion, which in violence almost equals the sudden decomposition of the
                    so-called chloride of nitrogen. It produces frightful burns if allowed to fall
                    upon the skin. It undergoes spontaneous decomposition at ordinary temperatures,
                    and cannot be distilled unchanged. It unites very energetically with water, and
                    when mixed with it in suitable proportions forms the hydrate HC1O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O; this is a white
                    crystalline substance, which melts at 50° C∙, and undergoes decomposition when
                    heated to 110° C., splitting up into the pure acid and the oily hydrate above
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>Aqueous perchloric acid has a sour taste, and reddens litmus strongly, but does
                    not bleach; it dissolves iron and zinc with evolution of hydrogen, and when
                    dilute it is unaffected by hydrogen sulphide and sulphurous acid, which reduce
                    all other oxy-acids of chlorine. Perchloric acid, in fact, is distinguished from
                    all other oxidized chlorine compounds by its superior stability, oxygen being
                    withdrawn from it with comparative difficulty.</p>
                <p>The results of Thomsen’s thermochemical examination of various reactions which
                    are involved in the formation of some of the oxidized chlorine compounds are
                    exhibited in the following table. The symbols in the first column indicate the
                    nature of the reaction, and the numbers in the second column the units of heat
                    developed or absorbed,—the reaction being supposed to take place between the
                    substances of which the symbols are separated by commas. Thus, the ^ <hi

                    experiments, the determinations were made at about 18° C.</p>

                <p>When bromine is added to an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, sodium
                    hypobromite, NaOBr, is formed, but this is much less stable than the
                    corresponding hypochlorite, and is readily converted into bromate and bromide.
                    The bromates and bromic acid resemble the chlorates and chloric acid, but are
                    much less stable; thus, a solution of bromic acid is decomposed at 100° C.,
                    giving off bromine and oxygen, and all reducing agents decompose it with
                    facility. The inferior stability of the oxidized compounds of bromine as
                    compared with those of chlorine appears to indicate that the affinity of bromine
                    to oxygen is less than that of chlorine; this is entirely confirmed by

                <p>Iodine is converted into iodic acid by heating with the strongest nitric acid,
                    and by the action of many other oxidizing agents; but iodic acid is usually
                    prepared from barium iodate, which is decomposed with the necessary quantity of
                    sulphuric acid. Potassium iodate is most readily prepared by passing chlorine
                    into water in which iodine is suspended until the latter is dissolved, then
                    adding a corresponding quantity of potassium chlorate and warming; the iodine is
                    converted into monochloride, which enters into reaction with the chlorate, and
                    chlorine is evolved—</p>

                <p>By adding a solution of barium hydroxide, insoluble barium iodate is

                    substance, which readily dissolves in water, forming iodic acid; when heated to
                    about 370° C. it is resolved into oxygen and iodine. Iodic acid is a powerful
                    oxidizing agent, being easily decomposed by deoxidizing agents; hydriodic acid
                    reduces it to iodine and water—</p>

                <p>The chlorates and bromates are mostly easily soluble, and the corresponding salts
                    are isomorphous; but the iodates are mostly difficultly soluble, and with the
                    exception of barium iodate, are not isomorphous with the corresponding chlorates
                    and bromates. Moreover, chloric and bromic acids furnish but one class of salts,
                    of which potassium chlorate, KC1O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is typical; but
                    iodic acid, in addition to the normal iodates, such as potassium iodate, KIO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, forms acid salts. These differences appear to
                    indicate that iodic acid differs in constitution from the other acids, and
                    Thomsen has pointed out that it is probably a dibasic acid of the formula H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> c</hi>, since it is readily converted into water and the
                    anhydride I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, a
                    property which is characteristic of dibasic but not of monobasic acids; and
                    since it furnishes acid salts, which is also characteristic of polybasic but not
                    of monobasic acids, and is isomorphous with succinic acid, which is dibasic.
                    Normal potassium iodate would therefore have the formula K <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, and
                    the so-called diiodate is probably the acid salt KHI <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>.</p>
                <p>This view of the constitution of iodic acid is rendered the more probable by the
                    behaviour of periodic acid, the disodium salt of which separates as a
                    crystalline powder on passing chlorine into a solution of sodium iodate and
                    sodium hydroxide; the reaction is empirically represented by the equation—</p>

                <p>To prepare the acid from this salt, it is dissolved in nitric acid, and silver
                    nitrate added; the precipitate of disilver periodate is dissolved in hot dilute
                    nitric acid, and the solution concentrated at a moderate heat until a salt of
                    the composition AgIO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> crystallizes out. By treating

                <p>Periodic acid furnishes a complex but extremely interesting series of salts.
                    Thus, it forms two potassium salts, one of which has the composition KIO <hi

                    over sulphuric acid. Corresponding sodium salts exist. That which has the

                    anhydrous state, or with 3 molecules of water, which it readily loses in dry

                    by precipitating a solution of the acid with barium hydroxide, or of an alkali
                    salt with a barium salt, it contains 6 or 7 molecules of water, which are only
                    completely removed by heating to 300° C. It also furnishes a lead salt of the

                <p>The question now arises—What is the nature of the relation between these various
                    'salts? By the chemical method alone it is extremely difficult, if not
                    impossible, to decide, but from Thomsen’s thermochemical investigation of the
                    acid there can be little doubt as to the answer we should make to this question.

                <p>The first and second molecules, therefore, together cause the development of
                    26,590 units of heat, or of 13,295 units per molecule. But we have seen (p. 486)
                    that on neutralizing a large number of <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> acids,
                    between 13,750 and 13,150 units of heat are developed per molecule of hydroxide
                    added; and as the addition of further quantities of the hydroxide causes a
                    comparatively slight development of heat there is little doubt from these
                    results that the molecule H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> IO <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 6</hi> is dibasic. But on account of the existence of salts, such as K <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 9</hi>, it appears desirable to double this formula, and
                    to represent the molecule of periodic acid by the formula H <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 4</hi>.1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>. Several of the salts above alluded to may be
                    regarded as derived from this molecule by the partial or total displacement of
                    the hydrogen by metals; and we may term those which are formed by displacing 4
                    of the 10 atoms of hydrogen <hi rend="italic">normal</hi> salts, while those in
                    which 2, 4, or 6 of the remaining atoms of hydrogen are displaced may be called
                        <hi rend="italic">basic</hi> salts. Thus we have—</p>

                    tendency to form basic salts is slight in the case of the highly positive
                    elements is also shown by the small amount of heat developed on the addition of
                    the third, fourth, and fifth molecules of potassium hydroxide.</p>
                <p>The anhydrous salts such as K <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> I <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi> are to be regarded as derived from a
                    distinct acid formed from the molecule H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>.1 <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 6</hi> by the withdrawal of the elements of 3 molecules of
                    water. The salts, such as KIO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, which on account of
                    its isomorphism with potassium permanganate, K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Mn
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>, is more
                    probably represented by the formula K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> I <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>, are, it may be
                    supposed, also derived from a distinct acid, formed in a similar manner by the
                    withdrawal of the elements of a fourth molecule of water; these salts have the
                    same empirical composition as the perchlorates, and as potassium perchlorate is
                    isomorphous with the compound K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> I <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>, it is probable that
                    it corresponds with it in composition, and that perchloric acid therefore is
                    represented by the formula H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> C1 <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>. If this conclusion
                    be correct, and chloric acid be correctly represented by the formula HC1O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, we have an explanation of the great difference
                    which is observed in the properties of these two acids. Perchloric acid, we have
                    seen, has a great tendency to combine with water, and its hydrates may be
                    regarded as distinct acids, the liquid hydrate bearing the same relation to the
                    acid H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 8</hi> that crystallized periodic acid bears to the
                    hypothetical acid H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    O <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>, from which salts such as K <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> are
                    derived. Basic perchlorates corresponding to the basic periodates are not known,
                    but a Cuprammonium salt and a lead salt have been obtained which apparently are
                    derived from the crystalline hydrate of perchloric acid, the latter having the
                    composition Pb"Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> +
                    PbH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> or Pb"Cl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Pb".</p>
                <p>It will have been noticed that the amount of heat developed on the addition of
                    the first molecule of potassium hydroxide to the solution of periodic acid
                    regarded as H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> IO <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> is
                    much less than is usually observed with other acids, and the amount developed on
                    the addition of the second molecule much greater; the two molecules together,
                    however, produce an effect comparable with that observed in the case of other
                    acids. But the salt produced on passing chlorine into a solution of potassium
                    hydroxide has the composition K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> I <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>, so that the first
                    action of potassium hydroxide on a solution of the acid H <hi rend="subscript">
                        4</hi>.1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 6</hi> apparently does not merely consist in the direct
                    displacement of hydrogen in this acid by potassium; the elements of four
                    molecules of water are also withdrawn, and since this latter operation involves
                    the absorption of heat, the amount of heat finally developed in the reaction is
                    but small. On the addition of a further quantity of hydroxide, however, change
                    in the reverse order is effected, and hence the normal amount of heat is
                    developed by the combined action of the two molecules of hydroxide. It is
                    interesting also to observe that more heat is developed on adding the third than
                    by the fourth and fifth molecules of hydroxide together, and to contrast this
                    with the circumstance that the silver salt Ag <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> I <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> j2</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 6</hi> loses the elements of two molecules of water at
                    100ð C., but the elements of a third only at 200’ C. Apparently there is a
                    tendency on the part of potassium hydroxide to enter into reaction with the acid
                    after the production of the normal salt K <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> I <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 6</hi>; but salts containing a relatively larger
                    proportion of potassium evidently cannot exist except in solution, and even then
                    only to a limited extent.</p>
                <p>We are now in a position also to explain the formation of sodium periodate by the
                    action of chlorine on a solution of sodium iodate and sodium hydroxide. We have
                    learnt that the action of chlorine on the latter is to produce sodium
                    hypochlorite, and that this is a powerful oxidizing agent—</p>
                <p>NaOH + Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = NaOCl + HC1, and there can be little
                    doubt, therefore, that the iodate is at first oxidized by it, and converted into
                    the salt Na <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> IO <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> j
                    thus—</p>
                <p>Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 6</hi> + 2NaOCl = Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> I <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> + 2NaCl. <hi
                        rend="italic">A A</hi> U <hi rend="italic">A A</hi> O</p>
                <p>In presence of sodium hydrate and water, however, this salt is at once converted
                    into the normal periodate—</p>
                <p>Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 8</hi> + 2NaOH + 2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = Na

                <p>Again, both acids are easily decomposed by hydriodic acid, yielding water and

                <p>The analogous decomposition of chloric acid by hydrochloric acid would involve
                    the absorption of 30,920 units of heat, whilst that of bromic acid by
                    hydrobromic acid would be attended with the development of 101,520 units of
                    heat; the difference between these numbers, 132,440, is almost equal to the
                    amount evolved in the decomposition of periodic acid, and on comparing the
                    several reactions it will be evident that the differences between the amounts of
                    heat evolved are approximately simple multiples of a common constant; thus—</p>

                <p>These three elements are usually classed together, since most of their compounds
                    with other elements are of the same type. In some respects they resemble each
                    other closely, but in others they differ very widely,—selenium being much more
                    closely related to sulphur on the one hand than to tellurium on the other.</p>
                <p>Sulphur occurs native in most volcanic districts; it is also found abundantly in
                    combination with metals, such as copper, iron, lead, and zinc, and it is widely
                    distributed in the form of sulphates of barium, calcium, magnesium, and
                    strontium; it is a necessary constituent of animal and vegetable tissues.</p>
                <p>Selenium is of rare occurrence, and is always met with in combination with other
                    elements; it is frequently associated in minute proportions with sulphur in its
                    ores. Tellurium is also a rare element; it is occasionally found native, but
                    generally in combination with various metals, such as bismuth, copper, lead,
                    gold, or silver, and it is usually accompanied by selenium.</p>
                <p>Sulphur is a very brittle solid of a lemon-yellow colour, insoluble in water, and
                    therefore tasteless. It is a bad conductor of heat, and a non-conductor of
                    electricity. Its specific gravity in the native crystalline state is 2O5.
                    Sulphur melts at 115° C., and at 120° C. is converted into a perfectly limpid
                    pale yellow liquid; but as it is gradually heated it becomes darker and more
                    viscid until, at 200°-240° C., it is so thick that the vessel in which it is
                    contained may be inverted without any outflow taking place. At 250°-300° C. it
                    again liquefies, but does not become so fluid as when first melted, and at 440°
                    C. it boils, yielding an orange-coloured vapour.</p>
                <p>The density of sulphur vapour at 1000° C. is 32 times as great as that of
                    hydrogen at the same temperature; so that as the atomic weight of sulphur is 32,
                    the molecules of sulphur at this temperature are diatomic; but at about 500° C.
                    its density is three times as great, so that at this temperature its molecules
                    must be regarded as hexatomic.</p>
                <p>Selenium is a deep brown-coloured brittle solid, of the specific gravity 4 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5 in the crystalline state; like sulphur, it is
                    insoluble in water. It boils at a temperature below a red heat, and gives off a
                    deep yellow vapour, the density of which at about 1400° C. is such as to show
                    that it consists of diatomic molecules, but at lower temperatures, like sulphur,
                    its molecule is more complex.</p>
                <p>Tellurium is much like a metal in appearance, resembling bismuth in colour; it is
                    very brittle; its specific gravity is 6 ’ 1 to 6 ’ 33, and it conducts heat and
                    electricity, though not very readily. It melts at about 500° C., and at a high
                    temperature is converted into a yellow vapour, the density of which at 1440° C.
                    is such as to show that the molecule of tellurium at this temperature is
                    diatomic. No tendency has hitherto been observed on the part of tellurium to
                    form a more complex molecule in the manner characteristic of selenium and
                    sulphur; and it is noteworthy also that, whereas the density of sulphur vapour
                    at temperatures not far removed from its boiling point is three times as great
                    as at much higher temperatures, the density of selenium vapour under similar
                    circumstances is only about one and a half times as great as at about 1400°
                    C.</p>
                <p>Sulphur is chiefly remarkable for the great number of <hi rend="italic"
                        >allotropie</hi> forms in which it can exist. Thus, native sulphur is found
                    crystallized in rhombic octahedra of the specific gravity 2 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 05. This variety melts at 114° *5 C.; it is
                    readily soluble in carbon disulphide, the sulphide of chlorine, S <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, benzene,
                    turpentine, &lt;fcc., and sulphur is usually deposited in this form on
                    spontaneous evaporation of its solution in carbon disulphide; it is, in fact,
                    the stable form into which all other <hi rend="italic">allotropes</hi> tend to
                    change. When, however, melted sulphur is allowed to cool slowly it crystallizes
                    in transparent, yellowish-brown, monoclinic prisms, of <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n510/mode/1up"

                    higher melting point (120° C.); in the course of a few days, although the
                    crystals maintain their prismatic form, they become opaque, and, on examination,
                    are found to be converted into aggregations of minute octahedrons. This change
                    of prismatic into octahedral sulphur is attended with the development of a
                    considerable amount of heat, which is especially noticeable when the conversion
                    is caused to take place rapidly by scratching the crystals. The transformation
                    of the octahedral variety into the prismatic takes place at about the melting
                    point of the former, a transparent crystal of octahedral sulphur being converted
                    into an opaque mass of prismatic crystals when heated for some time to a
                    temperature of 105°-115° C.; also, when a saturated solution of sulphur in hot
                    turpentine is allowed to cool, crystals of prismatic sulphur are at first
                    deposited, but after a time, when the liquid has become comparatively cool, the
                    crystals which separate are octahedral.</p>
                <p>Prismatic sulphur is soluble in carbon disulphide and other menstrua which
                    dissolve the octahedral modification; another modification, which is also
                    soluble, but destitute of crystalline form, is obtained on addition of acids to
                    solutions of alkaline polysulphides—</p>

                <p>It has a greenish-white colour, and constitutes ordinary milk of sulphur; by
                    keeping, it becomes gradually converted into octahedral sulphur. Sublimed
                    sulphur, or flowers of sulphur, is probably closely allied to this form, but
                    always contains a small proportion of insoluble sulphur.</p>
                <p>When sulphur is heated to 260°-300° C. and then poured in a thin stream into cold
                    water, it is converted into the so-called plastic modification, and is obtained
                    as a soft yellowish-brown semitransparent mass, capable of being drawn out into
                    fine elastic threads. In this state sulphur has the specific gravity 1 95, and
                    is insoluble in carbon disulphide; in the course of a few hours, however, it
                    again becomes brittle and almost entirely reconverted into the octahedral
                    modification, the change being accompanied by the development of heat.</p>
                <p>When the chloride of sulphur, S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CJ <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is decomposed by water, it furnishes sulphur,
                    hydrochloric acid, and thiosulphuric acid; the sulphur thus obtained is
                    amorphous and insoluble in carbon disulphide, but is converted into octahedral
                    sulphur by fusion, or by exposure for some time to a temperature of 100° C.
                    Thiosulphuric acid also gradually decomposes into sulphur and sulphurous acid,
                    and if a solution of a thiosulphate is decomposed by hydrochloric acid—</p>

                <p>the sulphur which separates is soluble in carbon disulphide, but is obtained on
                    evaporation of the solution in an amorphous condition, and cannot then be again
                    dissolved in carbon disulphide; it is stated, however, that if the hyposulphite
                    is decomposed by dilute sulphuric acid, the sulphur which separates is insoluble
                    in carbon disulphide. When a solution of ordinary sulphur in carbon disulphide
                    is exposed to sunlight, an amorphous insoluble modification separates; the
                    reconversion of this modification into octahedral sulphur is attended with the
                    absorption of heat.</p>
                <p>Several minor modifications of sulphur have been described, but it is not known
                    whether the differences which they exhibit are inherent, or whether, as is not
                    improbable, they are due to the presence of impurity.</p>
                <p>There appears to be a relation between the modification formed in <hi
                        rend="superscript"> p</hi> reaction and the compound or compounds from which
                    it is obtained, since, generally, the sulphur separated from compounds in which
                    it is associated with positive elements is soluble, whilst that separated from
                    compounds in which it is associated with negative elements is insoluble in
                    carbon disulphide; but the conditions under which the sulphur is separated
                    doubtless exercise an important influence.</p>
                <p>At present we have no knowledge as to the manner in which the various allotropes
                    are related to each other; it has been suggested, however, that the differences
                    between them are at least in some cases due to differences in molecular
                    composition.</p>
                <p>Several allotropic modifications of selenium are also known, but a tendency to
                    form allotropes has not been observed in the case of tellurium.</p>
                <p>Three principal modifications of selenium, corresponding to the three principal
                    modifications of sulphur, may be distinguished, viz., (1), black crystalline
                    selenium, of specific gravity about 4 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 80, which
                    may be placed by the side of the octahedral variety of sulphur, being the form
                    in which selenium separates when solutions of metallic selenides are exposed to
                    the air, and since all other modifications are converted into it when heated to
                    about 150° C.; (2), red crystalline selenium, of specific gravity 4'46 to 4’51,
                    which probably corresponds to monoclinic sulphur, as it has the same crystalline
                    form, and may be obtained by rapidly cooling melted selenium; and (3), red
                    amorphous selenium, of specific gravity about 4 ’ 3. This last corresponds to
                    the amorphous allotrope of sulphur, and, as in the case of sulphur, it occurs in
                    two modifications, the one soluble and the other insoluble in carbon disulphide.
                    Black crystal line selenium, unlike octahedral sulphur, however, is insoluble in
                    carbon disulphide, but the red crystalline allotrope is soluble, although to a
                    much less extent than sulphur. The conversion of these modifications of selenium
                    into each other is attended with development or absorption of heat, just as in
                    the case of sulphur, and the melting points of the several modifications are
                    different. Thus, if amorphous selenium, which melts a few degrees above 100° C.,
                    be heated to about 96° C., it quickly becomes crystalline, the change being
                    attended with considerable rise of temperature, and the melting point rises to
                    217° C. The electrical conductivity of selenium is found to vary in a remarkable
                    manner with the temperature, and is also influenced by light. Amorphous selenium
                    is a non-conductor up to 80° C., but from this temperature up to 210* Ç. its
                    conductivity gradually increases, after which it again diminishes. Selenium
                    which has been kept for several hours at 210° C. and then gradually cooled is
                    especially sensitive to the influence of light, its conductivity increasing with
                    the intensity of the light.</p>
                <p>Sulphur, selenium, and tellurium form gaseous compounds with hydrogen, analogous
                    in composition to water :—</p>

                <p>Iodine, however, cannot decompose the gas at ordinary temperatures except in
                    presence of water. This is because the reaction requires an absorption of heat.
                    Thus, in the production of a molecule of hydrogen sulphide from hydrogen and
                    sulphur in the state in which it separates when hydrogen sulphide is decomposed
                    by iodine, 4500 units of heat are developed; but in the production of a molecule
                    of hydriodic acid from its elements, 6000 units of heat are absorbed, so that
                    the reaction indicated by the equation H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S + I <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2HI + S would involve the absorption of 4500 + 2
                    × 6000 = 16,500 units ofheat. That it takes place in presence of water is due to
                    the fact that the dissolution of the hydriodic acid produced is attended with
                    the development of 2 × 19200 = 38,400 units of heat; hence, when the reaction is
                    effected in a dilute solution, heat is developed to the extent of 38,400-16,500
                    = 21,900 units of heat. But it is found that the reaction takes place the less
                    readily as the concentration of the solution increases, and that it ceases when
                    the solution has attained a specific gravity of 1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    56 at ordinary temperatures; in more concentrated solutions sulphur even
                    dissolves with production of hydrogen sulphide and liberation of iodine. A
                    simple explanation of this apparently anomalous result, however, is afforded by
                    the observation that the heat developed by the absorption of equal quantities of
                    hydriodic acid is less as the quantity of acid already dissolved in the water is
                    greater. The amount of heat <hi rend="italic">developed,</hi> therefore,
                    diminishing as tke quantity of hydriodic formed by the reaction in the liquid
                    increases, at a certain point becomes equal to that <hi rend="italic"
                        >absorbed</hi> in the decomposition of the hydrogen sulphide by the iodine,
                    and the reaction ceases since it can no longer be attended with a development of
                    heat.</p>
                <p>This behaviour of iodine with hydrogen sulphide alone, or in presence of water,
                    is one of the most striking illustrations of the fact that reactions involving
                    the expenditure of energy cannot take place directly, and are only possible when
                    the conditions are such that one or more of the products of the reactions enter
                    into secondary reactions, so as to cause the development of more heat than is
                    absorbed in the primary reaction.</p>
                <p>The hydrogen in hydrogen sulphide may be displaced by metals,—the compounds
                    formed by displacing one-half the hydrogen being termed sulphydrates or
                    hydrosulphides, whilst those in which the whole of the hydrogen is displaced are
                    termed sulphides. These two classes of compounds correspond to the metallic
                    hydroxides and the metallic oxides respectively, and in many respects closely
                    resemble them; the sulphur compounds, however, are, with few exceptions, far
                    less stable than the corresponding oxygen compounds.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen sulphide enters directly into reaction with the metallic hydroxides,
                    exchanging its hydrogen for the metal; for example—</p>
                <p>NaOH + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S = NaSH + HOH.</p>
                <p>Sodium Hydrogen Sodium hydroxide. sulphide. hydrosulphide. nater.</p>
                <p>It therefore exhibits the behaviour of an acid. From Thomsen’s experiments it
                    appears that 7740 units of heat are developed on the addition of a solution of
                    one molecule of sodium hydroxide to a solution of one molecule of hydrogen
                    sulphide, and that the further addition of the hydroxide is without effect.
                    Hydrogen sulphide is thus proved to be a <hi rend="italic">monobasic</hi> acid,
                    and this result also shows that when soluble sulphides, such as sodium sulphide,
                    are dissolved in water, double decomposition occurs, thus: Na <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S + OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = NaSH + NaOH,
                    just as when sodium oxide, for example, is added to water: Na <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O + OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2NaOH. It is
                    uncertain, however, whether the decomposition of the sulphides by water in this
                    manner is complete, or whether it is only partial, and the more complete the
                    greater the quantity of water present.</p>
                <p>The highly positive metals lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, strontium,
                    barium, and magnesium form soluble sulphides and hydrosulphides, but most of the
                    sulphides of other metals are insoluble. The nature of many of the compounds
                    precipitated from metallic solutions by hydrogen sulphide or an alkaline
                    hydrosulphide is not well established; but in many cases apparently they are
                    intermediate in composition between the hydroxides and hydrosulphides; the
                    precipitate formed on the addition of an alkaline hydrosulphide to a solution of
                    a zinc salt, for example, is probably a compound of this kind, and may be
                    represented by the formula HO.Zn.SH,—zinc hydroxide being HO.Zn.OH, and zinc
                    hydrosulphide HS.Zn.SH. The solutions of salts of heavy metals, such as mercury
                    and lead, furnish precipitates of the corresponding sulphides with hydrogen
                    sulphide or alkaline hydrosulphides.</p>
                <p>The hydrosulphides of certain elements, such as aluminium and chromium, cannot
                    exist in presence of water, but enter into reaction with it with evolution of
                    hydrogen sulphide; hence, on the addition of an alkaline hydrosulphide to
                    solution of their salts, the corresponding hydroxides are precipitated :—</p>

                <p>Sulphur unites with all the metals and with most of the non-metallic elements;
                    the sulphides are therefore usually prepared directly from their elements. Two
                    classes of sulphides corresponding to the basic and acid oxides may be
                    distinguished, but the distinction between them is much less marked than that
                    between the two classes of oxides. The sulphides of the non-metallic elements
                    and the sulphides of arsenic, antimony, tin, molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium,
                    gold, and platinum, which are soluble in solutions of alkaline hydrosulphides,
                    belong to the class of acid sulphides, and the remaining sulphides are basic.
                    These two classes of sulphides are capable of uniting together to form sulphur
                    salts, just as the basic and acid oxides combine formiûg oxy-salts. As a rule,
                    the sulphides and oxides of the same element have similar formulae and
                    correspond in their general behaviour. Occasionally there are oxides to which
                    there are no corresponding sulphides, but more fre <pb break="no"

                    corresponding oxides. All sulphides are decomposed more or less readily by
                    hydrochloric acid gas, hydrogen sulphide and a chloride being produced, and in
                    some cases sulphur is also liberated. Many of the sulphides which are decomposed
                    when heated in an atmosphere of hydrochloric acid gas are little, if at all,
                    affected by a boiling solution of the acid.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen selenide and telluride closely resemble hydrogen sulphide in properties,
                    but are far less stable compounds. The former has a most offensive acrid odour,
                    impairing or even destroying the sense of smell for several hours, and producing
                    inflammation of the eyes. Their aqueous solutions are decomposed on exposure to
                    the air with separation of selenium and tellurium respectively; and with
                    solutions of salts of most metals they produce precipitates of tire
                    corresponding selenhydrates or selenides and tellurhydrates or tellurides. The
                    selenides and the tellurides, like the sulphides, may be formed by the direct
                    combination of their elements, and are usually so prepared; in their général
                    behaviour they resemble the corresponding sulphides.</p>
                <p>A higher sulphide of hydrogen is known of which the composition has not yet been
                    satisfactorily determined, owing to the difficulty of obtaining it in a pure
                    state; but as it is obtained on adding a solution of potassium pentasulphide, K
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, to a dilute
                    solution of hydrochloric acid, and is formed without evolution of hydrogen
                    sulphide or separation of sulphur, it appears most probable that it is the
                    pentasulphide H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. It
                    separates as an oily liquid, heavier than water, possessing a peculiar
                    sulphurous disagreeable odour; it is soluble in water. It is a very unstable
                    substance, undergoing decomposition into hydrogen sulphide and sulphur with
                    great facility; this decomposition is instantaneous under the influence of
                    substances such as finely divided platinum, gold, and charcoal. Its stability is
                    increased by the presence of moderately strong acids, but diminished by
                    alkalies. With an alcoholic solution of potassium hydrosulphide it furnishes
                    potassium pentasulphide, hydrogen sulphide being evolved—</p>

                <p>Sulphur, selenium, and tellurium form compounds with chlorine, bromine, and
                    iodine, similar in composition, but differing greatly in stability.</p>
                <p>With chlorine, sulphur forms the three compounds— S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>

                    passing chlorine over sulphur, which is gently heated; it is a mobile
                    reddish-yellow liquid, having a peculiar, penetrating, and most disagreeable
                    odour. It boils without suffering decomposition at 137° C. It is slowly
                    decomposed by water, yielding hydrogen chloride, sulphur, and thiosulphuric acid

                    C. it furnishes the tetrachloride SC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. Both of
                    these compounds are so unstable, however, that they are resolved into the lowest
                    chloride S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and
                    chlorine when very slightly heated.</p>
                <p>The chlorides of selenium and tellurium are also obtained by the direct action of
                    chlorine on the elements. Two chlorides of selenium are known, Se <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and SeCl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, the former being liquid and the latter a white
                    crystalline solid.</p>
                <p>Tellurium forms the two chlorides TeCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and TeCl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, both of which are solid. These chlorides of
                    tellurium, as well as selenium tetrachloride, appear to volatilize without
                    decomposition.</p>
                <p>Very little is known of the bromides of sulphur and selenium, but from the
                    observations which have been made there is no doubt that the sulphur bromides
                    are much less stable than the chlorides; sulphur, therefore, like oxygen,
                    appears to have less affinity for bromine than for chlorine. Tellurium furnishes
                    two crystalline bromides, TeBr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and TeBr <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, both of which may be sublimed without

                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and is obtained by
                    the direct union of its elements; it is a black crystalline solid, insoluble in
                    water, and readily decomposes when heated. Iodides of selenium are not known
                    with certainty, but two tellurium iodides have been prepared, Tel <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and Tel <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>; both are
                    black crystalline bodies, which give off iodine when heated.</p>
                <p>The chlorides and bromides of selenium and tellurium, like the chlorides and
                    bromides of sulphur, are decomposed by water, but the iodides of these three
                    elements are comparatively stable and are scarcely affected unless heated with

                <p>Sulphtfr dioxide or sulphurous anhydride is a colourless gas, of pungent
                    suffocating odour; by a pressure of three atmospheres, or a refrigerating
                    mixture of ice and salt, it is readily condensed to a colourless mobile liquid,
                    which boils at about - 10° C. The liquid anhydride freezes at - 76° C., forming
                    a transparent colourless crystalline solid, which melts at about -79° C. Water
                    at 0° C. dissolves about 68 times its bulk of the gas, but only 32 times its
                    bulk at 24°, forming a solution of sulphurous acid, H <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, which is readily decomposed by
                    heat.</p>
                <p>Selenium dioxide or selenious anhydride is a white infusible substance, which
                    volatilizes at a temperature below redness; its vapour condenses in snow white
                    deliquescent prisms, which dissolve in water forming selenious acid, H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SeO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.</p>
                <p>Tellurium dioxide, however, is only very slightly soluble in water, and the
                    solution does not exhibit an acid reaction; the attraction of this oxide for
                    water, in fact, is so slight, that when a solution of tellurous hydrate
                    (tellurous acid), H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> TeO <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi>, is heated to about 40° C. the oxide separates. It fuses readily and
                    volatilizes, and the fused oxide, which is a transparent, deep yellow liquid,
                    solidifies on cooling to a white crystalline mass.</p>
                <p>The difference in physical properties between sulphur and seleqium dioxides is so
                    great as to suggest that the <pb break="no"

                    the formula SeO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, but that it is more complex; and
                    although the vapour density of selenium dioxide is such as to negative this
                    assumption for the gaseous substance, there is no evidence to show that the
                    expression SeO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is the correct molecular formula for
                    the solid oxide.</p>
                <p>Sulphur trioxide or sulphuric anhydride is a white, highly volatile substance
                    which dissolves in water, forming sulphuric acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, the combination being attended with the
                    development of so much heat that when the anhydride comes in contact with the
                    water a violent hissing is produced, just as when a red-hot iron is plunged into
                    water. Selenium trioxide has not been isolated, but selenic acid, H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SeO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, the acid
                    corresponding to sulphuric acid, is known, and very closely resembles the latter
                    compound in many of its properties. Tellurium trioxide, TeO <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 3</hi>, is an orange-yellow solid, insoluble in water, and therefore
                    altogether different in properties from sulphur trioxide; moreover, the
                    resemblance between the compound H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> TeO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, from which tellurium trioxide is obtained by
                    heating to a temperature below redness, and sulphuric and selenic acids scarcely
                    extends beyond the similarity of their formulae, since telluric acid is nearly
                    insoluble in water, and its solution has a metallic rather than an acid taste,
                    and reddens litmus but slightly.</p>
                <p>Sulphur dioxide is usually prepared for laboratory purposes by heating a metal,
                    such as copper or mercury, with concentrated sulphuric acid; the most probable
                    explanation of its formation in this manner appears to be that the metal acting
                    upon the acid produces the corresponding sulphate and hydrogen, and that the
                    latter whilst in the nascent state acts upon another portion of the acid,
                    reducing it to sulphurous acid, which splits up into sulphur dioxide and water;
                    thus—</p>

                    hydroxides or carbonates are dissolved or suspended metallic sulphites are

                    however, which readily produce acid sulphites; in fact, the tendency to form
                    acid salts is almost restricted to these metals in the case of all acids, and it
                    is difficult to obtain acid salts containing heavy metals.</p>
                <p>A solution of sulphurous acid slowly absorbs oxygen from the air and is converted
                    into sulphuric acid; in like manner, the sulphites, particularly if in solution,
                    become converted into sulphates on exposure to the air. All sulphites are
                    decomposed at a red heat, either into sulphate and sulphide, or into sulphur
                    dioxide and metallic oxide. They are also decomposed by all acids excepting
                    carbonic and boric acids, sulphurous acid being liberated. Sulphurous acid
                    possesses considerable bleaching powers, and is extensively employed in
                    bleaching straw, wool, and many other articles, which would be injured by
                    chlorine. The articles to be bleached are moistened and suspended in closed
                    chambers in which sulphur is burnt; the sulphur dioxide produced is then
                    absorbed by the damp goods, and their colour is discharged. The manner in which
                    it acts is not well understood, but it appears to be by forming colourless
                    compounds with the colouring matters; it does not, like chlorine, decompose
                    colouring matters, for <pb break="no"

                    or alkalies. The reproduction of the yellow colour of new flannel, when it is
                    washed with an alkaline soap for the first time, is an illustration of this.
                    Sulphurous acid is also a powerful antiseptic, and is highly valuable as a

                    a bulky precipitate, which, when dried over sulphuric acid, forms a light white

                    water, but dissolves in alkalies and alkaline carbonates. With the alkali metals
                    tellurous acid forms three classes of salts corresponding to the three classes
                    of selenites, of which the following are examples—</p>

                <p>With the alkaline earth metals tellurous acid forms normal salts, and also
                    certain peculiar salts, such as BaTe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi

                    With the heavy metals it appears to form only normal salts. The tellurites of
                    alkali metals are soluble in water, but those of other metals are difficultly
                    soluble or insoluble.</p>
                <p>In its oxides, therefore, it will be evident tellurium differs widely from
                    selenium and sulphur, but it much resembles metals like bismuth and antimony,
                    since it forms salts with acids. Thus, a tellurium sulphate of the composition
                    Te(SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, it is stated,
                    is formed by dissolving tellurium in concentrated sulphuric acid. Tellurous
                    hydrate also dissolves readily in acids; the solution in hydrochloric acid
                    probably contains either tellurium chloride, TeCl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>,
                    or a compound intermediate ia composition between tellurium chloride and
                    tellurium hydroxide, Te(OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, formed from the latter
                    by the partial displacement of the OH groups by chlorine; when it is dissolved
                    in oxy-acids, apparently salts are formed in which the group TeO displaces
                    hydrogen, corresponding to the antimony salts in which the radicle SbO displaces
                    hydrogen.</p>
                <p>Sulphurous acid, on account of its tendency to form sulphuric acid, has
                    considerable power as a reducing agent. Thus iodine and sulphurous acid, in
                    presence of a large quantity of water, yield hydriodic and sulphuric acid—</p>

                    Sulphuric acid.</p>
                <p>With chlorine and bromine similar reactions occur still more readily. On this
                    account, sulphurous acid is largely •employed as an “antichlor” to remove the
                    excess of chlorine from articles bleached with bleaching powder. When solutions
                    of sulphurous and selenious acid are mixed, the latter is reduced, especially on
                    warming, and red amorphous selenium precipitated; similarly, a black precipitate
                    of tellurium is formed on warming a solution containing tellurous and sulphurous
                    acids. But these acids also readily part with at least a portion of their
                    oxygen. For instance, when hydrogen sulphide gas is passed into a solution of
                    sulphurous acid, sulphur is deposited, and the solution contains pentathionic
                    acid—</p>

                    trioxide when gently heated, ordinary sulphuric acid remaining behind.</p>
                <p>Sulphur trioxide usually crystallizes in white slender needles, but it exists in
                    two modifications. Thus, when the liquid oxide is cooled, it solidifies at 16°
                    C. in long colourless prisms, which melt at the same temperature; but if kept at
                    temperatures below 25°, it changes into a mass of fine white needles. This
                    second modification gradually liquefies at temperatures above 50°, and again
                    passes into the first modification; it dissolves with extreme slowness in
                    sulphuric acid, whereas the liquid oxide is miscible in all proportions with the
                    acid. Liquid sulphuric anhydride undergoes very great expansion by heat, its
                    mean coefficient of expansion between 25° and 45° C. being <hi

                    is quite colourless when pure. Sulphur trioxide very readily parts with one of
                    its atoms of oxygen, converting phosphorus trichloride, for example, into
                    phosphorus oxy trichloride—</p>

                <p>This reaction takes place when the substances are merely mixed together, although
                    a strong red heat is necessary in order to resolve the trioxide into sulphur
                    dioxide and oxygen.</p>
                <p>When finely divided sulphur is added in small quantities to liquid sulphuric
                    anhydride, drops of a deep blue colour sink to the bottom and solidify
                    immediately. These consist of the compound S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. The temperature during the operation must be kept
                    at 15° C., for if it is lower the anhydride does not remain liquid, and if
                    higher the substance decomposes. When about a gramme of sulphur has been added
                    the anhydride is poured off, and the solid residue freed from any that remains
                    by a gentle heat. A bluish-green crystalline mass is thus obtained, which
                    decomposes at ordinary temperatures, giving off sulphur dioxide, and leaving
                    sulphur; water immediately decomposes it, forming sulphuric, sulphurous, and
                    probably thiosulphuric acids. The corresponding selenium compound, SeSO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, may be prepared in a similar manner; <hi

                <p>Of all chemical compounds this is probably the most important, on account of its
                    numerous practical applications, and enormous quantities of it are now
                    manufactured. The method employed consists essentially in oxidizing sulphurous
                    acid by atmospheric oxygen, which is accomplished with the aid of nitric oxide
                    gas in the following manner. Sulphur dioxide gas is prepared by burning sulphur,
                    or iron pyrites, FeS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, in a properly constructed
                    furnace, sulphur being always employed when the purest qualities of acid are
                    required, and this gas is conveyed into a large leaden chamber, into which steam
                    and air are also continuously admitted. At the back of the furnace in which the
                    sulphur is burnt, a small vessel is placed containing sodium <pb break="no"

                <p>The exact changes which occur among the various substances thus introduced into
                    the chambers are but imperfectly understood; the nitric acid, however, is
                    apparently decomposed by the sulphurous acid in such a manner that finally
                    nitric oxide is produced—</p>

                <p>But nitric oxide combines directly with oxygen at ordinary temperatures, forming
                    the oxides N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> and N
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, and it is
                    generally supposed that the nitric oxide thus formed acts as a carrier of
                    oxygen,—that on coming in contact with the oxygen of the air introduced into the
                    chamber, it is converted into a higher oxide, which, however, is no sooner
                    produced than it is reduced again to nitric oxide by the sulphurous acid, which
                    is oxidized to sulphuric acid; supposing the oxide formed to be nitric peroxide,
                    we may represent the change by the following simple equation :—</p>
                <p>2SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O + N <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> = 2H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + 2NO.</p>
                <p>The nitric oxide again absorbs oxygen to form the higher oxide, which again
                    enters into reaction with sulphur dioxide and water, with liberation of nitric
                    oxide, and so on continuously. Theoretically, therefore, a limited quantity of
                    nitric oxide should suffice to produce an indefinitely large amount of sulphuric
                    acid, but practically this is not the case, chiefly owing to the loss occasioned
                    by the dissolution of a certain quantity in the sulphuric acid which collects on
                    the floor of the chambers; a certain amount also escapes from the chambers with
                    the nitrogen of the air, but this is usually absorbed by passing the escaping
                    vapours through a tower filled with pieces of coke, kept moistened with
                    sulphuric acid, or over which water is constantly pouring; when acid is employed
                    it is afterwards pumped into a similar scrubber, and deprived of its nitric
                    oxide gas by means of the sulphur dioxide gas from the burning sulphur or
                    pyrites, and when water is used it is pumped into, and distributed on the floors
                    of, the leaden chambers.</p>
                <p>In practice the amount of sulphuric acid produced usually approximates very
                    closely to the theoretical quantity.</p>
                <p>It is beyond question that the reactions which occur in the formation of
                    sulphuric acid are not all of the simple character represented by the equations
                    above given. Thus, the formation of nitric oxide from nitric acid is probably
                    the final result of three distinct reactions. In the first place, from the
                    sulphur dioxide and nitric acid a compound which is known as the lead chamber
                    crystals, on account of its forming crystals, is probably produced; thus—</p>

                <p>Sulphur dioxide. Nitric acid. Lead chamber crystals.</p>
                <p>This compound, it will be observed, is very closely related to sulphuric acid,
                    and may be regarded as formed from it by the displacement of one of the OH
                    groups by the group NO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. It is decomposed by water,
                    yielding sulphuric and nitrous acids :—</p>

                    nitric oxide may be produced in two ways,—either by its spontaneous

                    Sulphur dioxide. Nitric oxide. Sulphuric acid.</p>
                <p>The latter reaction appears to be the more probable on account of the large
                    amount of sulphur dioxide present, but it is not unlikely that both occur.</p>
                <p>With regard to the part which the nitric oxide plays in the conversion of
                    sulphurous into sulphuric acid, it is highly probable that, by the conjoint
                    action of the oxygen and water present, it is converted into nitrous acid, from
                    which nitric oxide is reproduced by the action of the sulphur dioxide in the
                    manner above pointed out—</p>
                <p>4NO + O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 4HNO
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>If this be the case, nitrous acid is the active agent in the conversion of
                    sulphur dioxide into sulphuric acid. It is known to effect the oxidation of
                    sulphur dioxide with the greatest readiness, whereas dilute nitric acid has very
                    little action. On this account, it is probable also that the nitric oxide is not
                    converted into the peroxide, as sometimes is supposed, and that the latter is
                    the active agent in the formation of sulphuric acid, for our general experience
                    appears to warrant the conclusion that, as sulphur dioxide enters so readily
                    into reaction with nitrous acid, this acid would Be produced from the nitric
                    oxide almost entirely to the exclusion of other oxidation products. Moreover,
                    nitric peroxide in presence of water forms nitrous and nitric acids: <hi

                    converted into nitric peroxide, the formation of sulphuric acid would still in a
                    large measure be due to the action of nitrous acid. Although sulphur dioxide
                    acts very slowly on dilute nitric acid, it readily reduces it to nitric oxide in
                    presence of moderately concentrated sulphuric acid; hence any nitric acid formed
                    in the process, when carried down to the floor of the chamber and mixed with the
                    moderately concentrated sulphuric acid there collected, would also undergo
                    reduction by the sulphur dioxide.</p>
                <p>The acid from the leaden chambers has generally a specific gravity of about 1 <hi

                    leaden pans this is raised to above 1 ’ 7. The further concentration is effected
                    in glass or platinum retorts. The commercial acid, known as oil of vitriol, has
                    a specific gravity of about 1 ‘84; it is frequently of a more or less brown
                    colour from the presence of organic matter, and always contains lead. Other
                    impurities, such as arsenic and nitrous or nitric acid, are not unfrequently
                    present.</p>
                <p>Pure sulphuric acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript">
                        4</hi>, is an oily, colourless, inodorous liquid, of specific gravity 1 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 842; it solidifies at - 35° C. It cannot be
                    distilled unchanged, and when heated gives off the anhydride until a liquid
                    remains containing about 1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 per cent, of water
                    and 98 5 per cent, of sulphuric acid, which boils at 338° C.; acid of this
                    strength may always be obtained by boiling down acid of any other degree of
                    concentration. When the acid is vaporized, dissociation takes place very
                    rapidly, the vapour at temperatures above 400° C. consisting entirely of a
                    mixture of water and sulphuric anhydride. Sulphuric acid chars most organic
                    substances containing oxygen and hydrogen on account of its great affinity for
                    water, causing the separation of these elements in the form of water and the
                    liberation of carbon; when exposed to moist air it will even double its weight
                    in the course of a few days, and on this account it is much employed as a
                    desiccating agent. Much heat is developed when it is mixed with water, as will
                    be evident from the following table, which represents the amounts of heat
                    developed on mixing one molecule of the acid (98 grammes) with <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The last number in the table represents the amount of heat which, according to
                    calculation, would be developed on mixing a molecule of sulphuric acid with an
                    infinitely large quantity of water. It will be seen that the addition of the
                    first two molecules is accompanied with the development of an amount of heat
                    equal to half the entire amount developed on adding an excess of water; this
                    appears to be accounted for by the formation of definite compounds of sulphuric
                    acid with water. The first of these <hi rend="italic">hydrates,</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, may be obtained crystallized in colourless
                    six-sided prisms, by cooling a mixture of the acid and water in these
                    proportions to about 8° C.; it boils at 205°-210° C., and may be produced by
                    evaporating any more dilute sulphuric acid at 205° C. until it ceases to lose
                    water. The second hydrate, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + 2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, may, in a
                    similar manner, be obtained by evaporating any more dilute acid at 100° C. until
                    it ceases to lose water; it boils at 193° C. The specific gravity of the first
                    hydrate is 1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 78, and that of the second 1∙62;
                    when water is added to the acid in the proportions to form the latter, the
                    maximum condensation (about 8 per cent.) is observed which occurs on mixing
                    these substances.</p>
                <p>Further evidence in support of the view that sulphuric acid forms definite
                    compounds with water which may be regarded as distinct acids is afforded by its
                    behaviour on neutralization, by the persistent manner in which many sulphates
                    retain one or two molecules of water, and by the existence of so-called basic
                    sulphates. Thus, when it is neutralized by sodium hydroxide, considerably less
                    heat is developed by the first than by the second molecule of hydroxide; this
                    behaviour does not appear remarkable if it be supposed that it exists in
                    solution in combination with water, and that, therefore, as in the case of
                    periodic acid, not only is hydrogen displaced by sodium on the addition of the
                    hydroxide, but the elements of one or more molecules of water are also
                    separated, the latter being an operation which necessarily would involve the
                    expenditure of energy, as the combination of the acid with water is attended
                    with the development of heat (see page 488).</p>

                    are produced by displacing the whole of the hydrogen. Many of the normal
                    sulphates crystallize with the same number of molecules of water, and are
                    isomorphous, as, for example—</p>

                <p>Five of the seven molecules of water are removed with facility from these salts,
                    but the sixth is less readily removed, especially from magnesium sulphate, and
                    they are not deprived of the seventh unless heated to 200°-300° C. Copper,
                    cadmium, and manganese sulphates behave similarly, and are only with difficulty
                    deprived of the last molecule of water. The last molecule retained with such

                    of these terms, or even to say that there is an absolute difference between the
                    so-called water of constitution and water of crystallization, and not merely one
                    of degree; but since we have independent evidence tending to prove the existence
                    of distinct acids formed by the combination of sulphuric acid with water, we may
                    conveniently regard the above-mentioned salts as derived from these acids.
                    Magnesium sulphate, for example, we may regard as the normal magnesium salt of

                <p>A large number of double and mixed salts formed by the union of two or more

                <p>It has-already been pointed out that sulphuric acid may be regarded as a compound
                    of the dyad radicle SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> with the monad radicle OH,

                    this view of its “constitution” being chiefly founded on its behaviour with the
                    chlorides of phosphorus. Thus, by the action of phosphorus pentachloride on
                    sulphuric acid, an atom of oxygen and an atom of hydrogen, in other words, the
                    group OH, are displaced by a single atom of chlorine—</p>

                    pentachloride, it is afforded by the behaviour of the compound SO <hi

                    obtained by the action of zinc on a solution of sulphurous acid, which dissolves

                    is a more stable substance, and is produced in a similar manner by the action of
                    zinc on a solution of sodium hydrogen sulphite. This salt crystallizes in
                    slender colourless needles; it is soluble in water, but insoluble in alcohol.
                    When exposed to the air in a moist state it becomes very hot, and is converted
                    by oxidation into hydrogen sodium sulphite, but in the dry state it is not
                    affected by oxygen. The remarkable observation has been made, however, that when
                    a solution of sodium hyposulphite is oxidized by free oxygen, that is to say,
                    when water saturated with oxygen is added to a solution of the hyposulphite,
                    only one-half the oxygen is employed in causing the conversion of the
                    hyposulphite into the sulphite, the remaining half becoming affixed to water,
                    forming hydrogen dioxide; the reaction may be expressed by the following

                <p>Hyposulphurous acid has a much greater decolorizing and reducing power than
                    sulphurous acid; it immediately reduces the metals from mercury and silver

                <p>Sodium thiosulphate is largely employed in photography for the purpose of
                    dissolving the chloride, bromide, and iodide of silver. These salts are readily
                    soluble in a solution of the thiosulphate until they are exposed to light, when
                    they become insoluble. If, therefore, a sheet of paper coated with one of these
                    silver salts be exposed to light under an object which is in part transparent
                    and in part opaque, such as a piece of lace, for example, the silver salt is
                    rendered insoluble in those parts upon which the light has fallen, and by then
                    immersing the paper in a solution of sodium thiosulphate the unaltered silver
                    salt is removed, and the picture is thus “fixed.” The solvent power of the
                    thiosulphate is due to the formation of a soluble silver sodium
                    thiosulphate—</p>

                <p>This acid is obtained by dissolving sulphuric anhydride in sulphuric acid in the

                    in large colourless transparent prisms. When gently heated it is decomposed into
                    sulphuric anhydride, which distils over, and sulphuric acid, which remains.
                    Water dissolves it, forming sulphuric acid.</p>
                <p>The so-called Nordhausen or fuming sulphuric acid consists chiefly of this acid.
                    It is prepared at Nordhausen, in Saxony, by distilling an impure ferric
                    sulphate, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi

                    distillate, consisting chiefly of sulphuric anhydride, being received in
                    sulphuric acid. This acid readily dissolves many hydrogenized carbon compounds
                    which are only with difficulty acted upon by ordinary sulphuric acid, converting
                    them into sulphonic acids; it is employed on this account to dissolve indigo,
                    and in the preparation of anthraquinonedisul phonic acid, from which alizarin is
                    artificially produced.</p>

                    sulphates with sulphuric anhydride; water decomposes them, forming corresponding

                <p>Potassium trithionate is produced, together with potassium thiosulphate, when a
                    saturated solution of hydrogen potassium sulphite is gently heated with sulphur;
                    it is not improbable that the thiosulphate is a secondary product, formed by the
                    action of hydrogen sulphide resulting from the action of the sulphur on the
                    hydrogen potassium sulphite—</p>

                <p>Trithionic acid may be obtained from a concentrated solution of the potassium
                    salt by precipitating the potassium by hydrofluosilicic acid. The solution has a
                    sour and somewhat bitter taste, and is inodorous; it is permanent in a dilute
                    state only, and on concentrating it in a vacuum over sulphuric acid it begins to
                    decompose, even at 0° C., sulphur dioxide being evolved, and sulphur deposited,
                    while sulphuric acid remains in solution. The salts of trithionic acid are but
                    little known; they are extremely unstable, and even when boiled with water are
                    decomposed and converted into sulphates, with evolution of sulphur dioxide and
                    deposition of sulphur—</p>

                    sulphurous and sulphuric acids. Its salts are all soluble in water, and are much
                    more stable than the trithionates, but for the most part their solutions cannot
                    be evaporated without decomposition.</p>

                    heat till it attains a specific gravity of 1*25-1'3, and may then be further
                    concentrated in a vacuum to the specific gravity of about 1 ’ 6. The solution is
                    colourless and inodorous, and has a strongly acid taste; it may be preserved
                    unchanged at ordinary temperatures, but on heating a concentrated solution of
                    the acid, hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide are evolved, sulphur is
                    deposited, and sulphuric acid remains.</p>
                <p>The salts of pentathionic acid are so unstable that it is difficult to obtain
                    them in the solid state. In their formation from the acid there is a great
                    tendency for the fifth atom of sulphur to be separated, tetrathionates being
                    produced, which have greater stability, and sometimes two atoms of sulphur are
                    given up and trithionates are formed.</p>
                <p>A number of the reactions involved in the formation of various sulphur compounds,
                    and also of a few selenium and tellurium compounds, have been submitted to
                    thermochemical investigation by Thomsen. The results deduced from his

                <p>it will be evident that the affinity of selenium to oxygen, as measured by the
                    heat developed, is less than that of sulphur to oxygen, and also less than that
                    of tellurium to oxygen. In this respect, therefore, sulphur, selenium, and
                    tellurium form a series corresponding to that in which chlorine, bromine, and
                    iodine may be arranged. Bromine, we have seen, is intermediate in its properties
                    between chlorine and iodine, and its atomic weight is also almost the mean of
                    the atomic weights of these two elements, and its affinity to oxygen is less
                    than that of either chlorine or iodine; the atomic weight of selenium, which is
                    intermediate in its properties between sulphur and tellurium, is also nearly the
                    mean of the atomic weights of these elements.</p>

                    deduced; thus, the only formulae by which the chlorides of sulphur can be
                    represented graphically are as follows :—</p>
                <p>Cl</p>
                <p>Cl—S—S—Cl Cl—S—Cl Cl—8—Cl</p>

                <p>Cl</p>
                <p>But the constitution of each of the oxides of sulphur may be expressed in two
                    ways, thus—</p>
                <p>S O—S—0</p>

                <p>0 II O=S=O O=S=O</p>
                <p>Sulphur dioxide. Sulphur trioxide.</p>
                <p>In like manner, two corresponding formulae may be assigned to each of the acids
                    formed by combining these oxides with the elements of a molecule of water.
                    Sulphuric acid, for instance, may be represented by either of the following
                    formulae—</p>
                <p>0</p>
                <p>II</p>

                <p>II o</p>
                <p>But as compounds in which two or more atoms of oxygen are directly united
                    together (for example, hydrogen dioxide, the higher oxides of chlorine, and
                    chloric acid, as to the constitution of which there can be little doubt as they
                    contain only monad elements associated with oxygen) readily decompose with
                    separation of oxygen, the first of these formulae for sulphuric acid appears
                    improbable on account of the stability of the acid and of most of the <pb

                    second formula be adopted, it follows that the formula which represents the
                    three atoms of oxygen in the trioxide as directly associated with the sulphur
                    atom is the more probable. It is probable that sulphur dioxide and sulphurous
                    acid are analogous in constitution to sulphur trioxide and sulphuric acid, and
                    from the manner in which hyposulphurous acid is formed from sulphurous acid we
                    may infer that it has the constitution represented by the second of the

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Nitrogen.</hi></p>
                <p>Symbol, N; Atomic wt., 14; Molecular wt., 28.</p>
                <p>Nitrogen in the free state constitutes about one-fifth by volume of the
                    atmosphere; in combination it occurs in nitrates and ammoniacal salts, and it
                    enters into the composition of all animal and vegetable tissues.</p>
                <p>It is best obtained from air by removing the oxygen by means of copper heated to
                    redness; the air being first led through a solution of potassic hydrate to free
                    it from carbon dioxide, and then through concentrated sulphuric acid to remove
                    moisture, and when thus purified, passed through a tube containing metallic
                    copper heated to dull redness. By passing a mixture of air and ammonia over
                    heated copper, the copper oxide is reduced as fast as it is formed, and a short
                    length of copper suffices for the preparation of an indefinite quantity of
                    nitrogen; thus—</p>
                <p>2Cu + O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2CuO, 3CuO + 2NH <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi> = N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 3H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                    + 3Cu.</p>
                <p>The supply of air is easily regulated, as an excess shows itself by tarnishing
                    the surface of the copper.</p>
                <p>The easiest method of obtaining pure nitrogen is to heat a solution of ammonium
                    nitrate, which splits up into nitrogen and water: NO <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> = N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2H
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. But as this salt is difficult to prepare, it
                    is better to substitute for it a mixture of potassium nitrate and ammonium
                    chloride, which together produce ammonium nitrate and potassium chloride—</p>
                <p>KNO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> C1 = NH <hi

                <p>Nitrogen is a colourless, inodorous, tasteless, incondensable gas; it is only
                    very sparingly soluble in water, 100 volumes of water at 15° C. dissolving about
                    one and a half volumes of nitrogen. It is incombustible, and does not support
                    the combustion of ordinary combustibles; it is not poisonous, but an animal
                    immersed in it dies simply for want of oxygen. Nitrogen evinces but little
                    tendency to enter into reaction with other elements; titanium, tungsten,
                    vanadium, and probably a few others combine directly with it, however, but its
                    compounds are mostly produced by indirect means.</p>
                <p>Atmospheric air consists not only of nitrogen and oxygen, which are its chief
                    constituents, but besides these contains carbon dioxide, ammonia, water vapour,
                    &amp;c.; solid substances, such as common salt, are also frequently held in
                    suspension by it, especially in the neighbourhood of the sea and of towns. Air
                    from which all other constituents are removed does not always exhibit the same
                    composition, however, although the variations are very slight; usually in pure
                    air the proportion of oxygen is from 20 ’ 9 to 21 volumes in 100 of air, but
                    considerably less oxygen has been found in air from confined spaces and in a few
                    samples collected in warm countries. Full information on this subject may be
                    obtained from Dr Angus Smith’s work on Air and Rain.</p>
                <p>The fact, however, that oxygen and nitrogen are not always contained in air in
                    the same proportions is alone a sufficient proof that they are not combined, but
                    only mixed together, as the constituents of a compound always occur in
                    invariable proportions. This conclusion is confirmed in many ways. Thus, the
                    proportions in which nitrogen and oxygen are present in air are not those of
                    their atomic weights, nor do they bear any simple relation to them. We know also
                    that when gases enter into reaction to form new compounds their combination is
                    usually attended with an alteration of volume, and heat is developed; moreover,
                    the resulting compound possesses properties which differ strikingly from those
                    of its constituents. But when oxygen and nitrogen are mixed together in the
                    proportions in which they are present in air, neither is any alteration in
                    volume, observed, nor is heat developed; and the properties of the resulting
                    mixture are precisely those of air, and just such as we should expect to result
                    from the admixture of a gas which very readily supports combustion with one in
                    which combustion is impossible. Again, were air a compound it should dissolve in
                    water as such, or in other words, the proportion of oxygen and nitrogen in the
                    dissolved air should· be the same as in the undissolved air; but if a mixture,
                    the more soluble constituent should dissolve the more readily, and relatively
                    more oxygen than nitrogen should dissolve, since oxygen is more soluble than
                    nitrogen. Experiment proves that the latter is the case, for if water which has
                    been recently boiled to free it from dissolved gases and allowed to cool out of
                    contact with air be shaken with air, and the dissolved air be then expelled from
                    it by heating, and collected, it is found on analysis to contain 32 instead of
                    only 21 per cent, by volume of oxygen. Lastly, we have seen (p. 481) that the
                    oxygen may be to a great extent separated from the nitrogen by a mechanical
                    process by submitting air to filtration through a thin caoutchouc membrane.</p>
                <p>It is impossible for animals to live for any length of time in pure oxygen,
                    apparently because oxidation takes place so rapidly that the animal is incapable
                    of assimilating sufficient food to supply the waste; but by admixture with the
                    perfectly neutral nitrogen the activity of the oxygen becomes greatly
                    diminished.</p>
                <p>Air from open places contains usually from 3 to 6 volumes of carbon dioxide in
                    10,000 volumes, but the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is subject to
                    continual change, although within narrow limits. It does not continually
                    increase in amount, notwithstanding that animals expire carbon dioxide, and that
                    large quantities are produced by the combustion of wood and coal, because plants
                    exercise a power which is the reverse of that of which animals are possessed,
                    viz., that of decomposing carbon dioxide and restoring its oxygen to the
                    atmosphere.</p>

                    very imperfect, however. It is also obtained by the action of nascent hydrogen
                    on nitric acid and many of its salts; but it is always prepared by heating an
                    ammonium salt with an alkaline hydroxide, ammonium chloride and calcium

                <p>Ammonia is a product of the decay of all nitrogenous animal and vegetable
                    substances, and the ammonia present in the atmosphere is chiefly if not entirely
                    derived from this source; but it appears not improbable that ammonia is directly
                    produced in the atmosphere by the decomposition of water into its elements by
                    the electric discharge, and the combination also under the influence of the
                    discharge of the hydrogen thus produced with nitrogen. Ammonia is present in the
                    atmosphere apparently as carbonate, and in rain-water, especially in that of
                    thunder showers, as nitrate and nitrite. Ammonia salts are sometimes found as
                    minerals, chiefly in volcanic districts. The source from which ammonia salts are
                    now obtained, however, is the watery liquid which distils over in the
                    manufacture of coal gas; the ammonia is liberated from this liquid by heating it
                    with slaked lime, and by receiving it in sulphuric acid ammonium sulphate is
                    produced,—a salt which is largely employed as an artificial manure.</p>
                <p>Ammonia is a transparent colourless gas, of a very pungent peculiar odour, and a
                    burning taste. It may be reduced to the liquid state by a pressure of about 17
                    atmospheres at the ordinary temperature, or by cold alone at about - 50° to -
                    40° C.; by exposing the dry gas to a cold of — 75° C. and a pressure of 20
                    atmospheres, Faraday obtained ammonia as a white transparent crystalline body,
                    melting at — 75° C. It does not support combustion, and is only feebly
                    combustible. It is decomposed into its elements by a succession of electric
                    sparks.</p>
                <p>Ammonia is dissolved by water with great avidity, much heat being developed and
                    great expansion taking place; according to Roscoe and Dittmar, 1 gramme of water
                    at 0° C. dissolves no less than ’ 875 gramme of ammonia. The solution has the
                    smell and taste of the gas, and a powerfully alkaline reaction; it loses almost
                    all its ammonia below 100° C.</p>
                <p>Ammonia completely neutralizes acids, forming definite crystalline salts, known
                    as ammonium salts, which are formed by the direct combination of ammonia with
                    the acids; ammonia and hydrochloric acid, for example, form ammonium chloride,
                    NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> C1 = NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + HC1,
                    whilst ammonia and sulphuric acid furnish ammonium sulphate, (NH <hi

                    of these salts, it will be evident, is analogous to that of the salts of the
                    metals generally if we regard them as derived from the acids by the displacement
                    of the hydrogen of the latter by the monad compound radicle <hi rend="italic"
                        >ammonium,</hi> NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, and this view is confirmed
                    by the observation that the ammonium salts are isomorphous with the
                    corresponding potassium salts. They are all soluble in water, and are readily
                    decomposed by the alkaline hydroxides, and by most basic oxides, with evolution
                    of ammonia.</p>
                <p>The solution of ammonia in water is frequently regarded as the hydroxide of the
                    hypothetical radicle ammonium, that is to say, as a solution of ammonium
                    hydroxide, NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>.OH, the analogue of potassium
                    hydroxide, KOH. But Thomsen has shown that considerably less heat is developed
                    when an acid is neutralized by a solution of ammonia than when it is neutralized
                    by a solution of an alkaline hydroxide, such as potassium hydroxide, for
                    example, the reaction KHOAq, HCLAq being accompanied by the development of
                    27,500 units of heat, whilst only 24,500 are developed in the reaction NH <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> Aq, HClAq. Thomsen is inclined to regard this
                    result as evidence that ammonia exists as such iu its aqueous solution, and not
                    as the hydroxide NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>.OH, but the difference observed
                    appears scarcely sufficient to warrant this conclusion iu the face of the
                    chemical evidence which points to the existence of an ammonium hydroxide; it is
                    more probable, perhaps, that an aqueous solution of ammonia consists in part of

                    negative radicles so-called <hi rend="italic">imides</hi> are produced. A simple
                    instance of the formation of an amine derivative is afforded by the action which
                    takes place when potassium is heated in an atmosphere of ammonia—</p>

                <p>By digesting iodine in an excess of aqueous ammonia a black explosive compound is
                    produced, which apparently is formed by the displacement of two of the atoms of
                    hydrogen by iodine—</p>

                <p>It may be exploded by friction evèn under water, and in the dry state can
                    scarcely be touched without exploding. When chlorine is passed into an aqueous
                    solution of ammonia, nitrogen is evolved and ammonium chloride is produced;
                    thus—</p>

                <p>If the action of the chlorine be continued after the whole of the ammonia is thus
                    acted upon, the ammonium chloride becomes attacked, and yellow oily drops of the
                    so-called chloride of nitrogen are formed. The composition of this substance has
                    not yet been satisfactorily ascertained; it probably contains hydrogen, and its
                    formula is supposed to be NHC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, but it is not
                    unlikely that the compound NC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> is also produced. It
                    explodes with extreme violence when heated, or when brought in contact with
                    fatty matters, or with turpentine, phosphorus, and many other substances.</p>

                <p>This acid is now usually prepared by distilling sodium nitrate or Chili
                    saltpetre, a salt which occurs abundantly in South America, with concentrated
                    sulphuric acid in the proportions indicated by the equation—</p>

                <p>When potassic nitrate is employed, it is advantageous to use double the quantity
                    of sulphuric acid; thus —</p>

                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> is so great that a considerable amount of the acid
                    is decomposed.</p>
                <p>The acid passes over as an almost colourless liquid in the middle of the process,
                    but is coloured at the beginning and end by decomposition products. To obtain
                    the pure acid, it is mixed with an equal bulk of concentrated sulphuric acid,
                    and the mixture distilled; the first portions of the distillate are collected,
                    and a current of dry air passed for several hours through the liquid, which is
                    gently warmed and sheltered from strong daylight.</p>
                <p>Pure nitric acid is a colourless, mobile, fuming liquid, of the specific gravity
                    1 *53 at 15° C.; it solidifies at about 55° C. It is an extremely unstable
                    substance, and cannot be distilled without experiencing partial decomposition;
                    it is also decomposed when exposed to sunlight, becoming yellow, and oxygen
                    being evolved. It begins to boil at 86° C., but the temperature rises gradually,
                    and oxygen and red fumes of oxides of nitrogen are evolved; when the boiling
                    point reaches about 123° C., an aqueous acid, having a specific gravity of about
                    1 ’ 42, and containing about 68 per cent, of nitric acid, distils unchanged, and
                    weaker and stronger acids may alike be reduced to this strength by boiling. As
                    in the case of other aqueous acids, however, the composition of nitric acid of
                    constant boiling point varies with the pressure under which ebullition takes
                    place.</p>
                <p>The addition of water to nitric acid causes the development of heat. The

                    dissolving the metallic oxides, hydroxides, or carbonates in diluted nitric
                    acid; they are all soluble in water. The most important nitrate is that of
                    potassium, which is employed in the manufacture of gunpowder.</p>
                <p>Nitric acid is an extremely powerful oxidizing agent, and one of the most
                    corrosive substances known; it rapidly destroys all animal textures and most
                    vegetable products, and even if diluted it stains the skin, wool, and all
                    albuminous substances a bright yellow colour. Many hydrogenized carbon compounds
                    are converted by it into so-called nitro-derivatives, one or more atoms of
                    hydrogen being displaced by the monad compound radicle NO <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi>; the hydrocarbon benzene, for example, when added to the concentrated
                    acid yields nitrobenzene—</p>

                <p>Most metals, excepting gold, platinum, rhodium, iridium, titanium, and perhaps a
                    few others, are more or less readily acted on by nitric acid and converted into
                    nitrates; but the non-metallic elements and metalloids—iodine, sulphur,
                    selenium, tellurium, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, amorphous boron and carbon,
                    and tungsten—are oxidized by it, and furnish iodic, sulphuric, selenious,
                    tellurous, phosphoric, arsenic, antimonic, boric, carbonic, and tungstic
                    acids.</p>
                <p>The action of nitric acid on metals, however, is much influenced by temperature
                    and concentration. An acid of the specific gravity 1 ’ 25 to 1 ’ 35 is usually
                    the most active. The pure concentrated acid is without action on bismuth, iron,
                    tin, and many other metals at ordinary temperatures. Thus, a piece of bright
                    iron is at once attacked by an acid of about the specific gravity 1'35, but it
                    maybe preserved in acid of the specific gravity I *45 without losing its
                    brilliancy; what is more remarkable, however, is that by plunging it into the
                    more concentrated acid it is rendered <hi rend="italic">passive</hi> to the
                    action of the weaker acid, for on removing it and at once introducing it into
                    the weaker acid, no action is observed, although on diluting the acid below 1
                    ‘35 the iron is attacked.</p>
                <p>In order, however, to understand the behaviour of nitric acid with metals, it is
                    necessary that we should first consider the action of metals upon acids
                    generally. There is little doubt that in all cases the metal simply displaces
                    the hydrogen of the acid, forming a salt; and if, under the conditions under
                    which the experiment is made, the acid has no tendency to enter into reaction
                    with the hydrogen which is displaced, whilst it is in the nascent state,
                    hydrogen is also evolved; but if the acid can enter into reaction with the
                    nascent hydrogen the products of this secondary reaction are obtained instead.
                    For example, zinc readily dissolves in cold diluted sulphuric acid, forming zinc
                    sulphate, and hydrogen is evolved since it is without action on sulphuric acid
                    under these conditions—</p>
                <p>Zn + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> = ZnSO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>But when zinc and <hi rend="italic">concentrated</hi> sulphuric acid are heated
                    together, zinc sulphate and sulphur dioxide are obtained, and no hydrogen is
                    evolved. In this case, the hydrogen is displaced from the sulphuric acid under
                    conditions which are favourable to its action upon the acid, and it deprives the
                    acid of a portion of its oxygen, forming sulphurous acid, which is at once
                    resolved into water and sulphur dioxide.</p>
                <p>The behaviour of nitric acid with metals is precisely similar to that of zinc
                    with heated concentrated sulphuric acid, nitric acid being a substance which
                    with the greatest <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n523/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0523-0512"/> readiness may be deprived of its oxygen by
                    the action of nascent hydrogen. In fact, hydrogen is never evolved by the action
                    of metals on nitric acid, but instead oxides of nitrogen, nitrogen itself,
                    ammonia, and other products of secondary reaction are obtained. The formation of
                    these products is due to a somewhat complex series of reactions, which most
                    probably are as follows. In the first place, by the removal of one of the atoms
                    of oxygen the nitric acid is converted into nitrous acid, HNO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> by further reduction this acid furnishes the
                    so-called hyponitrous acid, HNO; and by the continued action of the nascent
                    hydrogen the hyponitrous acid is converted into hydroxylamine or oxyammonia, NH
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH), which finally is reduced to ammonia, NH
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. The reactions which successively occur in the
                    formation of these compounds are represented by the following equations :—</p>

                <p>But the products of these reactions enter into reaction with each other, and are
                    decomposed, and thus the gases are produced which are evolved when metals are
                    dissolved in nitric acid. The nitric oxide doubtless results chiefly from the
                    decomposition of the nitrous acid in the manner represented by the equation—</p>

                <p>The nitrous oxide may be produced in two ways :—from ∙hyponitrous acid, which

                <p>The nitrogen produced is probably formed in a similar manner by the action of the

                    also, together with nitric oxide, by the action of nitric acid on hyponitrous
                    acid.</p>
                <p>As the product of the action of nitric acid on a metal is always a mixture, it is

                <p>It is difficult at present to explain the remarkable difference in the behaviour
                    of the various metals with nitric acid which this table indicates. As we have
                    stated above, the action of the metal probably consists simply in displacing the
                    hydrogen of the acid, and the gases evolved are the more or less direct products
                    of the action of the hydrogen so displaced at the moment of liberation on the
                    acid which is always present in excess. The question, therefore, that we have to
                    consider is, Why does the hydrogen displaced from nitric acid by different
                    metals produce such very different effects î If the behaviour of closely related
                    metals such as magnesium, zinc, and cadmium be compared, it is evident that
                    magnesium is the most active, since it produces a relatively smaller quantity of
                    nitric oxide, and relatively larger quantities of nitrous oxide and nitrogen,
                    than either zinc or cadmium, cadmium being the least active; in other words, the
                    reduction of the nitric acid is most perfect when it is effected by the hydrogen
                    displaced by the aid of magnesium, and. least perfect when it is effected by the
                    aid of cadmium. We know that when these metals act upon acids which are not
                    attacked by nascent hydrogen, such as hydrochloric acid, for example, different
                    amounts of heat are developed, most heat being developed by the action of
                    magnesium, and least by the action of cadmium. But since the mere displacement
                    of hydrogen in hydrochloric acid by different metals is attended with the
                    development of different amounts of heat, it appears probable that the same will
                    be the case with nitric acid, and also that more heat would be developed in the
                    reaction</p>

                <p>than in the corresponding reactions with either zinc or cadmium; and that on this
                    account the reduction of nitric acid is carried furthest when magnesium is
                    employed, and further with zinc than with cadmium. Whether this explanation is
                    applicable to the action of metals generally there is not sufficient evidence at
                    present to show.</p>

                <p>This gas is obtained in a pure state by carefully heating ammonium nitrate, which
                    at a temperature between 200° and 250° C. breaks up into water and nitrous

                <p>It is the chief constituent of the gas produced on dissolving magnesium, zinc,
                    tin, nickel, or cobalt in nitric acid, and it is also furnished, but to a less
                    extent, by other metals. . .. ,</p>
                <p>Nitrous oxide is a transparent colourless gas, possessing a faint sweetish smell
                    and taste; it may be condensed by a pressure of about 50 atmospheres at 7° C. to
                    a colourless liquid, and even frozen by the cold produced by its own
                    evaporation. By exposing a mixture of liquid nitrous oxide and carbon disulphide
                    to evaporation in vacuo, Natterer obtained a reduction of temperature which he
                    estimated at - 140° C., which is lower than has been obtained by any other
                    means. 100 volumes of water at 0° C. dissolve 130 of nitrous oxide, but the
                    solubility diminishes rapidly as the temperature rises. It supports the
                    combustion of bodies almost, if not quite, as well as oxygen, but is readily
                    distinguished from that gas by its solubility in water, and by not forming red
                    fumes when mixed with nitric oxide gas.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable property which nitrous oxide gas possesses is that of causing
                    loss of sensibility in animals. When respired for a short time it produces a
                    singular species of transient intoxication, attended in many instances with an
                    irresistible tendency to muscular exertion, and often to uncontrollable
                    laughter; hence it has acquired the name of <hi rend="italic">laughing gas.</hi>
                    It is now largely used as an anaesthetic for producing insensibility to pain
                    during surgical operations, and especially in the extraction of teeth.</p>

                <p>This gas is one of the products of the action of nitric acid on metals; the gas
                    obtained on dissolving copper in moderately concentrated nitric acid contains at
                    first about 97 per cent, of nitric oxide, but as the action proceeds and cupric
                    nitrate accumulates in the solution, the proportion of nitric oxide evolved
                    diminishes, whilst that of nitrous oxide increases. This appears to be due to
                    the alternate reduction of the cupric nitrate to cuprous nitrate—</p>

                <p>Pure nitric oxide may be prepared by gently heating a mixture of a ferrous salt,

                    sulphuric acid and potassium or sodium nitrate. The nitric acid liberated from
                    the nitrate is reduced by the ferrous salt, which is oxidized to a ferric salt,
                    and nitric oxide is evolved—</p>

                <p>Nitric oxide is a colourless, transparent, uncondensable gas, almost insoluble in
                    water; it is the most stable of the oxides of nitrogen, and may even be exposed
                    to a red heat without undergoing decomposition. A lighted taper and phosphorus
                    just kindled are extinguished by it, but if the phosphorus be burning vigorously
                    when introduced into the gas the temperature is then sufficiently high to enable
                    it to decompose the gas into its elements, and it continues to burn as
                    brilliantly as in pure oxygen.</p>
                <p>Nitric oxide immediately combines with oxygen when mixed with it, forming deep
                    red fumes of higher oxides of nitrogen. It is perfectly absorbed by a solution
                    of ferrous chloride or sulphate, which it turns black; when the solution is
                    heated, most of the nitric oxide is expelled from it unchanged, and in this way
                    nitric oxide may be separated from other gases insoluble in solutions of the
                    ferrous salts. Nitric oxide is absorbed by nitric acid, and apparently nitrous
                    acid is produced—</p>

                <p>It combines directly with chlorine, forming the compound NOC1, or nitrosyl
                    chloride, which is also produced together with chlorine when a mixture of
                    concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids—the so-called aqua regia—is

                    be condensed to a deep blue coloured liquid, which begins to boil at about 2°
                    C., but is decomposed into nitric oxide and peroxide. It combines readily at

                <p>At low temperatures it forms colourless prismatic crystals, which melt at - 9°
                    C.; at this temperature the liquid oxide is almost colourless, but it assumes a
                    yellow colour, increasing in depth up to its boiling point. It boils at about
                    25° C., yielding a brownish-red vapour, the depth of which also increases with
                    the temperature, until at 40° C. it is so dark as to be almost opaque. The
                    vapour of nitric peroxide, however, probably even at temperatures below its
                    boiling point, is a mixture of the compound N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi

                <p>Although oxygen and nitrogen do not directly combine, when a succession of
                    electric sparks is passed through a mixture of the two gases confined over
                    water, red fumes are produced which dissolve in the water, forming nitric and
                    nitrous acids. The nitrite and nitrate present in the atmosphere and in
                    rain-water are doubtless formed in this manner.</p>
                <p>On adding an acid to a nitrite, nitrous acid is liberated, but at once decomposes
                    with evolution of nitric oxide—</p>

                <p>Nitrous acid can only exist, in fact, in presence of a large quantity of water,
                    or of nitric acid. It parts with its oxygen more readily, and is therefore a
                    more powerful oxidizing agent, than nitric acid. It also appears to act more
                    readily than nitric acid upon many metals. Thus, pure nitric acid is almost
                    without action upon silver, but on passing a few bubbles of nitric oxide gas
                    into the acid, and thus producing a minute quantity of nitrous acid, the metal
                    is at once attacked, and is dissolved more and more rapidly the longer the
                    action continues, doubtless because the hydrogen displaced from the acid by the
                    silver reduces nitric acid to nitrous acid, so that the more silver is dissolved
                    the richer the solution becomes in nitrous acid. Platinum also, which is
                    insoluble in nitric acid, is dissolved by nitrous acid.</p>
                <p>On some hydrogenized carbon compounds nitrous acid exerts an action similar to
                    that of nitric acid, and causes the displacement of hydrogen by the monad
                    compound radicle NO, producing mïroso-compounds. Thus—</p>

                <p>Nitrous acid readily absorbs oxygen, and is converted into nitric acid. The
                    nitrites are also converted into nitrates when exposed in the moist state to
                    air. Nitrous acid is easily distinguished from nitric acid by its power of
                    liberating iodine from iodides, by the readiness with which it destroys the blue
                    colour of a solution of indigo at ordinary temperatures, and by its decolorizing
                    a solution of potassium permanganate,—nitric acid being without the power of
                    liberating iodine from iodides, or of bleaching permanganate solution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hyponitrous Acid,</hi> HNO.</p>
                <p>When sodium is added to a solution of sodium nitrate, the hydrogen displaced from
                    the water by the sodium reduces the nitrate to nitrite, which in its turn
                    undergoes further reduction to the hyponitrite, NaNO. On rendering the solution
                    slightly acid with acetic acid, and adding silver nitrate, a yellow pulverulent
                    precipitate of silver hyponitrite, AgNO, is produced. It is insoluble in water,
                    and almost insoluble in acetic acid, but is soluble in either dilute nitric or
                    sulphuric acid, and without immediate decomposition. Moderately diluted nitric,
                    sulphuric, or hydrochloric acid decomposes it with the evolution of nitrogen,
                    and the production of apparently both nitrous and nitric acids in the solution.
                    It is immediately oxidized by concentrated nitric acid. A solution of the sodium
                    salt acidified with acetic or hydrochloric acid decolorizes potassium
                    permanganate; it does not liberate iodine from iodides, however, but on the
                    contrary decolorizes a solution of iodine. When the solution acidified with
                    acetic acid is heated, nitrous oxide is evolved.</p>

                <p>This compound is formed when nitric acid is added to a mixture of tin and
                    hydrochloric acid, the hydrogen produced by the action of the tin on the
                    hydrochloric acid reducing the nitric acid. It may also be formed by the direct
                    union of nitric oxide with hydrogen, namely, by passing a stream of nitric oxide
                    gas through a series of glass cylinders containing tin and hydrochloric acid,
                    together with a little platinum chloride solution, whereby hydrogen is produced
                    at ordinary temperatures.</p>
                <p>It is a very unstable substance, and can be obtained only in solution, but
                    well-crystallized <hi rend="italic">hydroxylammonium</hi> salts are formed by
                    its union with acids. Thus, the hydrochloride, NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    C1(OH), or NH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH). HC1, crystallizes from alcohol
                    in long spicular crystals, and from water in large irregular monoclinic prisms;
                    it melts at 100° C., but decomposes, with violent evolution of gas, into
                    nitrogen, ammonium chloride, water, and hydrochloric acid. A solution of
                    hydroxylamine has an alkaline reaction, and precipitates many metallic salts; it
                    decomposes quickly if concentrated, and gradually if dilute, with evolution of
                    nitrogen and formation of ammonia—</p>

                <p>Hydroxylamine is readily reduced tc ammonia by the action of the nascent hydrogen

                <p>It will be observed that a considerable amount of heat would be absorbed in the
                    formation of nitrous oxide from its elements; consequently, when this gas is
                    decomposed into its elements, heat is developed, and on this account it is
                    readily decomposed by burning bodies. This fact also explains the non-formation
                    of nitrous oxide from its elements. Probably, heat would also be absorbed in the
                    formation of nitric oxide from its elements. The absorption of heat is perhaps
                    necessary, because the amount of energy in the form of heat which can be
                    developed by the combination of nitrogen with oxygen to form nitrous and (1)
                    nitric oxides is less than must be expended in separating the atoms of oxygen of
                    the oxygen molecules from each other, and the atoms of nitrogen of the nitrogen
                    molecules from each other.</p>

                <p>This element never occurs in the free state, but is always found in combination
                    as a salt of phosphoric acid. Considerable deposits of more or less pure calcium
                    phosphate occur in a few places, and phosphates are found in minute proportions
                    in most rocks and in soils, and in river and spring waters. Phosphates are
                    necessary to the life of all plants and animals. In plants they accumulate
                    chiefly in the seed; in animals they accumulate in the bones, of which calcium
                    phosphate is the chief earthy constituent, but they are also an important
                    element of blood and nervous tissue.</p>
                <p>Phosphorus was discovered in 1669 by Brandt of Hamburg, who obtained it by
                    distilling the residue of evaporated urine with charcoal. Scheele in 1775,
                    however, was the first who devised a process for its extraction from bones, and
                    it has always since been prepared from this source. The bones are burnt to a
                    white ash, which is finely powdered and mixed with a sufficient quantity of
                    diluted sulphuric acid to displace by hydrogen two-thirds of the calcium in the

                <p>The solution of monocalcium phosphate, or superphosphate of lime as it is

                    weight of charcoal powder, and heated gradually to dull redness in an iron pot
                    with constant stirring. By this means the elements of two molecules of water are
                    removed, the monocalcium phosphate being converted into calcium

                <p>The crude phosphorus which is produced is usually purified by adding a mixture of
                    potassium chromate and sulphuric acid to it when in a melted state. The
                    impurities are thus oxidized, and rise to the surface in the form of a scum, and
                    the pure phosphorus remains colourless and transparent at the bottom of the
                    vessel.</p>
                <p>Freshly-prepared phosphorus is almost perfectly transparent and colourless, or
                    has, at most, a faint yellow tinge. It melts at 44° C., forming a viscid oily
                    liquid, and boils at 290° C. Its vapour at a temperature of 1040° C. is about 62
                    times as heavy as hydrogen gas, and hence, as the atomic weight of phosphorus is
                    about 31, it appears that the molecule of gaseous phosphorus is tetratomic.
                    Phosphorus has a specific gravity of about 1 ’ 82. It is a non-conductor of heat
                    and electricity. It is insoluble in water, but freely soluble in carbon
                    disulphide, phosphorus trichloride, and sulphur chloride, S <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 2</hi> C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. It crystallizes in forms of the
                    regular system.</p>
                <p>Phosphorus is extremely inflammable, taking fire in the open air at a temperature
                    very little above its melting point; if it contains impurities, it inflames
                    still more easily. It gradually absorbs oxygen when exposed to the air at
                    ordinary temperatures, giving off a white vapour, which has a peculiar garlic
                    odour; in presence of moisture phosphorous acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    PO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and phosphoric acid, H <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi> PO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, are produced.</p>
                <p>Phosphorus, like sulphur, can exist in several allotropic modifications, the most
                    remarkable being that produced by exposing ordinary phosphorus to light, or by
                    heating it for some hours to a temperature of about 240° C. in an atmosphere
                    free from oxygen. It is thus converted into a red amorphous substance, which is
                    insoluble in carbon disulphide, and may be heated to 250° C. without alteration,
                    but at 260° C., under the ordinary pressure, it is reconverted into ordinary
                    phosphorus. The red modification has a much higher specific gravity (2 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 14) than ordinary phosphorus, and it is also
                    distinguished by its inertness as compared with the latter; thus, it is not
                    oxidized in the air at common temperatures, and it emits no odour. The
                    transformation of ordinary phosphorus into this variety is attended with
                    development of heat. Troost and Hautefeuille have shown that the formation of
                    the red modification is governed by different laws according as the phosphorus
                    is in the state of gas or liquid, and that it takes place much more rapidly in
                    the latter case. When the tension of the vapour becomes diminished to a certain
                    minimum value, varying for each temperature, the transformation ceases; this <hi
                        rend="italic">tension of transformation</hi> is established only after some
                    time. Liquid phosphorus at 280° C., for instance, becomes wholly transformed
                    into red phosphorus. The vapour given off at 260° C. is stable, but that formed
                    at higher temperatures becomes slowly and partially converted into red
                    phosphorus, the production of which ceases when the tension attains a given
                    minimum; the rapidity with which this change takes place is greater the higher
                    the temperature. At temperatures up to 520° C., however, the maximum tensions of
                    phosphorus vapour are much higher than the tensions of transformation; thus, at
                    360° C. the tension of transformation is '6 atmosphere, but to prevent
                    phosphorus boiling at this temperature, a pressure of 3'2 atmospheres must be
                    exerted. Above 520° C. the maximum tension is not established on account of the
                    rapidity with which the transformation takes place; and at temperatures above
                    550° C. the tension observed is no greater than the tension of transformation,
                    because the transformation of the liquid phosphorus takes place more rapidly
                    than its evaporation. The observed maximum tension and tension of transformation
                    at different temperatures are given in the following table :—</p>

                <p>The red phosphorus produced by heating ordinary phosphorus in closed vessels
                    differs, however, in appearance according to the temperature at which it is
                    prepared. That obtained at 265° C. has a bright red colour and glassy fracture;
                    that produced at 440° C. is orange-yellow in colour, and exhibits a dull
                    fracture; at 500° C. it is denser, and has a violet grey colour; and, lastly,
                    that prepared at 580° C. has a conchoidal fracture, exhibits signs of commencing
                    fusion, and often encloses ruby red crystals. These modifications differ also in
                    specific gravity, and when oxidized to phosphoric acid by iodic acid solution
                    they develop different amounts of heat. Thus—</p>

                <p>Hydrogen, except in the nascent state, appears to be without action on
                    phosphorus. Oxygen forms the two oxides P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> and P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine enter directly into
                    reaction with ordinary phosphorus, the combination being attended with
                    inflammation; red phosphorus also enters into reaction with these elements at
                    ordinary temperatures, and heat is developed, although to a much less extent.
                    When sulphur and ordinary phosphorus are melted together, combination takes
                    place with great violence, and the experiment of bringing the two bodies
                    together is attended with much danger. If dissolved in carbon disulphide, they
                    are without action upon each other. Red phosphorus readily enters into reaction
                    with sulphur when a mixture of the two substances is gently warmed, and although
                    much heat is developed by their combination, the reaction is not explosively
                    violent. Selenium also unites with phosphorus when the two are heated together
                    nearly to the boiling point of the latter. Most metals combine with phosphorus
                    when they are heated in its vapour, or when it is thrown upon them whilst they
                    are in a state of ignition.</p>

                    sparingly soluble in water, the solution being neutral to test paper. Phosphine
                    is extremely inflammable, igniting at a temperature a little above 100’ C.;
                    contact with a drop of fuming nitric acid, or with chlorine or bromine, also
                    causes it to inflame. A mixture of the gas with oxygen standing over water is
                    gradually absorbed, and phosphorous acid produced. It is a powerful reducing
                    agent, withdrawing oxygen with great readiness from bodies like nitric oxide,
                    sulphur dioxide, and sulphuric acid. It precipitates many metallic salts, the
                    precipitate in most cases consisting either of metallic phosphide, as in the
                    case of copper, or of reduced metal, as in the case of gold and silver. It
                    combines with hydriodic acid, forming phosphonium iodide, PH <hi

                <p>The gas obtained by the first and second methods is spontaneously inflammable,
                    owing to the presence of liquid hydrogen phosphide, which may be separated by

                    composed by the passage of electric sparks, even when mixed with oxygen or

                    phosphorus,—a liquid trichloride, PC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and a solid
                    pentachloride, PC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. Bromine in like manner forms a

                <p>Phosphorus trichloride boils at 76° C., and the tribromide is also volatile
                    without decomposition, but the remaining chlorine and bromine compounds of

                <p>The haloid compounds of phosphorus are all readily decomposed by water. The

                    oxybromide, two of the atoms of halogen being displaced by a single atom of

                <p>The behaviour of the trihaloid compounds of phosphorus is analogous to that of

                <p>The compounds containing more than five atoms of halogen behave as mixtures of

                    resolved into phosphine and phosphoric acid when heated. Its solution is
                    oxidized on exposure to the air. It is a powerful reducing agent, precipitating
                    silver, gold, and mercury from their salts, but it does not form copper hydride
                    with copper sulphate. Iron and zinc dissolve in a solution of phosphorous acid
                    with evolution of phosphine, a portion of the acid being reduced by the hydrogen

                    mass, which dissolves slowly though somewhat abundantly in water, forming a
                    strongly acid liquid; but the solution is very unstable, and is converted
                    gradually at ordinary temperatures, and rapidly on heating, into phosphoric
                    acid. Metaphosphoric acfd is an extremely stable body; it volatilizes completely

                <p>and in various other ways, are remarkable for exhibiting very different
                    properties according to the manner in which they are prepared. Thus, ordinary
                    sodium metaphosphate, obtained by igniting sodium phosphate and sudden cooling,
                    forms a vitreous mass, the aqueous solution of which gives gelatinous
                    precipitates with the salts of the heavy metals. But when a considerable
                    quantity of ordinary fused sodium metaphosphate is allowed to cool very slowly,
                    a crystalline mass results, and on digesting this in a slight excess of warm
                    water the liquid separates into two layers, one containing a crystalline sodium
                    metaphosphate, and the other the ordinary vitreous salt. By heating copper oxide
                    and a slight excess of phosphoric acid together to 350° C., a crystalline powder
                    is formed, insoluble in water; and by treating this copper salt with sodium
                    sulphide another crystalline sodium metaphosphate is produced. If oxide of lead
                    be employed, and the resulting lead salt decomposed with sodium sulphide, a
                    sodium metaphosphate is obtained which forms with water a gummy mass, which will
                    not pass through a filter. Lastly, a fifth variety of metaphosphates, remarkable
                    for their insolubility in water, are formed by adding phosphoric acid in excess
                    to solutions of sulphates or nitrates, evaporating to dryness, and heating the
                    residue to 316° C. or upwards. They are crystalline powders.</p>
                <p>These different metaphosphates are generally regarded as polymeric compounds,
                    that is to say, as compounds having different molecular weights although of the
                    same empirical composition; and the attempt has been made to infer their
                    formulae from the relative number of atoms of the two metals contained in the
                    mixed salts derived from them. Thus, the sodium in ordinary sodium metaphosphate
                    may be partially displaced by another metal, and a mixed salt produced
                    containing the two metals in the ratio of 5 atoms of the one monad metal to 1
                    atom of the other; hence it is concluded that ordinary sodium metaphosphate is a

                    O <hi rend="subscript"> 18</hi>. The mixed salts derived from the second variety
                    of sodium metaphosphate above described contain the two metals in the ratio of 2
                    atoms of the one monad metal to 1 atom of another, and are therefore regarded as
                    trimetaphosphates, the sodium salt being represented by the formula Na <hi

                    neutralization it gives a white precipitate with the latter. Metaphosphoric acid
                    coagulates albumen, and gives a white precipitate with silver nitrate; and
                    phosphoric acid does not coagulate albumen, and when neutralized gives a yellow

                <p>This element always occurs in the combined state as boric acid, or as a salt of
                    boric acid. Two modifications of boron may be obtained, viz., an amorphous and a
                    crystalline modification; the former is produced by reducing boric anhydride, B
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, by heating it
                    with sodium, and the latter is formed when the reduction is effected by the aid
                    of aluminium at a very high temperature.</p>
                <p>Amorphous boron is a dark brown powder; it does not oxidize in the air at
                    ordinary temperatures, but when heated it burns in air or oxygen, in the latter
                    with dazzling brightness, forming the oxide B <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. By ignition in an atmosphere of nitrogen it is
                    converted into a white amorphous boron nitride, BN. It does not decompose water,
                    even at the boiling heat, but readily dissolves in nitric acid, producing .boric
                    acid; when heated with potassium hydroxide it forms a potassium borate, hydrogen
                    being evolved.</p>
                <p>On heating amorphous boron with aluminium it is dissolved, and crystallizes from
                    the fused metal on cooling; it may be separated from the latter by the aid of
                    hydrochloric acid. The crystals are usually of a more or less brown colour, but
                    in lustre, refracting power, and hardness they are nearly equal to the diamond.
                    Crystalline boron is only slightly oxidized at the temperature at which diamond
                    burns.</p>
                <p>Boron forms a trichloride, BC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, a tribromide, BBr
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and a trifluoride, BF <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi>. The chloride may be obtained by the direct action of chlorine on
                    amorphous boron, the combination taking place at ordinary temperatures; it is
                    also produced by strongly heating a mixture of boric anhydride and charcoal in
                    an atmosphere of chlorine, and by heating boric anhydride with phosphorus
                    pentachloride to 150° C. The bromide may be obtained in a similar manner by the
                    direct combination of its elements. Both are colourless, mobile liquids; the
                    chloride boils at 17’ C., and the bromide at 90° C. They are readily decomposed
                    by water; thus—</p>

                <p>Boron chloride is not easily deprived of its chlorine by the action of metals,
                    which is apparently accounted for by the fact that much heat is evolved in its
                    formation from its elements. According to Troost and Hautefeuille, the amounts
                    of heat disengaged in the formation of the chloride and oxide of boron from
                    their elements, and in the decomposition of the former by a large excess of
                    water, are as follows—</p>

                <p>Boron fluoride is formed by the action of hydrofluoric acid on boric anhydride,
                    viz., by heating a mixture of boric anhydride and calcium fluoride with
                    concentrated sulphuric acid. It is a colourless gas, of pungent, suffocating
                    odour; when passed into water, which dissolves about 700 times its volume of the
                    gas, it is partly decomposed into boric and hydrofluoric acids, and partly
                    combines with the hydrofluoric acid thus produced, forming fluoboric acid, HBF
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. This acid can only be obtained in a state of
                    dilute solution, but many salts formed from it are known, such as potassium
                    borofluoride, KBF <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, for example. Its existence
                    appears to indicate that boron is capable of acting as a pentad element.</p>

                    most readily obtained by strongly heating boric acid; it forms a colourless,
                    brittle, glassy mass, which dissolves readily in water, producing boric acid,
                    and is one of the most stable oxides known. It unites with metallic oxides, when
                    fused with them, forming borates, and at high temperatures it is capable of
                    decomposing carbonates, sulphates, and indeed the salts of all acids the
                    anhydrides of which are more volatile than itself.</p>

                    other of its salts are also found in nature. It crystallizes from water in white
                    nacreous laminae, which are easily soluble; when heated to about 100° C., it
                    furnishes a residue of the composition H <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> B <hi

                <p>The properties of carbon itself and its oxides have already been described (p.
                    86), and need not therefore be again discussed.</p>
                <p>On comparing the compounds of carbon with those of other elements we find that,
                    whereas there is reason to believe that the number of atoms of any of the other
                    elements directly associated together in a molecule of their compounds is very
                    small, probably never exceeding five, carbon compounds frequently contain a
                    relatively very large number of carbon atoms, which from the behaviour of the
                    compounds we are led to suppose are in direct association with each other; and
                    while none of the remaining elements are known to furnish more than a single <hi
                        rend="italic">stable</hi> compound with hydrogen, the number of stable
                    compounds of carbon with hydrogen which have been obtained may be counted by
                    hundreds. We are thus led to the conclusion that carbon possesses two
                    distinctive properties :—firstly, that of uniting with itself to an almost
                    unlimited extent in comparison with other elements; and secondly, that of
                    combining with hydrogen in numerous proportions. It is in consequence capable of
                    uniting with the same elements in a multiplicity of proportions, and of
                    furnishing a great variety of compounds, which probably exceed in number those
                    of all the remaining, elements together.</p>
                <p>The study of the compounds of carbon constitutes that branch of our science which
                    is termed organic chemistry, which is treated separately below, pp. <hi

                    remaining elements and of their compounds constituting inorganic or, as it is

                    account of the great number of carbon compounds which exist, and because,
                    generally speaking, the compounds of other elements are distinguished from those
                    of carbon by their comparative simplicity, and also by the comparative want of
                    stability which all but the simplest exhibit; this we may attribute to the
                    possession by carbon of the distinctive properties above mentioned, but
                    otherwise there is no essential difference between the compounds of carbon and
                    those of the remaining elements.</p>

                    their elements as they were formed in the animal or plant under the influence of
                    life, it being supposed that, therefore, the interposition of a special force,
                    termed the vital force, was requisite. The first step towards the disproval of
                    this hypothesis was made by Wöhler, who in 1828 succeeded in artificially
                    producing urea, the characteristic crystalline constituent of the urine; but its
                    final overthrow was not accomplished until 1845, when Kolbe showed that it was
                    possible to produce acetic acid from carbon by a comparatively very simple
                    series of reactions. Berthelot’s discovery in 1862 of the formation of
                    acetylene, C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, from
                    its elements, however, affords the simplest solution of the problem of the
                    artificial production of organic substances from their elements, as acetylene
                    may be without difficulty converted into ordinary alcohol, and from this body
                    all the carbon compounds which have been artificially prepared may be more or
                    less directly derived. Chemists have already succeeded in preparing a large
                    number of substances which occur as products of animal or vegetable life,—for
                    example, oxalic, tartaric, and salicylic acids; coumarin, the crystalline
                    substance from which the Tonka bean derives its pleasant odour; and alizarin,
                    the colouring matter derived from madder root. From the insight we have recently
                    gained into their constitution, there is little doubt that eventually the
                    synthesis of even the most complex organic bodies, such as albumen, will be
                    possible.</p>
                <p>Although carbon combines with hydrogen in a great variety of proportions, it
                    furnishes only a very limited number of compounds with other elements; thus,
                    only one sulphide of carbon, CS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and one nitride of
                    carbon, C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, are
                    known, and no well characterized compounds of carbon with the metals have been
                    obtained. The compounds of carbon with the halogens are more numerous. The only
                    compound that calls for consideration here is the sulphide; the others will be
                    noticed in the section on Organic Chemistry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Carbon disulphide,</hi> CS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, the
                    analogue of carbon dioxide, is obtained by passing sulphur vapour over charcoal
                    heated to redness. It is a colourless, very mobile, highly refracting liquid of
                    faint unpleasant odour, insoluble in water; it boils at 46° C. It is extremely
                    inflammable, and its vapour when mixed with air is highly explosive; the
                    products of its combustion are carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. The formation
                    of carbon disulphide from its elements is attended with the absorption of no
                    less than 22,000 units of heat, which explains how it is that it so readily
                    inflames, and also the fact that it is necessary to apply heat continuously in
                    preparing it; whereas the combustion of carbon in oxygen, when once it
                    commences, proceeds spontaneously, owing to the large amount of heat developed
                    in the process; we may suppose that the expenditure of energy is necessary
                    because less heat is developed by the combination of the atoms of carbon and
                    sulphur than is requisite to convert the carbon and sulphur from the state in
                    which they ordinarily exist into that in which they exist in carbon disulphide,
                    or, in other words, than is requisite to effect the separation from each other
                    of the atoms of carbon and of sulphur in the carbon and sulphur molecules.</p>
                <p>Carbon disulphide belongs to the class of acid sulphides or sulphur-anhydrides.
                    It readily dissolves in solutions of alkaline hydroxides and of metallic
                    sulphides, forming salts analogous to the metallic carbonates, and which may be
                    regarded as derived from the carbonates by the partial or entire displacement of
                    the oxygen in the latter by sulphur. The stability of these salts and of the
                    corresponding acids increases with the amount of sulphur; thus, sulphocarbonic
                    acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CS <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, which is
                    formed from the salt produced by combining carbon disulphide with metallic
                    sulphides, may be obtained as a yellow oily liquid, whereas carbonic acid, H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, can only exist in
                    extremely dilute solution.</p>
                <p>Carbon disulphide readily dissolves sulphur and phosphorus, and also oils and
                    fatty matters; on this account it meets with many practical applications.</p>
                <p>By gently heating a mixture of carbon disulphide and
                    sulphuricanhydride,carbonoxysulphideis produced,one-half the sulphur in the
                    former being displaced by oxygen: CS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + SO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = COS + SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + S; this
                    compound may also be obtained by combining carbon monoxide with sulphur, by
                    passing a mixture of the gas with sulphur vapour through a red hot tube. It is a
                    colourless gas, possessing an odour like that of carbon disulphide; in
                    properties, as in composition, it is intermediate between carbon dioxide and
                    disulphide.</p>

                    a warm aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide. It fuses at a temperature below
                    that at which steel melts; and when heated in air or oxygen it burns brilliantly
                    and is converted into silicon dioxide. When strongly heated in a platinum
                    crucible it becomes much denser and darker in colour, and much less oxidizable,
                    being converted into <hi rend="italic">graphitoidal silicon.</hi> On heatinga

                    hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids, yields graphitoidal silicon partly in
                    isolated hexagonal tables. This modification has the specific gravity 2 ’ 49,
                    and may be heated to whiteness in oxygen without burning; it is not attacked by
                    any acid excepting a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, and is only slowly
                    dissolved by a solution of potassium hydroxide.</p>
                <p>When the vapour of silicon tetrachloride mixed with hydrogen is passed over fused
                    aluminium, the chloride is reduced, and the silicon dissolves in the aluminium;
                    after a time a point is reached at which the silicon separates from the fused
                    metal in large beautiful needles, having a dark iron-grey colour. These crystals
                    constitute the <hi rend="italic">adamantine</hi> variety of silicon.</p>
                <p>Silicon appears to be capable of combining with hydrogen in the nascent state, as
                    when a plate or wire of aluminium containing silicon is connected with the
                    positive pole of a galvanic battery, and made to decompose a solution of sodium
                    chloride, gas is evolved which spontaneously inflames. Silicon hydride mixed
                    with much hydrogen is also obtained on decomposing with concentrated

                    magnesium chloride, sodium silicofluoride, and sodium chloride with sodium. The

                    Silicon tetrafluoride is a colourless gas, which liquefies under very strong
                    pressure, and solidifies at-140° C.; it is not inflammable. It is readily
                    absorbed by water, which decomposes it into silica and hydrofluosilicic acid:

                    in water. By prolonged ignition they are decomposed into silicon fluoride which

                <p>When obtained by igniting the gelatinous silica from the decomposition of the
                    haloid silicon compounds by water, or of the soluble silicates by acids, silica
                    is a snow-white amorphous powder; but it occurs native as quartz in large
                    transparent crystals of the hexagonal system, of the specific gravity 2 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5 to 2 ’ 8, and of extreme hardness. Native
                    silica of all kinds is insoluble in water and in all acids except hydrofluoric
                    acid; this is also true of artificial ignited silica. The gelatinous hydrate
                    which separates on the addition of acids to solutions of alkaline silicates is
                    also almost insoluble in water and in acids, but that which results from the
                    decomposition of silicon fluoride is stated to be soluble in a considerable
                    quantity of water. Gelatinous silica dissolves without difficulty in solutions
                    of potassium or sodium hydroxide at the ordinary temperature, and all forms of
                    silica are more or less readily dissolved by solutions of these alkalies,
                    especially when heated with them under pressure; in this manner, according to
                    the proportions of silica and alkali employed, various alkaline silicates are
                    formed which are the more soluble the greater the proportion of alkali metal
                    they contain. Those which contain a larger proportion than is indicated by the

                <p>Although silica is an extremely weak acid oxide, on account of its
                    non-volatility, it is capable of decomposing the salts of all volatile acids at
                    more or less elevated temperatures, and the salts formed from it are stable at
                    the highest temperatures. A great variety of artificial and natural silicates
                    are known,—some of which may be regarded as derived from silicic acid, H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SiO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and others from

                    SiO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, but the majority are far more complex, those
                    which occur as natural minerals being formed by the association of silica with
                    basic oxides in proportions included between the following limits :—</p>

                <p>On adding acids to a solution of an alkaline silicate, a gelatinous “hydrate of
                    silica” is precipitated; the whole of the silica may be retained in solution,
                    however, if a dilute solution of an alkaline silicate be poured into a
                    considerable excess of hydrochloric acid, but may be precipitated by gradually
                    neutralizing the acid. The retention of the silica in solution is, perhaps, due
                    to the formation of a soluble chlorhydrin (p. 565). If a stratum <hi

                    “dialyzer” formed by stretching wetted parchment paper across a light hoop of
                    wood or gutta-percha, and the dialyzer be floated in a vessel of water, the
                    water in the outer vessel being changed at intervals, after four or five days
                    the hydrochloric acid and the soluble chlorides are found to have diffused
                    completely into the water; but the solution in the dialyzer still contains the
                    silica, and a 5 per cent, solution prepared in this way may be concentrated by
                    boiling down in an open flask until it contains nearly 14 per cent, of silica.
                    The solution is tasteless, limpid, and colourless; it has an acid reaction
                    rather greater than that of carbonic acid; for every 100 parts of silica
                    present, however, only 2 Ι 3 parts of potassium hydroxide are requisite to
                    neutralize the acid reaction. The solution is not easily preserved for many
                    days, as it becomes converted into a solid transparent jelly; coagulation is
                    retarded by hydrochloric acid, and by small quantities of potassium or sodium
                    hydroxide, but is effected in a few minutes by the addition of <hi

                    without effect. Sulphuric, nitric, and acetic acids are also without action, but
                    a few bubbles of carbon dioxide gas slowly cause coagulation. The condition in
                    which the silica is present in the solution having these very remarkable
                    properties is not known, but on the assumption that a chlorhydrin is produced on
                    decomposing the alkaline silicate by an excess of hydrochloric acid, it appears
                    not improbable that, as the excess of the latter is removed by dialysis, the
                    chlorhydrin is gradually decomposed by the water and, perhaps, converted into
                    the hydroxide H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> SiO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>,
                    or some other soluble hydroxide, and that the subsequent coagulation may be due
                    to the conversion of this hydroxide into an insoluble hydroxide of different
                    molecular composition. The solution evaporated at 15° C. in a vacuum leaves the
                    silica in the form of a transparent, glassy, very lustrous hydrate, containing
                    after two days’ exposure over sulphuric acid an amount of water which agrees
                    very nearly with the formula H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SiO <hi

                <p>When silicon chloroform is added to water at the ordinary temperature, hydrogen
                    is evolved, and hvdrated silica is produced: SiHCl <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>

                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 3HCl; but if water at zero is employed, a
                    precipitate is obtained which, after drying over sulphuric acid, and then at
                    150° C., has the composition (HSiO) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. This
                    compound is analogous in composition to the unknown anhydride of formic acid:
                    (HCO) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = 2HCO(OH) - OH <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi>; its formation is probably preceded by that of the hydroxide SiH(OH)
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. It is a snow-white, voluminous, amorphous
                    substance, slightly soluble in water; it is decomposed by the least heat when in
                    a moist state, with evolution of hydrogen, and is dissolved by ammonia, caustic
                    alkalies, and alkaline carbonates, with evolution of hydrogen and production of
                    an alkaline silicate. It is not acted upon by any acids except hydrofluoric
                    acid, even concentrated nitric acid being without action. It decomposes when
                    heated above 300° C.</p>
                <p>Silicon hexachloride and hexiodide are decomposed by water in a similar manner,
                    being first converted into the hydroxide Si <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH)
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, which then furnishes siliconoxalic acid Si <hi

                    decomposed, like the preceding compound, with evolution of hydrogen, leaving a
                    residue of silica; it is also decomposed with evolution of hydrogen by even the
                    weakest bases. It rapidly reduces potassium permanganate in the cold, but is
                    only slowly oxidized by chromic acid, and is without action on solutions of gold
                    chloride or selenious acid. On decomposing the chloride, Si <hi rend="subscript"

                    acid, but also gold chloride and selenious acid. The behaviour of siliconoxalic
                    acid on oxidation is precisely similar to that of its carbon analogue oxalic
                    acid, C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which, however, is a crystalline, strongly acid
                    body, which dissolves readily in water and furnishes stable salts.</p>
                <p>By the action of anhydrous alcohol, silicon tetrachloride is converted into

                    thus, they are white amorphous substances, insoluble in water, although soluble
                    in alkaline solutions, from which they are precipitated by the addition of
                    acids, whereas acetic and propionic acids are colourless liquids, soluble in

                <p>When the vapour of carbon disulphide is passed over a heated mixture of silica
                    and carbon, silicon disulphide, SiS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is produced;
                    it crystallizes in white silky needles, which quickly decompose in moist air
                    into hydrogen sulphide and amorphous silica.</p>
                <p>From the foregoing description of the silicon compounds, it will be evident that
                    while closely allied both in composition and in many of their properties to the
                    carbon compounds, they nevertheless differ from them in numerous important
                    particulars. Thus, carbon dioxide is gaseous, and silicon dioxide is a
                    non-volatile solid; the chlorides of carbon are stable in presence of water
                    except perhaps at relatively very high temperatures, but the chlorides of
                    silicon are with the greatest readiness decomposed by water; carbon disulphide
                    is a volatile liquid not affected by water, while silicon disulphide is a solid
                    which cannot exist in presence of water; and obviously the representatives of
                    the carbon compounds oxalic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid in the silicon
                    series possess very different properties. In many respects silicon bears
                    considerable resemblance to boron, the resemblance being especially noticeable
                    between the elements themselves, and in the behaviour of their haloid compounds
                    with water, and also in the property which the fluorides of both elements
                    possess of combining with hydrogen fluoride. It is of interest to note that much
                    more heat is developed in the formation of the oxides of boron and silicon than
                    in the formation of carbon dioxide, which alone is gaseous; thus—</p>

                <p>The elements of this class are white metals, volatile at high temperatures;
                    lithium is softer than lead but harder than sodium, while sodium is harder than
                    potassium, and potassium harder than rubidium, the last mentioned being as soft
                    as wax. They may all be separated from their chlorides by electrolysis, and
                    apparently also by strongly heating mixtures of their carbonates with charcoal
                    in iron retorts; the latter method is employed in the manufacture of sodium and
                    potassium, and rubidium has been prepared by it. Caesium has not yet been
                    obtained in a pure state, but an amalgam of caesium may be procured by
                    submitting its chloride to electrolysis, employing a globule of mercury as the
                    negative electrode.</p>
                <p>Caesium is the most electro-positive element yet discovered; the remaining
                    members of the group follow it in this respect in the order of their atomic
                    weights. They are easily fusible (see table above), and their compounds with
                    other elements are all fusible.</p>
                <p>The metals of this group and their compounds furnish characteristic spectra,
                    which are distinguished from those of most other elements by their simplicity.
                    Lithium and its salts communicate a beautiful red colour to flame, sodium salts
                    an intense yellow, and potassium, caesium, and rubidium salts a violet
                    colour.</p>
                <p>According to Troost and Hautefeuille, when potassium is heated to 350°-400° C. in
                    an atmosphere of hydrogen, it is converted into a hydride of the composition K
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H; and the corresponding hydride, N^a <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H, may be prepared in a similar manner from sodium.
                    Lithium, however, manifests but little tendency to combine with hydrogen,
                    absorbing only 17 times its volume of the gas at 500° C. The hydrides are white
                    bodies resembling silver in appearance; potassium hydride is very brittle, but
                    sodium hydride is as soft as sodium, although it becomes brittle when heated;
                    the former takes fire spontaneously in air, but the latter is much more stable.
                    The compounds of lithium, sodium, and potassium with hydrocarbon radicles are
                    only known in combination with the zinc compounds; thus, the body obtained by
                    the action of sodium on zinc ethyl has the composition ZnNa(C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.</p>
                <p>The haloid compounds of the elements of this group may be formed by the direct
                    combination of the metals with halogens; their affinity for halogens, however,
                    appears to be inversely proportional to their atomic weights. Thus, it is
                    requisite to heat sodium to a moderately high temperature in an atmosphere of
                    chlorine in order to secure its conversion into the chloride NaCl; but potassium
                    inflames in chlorine at the ordinary temperature. Similarly, sodium may be
                    preserved unchanged in contact with bromine, and is scarcely affected even when
                    heated with it to 200° C.; potassium, however, causes a violent explosion when
                    thrown on bromine. Sodium may also be fused with iodine without appreciable
                    reaction occurring, but potassium at once combines with it with explosive
                    violence.</p>

                <p>The metals of this group all decompose water in the cold with evolution of
                    hydrogen and production of a solution of the hydroxide: for example—</p>

                    2Na,OH.</p>
                <p>Lithium does not fuse when thrown on water, and sodium fuses but does not
                    inflame; potassium and rubidium, however, not only fuse but also take fire and
                    burn with a violet coloured flame. According to Thomsen’s determinations, more
                    heat is developed in the decomposition of water by lithium or sodium than by
                    potassium; thus—</p>

                <p>The difference in their behaviour when thrown on water is, perhaps, due to the
                    circumstance that the action proceeds more rapidly with potassium than with
                    sodium.</p>
                <p>All the metals of this group attract oxygen with avidity on exposure to air, but
                    lithium is much less oxidizable than sodium or potassium, rubidium takes fire
                    spontaneously in air, and caesium amalgam is much more readily oxidized than
                    rubidium amalgam; so that their affinity for oxygen, as for the halogens, is
                    proportional to their atomic weights. Only one oxide of lithium, Li <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, has been obtained, but two oxides of sodium, Na

                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, are known; the oxides of the remaining elements
                    have not been investigated. The oxides of the form M' <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> O are white deliquescent solids, which readily dissolve in water with
                    the development cf much heat, forming solutions of the corresponding hydroxides,
                    Μ'.OH; they are the most powerfully basic oxides known. The oxides of the form M
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> dissolve in
                    water, butcorrespondingsalts are unknown; potassium tetroxide dissolves in water
                    with evolution of oxygen. The hydroxides M'.OH, or alkalies, are white fusible
                    solids of remarkable stability, volatilizing at high temperatures apparently
                    without undergoing decomposition; they are very soluble in water, furnishing
                    strongly alkaline solutions, soapy to the touch.</p>
                <p>The metals of the alkalies appear to act uniformly as monads, and the salts
                    derived from them are all formed on the types M'C1, M <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> 'SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, &lt;fcc. Their salts are colourless
                    excepting those derived from coloured acids; and the corresponding salts of the
                    several metals are isomorphous. Their chlorides, carbonates, sulphates, and
                    phosphates are soluble in water, and the chlorides and sulphates furnish neutral
                    solutions. Their sulphates form characteristic double salts called “alums” with
                    sulphate of aluminium and the sulphates of allied elements. The alums all
                    crystallize with the same number of molecules of water, and correspond in
                    composition to ordinary alum, K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> A1 <hi

                    isomorphous.</p>
                <p>Although the general resemblance between the metals of this group is very great,
                    it will be obvious that they differ in many important respects. The properties
                    of potassium, rubidium, and caesium, which are very closely related, are
                    especially different from those of lithium and sodium, which are also closely
                    related. For instance, the normal lithium and sodium salts of chloroρlatinic
                    acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> PtCl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, the acid
                    lithium and sodium salts of tartaric acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, and the lithium and sodium alums are readily
                    soluble in water, whereas the corresponding salts of potassium, rubidium, and
                    caesium are difficultly soluble. Lithium, however, in many of its properties is
                    more closely allied to magnesium and calcium than to sodium; and it may be
                    noticed that its chloride, like that of magnesium, dissolves in water with
                    considerable development of heat.</p>
                <p>The reactions involved in the formation of a few compounds of lithium, sodium,
                    and potassium have been investigated by Thomsen, with the following results

                <p>The members of this group are strongly positive elements, which act uniformly as
                    dyads; the relations between them are similar to those which obtain in the
                    preceding group, the element with the highest atomic weight being the most
                    positive. Strontium, however, in some respects appears to be more closely
                    related to barium than to calcium. They are best prepared by the voltaic
                    decomposition of their fused chlorides; their chlorides are not reduced by
                    sodium, but calcium may be obtained by heating calcium iodide with sodium.</p>
                <p>Calcium is a yellow metal of the colour of gold largely alloyed with silver; in
                    hardness it is intermediate between lead and gold, and it is very ductile. It
                    melts at a red heat. Strontium closely resembles calcium, but has a deeper
                    colour; little is known of barium, but it appears to resemble strontium and
                    calcium. The behaviour of these elements with halogens is apparently similar to
                    that of the metals of the preceding group with low atomic weights.</p>
                <p>They decompose cold water with evolution of hydrogen, but less readily than the
                    alkali metals; it is remarkable that concentrated nitric acid is almost without
                    action on calcium and strontium even when heated to boiling, although the
                    diluted acid dissolves them rapidly.</p>
                <p>They are less easily oxidized than the alkali metals, calcium being the least,
                    and barium apparently the most oxidizable; in dry air calcium and strontium
                    remain untarnished for a considerable period. They burn with great brilliancy
                    when ignited in air.</p>
                <p>Each metal furnishes two oxides,—a monoxide such as barium oxide, BaO, and a
                    dioxide such as barium peroxide, BaO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; these oxides
                    are white, earthy, infusible substances; the dioxides are decomposed into the
                    monoxides and oxygen at a red heat. Their monoxides are powerfully basic, but
                    apparently the dioxides are almost destitute of basic properties; the action of
                    acids on the two classes of oxides is illustrated by the following equations

                    calcium carbonate, as it is only sparingly soluble in water, and decomposes on
                    ignition; whereas the carbonates of the other alkali metals are very soluble,
                    and are not decomposed by heat.</p>
                <p>Calcium sulphate, CaSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, crystallizes with two
                    molecules of water, and is slightly soluble in water; but strontium and barium
                    sulphates form anhydrous crystals, and are practically insoluble in water.
                    Similarly, calcium nitrate crystallizes in deliquescent, very soluble monoclinic
                    prisms of the composition Ca(NO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, 4H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, and an
                    apparently isomorphous salt of similar composition, but efflorescent, may be
                    obtained by crystallizing strontium nitrate at a low temperature; but from a hot
                    solution strontium nitrate separates in anhydrous octahedra isomorphous with
                    barium nitrate, which crystallizes without water. The chlorides of calcium and
                    strontium are deliquescent crystalline substances, very soluble in water, and
                    also soluble in alcohol; barium chloride is very much less soluble in water, and
                    is insoluble in alcohol, and does not deliquesce. The chlorides of barium,
                    strontium, and calcium furnish perfectly neutral solutions. Barium salts
                    communicate an apple-green colour to flame, strontium salts a brilliant crimson,
                    and calcium salts an orange-red; the spectra of the three elements are
                    comparatively simple.</p>

                    its chloride, is a white, malleable metal fusible below the melting-point of
                    silver; it does not burn in air or oxygen, but becomes coated with a layer of
                    oxide which seems to protect it from further change. When heated in an

                    but nitric acid, even when concentrated, has little action on it. It is readily
                    dissolved by a solution of potassium hydroxide.</p>
                <p>Glucinum hydroxide, G(OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, separates as a white
                    bulky precipitate on the addition of an alkaline hydroxide to a solution of a
                    glucinum salt; it exhibits pronounced acid properties, dissolving in solutions
                    of the alkalies and even in those of alkaline carbonates. Glucinum oxide, GO, is
                    a light, very bulky, white powder; when strongly heated it volatilizes without
                    fusing. Glucinum chloride <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> GC1 <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi>, crystallizes in silky needles; it is very deliquescent, and

                    Glucinum hydroxide readily dissolves in acids, but the ignited oxide slowly; the
                    glucinum salts are mostly soluble, and have a sweet, slightly astringent taste.
                    Basic glucinum salts are obtained with great facility; thus by digestion with

                    Magnesium is a white, malleable ductile metal about as hard as calcspar; it
                    melts and volatilizes nearly as readily as zinc. It readily decomposes water
                    below its boiling-point, but not in the cold, unless associated with a less
                    positive metal such as copper. It is easily dissolved by dilute acids.</p>
                <p>Zinc is a hard, white metal with a shade of blue; when pure it is very malleable,
                    but it is usually brittle owing to the presence of impurities such as lead and
                    iron. Commercial zinc, however, becomes malleable at 100°-150° C., and may then
                    be rolled; at 210° C. it again becomes brittle, and may easily be reduced to
                    powder at that temperature. Zinc decomposes vapour of water at a temperature
                    below dull redness, and readily, even at ordinary temperatures, when it is
                    associated with coper or other less positive metals. The pure metal dissolves
                    very slowly in dilute acids, but ordinary zinc dissolves quickly, because the
                    lead contained in it acts as an electro-negative element. Zinc dissolves in
                    aqueous alkalies with evolution of hydrogen.</p>
                <p>Cadmium is a bluish-white metal like zinc; it is soft, though harder and more
                    tenacious than tin, and is very malleable and ductile. When heated to about 80°
                    C. it becomes very brittle, and may be powdered with facility. It appears to
                    decompose water at a high temperature, and dissolves when heated with slightly
                    diluted hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, but its best solvent is dilute nitric
                    acid.</p>
                <p>Magnesium is usually prepared by heating its chloride with sodium; zinc and
                    cadmium are readily obtained by reducing their oxides with charcoal. Magnesium,
                    zinc, and cadmium are capable of being polished, and then assume a bright
                    metallic lustre; they retain their lustre in dry air, but when exposed to moist
                    air a film of oxide forms on the surface which protects them from further
                    oxidation. Magnesium is the most positive metal of the three, as it precipitates
                    zinc and cadmium from their salts, and zinc is more positive than cadmium. When
                    heated in chlorine, or in the vapour of bromine or of iodine, they burn
                    brilliantly, forming corresponding chlorides, bromides, or iodides, such as MgCl
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, ZnBr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, Cdl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; if moistened with water, zinc and cadmium readily
                    combine with the halogens at the ordinary temperature.</p>
                <p>They are easily combustible in air or oxygen; the light emitted by burning
                    magnesium is intensely brilliant and very rich in actinic rays; zinc also burns
                    with a brilliant flame. They are thus converted into the oxides MgO, ZnO, CdO;
                    magnesium and zinc oxides are white, but the latter becomes lemon yellow when
                    heated; cadmium oxide is yellowish brown. These oxides are unalterable in the

                    heat occurs during the hydration. Cadmium oxide also unites with water.</p>
                <p>The hydroxides of magnesium, zinc, and cadmium separate as white amorphous
                    precipitates, insoluble in water, on the addition of alkalies to solutions of
                    the salts of these metals. Magnesium hydroxide alone exhibits a faint alkaline
                    reaction; zinc hydroxide readily dissolves in alkalies; they are all dissolved
                    by solutions of ammonium salts; they are easily resolved by heat into water and
                    the oxide.</p>
                <p>Cadmium also furnishes a suboxide, Cd <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, which is a
                    green powder; on treatment with acids it is resolved into metallic cadmium and
                    the oxide CdO; in other words, a salt of the oxide CdO is produced, and cadmium
                    remains.</p>
                <p>The chlorides of these metals, like glucinum chloride, are volatile deliquescent
                    solids; magnesium and zinc chlorides are extremely soluble in water, and their
                    solutions are strongly acid, but cadmium chloride is less soluble; their
                    dissolution in water is attended with development of heat, thus :—</p>

                <p>Zinc, like glucinum, manifests a great tendency to form basic sulphates.</p>

                <p>Glucinum sulphide is soluble in water without decomposition, but is decomposed by
                    dilute acids; magnesium sulphide is converted by water into magnesium hydroxide
                    with evolution of hydrogen sulphide: MgS + 2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O =

                    sulphide is insoluble in water, but is dissolved and decomposed by dilute
                    mineral acids; lastly, cadmium sulphide is insoluble in water and dissolves with
                    difficulty even in boiling dilute hydrochloric acid, though it is readily
                    decomposed by concentrated hydrochloric acid even at ordinary temperatures.
                    Cadmium sulphide is a brilliant yellow substance, the remaining sulphides are
                    white.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mercury.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This element is the only
                    metal that is liquid at common temperatures, with the exception, possibly, of
                    caesium, and the recently discovered element gallium. The latter element,
                    indeed, appears to be closely allied to zinc in properties, but is less
                    positive, and is probably a member of the aluminium group; its specific gravity
                    is 5 ’ 95.</p>
                <p>Mercury occurs native chiefly in the form of sulphide, from which it is separated
                    either by distillation with slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), or by burning off
                    the sulphur. It is a highly lustrous metal, and in the solid state is malleable.
                    It slowly combines with the halogens at ordinary temperatures, and also with
                    sulphur if triturated with it; it does not tarnish, even in moist air, but
                    slowly absorbs oxygen when heated to about 400° C., being converted into the red
                    oxide HgO; this oxide is decomposed on ignition. Hydrochloric acid, whether cold
                    or hot, is without action on mercury, but it is slowly dissolved by hydriodic
                    acid; concentrated nitric acid dissolves it readily; it is also dissolved by hot
                    concentrated sulphuric acid. It has no action upon water at any temperature. It
                    is capable of uniting with most metals, forming liquid or solid compounds called
                    amalgams; the solid amalgams appear for the most part to be of definite
                    composition, but the two metals are held together by very feeble affinities.</p>
                <p>Mercury unites with the halogens, with oxygen, and with sulphur in two
                    proportions, forming the two series distinguished as mercurous and mercuric
                    compounds; thus :—</p>

                <p>The compounds of mercury with halogens, and mercury compounds generally, are
                    difficultly soluble, or insoluble, in water. But the compounds with halogens
                    dissolve readily in solutions of the haloid compounds of the alkali metals in
                    consequence of the formation of double salts; the haloid compounds of mercury,
                    in fact, exhibit a more marked tendency than those of any other metal of the
                    group to form double salts with the haloid compounds of other metals, cadmium
                    being most nearly allied to mercury in this respect <hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">they</hi> unite also with the haloid acids, forming the

                <p>Mercurous chloride or calomel, Hg <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is a white crystalline solid, insoluble in water;
                    it blackens slowly on exposure to light, and is decomposed by heat into metallic
                    mercury and mercuric chloride, HgCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Mercuric
                    chloride or corrosive sublimate is also white and crystalline, but soluble in
                    water; it boils without decomposition at 295° C.; the density of its vapour
                    corresponds with the formula HgCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. By the action of
                    ammonia on the chlorides of mer cury, one-half the chlorine is removed and
                    displaced by the monad radicle amidogen: Hg <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi

                    black mercurous amidochloride, the higher chloride furnishing mercuric
                    amidochloride or white precipitate, HgCl(NH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>).</p>
                <p>Mercury hydroxides are unknown, the chlorides of mercury being at once converted
                    into corresponding oxides by the action of alkalies; but when mercury is
                    associated with positive hydrocarbon radicles, it forms powerfully basic
                    hydroxides such as Hg(C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                        5</hi>)OH, which is a colourless oil. Mercurous oxide, Hg <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, is a black substance which by mere exposure to
                    light, or a very gentle heat, is converted into the metal and the red oxide.
                    Mercuric oxide, HgO, when prepared by heating mercury in oxgyen, forms red
                    crystalline scales, but it is precipitated as a yellow powder on the addition of
                    an alkali to a solution of mercuric chloride. These two forms of the oxide
                    differ even in their chemical behaviour, and are perhaps polymeric; thus, when
                    the yellow oxide is boiled with a solution of potassium dichromate a basic
                    mercuric chromate, Hg <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> CrO <hi rend="subscript">
                        6</hi>, is formed, but the crystallized oxide forms a more basic salt, viz.,
                    Hg <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> CrO <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi>, under similar
                    circumstances. Mercuric oxide is dissolved by acids, forming mercuric salts such
                    as mercuric nitrate, Hg(NO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi>; by digesting solutions of these salts with mercury they are
                    converted into corresponding mercurous salts such as mercurous nitrate Hg <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (NO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, But mercuric oxide also exhibits feeble acid
                    properties; thus it forms the compound K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> HgO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> when dissolved in fused potassium hydroxide. Basic
                    mercuric salts are also very readily produced; mercuric sulphate, HgSO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, for example, is decomposed by water into a soluble
                    acid salt and the insoluble basic sulphate Hg <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> SO
                        <hi rend="subscript"> d</hi>. Mercuric sulphide, HgS, is thrown down as a

                    through solutions of mercuric salts; it is not decomposed by hydrochloric acid;
                    when heated it becomes red. Native cinnabar and vermilion consist of the red
                    modification of mercuric oxide.</p>
                <p>No tendency to combine with hydrogen has been observed in the case of the metals
                    of this group, but they have all been obtained in combination with hydrocarbon
                    radicles. Their organo-metallic derivatives correspond in composition to zinc
                    ethyl, Zn(C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>) <hi

                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>It would appear, in fact, that only mercurous compounds can exist in which
                    mercury is associated with negative radicles.</p>
                <p>It has been shown that the density of the vapour of each of the metals cadmium
                    and mercury is the half of its atomic weight, in other words, the gaseous
                    molecules of these elements are monatomic (p. 471 ). As we are not acquainted
                    with the density of any other metal in the state of gas, it is impossible to say
                    whether these metals are peculiar in this respect.</p>
                <p>On comparing the properties thus briefly sketched of the elements of this group,
                    the general resemblance will be at once noticed, but it will be remarked also,
                    that, although in respect of many properties the variations are gradational in
                    the same degree as the atomic weights, certain properties are not continuous,
                    but recur periodically. Thus glucinum, zinc, and mercury, the first, third, and
                    fifth terms of the group, have many characteristics in common which are
                    apparently wanting in the case of magnesium and cadmium, the second and fourth
                    terms. This is evidenced especially by certain of their physical properties, by
                    the solubility of their hydroxides in alkalies, by the formation of basic salts,
                    and by the behaviour of their sulphides.</p>
                <p>The elements of this group are in many respects closely related to the metals of
                    the previous group, of which they may be regarded as forming a sub-group, the
                    formulae of their compounds being similar in most cases; the general behaviour
                    especially of magnesium and its compounds, it will be evident, is in close
                    accordance with that of calcium and its compounds. But many important
                    distinctions characterize the two groups. Thus the metals of the one group
                    decompose cold water; their oxides are powerfully basic, and readily combine
                    with water; their carbonates are extremely stable; and their sulphates are
                    insoluble or very slightly soluble in water, and do not readily form double
                    salts. The metals of the other group, however, either are without action on
                    water, or decompose it only when heated; their oxides, although basic, exhibit
                    little tendency to combine with water; their carbonates are comparatively
                    unstable; and their sulphates are mostly very soluble in water, and readily form
                    double salts. In the one group the positive character becomes more pronounced as
                    the atomic weight increases, whereas in the other the positive character
                    diminishes with increase of atomic weight.</p>
                <p>Glucinum, apparently, is much less closely related to magnesium than is the
                    latter to zinc, and mercury much less closely to cadmium than cadmium to zinc;
                    but zinc and cadmium are more closely related than zinc and magnesium. These
                    conclusions, which result chiefly from the comparison of what may be termed
                    chemical properties, are entirely confirmed by Thomsen’s thermochemical
                    investigation of the reactions involved in the formation of a number of
                    compounds of the metals of this group, as will be evident from the following

                <p>These metals may be regarded as forming a sub-group to the metals of the
                    alkalies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Copper</hi> is a very tenacious, ductile, malleable metal, of
                    red colour, more easily fused than gold, but less fusible than silver. It is
                    without action on water at a red heat, and does not oxidize in the air at
                    ordinary temperatures, but when heated to redness it rapidly combines with
                    oxygen forming a black oxide CuO; when in a finely divided state, it readily
                    unites with chlorine at ordinary temperatures. Moderately diluted nitric acid
                    dissolves copper with great facility, and it is also dissolved by heated
                    concentrated sulphuric acid; hydrochloric acid, even when boiling, has little
                    action on the massive metal, but slowly dissolves the finely divided metal.</p>
                <p>Copper forms two chlorides,—cuprous chloride, Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and cupric chloride, CuCl <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 2</hi>, but only one iodide Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> I <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Cuprous chloride is a white crystalline substance
                    insoluble in water, but it dissolves in hydrochloric acid or ammonia, forming
                    colourless solutions. Cupric chloride is readily soluble; it is liver-coloured,
                    but its solution in water is blue; it forms crystalline double salts with the
                    chlorides of the alkali metals. It is converted into cuprous chloride and
                    chlorine at a red heat.</p>
                <p>Cupric hydroxide, Cu(OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, separates as a pale blue
                    precipitate on the addition of an alkali to a solution of a cupric salt; in the
                    dry state it is stable at 100° C., but at a slightly higher temperature it is
                    converted into the black oxide. Cupric hydroxide, although insoluble in
                    alkalies, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n540/mode/1up"

                    solution; the production of deep blue-coloured liquids on dissolution in ammonia
                    is, in fact, characteristic of copper compounds. Cupric oxide, CuO, dissolves in
                    acids, forming cupric salts, which are white when anhydrous, but furnish green
                    or blue solutions; they are mostly soluble. Cupric sulphate crystallizes with 5
                    molecules of water, but it forms a double sulphate with potassium sulphate, CuK
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, 6H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, isomorphous
                    with the corresponding zinc and magnesium salts. Basic cupric salts are readily
                    produced by digesting the normal salts with cupric hydroxide.</p>
                <p>By igniting cupric oxide with metallic copper it is converted into red cuprous
                    oxide, Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O; this oxide may also be prepared by
                    heating a solution of a cupric salt with an easily oxidizable substance, such as
                    grape sugar, and an alkali. Most acids decompose cuprous oxide, forming a cupric
                    salt and separating metallic copper; but it is converted into cuprous chloride
                    by hydrochloric acid. A number of cuprous salts exist, but they are extremely
                    unstable, and mostly absorb oxygen readily, becoming converted into cupric
                    salts. Both oxides of copper are easily reduced by ignition with hydrogen or
                    charcoal.</p>
                <p>A black hydrated cupric sulphide is precipitated by hydrogen sulphide even from
                    strongly acid solutions of cupric salts.</p>
                <p>Cuprous hydride, Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    is deposited as a yellow precipitate when a solution of cupric sulphate mixed
                    with hypophosphorous acid is heated to about 60° C.; it soon turns brown, and
                    when heated to 70° C. suddenly decomposes, with evolution of hydrogen;
                    hydrochloric acid converts it into cuprous chloride :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Silver</hi> is a white metal, inferior in malleablity only to
                    gold among the heavy metals; it is harder than gold, and softer than copper. It
                    is the best-known conductor of heat and electricity. It may be distilled by the
                    aid of the oxy-hydrogen flame. It is not oxidized by ordinary oxygen, and is
                    incapable of decomposing water, but like mercury it is oxidized by ozone.
                    Moderately diluted nitric acid dissolves it readily, and it is dissolved by
                    heated concentrated sulphuric acid; it also resembles copper and mercury in its
                    behaviour with hydrochloric acid, and mercury in its behaviour with hydriodic
                    acid. It unites with the halogens at ordinary temperatures, and, like mercury,
                    readily combines with sulphur, and is precipitated by hydrogen sulphide from
                    strongly acid solutions of its salts as black sulphide, Ag <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> S.</p>
                <p>Silver forms two chlorides,—argentic chloride, AgCl, which is white, and
                    insoluble in water, but readily soluble in ammonia, and a black argentous
                    chloride, the composition of which is not known with certainty, but is probably
                    Ag <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Corresponding
                    bromides exist, but only the one iodide, Agi, is known. Argentic chloride
                    becomes violetcoloured on exposure to light, apparently owing to the formation
                    of the lower chloride; the iodide does not alter in appearance, but acquires the
                    property of attracting metallic silver, and hence its employment in photography.
                    The subchloride is not changed by nitric acid, but is converted by ammonia into
                    metallic silver and argentic chloride.</p>
                <p>A brown argentous hydroxide, Ag (OH), is precipitated from solutions of argentic
                    salts on the addition of an alkali; it is slightly soluble in water and its
                    solution is faintly alkaline; it loses water at a temperature above 60° C., and
                    is converted into argentic oxide, AgO. Argentic oxide is a brown powder; it
                    gives off a certain amount of oxygen, even at 100° C., and also when exposed to
                    sunshine; it neutralizes the strongest acids, forming argentic salts such as
                    argentic nitrate, AgN^O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. Argentic sulphate, Ag <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, is isomorphous
                    with anhγdrous sodium sulphate, and it also forms an alum, Ag <hi

                <p>Silver also forms a suboxide probably of the composition Ag <hi rend="subscript">

                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Both are extremely
                    unstable; the former is decomposed by ammonia into metallic silver and argentic
                    oxide, which dissolves, and acids act upon it in a similar manner.</p>
                <p>Argentic carbonate is insoluble in water, and decomposes at 200 C <hi
                        rend="superscript"> o</hi>. into the oxide and carbon dioxide.</p>
                <p>Metallic silver is slowly precipitated from solutions of its salts by hydrogen at
                    ordinary temperatures, so that it is a less positive element than hydrogen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gold</hi> is a metal of rich yellow colour nearly as soft as
                    lead when in a pure state. It exhibits no tendency to combine directly with
                    oxygen, and is not dissolved by any single acid, except selenic acid, but it
                    readily combines with the halogens, and therefore dissolves in a mixture of
                    nitric and hydrochloric acids, which liberates chlorine (p. 466).</p>
                <p>Gold is reduced from its compounds with extreme readiness, but varies in
                    properties according to the nature of the compound from which it is separated;
                    in fact, it appears to exist in several allotropic modifications. Thus,
                    according to Thomsen, when a solution of auric chloride is reduced by sulphurous
                    acid, the gold separates as a lightcoloured powder which readily cakes together,
                    but from a solution of auric bromide it separates as an extremely fine
                    dark-coloured powder which exhibits no tendency to agglomerate; a third
                    modification, also finely pulverulent, but lustrous, is obtained by reducing
                    aurous bromide or iodide with sulphurous acid. Thomsen finds that the conversion
                    of the second (Auα) and third (Auj8) of these modifications into that obtained
                    from auric chloride (Au) would involve development of heat, and of different
                    amounts in the two cases; thus :—</p>
                <p>AuØ = Au + 4700 units of heat Auα=Au + 3210 „ „</p>

                        3</hi>. Auric chloride is soluble in water, but aurous chloride is
                    insoluble; in contact with water, especially on warming, the latter decomposes
                    into metallic gold and auric chloride. Auric chloride is readily converted into
                    aurous chloride when heated to 185° C. The gold bromides may be obtained in a
                    similar manner, and exhibit similar properties, but are less stable. Aurous and
                    auric iodides, Au <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    and Aul <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, are both insoluble, and still less stable.
                    The auric compounds combine with the haloid acids, and with the haloid compounds
                    of most other metals, forming crystalline so-called double salts; these double
                    salts, however, may be regarded as salts of the acids formed by the union of the
                    haloid acids with the auric halogen compounds; the double chloride of gold and
                    potassium, for example, KCLAuCl <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, as the potassium
                    salt of the acid HAuCl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>.</p>
                <p>On treating aurous chloride with a solution of potassium hydroxide, a dark-green
                    substance is obtained, which is probably the corresponding hydroxide; it
                    decomposes spontaneously into metallic gold and auric hydroxide. Auric
                    hydroxide, Au(OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is precipitated by alkalies from
                    a solution of auric chloride as a dark-brown powder, which is quickly reduced on
                    exposure to light. A third gold hydroxide, derived from the oxide Au <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, appears also to
                    exist.</p>
                <p>The hydroxides of gold exhibit very feeble basic properties; in fact, the salts
                    formed on dissolving auric hydroxide in nitric and sulphuric acids are so
                    unstable that they have not been isolated. Auric hydroxide, however, possesses
                    marked acid properties, and is dissolved by a solution of potassium
                    hydroxide,—potassium aurate, a <pb break="no"

                    converted into the so-called fulminating gold, which is obtained in the form of
                    a yellowish-brown powder easily exploded by percussion or heat; it is somewhat
                    uncertain what is the composition of this body, but it is not improbable that it
                    is represented by the formula Au (NH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) j θyjq <hi

                <p>The distinctions between cupper, silver, and gold are obviously very marked; yet
                    they resemble each other in many respects, the relation being especially evident
                    when the cuprous and aurons compounds are compared with the argentic compounds.
                    It is to be noted that their hydroxides and many other of their compounds are
                    acted on by ammonia iu a characteristic manner, both silver and gold hydroxides
                    being converted into highly explosive bodies; the nature of the products has not
                    been ascertained with certainty, but apparently they are allied in composition.
                    The ammoniacal derivatives of copper correspond in composition to those formed
                    from nickel, a metal which in many respects is allied to copper.</p>
                <p>As in the magnesium group of metals, the positive character diminishes with
                    increase of atomic weight, but to a much greater extent.</p>
                <p>Silver is the only element of the group which exhibits marked analogy with the
                    metals of the alkalies,—being connected with them by the isomorphism of its
                    sulphate with that of sodium, by the formation of an alum, by the alkalinity of
                    its hydroxide, and by its colour. Thermochemical investigation also indicates a
                    marked analogy between silver and the metals of the alkalies, the sulphates of
                    silver, sodium, and potassium dissolving in water with absorption of heat,
                    whereas nearly as much heat is developed on dissolving copper sulphate as when
                    the equivalent amount of sulphuric acid is added to water, copper sulphate
                    resembling in this respect the sulphates of magnesium and zinc; thus :—</p>

                    copper are formed, are confirmatory of the conclusion that copper is allied to
                    zinc and magnesium.</p>
                <p>The results of the thermo-chemical investigation of copper, silver, and gold are
                    of considerable interest, as will be evident from the following tables. To
                    illustrate the application of the values in these tables, it may be pointed out
                    that the stability of the oxides of copper and the instability of silver oxide
                    and of auric hydroxide are explained by the fact that much heat is developed in
                    the formation of the oxides of copper from their elements, whereas the formation
                    of silver oxide would involve but a slight development of heat, and the
                    formation of auric hydroxide would even involve a large expenditure of energy.
                    Then it will be noticed that, in the formation of cuprous iodide, heat is
                    developed to the extent of 32,520 units per molecule, and that the formation of
                    an aqueous solution of cupric iodide would involve the development of only
                    10,410 units per molecule; hence it follows that the conversion of two molecules
                    of cupric iodide into a molecule of cuprous iodide and a molecule of iodine
                    would be attended by the development of no less than 32520 — 2×10410 = 11700
                    units of heat. This explains the fact that a mixture of cuprous iodide and
                    iodine, and not cupric iodide, is obtained on adding potassium iodide to a
                    solution of cupric sulphate :—</p>

                <p>Again, the superior affinity of auric bromide for hydrogen bromide as compared
                    with that of auric chloride for hydrogen chloride is shown by the development of
                    7700 units of heat in the formation of the compound AuBr <hi rend="subscript">
                        4</hi> H, and of only 4530 units in the formation of the corresponding

                    latter is almost completely decomposed and converted into the former on
                    treatment with hydrobromic acid is evidenced by the development of 13,800 units

                <p><hi rend="italic">Thallium</hi> is a heavy crystalline metal, resembling cadmium
                    in appearance; it is extremely soft, even lead scratching it readily. It melts
                    at 294° C., and boils below a white heat; the liquid metal can hardly be
                    distinguished from mercury. It is reduced from solutions of its salts by zinc,
                    but not by cadmium. It readily dissolves in concentrated nitric acid, and is
                    also dissolved by dilute sulphuric acid, especially if it be in contact with a
                    piece of platinum, but it is only slowly attacked even by boiling hydrochloric
                    acid; it decomposes water at a red heat. It combines with the halogens at
                    ordinary temperatures. When exposed <pb break="no"

                    a white precipitate scarcely distinguishable at first sight from silver
                    chloride, on the addition of hydrochloric acid to a solution of a thallious
                    salt; but in properties it more nearly resembles lead chloride, PbCl <hi

                    which it separates again on cooling in crystals, and scarcely more soluble in
                    aqueous ammonia than in water. Thallium sesquichloride, T1 <hi rend="subscript">
                        4</hi> C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, formed by melting thallious chloride

                    moderately soluble without decomposition in water slightly acidulated with
                    hydrochloric acid. Thallic chloride, T1C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> or T1 <hi

                    but the corresponding bromide is obtained on adding thalíious bromide to a hot
                    solution of thallic bromide, separating from the hot liquid in yellow shining
                    needles. Thaliious bromide is nearly insoluble in water, but thallic bromide is
                    very soluble and deliquescent; the bromide Tl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Br
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> is decomposed by water into thaliious and
                    thallic bromide and the bromide Tl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> Br <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, which crystallizes in orange-red laminae. This
                    last compound is also decomposed by water, with separation of thaliious bromide.
                    Thaliious iodide, TH or T1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> I <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi>, has a brilliant yellow colour, and is almost insoluble in water, and
                    scarcely more soluble in a solution of potassium iodide; when heated it becomes
                    scarlet, but its yellow colour is restored by friction. It is therefore opposite
                    in character to mercuric iodide, Hgl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which is
                    scarlet, but becomes yellow when heated, and is readily soluble in potassium
                    iodide solution, although insoluble in water. Thallic iodide is an extremely
                    unstable compound, and, like cupric iodide, readily decomposes into iodine and
                    thaliious iodide.</p>
                <p>Thaliious oxide is almost black in colour; like litharge, PbO, the corresponding
                    lead oxide, it fuses readily; and the fused oxide is absorbed by bone-ash so
                    that a silver thallium alloy may be cupelled like a silver-lead alloy. It
                    dissolves readily in water, forming a colourless, powerfully alkaline solution,
                    greasy to the touch, of thaliious hydroxide, T1(OH) or T1 <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> (OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. The latter compound may be
                    obtained in pale-yellow prismatic crystals; it is reconverted into the oxide by
                    mere exposure over sulphuric acid in a vacuum at the ordinary temperature. The
                    solution of thaliious hydroxide has nearly all the properties characteristic of
                    sodium hydroxide; but it has a slight tendency to absorb oxygen. Thallic
                    hydroxide, T1(OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> or T1 <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> (OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, separates as a brown gelatinous
                    precipitate on the addition of alkalies to a solution of a thallic salt; by
                    heating to about 260° C. it is converted into thallic oxide, T1 <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. This oxide is a
                    dark brown powder fusible with difficulty; it is reduced to the lower 'oxide at
                    a red heat. It has much less marked basic properties than thaliious oxide, but
                    dissolves readily in acids, forming thallic salts; it is insoluble in water.
                    Thaliious salts are not precipitated by hydrogen sulphide in presence of strong
                    acids, but the thallium is completely precipitated as a brown sulphide from
                    solutions of the salts of weak acids, such as thaliious acetate, and by alkaline
                    sulphides.</p>
                <p>Thaliious hydroxide readily absorbs carbon dioxide, formmg thaliious carbonate,
                    T1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. This salt
                    crystallizes in prisms, and is soluble in about four times its weight of boiling
                    water, forming an alkaline solution; it is fusible, but decomposes when heated
                    to dull redness. Thaliious sulphate, T1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, is isomorphous with potassium sulphate; it also

                    salts. A large number of thaliious salts, in fact, are isomorphous with the
                    corresponding sodium, potassium, and ammonium salts. Thallic sulphate, T1 <hi

                    even by cold water; it forms an anhydrous double sulphate with potassium

                <p><hi rend="italic">Lead</hi> is a bluish-white, extremely soft metal; it fuses at
                    325° C. It is readily dissolved by nitric acid, and is slowly acted on when
                    boiled with hydrochloric or dilute sulphuric acid, hydrogen being evolved.
                    Although it tarnishes in the air, the oxidation is only superficial, but it
                    readily absorbs oxygen when heated. Its oxides are very easily reduced.</p>
                <p>Only one stable chloride of lead, PbCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is known;

                    reprecipitated by alkalies, but the slightest heat causes chlorine to be
                    evolved. Lead cldoride is difficultly soluble in water, from which it
                    crystallizes in delicate white needles. Lead iodide, Pbl <hi rend="subscript">

                    water.</p>
                <p>Lead forms a suboxide, Pb <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, a monoxide, PbO, a
                    dioxide or peroxide, PbO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and a fourth oxide, Pb
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, which may be
                    regarded as a compound of the monoxide and dioxide. The suboxide is black; like
                    the corresponding oxides of mercury and silver, it furnishes the metal and a
                    salt derived from the monoxide on treatment with acids. The monoxide, PbO,
                    ordinarily known as litharge, is prepared on the large scale by the oxidation of
                    lead in air; the pure oxide has a lemon-yellow colour, and is insoluble in
                    water; it fuses at a heat below redness. The corresponding hydroxide, Pb(OH) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is obtained on adding ammonia to a solution of a
                    lead salt such as lead nitrate, Pb(NO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, as a white amorphous precipitate, which absorbs
                    carbon dioxide on exposure to air; it is converted into the oxide when heated
                    above 100° C. The oxide and hydroxide are readily acted on by acids, and form
                    stable salts; but they are also soluble in alkalies. Lead nitrate is easily
                    soluble, but lead sulphate and carbonate are insoluble in water; they may be
                    obtained in crystals isomorphous with those of the corresponding barium salts.
                    The carbonate is readily decomposed when heated, and on heating the sulphate
                    with lead sulphide metallic lead is obtained: PbSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>

                    is little known; it has a brown colour, and is converted into the monoxide and
                    oxygen when heated. Lead dioxide, PbO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, also has a
                    brown colour; it may be obtained by passing chlorine into water in which lead
                    oxide is suspended. It unites directly with sulphur dioxide, forming lead
                    sulphate, sufficient heat being developed to cause the mass to glow; it is
                    converted into the monoxide when heated; it is insoluble in most acids, but is
                    dissolved by acetic acid, and apparently converted into a corresponding acetate;
                    by fusing it with potassium hydroxide, potassium plumbate is produced, which may
                    be obtained in crystals of the composition K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> PbO

                <p>By carefully heating lead monoxide to low redness in air it is converted into the
                    red oxide or minium, the most usual composition of which is represented by the
                    formula Pb <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. On
                    treating this oxide with acids—nitric acid, for example—it furnishes lead

                <p>The relation of thallium to lead will be sufficiently evident'from the above
                    sketch of the properties of some of the more important compounds of the two
                    elements; it will be noticed also that thallium has strong points of resemblance
                    with the metals of the alkalies, and that it is in some respects related to
                    mercury. Its relation to the alkali metals is especially indicated by the
                    extreme readiness with which it is oxidized, by the properties of thallious
                    hydroxide, and by the isomorphism of many thallious compounds with the
                    corresponding potassium and sodium -compounds. Thermochemical investigation
                    entirely confirms these conclusions, as will be evident from the following
                    tables, the heat of neutralization of thallium hydroxide being equal to that of
                    the hydroxides of potassium and sodium, but the affinity of thallium for oxygen
                    being only about equal to that of mercury and copper, and somewhat less than
                    that of lead. The heat of neutralization of thallic hydroxide exceeds that of
                    aluminic hydroxide.</p>

                <p>The first of these elements has already been described. Aluminium is related not
                    only to boron but also to silicon among the non-metals, and to magnesium among
                    the metals. Its oxide is one of the most stable known, and, like silicon and
                    boron oxides, cannot be reduced by charcoal alone. The metal is usually obtained
                    by heating the double chloride of sodium and aluminium, 2NaCl,Al <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi>, with sodium.
                    Aluminium is a white malleable metal, nearly resembling zinc in colour and
                    hardness; it fuses at a lower temperature than silver, but does not volatilize.
                    It is rapidly dissolved by hydrochloric acid, but only slowly acted on by heated
                    nitric and sulphuric acids; it is readily dissolved by solutions of the
                    alkalies. In a finely-divided state it appears to decompose water almost as
                    easily as magnesium, but when in mass, even if heated to full redness in steam,
                    it decomposes water but slowly, owing to the formation of a coating of oxide on
                    its surface which protects the metal; on this account also it may be heated
                    intensely in air without undergoing more than a superficial oxidation, but in
                    the form of powder it burns brightly when heated to redness in air or oxygen.
                    Aluminium takes fire when heated in chlorine gas, and is converted into the
                    chloride, which is also produced on passing chlorine over an ignited mixture of
                    alumina and charcoal.</p>
                <p>Aluminium forms only one chloride, the density of which in the state of vapour
                    corresponds with the formula Al <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Clθ; it also forms
                    only a single oxide, A1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi>. Aluminium chloride is a colourless, crystalline, volatile substance;
                    it is deliquescent and dissolves readily in water, much heat being developed,
                    forming a strongly acid solution. Aluminium hydroxide, Al <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> (OH) <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi>, separates as an almost colourless
                    gelatinous precipitate on the addition of alkalies to a solution of an aluminium
                    salt; it is readily soluble in acids, forming salts such as aluminium sulphate,
                    A1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. Aluminium sulphate is extremely soluble in water;
                    it is very readily converted into basic salts; it combines with the sulphates of
                    the alkali metals forming characteristic double salts—the so-called alums.</p>
                <p>Aluminium hydroxide also possesses marked acid properties, being soluble in
                    alkalies, and furnishing salts such as sodium aluminate, Na <hi rend="subscript"

                    it has been exposed only to a moderate red heat the alumina is a soft, white,
                    light powder like magnesium oxide, and is soluble in acids; but after strong
                    ignition it becomes very hard and insoluble, or difficultly soluble, in acids.
                    Alumina occurs native as corundum in crystals isomorphous with the corresponding
                    oxides of chromium and iron; in the crystalline state it is the hardest
                    substance known next to the diamond, and insoluble in all acids, but like silica
                    it is dissolved on fusion with alkalies.</p>

                <p>The resemblance of aluminium to boron, silicon, and magnesium is most evident
                    when the oxides and chlorides are compared. Thus, their oxides are all bodies of
                    great stability, and, excepting magnesium oxide, possess marked acid properties;
                    and their chlorides behave similarly when added to water, boron and silicon
                    chlorides being entirely decomposed, and aluminium and magnesium chlorides at
                    least partially, the reaction in each case being attended by the development of
                    a very considerable amount of heat; thus, according as quantities are taken
                    which are as the molecular weights of the chlorides, or which contain the same
                    amount of chlorine, we have—</p>

                <p>The general resemblance between these metals is very great, but each exhibits
                    properties which serve to distinguish it readily from the others. They are also
                    related to many other elements; thus, chromium and iron are closely allied to
                    aluminium; and chromium is also allied to sulphur and its congeners; manganese
                    manifests some analogy with the halogens; nickel has properties in common with
                    copper: and iron, cobalt, and nickel are closely related to the so-called
                    platinum metals.</p>
                <p>The oxides of chromium and manganese are reduced by charcoal only at a white
                    heat; the oxides of the remaining metals are easily reduced on ignition with
                    hydrogen or carbon.</p>
                <p>The properties of chromium appear to differ considerably according to the manner
                    in which it is prepared. Thus, by heating its chloride with potassium it is
                    obtained as a dark grey powder, which oxidizes readily, taking fire in the air
                    at a heat below redness, and dissolving in dilute sulphuric and hydrochloric
                    acids. By heating its chloride with sodium, however, it is obtained in hard,
                    shining crystals, insoluble in all acids. The metal prepared by reducing the
                    oxide with charcoal is shining, has a steel-grey colour, and is hard enough to
                    scratch glass.</p>
                <p>Manganese is a soft, brittle, greyish-white metal, which oxidizes quickly on
                    exposure to the air, decomposes water slowly at ordinary temperatures, and
                    dissolves easily in acids; it is feebly magnetic.</p>
                <p>The properties of iron are too well known to need description. It dissolves
                    readily in acids, and decomposes water rapidly at a red heat, it does not alter
                    in dry air, but rapidly oxidizes in moist air; especially in presence of
                    carbonic acid.</p>
                <p>Cobalt has a steel-grey colour; nickel is silver-white. Both are hard, ductile,
                    malleable metals, of great tenacity, somewhat more fusible than iron; they
                    decompose water at a red heat, and like iron dissolve without difficulty in
                    acids. They are not altered by the combined action of air and water at ordinary
                    temperatures, but if previously heated burn in oxygen like iron. Nickel appears
                    to be less oxidizable than cobalt. They are both magnetic metals.</p>
                <p>Each of these metals forms several oxides; and hydroxides and chlorides, or
                    fluorides, corresponding to most of their oxides are known, as will be evident
                    from the following list :—</p>

                <p>Their chlorides, and, in fact, their halogen compounds generally, are all easily
                    soluble in water, with the exception of sublimed chromic chloride, Cr <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, which is insoluble
                    in cold, and is only slowly dissolved by boiling water; but if the cold solution
                    contains a minute quantity of chromous chloride, Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, the chromic chloride dissolves immediately with
                    development of heat, forming a green solution identical with that produced by
                    dissolving chromic hydroxide in hydrochloric acid; this effect is, perhaps, due
                    to the formation in the first instance of an intermediate chloride, or
                    combination of the two chlorides, which is decomposable by water. The chlorides
                    which correspond in composition to ferrous chloride, Fe <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, are all perfectly stable, and
                    volatilize without decomposition; chromic and ferric chlorides are also highly
                    stable bodies, but the remaining chlorides are exceedingly unstable. Chromium
                    hexafluoride, CrF <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, is a very volatile blood-red
                    liquid which is decomposed by water.</p>
                <p>Their oxides, with the exception of chromium trioxide or chromic anhydride, CrO
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and hydroxides are all insoluble in water, but
                    readily dissolve in acids. Chromic oxide, Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is green, and chromium trioxide has a magnificent
                    scarlet colour. Ferric oxide, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, has a reddish-brown colour; the oxides of
                    manganese are brownish black; and the oxides of nickel and cobalt are all
                    intensely black like cupric oxide. Chromic and ferric oxides form crystals
                    isomorphous with those of aluminic oxide, A1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.</p>
                <p>The affinity of chromium to oxygen is so great that chromous oxide, Cr <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is apparently
                    incapable of existing, and it is difficult to obtain ferrous oxide, Fe <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, on account of the
                    readiness with which it is oxidized to ferric oxide, Fe <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. Ferric oxide, like chromic oxide, Cr
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is a body of
                    great stability, but unlike the latter it is converted into a lower oxide,
                    ferroso-ferric oxide, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                        4</hi>, on ignition. The most stable oxide of manganese is the corresponding
                    oxide, Mn <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>; but
                    manganous oxide, Mn <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    is less readily oxidized than ferrous oxide, and manganic oxide is less stable
                    than ferric oxide; manganese is the only metal of the iron group which forms a
                    dioxide, or, as it is usually termed, a peroxide. Cobaltous oxide, Co <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, absorbs oxygen when
                    heated to dull redness in air, and is converted into the oxide Co <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, but when more
                    strongly heated this oxide is reconverted into cobaltous oxide, which is also
                    obtained on igniting cobaltic oxide, Co <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. Nickelous oxide, Ni <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, exhibits no tendency to absorb oxygen, and the
                    higher oxide is very readily decomposed by heat. From this it will be evident
                    that the affinity to oxygen diminishes rapidly from chromium to nickel.</p>
                <p>Similar differences are noticeable between their hydroxides. Thus, the tendency
                    of chromous hydroxide, Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH) <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 4</hi>, to become converted into chromic hydroxide, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Cγ</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 2</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >(OH)</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 6</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">,</hi>
                    is so great that it decomposes water even at ordinary temperatures with
                    evolution of hydrogen: Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH) <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 4</hi> + 2OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = Cr <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> (OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.
                    Ferrous hydroxide does not decompose water in this manner, but in presence of
                    both air and water it is quickly converted into ferric hydroxide: 2Fe <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + 4OH <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2Fe <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> + 2OH <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; manganous hydroxide behaves similarly, but
                    oxidizes much less rapidly; cobaltous hydroxide manifests but little tendency to
                    form the higher hydroxide, and nickelous hydroxide is unaffected, when placed in
                    contact with air and water. The two last named hydroxides, however, may be
                    converted into the higher hydroxides by treatment with a solution of sodium
                    hvDOchlorite.</p>
                <p>Their hydroxides are without difficulty converted into the corresponding oxides,
                    giving off water when very gently heated; the behaviour of chromous hydroxide is
                    peculiar, as, when ignited, it is converted into chromic oxide with evolution of
                    hydrogen: Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> = Cr
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + OH <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Many hydroxides
                    are known intermediate in composition between the oxides and the highest
                    hydroxides,—such, for example, as are represented by the formulae Fe <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O(OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> and Fe <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which obviously are intermediate in composition
                    between ferric oxide, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi>, and ferric hydroxide, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 6</hi>.</p>
                <p>With the exception of chromium trioxide, the oxides and hydroxides of the metals
                    now under consideration all exhibit marked basic properties; but chromic
                    hydroxide, like aluminie hydroxide, also has feeble acid properties, dissolving
                    in solutions of the alkalies; and cobaltous and nickelυus hydroxides, like
                    cupric hydroxide, readily dissolve in ammonia, the solution of the former being
                    brownish-red, and that of the latter blue. The oxides and hydroxides which
                    correspond in composition with ferrous oxide and hydroxide furnish stable salts
                    such as ferrous sulphate, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (SO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. The chromous salts,
                    however, are but little known; they form either red or blue solutions, which
                    absorb oxygen with avidity, and dissolve nitric oxide gas, forming dark brown
                    solutions. The ferrous salts form pale green solutions, which slowly absorb
                    oxygen, and readily dissolve nitric oxide (p. 513). The manganous salts are of a
                    pale pink colour, and their solutions are scarcely altered in contact with
                    oxygen. Solutions of cobaltous salts have a rose-red colour, unless they are
                    very concentrated or mixed with a strong acid, in which case they are blue.
                    Nickelous salts are green. The solutions of cobaltous and nickelous salts are
                    permanent in air.</p>
                <p>A second series of chromium and iron salts corresponding to the oxides Cr <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> and Fe <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> are readily
                    obtained, as they are of great stability. Solutions of chromic salts are green
                    or violet; solutions of ferric salts are yellow. Chromic salts such as chromic
                    sulphate, Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, for example, are reduced to chromous salts by the
                    action of the nascent hydrogen produced when zinc is immersed in their
                    solutions, but they cannot be thus reduced by the aid of iron; ferric salts,
                    however, are readily reduced to ferrous salts even by feeble reducing agents
                    such as hydrogen sulphide. Manganic and cobaltic salts corresponding to the
                    chromic and ferric salts may be obtained, but they are extremely unstable, and
                    nickelic salts appear to be incapable of existing, so that, on treating the
                    higher oxides and hydroxides of manganese, &amp;c., with acids, salts derived
                    from manganous oxide and its congeners are usually obtained. Thus, nickelic
                    oxide, Ni <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is
                    converted by the action of sulphuric acid into nickelous sulphate, with
                    evolution of oxygen; similarly, when manganic oxide, Mn <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, manganic peroxide, MnO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, or cobaltic oxide, Co <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is carefully dissolved in hydrochloric acid,
                    solutions are obtained which apparently contain the corresponding chlorides, Mn
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, MnCl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, and Co <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> β</hi>, but these rapidly decompose with evolution of
                    chlorine, leaving manganous chloride, Mn <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, or cobaltous chloride Co <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. The oxides which correspond in
                    composition to ferroso-ferric oxide, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, behave with acids as if mixtures of the two
                    oxides. Salts corresponding to chromium trioxide are not obtainable, for on
                    treatment with sulphuric acid it is converted into chromic sulphate, with
                    evolution of oxygen; and by the action of hydrochloric acid it is converted into
                    chromic chloride, with evolution of chlorine. Like all feebly positive metals,
                    the metals of the iron group form numerous basic salts, iron and chromium being
                    especially characterized by the formation of basic chromic and ferric salts; a
                    remarkable series of ferric and chromic “mixed salts,” such, for example, as
                    ferric tetraceto-dinitrate, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (NO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (C <hi

                        rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, have been obtained by dissolving the hydroxides in
                    mixtures of two acids in various proportions. Like aluminic sulphate, chromic,
                    ferric, and manganic sulphates form double salts with the sulphates of the
                    alkali metals, which correspond both in composition and crystalline form with
                    the alums. The chrome alums are almost as stable as the true alums, but the iron
                    alums are much less stable, and the manganese alums are so unstable that water
                    decomposes them into their component salts. Ferrous, manganous, cobaltous, and
                    nickelous sulphates form double sulphates with the sulphates of the alkali
                    metals, corresponding in composition and isomorphous with double sulphates such
                    as K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Zn(SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi

                <p>The relation of chromium to sulphur and the allied elements is indicated by the
                    existence of the trioxide CrO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>; this oxide, however,
                    is not merely analogous in composition to sulphuric anhydride, but also
                    resembles it in properties. Thus, it dissolves readily in water, forming a
                    strongly acid, yellow solution of chromic acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    CrO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>; and the salts of this acid are not only
                    analogous in composition to the corresponding sulphates, but are also
                    isomorphous with them, and are similar to them in many respects, the chromates
                    of metals which form insoluble or difficultly soluble sulphates being as a rule
                    also insoluble or difficultly soluble. But although the chromates are stable
                    salts, chromic acid is not known except in solution, chromic anhydride, CrO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, being obtained when the solution is evaporated;
                    moreover, chromic acid very readily parts with oxygen, and on this account is a
                    most valuable oxidizing agent. Acid salts of chromic acid corresponding to the
                    acid sulphates apparently cannot exist, for when a solution of a chromate is
                    rendered acid the colour changes from pale yellow to orange-yellow, the chromate
                    being converted into an anhydrochromate or dichromate, which is formed from two
                    molecules of the acid chromate by the withdrawal of the elements of a molecule
                    of water; thus —</p>

                <p>The anhydrochromates are mostly orange-red, the corresponding chromates being
                    yellow; they are very stable, and unlike the anhydrosulphates (p. 507), to which
                    they correspond in composition, dissolve in water unchanged.</p>
                <p>The relation of chromium to sulphur is also indicated by the existence of an

                <p>The permanganates are much more stable than the manganates, and their solutions
                    may be boiled without their decomposing; but they readily part with oxygen, and
                    are therefore most powerful oxidizing agents</p>
                <p>As the manganates and sulphates are isomorphous it is probable that the two
                    classes of compounds are analogous in constitution; and from the manner in which
                    the permanganates are formed from the manganates it is probable that the former
                    contain at least two atoms of manganese in the molecule, and that potassium
                    permanganate, for example, is represented by the formula ∙ , <hi
                        rend="subscript"> r</hi> √ <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi>. '. But

                    permanganate is isomorphous with potassium perchlorate and periodate; it
                    therefore appears probable that, as already pointed out (p. 497), the formula K
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 8</hi> for the former salt is preferable to the simpler
                    formula KC1O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, by which it is usually represented.
                    The isomorphism of potassium permanganate with potassium perchlorate and
                    periodate is, however, chiefly of interest as an indication that manganese is
                    related to the halogens.</p>
                <p>Iron is also capable of yielding a compound analogous to potassium manganate, but
                    much less stable, termed potassium ferrate, K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> FeO
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>; it is produced by fusing an oxide of iron with
                    nitre. The solution has a cherry-red colour, and on the addition of acids is at
                    once decomposed with evolution of oxygen. The most characteristic compounds of
                    iron, however, are the so-called ferrocyanides and ferricyanides. Potassium
                    ferrocyanide, K <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    (CN) <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi>, is produced on adding potassium cyanide to a
                    solution of a ferrous salt in sufficient amount to redissolve the precipitate
                    which at first forms; it crystallizes from the concentrated solution in
                    beautiful yellow plates. The tendency to form this salt is so great that
                    metallic iron is rapidly dissolved when heated with an aqueous solution of
                    potassium cyanide: —</p>

                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>. Not only is the presence of iron in this compound not discoverable by the
                    ordinary tests, but on treatment with hydrochloric acid it furnishes
                    hydroferrocyanic acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> Fe <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> (CN) <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi>, and is not, like most double
                    cyanides, decomposed with evolution of hydrocyanic acid. Potassium ferricyanide,
                    K <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (CN) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 12</hi>, is produced by the action of chlorine on the
                    ferrocyanide: K <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>

                        rend="subscript"> 12</hi> ÷ 2KC1; it crystallizes in red prisms, and like
                    the ferrocyanide is an extremely stable compound. Other ferro-and ferri-cyanides
                    may be prepared from the potassium compounds by double decomposition.</p>
                <p>Cobalticyanides, such as K <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> Co <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> (CN) <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi>, isomorphous with the
                    ferricyanides, are readily obtained, and are equally stable; but the
                    cobaltocyanides are very unstable. Chrom i-cyanides and mangano-and
                    mangani-cyanides, isomorphous with the corresponding iron compounds are also
                    known, but they are much less stable than the latter. Nickel does not furnish
                    compounds of this kind, but like copper forms double cyanides, such as Ni(CN)
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, 2KCN, which are readily decomposed by acids
                    with evolution of hydrocyanic acid.</p>
                <p>Nickel, although of the same atomic weight as cobalt, it will be manifest, is
                    possessed of very different properties, being in many respects much more nearly
                    related to copper than to cobalt, iron, &amp;c.; it is noteworthy that nickel
                    and copper are the only metals whose compounds form blue solutions with ammonia.
                    The relation of chromium, iron, manganese, and cobalt to one another, and of the
                    first two especially to aluminium, will be sufficiently evident without further
                    remark; the relation of iron, cobalt, and nickel to the platinum metals will be
                    referred to later on.</p>
                <p>Manganese and iron are the only elements of this group which have been submitted
                    to thermochemical investigation. Many of the results are of considerable
                    interest; thus, it will be noticed, on reference to the following tables, that
                    much more heat is developed in the formation of riaugaivíus chloride, MnCl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> or Mn <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, than in that of the corresponding chloride of
                    iron; this is of interest in connection with and may perhaps serve to explain,
                    the great instability of the higher chlorides of manganese.</p>

                <p>The only two compounds of the metals of the iron group of which the vapour
                    density has been determined are ferric chloride and chromium oxychloride; the
                    density of the former corresponds to the formula Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, and that of the latter to the formula CrO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Hence the
                    composition of ferric chloride is similar to that of aluminic chloride, the
                    density of which corresponds to the formula Al <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CL,
                    and it is therefore probable that chromic chloride, which is in all respects
                    analogous to aluminic and ferric chlorides, is similarly constituted, and that
                    its formula is Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript">
                    6</hi>.</p>
                <p>The majority of the formulae employed to represent chemical compounds which
                    cannot be converted into gas are merely the simplest expressions of their
                    composition in terms of the atomic weights of their constituent elements. Thus
                    it is usual to express the composition of the lower chlorides of chromium, iron,
                    manganese, &lt;fcc., by the simple formulae CrCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    MnCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, FeCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and the
                    corresponding oxides by the similar formulae CrO, MnO, FeO; there are reasons,
                    however, which lead us to suppose that in many cases the less simple formulae,
                    such as Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, Cr <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, are to be
                    preferred, and that the lower ch!orides and oxides of iron, &amp;c., like the
                    higher chlorides and oxides, contain at least two atoms of the metal in the
                    molecule. For example, the lower chlorides of chromium and iron are readily
                    converted into the higher chlorides by the action of chlorine; now if the
                    formula of ferrous chloride is FeCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, that of ferric
                    chloride being Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi>,
                    the conversion of the former into the latter by the action of chlorine involves
                    the extremely improbable assumption that a molecule of the ferric compound is
                    formed from two molecules of the ferrous compound :—</p>
                <p>2FeCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = Fe <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>.</p>
                <p>Chlorine is not known ever to produce an effect of this kind, that is to say,
                    directly to cause the formation of a more complex from a less complex molecule;
                    but its action is frequently to produce an effect the very reverse of this, many
                    instances of simplification of the molecule by the action of chlorine being
                    known. By adopting the formula Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> for ferrous chloride a natural interpretation of
                    its conversion into ferric chloride is at once possible, however :—</p>
                <p>FeCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> FeCl <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi></p>
                <p>II + cι <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> = I l'eCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    Fed,</p>
                <p>Ferrous chloride. Ferric chloride.</p>
                <p>Corresponding formulae may be assigned to the lower chlorides of chromium,
                    manganese, cobalt, and nickel, on account of their resemblance to ferrous
                    chloride; and from the general resemblance which the nickel compounds bear to
                    the cupric compounds it appears probable that, if nickel chloride has the
                    formula Ni <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, cupric
                    chloride has the formula Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 4</hi>.</p>
                <p>The argument may be extended much further, and from the more or less perfect
                    resemblance of silver chloride to cuprous chloride, mercurous chloride, and
                    other chlorides which certainly contain at least two atoms of chlorine in their
                    molecules, we may infer that the formula Ag <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is probably a more correct expression than that
                    commonly employed. The existence of a subchloride and a suboxide of silver
                    indicates that silver is not uniformly a monad element, and if we regard copper,
                    silver, and gold as triad elements (although the last mentioned is undoubtedly
                    capable of assuming pentad functions) we may represent their lower chlorides by
                    similar formulae, and thus, in a measure, account for the similarity in their
                    properties :—</p>
                <p>CuCl AgCl AuCl</p>
                <p>II II II</p>
                <p>CuCl AgCl AuCl</p>
                <p>Cuprous chloride. Argentic chloride. Aurous chloride.</p>
                <p>But it has been pointed out that certain of the silver compounds are isomorphous
                    with the corresponding sodium and potassium compounds, and as there is no reason
                    to suppose that the argentic compounds generally are not of similar constitution
                    to argentic chloride, the conclusion that there are two atoms of silver in the
                    molecule of argentic chloride would appear to necessitate the assumption that
                    the compounds of the alkali metals also contain at least two atoms of the metal
                    in their molecules ;—that the formula of sodium nitrate, for example, is Na <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (NO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and not NaNO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. The
                    existence of a compound of sodium ethyl with zinc ethyl, NaZn(C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, from which the former cannot even be separated,
                    appears to show that sodium does not invariably function as a monad.</p>
                <p>Speculations of this kind are extremely hazardous, but, as no method is known
                    enabling us to ascertain the molecular composition of compounds which cannot be
                    volatilized, they possess a certain interest and, moreover, point to the
                    necessity of investigation in this direction.</p>

                <p>These metals always occur in the native state, and are usually associated
                    together. The relation between <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n548/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0548-0537"/> ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium, and
                    between osmium, iridium, and platinum, is similar to that which obtains between
                    iron, cobalt, and nickel; they are indeed very closely related to these last
                    elements,—the resemblance in properties being greatest between iron, ruthenium,
                    and osmium; between cobalt, rhodium, and iridium; and between nickel, palladium,
                    and platinum. Palladium and platinum also manifest much analogy to silver and
                    gold, and ruthenium and osmium exhibit properties which connect them with the
                    elements molybdenum and tungsten.</p>
                <p>They are white, or nearly white, hard metals, of high specific gravity, osmium
                    being the heaviest of the elements; they may be melted, but only at a very high
                    temperature with the aid of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, with the exception of
                    osmium, which does not melt, but volatilizes, palladium being more fusible, and
                    rhodium, ruthenium, and iridium much less fusible, than platinum. Palladium is
                    soluble in concentrated nitric acid, and platinum in nitrous acid, as well as in
                    aqua-regia; the remaining metals are difficultly soluble or are insoluble in
                    aqua-regia. They are all attacked on fusion with alkalies and potassic nitrate.
                    Most of them possess in a high degree the property to which allusion has already
                    been made of condensing gases on their surfaces, especially when in a finely
                    divided state; thus, finely divided platinum at ordinary temperatures absorbs
                    about 240 times its volume of hydrogen, and finely divided palladium at 200° C.
                    absorbs nearly 700 times its volume of hydrogen. W!ιen heated in an atmosphere
                    of the gas platinum and palladium also occlude hydrogen when in a compact state.
                    The latter metal, according to Troost and Hautefeuille, forms a definite
                    compound with hydrogen of the composition Pd <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H,
                    which is further capable of absorbing hydrogen in considerable quantity; the
                    density of the pure compound is 11 06, that of the melted metal from which it
                    was prepared being 12, and, therefore, if it be supposed that the elements unite
                    without condensation, that is to say, that the hydrogen has the same density as
                    it would have if solidified in the free state, the density of solidified
                    hydrogen is '62, or slightly higher than that of lithium. Iron, cobalt, and
                    nickel also possess the property of occluding hydrogen, although only in a
                    slight degree.</p>

                    Osmium tetroxide is a white, crystalline, extremely volatile substance; it melts
                    considerably below 100’ C., and boils at a temperature a little above its
                    melting point. The vapour density determination shows that it is correctly
                    represented by the formula OsO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. Its vapour has an
                    intolerably pungent odour, and is excessively poisonous. It is dissolved by
                    water, and is a powerful oxidizing agent, but does not evolve chlorine on
                    treatment with hydrochloric acid; most metals, even silver and mercury,
                    excepting gold and the platinum metals, partially reduce its solution and cause
                    the separation of osmium; it is decomposed by ammonia, being converted into the
                    hydroxide Os(OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, with evolution of nitrogen: 3OsO

                <p>The tetroxides of ruthenium and osmium are apparently perfectly neutral bodies,
                    possessing neither basic nor acid properties; the remaining oxides exhibit only

                    the compounds analogous to the ferricyanides are not known. On heating the
                    metals with potassium nitrate, compounds analogous in composition to potassium
                    ferrate, but more stable, are formed; potassium rutheniate, K <hi

                <p>The chlorides of ruthenium and osmium form numerous double salts, but the most
                    important are the ruthenio-and osmio-chlorides, such as <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    corresponding platinochlorides.</p>
                <p>Iridium and rhodium are insoluble in aqua-regia, and even when in a finely
                    divided state are only slowly oxidized at a red heat; the most stable oxide of
                    iridium is the dioxide, and the tendency of iridium is always to form compounds
                    which correspond to this oxide in composition, but compounds corresponding to
                    the oxide Rh <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> are
                    more often produced from rhodium, this being apparently its most stable oxide.
                    The oxides of rhodium are reduced when heated in an atmosphere of hydrogen, but
                    the oxides of iridium are reduced at ordinary temperatures. The difference
                    between the two metals is therefore similar to that between ruthenium and
                    osmium, which they much resemble in their general behaviour, although neither
                    furnishes a tetroxide, and rhodium forms only one stable chloride, the hydroxide
                    Rh(OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> being dissolved by hydrochloric acid with
                    evolution of chlorine. Iridium tetrachloride forms double chlorides or
                    iridiochlorides isomorphous with the corresponding platinochlorides. Like
                    cobalt, rhodium and iridium form compounds which are not only analogous in
                    composition to the ferricyanides, but also isomorphous with them. A number of
                    rhodium salts corresponding to the oxide Rh <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> are known, but they crystallize with difficulty;
                    the hydroxides of iridium are soluble in acids, but no definite oxygen salts of
                    iridium have been obtained. The hydroxides Rh <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (OH)

                    and iridium are precipitated from solutions of their salts by most metals, but
                    not by silver or gold.</p>
                <p>In many cf their properties palladium and platinum more nearly resemble silver
                    and gold than the preceding metals, just as nickel is more closely allied to
                    copper than to cobalt and iron. Palladium is superficially oxidized at a lower
                    temperature than silver, but its oxide is decomposed at a red heat; platinum is
                    not in the least affected when heated in air or oxygen. The most stable
                    compounds of palladium are the palladious compounds, a solution of palladic
                    chloride, PdCl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, being decomposed when heated, with
                    evolution of chlorine, Pd <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript">
                        4</hi> being produced; the most stable compounds of platinum, however, are
                    those which correspond in composition to platinic chloride. Palladium, like
                    silver, is stained by iodine, which is without action on platinum, owing to the
                    formation of palladious iodide, which is also obtained on adding potassium
                    iodide to a solution of a palladious salt; it is a black powder insoluble in.
                    water but soluble in ammonia, and also, like silver iodide, in a solution of
                    potassium iodide. Both platinous and platinic chlorides, like auric chloride,
                    readily unite with hydrochloric acid, forming chloroplatinous and chloroplatinic
                    acids, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> PtCl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> and H
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> PtCl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>; salts of
                    these acids are produced by the combination of platinous and platinic chlorides
                    with the chlorides of other metals. Palladious and palladic chlorides, and the
                    corresponding chlorides of the other platinum metals, as already pointed out,
                    form similar compounds, those which correspond in composition being in all cases
                    isomorphous. Although platiuum and palladium do not furnish compounds analogous
                    to the ferro-or ferri-cyanides, they form a distinct series of very beautiful
                    and highly stable salts termed platinocyanides and palladiocyanides, which are
                    analogous in composition to the chloroplatinites, and from which the
                    corresponding acids may be obtained by decomposing the silver salts, for
                    example, with hydrogen sulphide; thus :—</p>

                <p>The oxides and hydroxides of platinum and palladium are somewhat more stable than
                    the silver and gold compounds, but are entirely decomposed on ignition; they
                    dissolve in acids, but the resulting salts have little stability, although they
                    are considerably more stable than those of gold. The hydroxides appear all to
                    possess acid properties, platinic hydroxide dissolving readily in solutions of
                    alkalies, forming metallic derivatives which may be obtained in crystals.
                    Platinic hydroxide, like auric hydroxide, is converted into a fulminating
                    compound by the action of ammonia.</p>
                <p>Cobalt and the platinum metak are especially characterized by the readiness with
                    which they enter into reaction with ammonia, forming salts of cobalt and
                    platinum bases, which are often extremely complex in composition. Thus, a
                    solution of platinous chloride in warm, moderately strong ammonia, concentrated
                    by evaporation, on cooling deposits yellow crystals of platinodiammonium
                    chloride, PtN <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> Cl
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O; by treating
                    a solution of this salt with silver sulphate it is converted into the sulphate
                    PtN <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> (SO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>), from which the corresponding hydroxide PtN <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> (OH) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> may be procured by adding to the solution the
                    equivalent quantity of barium hydroxide. Platinodiammonium hydroxide may be
                    obtained in crystals; it is a powerfully alkaline, caustic substance, aud,
                    according to Thomsen, its heat of neutralization is as great as that of the
                    alkalies and the hydroxides of barium, strontium, and calcium. When
                    platinodiammonium hydroxide is heated as long as it gives off ammonia and water,
                    it is converted into platinoammonium oxide PtN <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> O, from which salts such as platinoammonium

                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, may be prepared by the action of acids; on passing
                    chlorine into water in which the latter is suspended it is converted into
                    chloroplatinoammonium chloride, PtCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> N <hi

                <p>Titanium and zirconium are closely related to silicon and, therefore, to carbon,
                    and occupy an intermediate position between these elements and the true metals.
                    Titanium and tin, however, are more nearly related than either titanium and
                    zirconium or tin and zirconium,— zirconium more closely resembling silicon,
                    especially in tho properties of its oxide.</p>
                <p>Titanium and zirconium apparently resemble silicon closely in their physical
                    properties, and exist both in the amorphous and crystalline state. In the
                    amorphous state they burn with great brilliancy when heated to redness in
                    oxygen, and they take fire when heated to redness in chlorine; titanium also
                    unites directly with nitrogen at high temperatures, and it is stated forms the
                    three nitrides Ti <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,

                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Titanium is said to be soluble in warm
                    hydrochloric acid, but zirconium is only slowly attacked by ordinary acids,
                    although it readily dissolves even in cold hydrofluoric acid. Crystalline
                    zirconium is very hard, and resembles antimony in colour, lustre, and
                    brittleness; it is less fusible than silicon.</p>
                <p>Tin is a soft, very malleable, white metal, with a tinge of yellow, and is a
                    tolerably good conductor of electricity, titanium and zirconium being
                    non-conductors of electricity. It fuses at about 230° C. It scarcely tarnishes
                    at ordinary temperatures, but at a red heat it rapidly oxidizes, and readily
                    decomposes water. It is only slowly dissolved by <pb break="no"

                    SnCl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. Two chlorides of titanium are known, Ti <hi

                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. Titanium and tin tetrachlorides are colourless
                    liquids, which boil respectively at 135° and 115° C.; their lower chlorides are
                    solids, and are powerful reducing agents. Zirconium chloride is a white,
                    crystalline solid; its vapour density corresponds with the formula ZrCl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. When titanium and tin tetrachlorides are mixed
                    with a small quantity of water, much heat is developed, and they dissolve,
                    probably forming chlorhydrins; but a large quantity of water causes their
                    conversion into the corresponding hydroxides, which separate as white gelatinous
                    precipitates. Zirconium chloride is dissolved even by a large quantity of water,
                    but the hydroxide Zr(OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> separates as a gelatinous,
                    bulky, white precipitate on the addition of alkalies.</p>
                <p>Titanium, zirconium, and tin tetrafluoride unite with metallic fluorides, forming
                    crystalline salts which correspond in composition to the silcofluorides or
                    fluosilicates (p. 522), with which they are isomorphous; thus :—</p>

                <p>Titanic oxide, TiO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, has a reddish-brown colour;

                    ZrO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is white. They may be obtained in crystals
                    which are isomorphous. Zirconic oxide is infusible, and titanic oxide melts only
                    at the heat of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe; stannic oxide is somewhat more fusible,
                    although very difficult to fuse. Titanic oxide is reduced by charcoal at a white
                    heat, and stannic oxide at a full red heat; zirconic oxide, however, appears
                    entirely to resist reduction; by ignition with charcoal in an atmosphere of
                    chlorine they are converted into the corresponding chlorides. After ignition
                    they are insoluble in acids, except concentrated sulphuric acid; they are
                    dissolved on fusion with alkalies. By dissolving the oxides or the corresponding
                    hydroxides in acids, salts such as stannic sulphate, Sn(SO <hi rend="subscript">

                    salts are so unstable, however, that their solutions are decomposed by boiling;
                    the zirconium salts are somewhat more stable. Stannic hydroxide readily
                    dissolves in alkaline solutions, but titanic and zirconic hydroxides are
                    insoluble. The salts which are formed from the hydroxides or oxides by the
                    action of alkalies are mostly analogous to the silicates of the form M√SiOo;

                <p>These elements belong to the same group as nitrogen and phosphorus, but the
                    relation between them is in a marked degree periodic, the resemblance being
                    greatest in many respects between arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, and between
                    vanadium, niobium, and tantalum. Vanadium is the only member of the group,
                    excepting niobium and, perhaps, tantalum, which furnishes coloured compounds,
                    and in this respect resembles titanium and chromium, to both of which it is
                    about equally related. Relationship may also be traced between arsenic aud
                    selenium; between niobium and zirconium, and niobium and molybdenum; between
                    antimony and tin, and antimony and tellurium; and between tantalum and
                    tungsten.</p>

                <p>Arsenic, antimony, and bismuth are readily reduced from their oxides, but the
                    oxides of vanadium, niobium, and tantalum are not reduced to the metallic state
                    by ignition with chareoal; vanadium may be obtained by the reduction of its
                    dichloride in hydrogen at a bright-red heat. Arsenic has a brilliant, dark
                    steel-grey lustre; antimony has a bluish-white, and bismuth a reddish-white
                    colour; they are hard, and extremely brittle, and bad conductors of electricity.
                    Arsenic begins to volatilize at 180° C. without fusing; antimony fuses at about
                    450° C., and bismuth at about 265° C. They are but little altered on exposure to
                    the air at ordinary temperatures, but readily oxidize when heated. They are
                    readily acted upon by moderately concentrated nitric acid, but are only very
                    slowly dissolved by boiling hydrochloric acid.</p>
                <p>Vanadium has been obtained as a whitish-grey powder which under the microscope
                    appears as a brilliant, crystal· line, metallic mass possessing a silver-white
                    lustre. It does not oxidize at ordinary temperatures, but when heated in air it
                    rapidly absorbs oxygen, and is finally converted into the pentoxide. It is not
                    attacked by boiling hydrochloric acid, but nitric acid of all strengths readily
                    dissolves it. It is converted into a mononitride when heated in nitrogen
                    gas.</p>
                <p>Niobium and tantalum have been obtained only in an impure state as black powders.

                    nitrogen. Vanadium dichloride crystallizes in apple-green coloured plates, and
                    vanadium trichloride forms peach-blossom coloured tables; vanadium tetrachloride
                    is a reddish-brown liquid, which boils at 154° C. An oxychloride of vanadium,
                    VOCl <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, corresponding to phosphorus oxychloride, POCl
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is also known; it is a yellow liquid, which
                    boils at 126° C. The vapour density of the tetrachloride, according to Roscoe,
                    corresponds with the formula VCl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, but as it is
                    resolved into the trichloride and free chlorine on boiling, and even undergoes
                    the same decomposition at ordinary temperatures, it may be doubted whether the
                    density observed was really that of the tetrachloride, and not that of a mixture
                    of a lower chloride and chlorine, especially as from the analogy which vanadium
                    presents to chromium the formula V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 8</hi> appears to be more probable than the simpler

                    forming a blue, the trichloride a green, the dichloride a lavender-coloured, and
                    the oxychloride a yellow liquid; the solution of the dichloride is a most
                    powerful reducing agent, and the solutions of the tri-and tetra-chloride also
                    exhibit reducing properties, owing to the tendency of the dissolved compounds to
                    combine with oxgyen to form vanadic acid.</p>

                    phosphoric anhydride; it has a brownish-red colour, and fuses at a red heat; it
                    dissolves sparingly in water, forming a yellow, strongly acid solution of
                    vanadic acid. By the combination of vanadic anhydride with basic oxides in

                <p>Isomorphism has been observed between several corresponding phosphates and
                    vanadates. The tetroxide and trioxide of vanadium also possess feeble acid
                    properties and unite with basic oxides. The vanadium oxides dissolve in acids,
                    mostly forming salts such as the sulphate V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi

                    the radicle VO; the formation of salts of this kind is characteristic of all the
                    metalloids included in this group, and apparently of the metalloids generally. A
                    solution of vanadium pentoxide in sulphuric acid, which is red, becomes blue on
                    treatment with sulphurous acid or hydrogen sulphide, the salt of the pentoxide
                    being reduced to a salt of the tetroxide; by the aid of magnesium the reduction
                    may be carried a stage further, and a salt of the trioxide is formed, the
                    solution becoming green; and if zinc, cadmium, <hi rend="smallcaps">dγ</hi>
                    sodium amalgam is employed, the solution finally becomes lavender-coloured, and

                    liquid, which boils at 132° C.; it is dissolved by water, probably as a
                    chlorhydrin, as its solution in the smallest possible quantity of water deposits

                <p>Antimony trichloride is a crystalline compound which boils at 223° C.; its vapour
                    density corresponds with the formula SbCl <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. Antimony
                    pentachloride, SbCl <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, is a heavy, yellowish liquid,
                    which cannot be distilled without decomposition. These chlorides are dissolved
                    by hydrochloric acid or a small quantity of water, but a large quantity of water
                    converts the trichloride into an insoluble oxychloride, SbOCl, and the
                    pentachloride into a compound which corresponds in composition to pyrophosphoric
                    acid, viz., H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> Sb <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi

                    corresponding to phosphorus oxychloride is known, but a. crystalline antimony

                <p>Bismuth trichloride is a very fusible, volatile, deliquescent, colourless
                    compound; its vapour density corresponds with the formula BiCl <hi

                    BiOCl; when heated in hydrogen it furnishes an unstable dichloride, Bi <hi

                <p>Niobium pentachloride, NbCl <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, is a yellow, easily
                    fusible,, crystalline substance, which boils at 240° C.; niobium oxychloride,
                    NbOCl <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is a white, infusible, but volatile,
                    crystalline compound. The formulae of these .bodies have: been established by
                    the determination of their vapour densities; both are decomposed by water. The
                    solution of niobium chloride in hydrochloric acid becomes blue when a. plate of
                    zinc is immersed in it. Tantalum pentachloride is a yellow, fusible, crystalline
                    substance, which boils at about 242° C.; its vapour density corresponds with the
                    formula TaCl <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>; it is decomposed by water.</p>
                <p>Both oxides of arsenic are white; the trioxide sublimes at about 200° C. without
                    fusing; the pentoxide, when suddenly heated to redness, fuses and is decomposed
                    into the trioxide and oxygen. The vapour density of the tri oxide corresponds
                    with the formula As <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>.
                    Arsenic trioxide is sparingly soluble in cold water, more readily in hot water,
                    and freely in hot hydrochloric acid; the aqueous solution reddens litmus. The
                    pentoxide is deliquescent and easily soluble in water, forming a solution of
                    arsenic acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> AsO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>;
                    on evaporating the solution, however, even at ordinary temperatures, crystals of
                    an acid corresponding in composition to pyrophosphoric acid, H <hi

                    converted into the pentoxide when heated at about 260° C. Arsenic acid furnishes
                    a series of salts analogous in composition to and isomorphous with the
                    corresponding phosphates. Arsenic trioxide is almost destitute of basic
                    properties, and the salts formed by its union with basic oxides are not very
                    stable, so that it differs greatly from the corresponding oxide of phosphorus;
                    thermochemical investigation confirms this conclusion. Thus, on inspection of
                    the following table, which shows the amounts of heat which are developed on
                    adding sodium hydroxide solution to solutions of the acids of phosphorus and
                    arsenic, it will be evident that, whereas the behaviour of arsenic acid is
                    similar to that of phosphoric acid, the behaviour of a solution of arsenic
                    trioxide is altogether different from that of a solution of phosphorus trioxide
                    (phosphorous acid), the molecule of arsenic trioxide regarded as As <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, like boron oxide,
                    evidently existing in solution as a dibasic acid; it is not known whether the
                    molecular composition of phosphorus trioxide is correctly represented by the
                    formula P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and
                    whether therefore the difference between the phosphorus and arsenic compounds is
                    to be referred to the existence of a difference similar to that exhibited by the

                <p>The oxides of antimony are white or yellowish; the trioxide is fusible and
                    volatile, and is partly converted into the tetroxide when heated in air; the
                    tetroxide is infusible, and unalterable by heat; the pentoxide is converted into
                    the tetroxide at a red heat. The vapour density of the trioxide has not been
                    determined, but as it may be obtained in crystals isomorphous with those of
                    arsenic trioxide its formula is probably Sb <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 6</hi>. The oxides of antimony all exhibit feeble acid
                    properties, dissolving in alkalies, but the salts mostly have little stability;
                    the most stable salts apparently are those which correspond to the potassium
                    salt of the formula K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Sb <hi rend="subscript">
                        4</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 11</hi>. The· oxides of antimony are soluble
                    in hydrochloric and concentrated sulphuric acids; the trioxide may thus be
                    converted into the sulphate, Sb <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (SO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, which is decomposed
                    by water into an acid and a basic salt.</p>
                <p>The bismuth oxides are yellow or brown, and are devoid of acid properties, but
                    they dissolve in acids; the pentoxide is decomposed and converted into the
                    tetroxide when heated to about 220° C., and the latter is reduced to the
                    trioxide at a somewhat higher temperature. Bismuth sulphate, Bi <hi

                    into an acid and a basic salt.</p>

                    corresponding arsenic and bismuth compounds are formed in a similar manner.</p>
                <p>Niobium and tantalum pentoxides are white and infusible; they do not volatilize;
                    after ignition they are insoluble in all acids, but dissolve on fusion with
                    alkalies. They exhibit marked acid properties, combining with basic oxides in
                    various proportions. The hydrated oxides obtained on decomposing the chlorides
                    by water are acid to litmus, and are soluble in hydrochloric and hydrofluoric
                    acids. The fluorides of niobium and tantalum, and niobium oxyfluoride, readily
                    form double salts with other fluorides, which in many cases are isomorphous with
                    certain titanium, zirconium, tin, and tungsten compounds which do not exactly
                    correspond to them in composition, but in which apparently fluorine and oxygen
                    displace one another isomorphously; thus, the following pairs of compounds are
                    isomorphous :—</p>

                <p>Molybdenum pentachloride is the highest chloride obtained by heating molybdenum
                    in chlorine gas; it is a black, crystalline substance, which forms a colourless
                    solution when dissolved in a considerable quantity of water; when heated in air
                    it is converted into a colourless oxychloride, MoO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; according to Debray, its vapour density

                    tetrachloride is brown, the trichloride red, and the dichloride yellow; the
                    molecular formulae of these chlorides are undetermined. In an atmosphere of
                    carbon dioxide the dichloride bears a bright red heat without melting or
                    volatilizing, the trichloride is resolved into di-and tetrachloride, and the
                    latter when again heated, splits up into pentachloride which sublimes, and
                    trichloride which remains; the di-and tri-chlorides are insoluble, but the
                    tetrachloride is readily soluble in water.</p>
                <p>Tungsten is converted by chlorine at a moderate heat into a hexachloride, WCl <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, which forms black-violet crystals; it melts at
                    275° C., and boils at 341° C.; from the determination of its vapour density it
                    appears that it undergoes decomposition when heated. When pure it is insoluble
                    in water below 60° C., but if the slightest trace <pb break="no"

                    water even in the cold. Tungsten pentachloride crystallizes in black, highly
                    deliquescent needles; it melts at 248° C., and boils at 376° C., and its vapour
                    density at 350 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> C. corresponds with the formula
                    WCI <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. It has already been pointed out that the
                    existence of pentachlorides of tungsten and molybdenum, and of a vanadium
                    tetrachloride, is apparently anomalous; at present, these chlorides, chlorine
                    dioxide, ClO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, nitrogen monoxide and dioxide, and,
                    perhaps, uranium pentachloride are the only instances known to us in which
                    apparently an odd number of affinities are disengaged (see p. 473).</p>
                <p>Tungsten tetrachloride is a crystalline, greyish-brown substance; when strongly
                    heated it decomposes into the volatile pentachloride and the non-volatile
                    dichloride, which is a loose grey powder, destitute of crystalline structure.
                    Tungsten also forms two oxychlorides, WOCl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> and WO
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; the former is
                    obtained in beautiful ruby-red, and the latter in yellow crystals. The formula
                    of the monoxychloride, WOC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, has been established
                    by determining its vapour density.</p>
                <p>Molybdenum trioxide has marked acid properties, but the remaining oxides are
                    feebly basic; both oxides of tungsten exhibit acid functions. Solutions of

                    molybdates are mostly white. Molybdenum trioxide, MoO <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi>, melts at a. red heat to a dark yellow liquid, which on cooling forms
                    a strawyellow mass, breaking up into crystalline scales; it is scarcely soluble
                    in water, but dissolves in hydrochloric, nitric, and sulphuric acids. Like
                    silica and other feebly acid oxides it combines with basic oxides in a large
                    number of different proportions, forming molybdates.. Tungsten trioxide, WO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is a canary-yellow substance, insoluble in water
                    and in most acids; it melts at a high temperature, and, like molybdenum
                    trioxide, may be volatilized by heat; it dissolves in alkaline solutions,
                    forming tungstates, of which a great variety may be obtained by the union of
                    tungsten trioxide with basic oxides in various proportions. The tungstates are
                    mostly colourless. When a hot solution of an alkaline tungstate is mixed with an
                    acid a yellow precipitate of tungstic acid, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> WO
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, is obtained, which is insoluble in water, and
                    forms insoluble salts with all metals, except the alkali metals; but by
                    decomposing tungstates by the stronger acids at ordinary temperatures a soluble
                    variety of the acid, called metatungstic acid, is produced, which forms soluble
                    salts with nearly all metals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Uranium.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The atomic weight of
                    uranium has not yet been ascertained, and its position among the elements is
                    therefore uncertain, especially as it does not exhibit marked analogy to any
                    other element. The generally received atomic weight is 120, but Mendeljeff has
                    proposed to double this; L. Meyer, however, considers that from the high
                    specific gravity of the metal it is more probable that its atomic weight is 180,
                    and that it occupies a position in the series near to tungsten. A
                    redetermination of the equivalent of this element and an investigation of its
                    compounds are much required.</p>
                <p>Uranium is like iron in colour; it tarnishes when exposed to the air, and in the
                    pulverulent state takes fire at a comparatively low temperature, and burns with
                    great brilliancy, forming a green oxide, U <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 8</hi>; it is dissolved by hydrochloric acid, forming a
                    green solution, which has powerful reducing properties. The highest oxide has
                    the composition UO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. Uranium forms a volatile stable
                    tetrachloride, UC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, which crystallizes in
                    dark-green octahedra, and an unstable chloride regarded as the pentachloride,
                    UC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>; both are dissolved and decomposed by
                    water.</p>
                <p>When uranium, or either of its oxides, is dissolved in nitric acid, a solution of
                    uranic nitrate is formed from which the salt may be crystallized in beautiful
                    yellow prisms of the composition (UO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>)(NO <hi

                <p>Excepting thorium, these elements are closely related in properties; their
                    compounds are of extremely rare occurrence. Lanthanum, cerium, and didymium are
                    always associated together, and on account of their occurrence in the mineral
                    cerite are usually termed cerite metals; they appear to occupy a position
                    intermediate between the alkaline earth metals and the metals of the aluminium
                    group. The atomic weights of yttrium and erbium, the so-called gadolinite
                    metals, have not been determined; their compounds much resemble those of the
                    cerite metals. The atomic weight of thorium is also unknown; from the properties
                    of its compounds, however, it is not improbable that it is a member of the
                    aluminium group.</p>
                <p>Lanthanum, cerium, and didymium have been obtained by the electrolysis of their
                    chlorides. Cerium is an extremely ductile metal, resembling iron in colour and
                    lustre; it melts more readily than silver, but much less readily than antimony.
                    It retains its lustre for a considerable period in dry air, but takes fire much
                    more readily than magnesium, and burns with great brilliancy. It slowly
                    decomposes cold water, and rapidly dissolves in hydrochloric acid.</p>
                <p>Lanthanum and didymium closely resemble cerium in their general chemical
                    behaviour. Lanthanum is a slightly harder, less ductile metal than cerium, and
                    appears to melt nearly at the same temperature. It readily oxidizes
                    superficially even in dry air, although it takes fire at a much higher
                    temperature than cerium. Didymium more closely resembles lanthanum than cerium,
                    but has a distinct yellowish colour.</p>
                <p>Only one oxide of lanthanum is known, namely, La <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>; it is white, and unalterable by heat, and
                    combines directly with water, forming the hydroxide La <hi rend="subscript">

                    resembling calcium hydroxide. The lanthanum salts of colourless acids are all
                    colourless.</p>
                <p>Cerium forms the two oxides Ce <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi

                    to the air is converted into yellow ceric oxide, Ce <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. Cerous hydroxide, Ce <hi rend="subscript">

                    obtained on passing chlorine into water in which cerous hydroxide is suspended.
                    Ceric hydroxide dissolves in hydrochloric acid with evolution of chlorine,
                    forming a solution of cerous chloride, Ce <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi

                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, has a pale rose
                    colour; the former is readily soluble in acids, even after ignition, but the
                    latter dissolves with great difficulty. The yttrium salts are colourless; but
                    the salts of erbium have a beautiful rose colour, and their solutions give an
                    absorption spectrum, which is not the case with yttrium salts. When erbium oxide
                    is strongly heated it glows with an intense green light, which in the
                    spectroscope exhibits a continuous spectrum intersected by a number of bright
                    bands corresponding in position to the dark bands in the absorption spectrum of
                    solutions of erbium salts. Didymium oxide behaves similarly, and solutions of
                    didymium salts give an absorption spectrum by which they are readily
                    distinguished from erbium salts.</p>
                <p>The chlorides, nitrates, and sulphates of the cerite and gadolinite metals are
                    readily soluble in water, but their carbonates are insoluble; the solutions of
                    their salts all possess a sweet astringent taste. The most conclusive evidence
                    that lanthanum, cerium, didymium, and yttrium are closely allied to the alkaline
                    earth metals is afforded by thermochemical investigation, the amounts of heat
                    developed on neutralizing their hydroxides being for hydrochloric acid,
                    according to Thomsen’s experiments, inferior only to that developed on
                    neutralizing the hydroxides of the alkali and alkaline earth metals, as shown by
                    the following examples :—</p>

                <p>Metallic thorium has been obtained as a dark-grey powder of the specific gravity
                    7*65 to 7 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 79, easily soluble in nitric acid, but
                    difficultly soluble in hydrochloric acid. Its oxide, Th <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> (if Th = 178’5), is white, and after
                    ignition is insoluble in all acids except concentrated sulphuric acid; it
                    appears to be destitute of acid properties as it does not expel carbon dioxide
                    when fused with alkaline carbonates. Thorium hydroxide is precipitated from
                    solutions of thorium salts by alkalies as a gelatinous mass, soluble in most
                    acids, but insoluble in alkalies. Thorium chloride, Th <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>The foregoing description of the elements and of some of their more important
                    compounds will be sufficient to show that, while each element manifests certain
                    characters which distinguish it from all others, many of the elements are more
                    or less closely related in properties, as indeed we have already frequently had
                    occasion to point out.</p>
                <p>Elements which exhibit similar properties often differ in atomic weight to the
                    same or nearly the same extent <hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >for</hi> example, the difference between the atomic weights of potassium
                    and rubidium is about 46, and of rubidium and caesium 47'5, since K = 39, Rb =
                    85 ’ 2, and Cs=132 ’ 7. As these three elements are closely related in
                    properties, rubidium differing from potassium to about the same extent that
                    caesium differs from rubidium, we are led to suspect a connection between the
                    atomic weight of an element and its properties, especially as with very few
                    exceptions the elements all possess different atomic weights. Many instances of
                    relation between atomic weight and properties, similar in character to that
                    which obtains in the case of potassium, rubidium, and caesium, have been
                    commented on from time to time by various chemists, but the connection between
                    the atomic weights of the elements generally and their properties was not
                    recognized until Mendeljeff in 1869 pointed out that the latter are periodic
                    functions of the former. In other words, if the elements are grouped in the
                    order of their atomic weights, it will be found that nearly the same properties
                    recur periodically throughout the entire series. Hence the whole of the elements
                    may be arranged in a number of groups, each group consisting of members of the
                    same natural family following each other in the same order. The elements are
                    arranged in this manner in the following table, although, in order to retain
                    elements which are undoubtedly members of the same natural family in the same
                    vertical series, a few departures from the order of atomic weights are
                    necessary, but probably they are necessary merely because the atomic weights are
                    incorrectly determined; thus, tellurium is placed before iodine, and osmium,
                    iridium, and platinum before gold. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> the position
                    assigned to uranium be correct, the number at present accepted as its atomic
                    weight is much too low.</p>

                <p>The position of hydrogen at the head of a series of metals is in accordance with
                    Graham’s conclusion that this element possesses the characters of a metal, a
                    conclusion which many chemists are inclined to accept on account of the striking
                    analogies to the metals which it exhibits in its relation to the halogens,
                    oxygen, &amp;c. As the properties of alloys are usually similar to those of
                    their constituent metals, whereas the compounds of metals with non-metallic
                    elements are in most cases widely different from those of the elements which
                    enter into their composition, the fact that Troost and Hautefeuille’s sodium and
                    potassium hydrides(lsodium-hydrogen and potassium-hydrogen alloys) (p. 524)
                    retain the metallic character of sodium and potassium <pb break="no"

                <p>The periodic character of the relation between the properties of the elements and
                    their atomic weights is especially evident in their physical properties, which
                    are more readily compared than the so-called chemical properties, as they admit
                    of measurement, although, on account of our imperfect knowledge, comparison is
                    at present possible only to a very limited extent. One of the few physical
                    properties which has been determined for most of the elements is the specific
                    gravity in the solid state; now, on comparing the specific gravities of the
                    various elements we find that they do not increase progressively with increase
                    of atomic weight, but that they increase and diminish periodically. Hence, as
                    Lothar Meyer has shown, on taking the atomic volumes, or quotients of the atomic
                    weights of the elements divided by their specific gravities in the solid state,
                    as abscissae, and the atomic weights as ordinates, a curve is obtained which
                    exhibits a series of maxima and minima, viz., five maxima and five minima in the
                    portion which includes barium and the elements of lower atomic weight. The most
                    electro-positive elements, lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and caesium
                    form the five maxima; but with increase of atomic weight the height to which the
                    curve rises also rapidly increases, namely, in the proportion</p>
                <p>Li: Na: K: Rb: Cs = 12 :24 :46 :57 :79.</p>
                <p>The remaining physical properties of the elements, so far as they are known to
                    us, appear to be subject to similar periodic variation, but for a full
                    discussion of the connection between the atomic weights of the elements and
                    their properties the reader is referred to L. Meyer’s work, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">modernen Theorien der Chemie</hi> (Breslau).</p>
                <p>The establishment of the periodic law may truly be said to mark an era in
                    chemical science, and we may anticipate that its application and extension will
                    be fraught with the most important consequences. It reminds us how important
                    above all things is the correct determination of the fundamental constants of
                    our science—the atomic weights of the elements, about which in many cases great
                    uncertainty prevails; it is much to be desired that this may not long remain the
                    case. It also affords the strongest encouragement to the chemist to persevere in
                    the search for new elements. (∏, <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi>. <hi

                <p>ORGANIC CHEMISTRY.</p>
                <p>As has been already explained (p. 520) it was at one time thought that certain
                    chemical compounds were producible only through the agency of living things, and
                    the name “organic chemistry” was in consequence conferred upon this branch of
                    the science. The progress of discovery has, however, served to break down the
                    barrier that was supposed to exist between those and purely inorganic compounds,
                    since it has been found possible to build up artificially a very large number of
                    compounds formerly regarded as essentially organic. Nor must it be forgotten
                    that many living things elaborate compounds which can in no sense be regarded as
                    organic—such as the silica of grasses, the carbonate of calcium secreted by
                    molluscs, &amp;c., and the tricalcic phosphate forming the bones of the higher
                    animals.</p>
                <p>Although the number of elements entering into the composition of organic
                    compounds is comparatively small, yet these compounds far exceed inorganic
                    bodies both in number and complexity of composition. It is indeed the vast and
                    ever-increasing numbers of the organic compounds that render it necessary to
                    form a separate branch of the science for their study, and not any real <hi
                        rend="italic">chemical</hi> difference between the matter forming these and
                    mineral compounds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition and Character of Organic Compounds.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">—</hi> Carbon is an invariable constituent of organic bodies,
                    so that this branch of the science is sometimes defined as “the chemistry of the
                    carbon compounds.” The best chemical definition of organic compounds, however,
                    is that proposed by Frankland, viz., “compounds the molecules of which consist
                    of one or more atoms of carbon <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> combined either
                    with carbon, nitrogen, or hydrogen.”</p>
                <p>After carbon, the elements of most frequent occurrence in organic compounds are
                    hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Sulphur, phosphorus, the halogens, silicon,
                    boron, and the metals are of comparatively rare occurrence. The number of atoms
                    entering into the composition of organic molecules is often very great—far
                    exceeding the atoms of the most complex molecule of a mineral substance. Thus,
                    stearin contains 173 atoms, and albumin no less than 226. Chemical bodies that

                <p><hi rend="italic">Ultimate Analysis of Organic Compounds.</hi></p>
                <p>Before the formula of an organic compound can be determined, it is necessary to
                    ascertain the amounts of its several constituents—that is to say, to make a
                    quantitative analysis of it. The elements carbon and hydrogen being of paramount
                    importance are generally first determined. The method employed depends upon the
                    fact that all organic compounds undergo combustion when heated with easily
                    reducible oxidizing substances, their carbon being oxidized to carbon dioxide
                    and their hydrogen to water. These two products of combustion being collected in
                    suitable apparatus and weighed, the necessary data for calculating the amounts
                    of carbon and hydrogen are obtained. The following is a brief description of the
                    process.</p>

                    diameter, after being scrupulously cleaned and dried, is <pb break="no"

                    leave a tailed extremity of the form shown in figure 1. The open end of the tube
                    is then held in the flame of the blowpipe till the sharp edge of the glass is
                    rounded off. This tube, known as the <hi rend="italic">combustion tube,</hi> is
                    from 500 to 800 millimetres in length, according as the substance contains
                    little or much carbon.</p>
                <p>The substance generally employed to effect the combustion of carbon compounds is
                    cupric oxide (CuO), and as this oxide is of a somewhat hygroscopic nature, it is
                    necessary to dry it thoroughly before use, and then exclude it carefully from
                    the air. Should these precautions not be observed, the oxide absorbs water from
                    the air, and when heated in the combustion tube this water distils over and is
                    weighed with that produced by the combustion of the substance. It is therefore
                    found convenient in practice to have anothér glass tube sealed at one end and
                    closely corked at the other for the reception of the cupric oxide. This tube is
                    of sufficient capacity to contain enough cupric oxide to fill the combustion
                    tube, and its diameter is such as to allow it to be introduced into the open end
                    of the combustion tube.</p>
                <p>The substance for analysis, after being finely powdered, is dried in a water oven
                    at 100° C. till it ceases to lose weight, or, if decomposed by heat, in a vacuum
                    over some waterabsorbing substance, such as strong sulphuric acid or calcium
                    chloride. When dry it is transferred to a small stoppered bottle or corked tube,
                    sealed at one end, and of about 40 or 50 millimetres in length.</p>
                <p>The apparatus for absorbing the carbon dioxide is a series of light glass bulbs
                    (figs. 2 and 3) containing a solution of caustic potash (KHO) of sp. gr. 1∙27,
                    through which the gases evolved during the combustion are obliged to pass. It is
                    customary to attach to one end of the potash bulbs a small glass tube drawn to a
                    point at its free end, and containing a small piece of solid potash enclosed
                    between plugs of cotton wool. This appendage is for the purpose of retaining any
                    trace of carbon dioxide or moisture carried over from the bulbs by the escaping
                    gases.</p>
                <p>The water formed by the combustion is collected in a tube (fig. 4) filled with
                    fragments <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> 'of dried calcium chloride or pumice
                    stone wetted with strong sulphuric acid,</p>
                <p>The combustion tube when charged is heated in a furnace which consists
                    essentially of a row of gas burners constructed so as to burn a mixture of coal
                    gas and air, and thus obtain a non-luminous but very hot flame. Two forms of
                    furnace are in common use in laboratories. In Hofmann’s furnace a clay cylinder
                    perforated by a large number of very fine holes is fitted over the end of each
                    gas burner, thus dividing the escaping gas into a number of fine streams, and so
                    ensuring its perfect combustion. In Griffin’s furnace the burners are
                    constructed on Bunsen’s principle, that is, each burner is perforated by holes
                    at its lower end so that a mixture of gas and air escapes from its upper
                    extremity. The combustion tube is supported on a thin iron trough lined with
                    asbestos, the whole being enclosed by unglazed tiles.</p>
                <p>The cupric oxide intended for use is first heated to redness in a crucible, and
                    transferred while still hot to its tube, wherein it is allowed to cool. When
                    sufficiently cool the cork is withdrawn, and enough cupric oxide poured into the
                    combustion tube to occupy about ½th of its length. The tube or bottle containing
                    the dried pulverized substance having been weighed, about half a gramme is then
                    introduced into the combustion tube, and a small quantity of cupric oxide is
                    poured down after it. The bottle being again weighed gives the exact weight of
                    the substance employed. The substance in the combustion tube is thoroughly mixed
                    with cupric oxide by stirring it about with a long wire with corkscrew
                    point.</p>
                <p>More cupric oxide is now added till the tube is filled nearly to its open end,
                    and a plug of freshly ignited asbestos is finally introduced. The tube is then
                    gently tapped while in a horizontal position so as to cause a slight subsidence
                    of the contents, thus allowing a free passage for gas throughout its whole
                    length. The calcium chloride tube is fitted into the open end of the combustion
                    tube by means of a tightly fitting cork or caoutchouc stopper, and the potash
                    apparatus is attached to the calcium chloride tube by means of a short piece of
                    caoutchouc tubing bound tightly round with thin copper wire. Both the potash
                    bulbs and calcium chloride tube are carefully weighed before being attached. The
                    whole apparatus as arranged for the combustion is shown in fig. 5 :—</p>
                <p>The front part of the tube is first heated to redness, and the gas burners are
                    then gradually turned on so as to cause the slow combustion of the substance.
                    When no more bubbles pass into the potash solution the gas burners are turned
                    out, the point of the tail of the combustion tube is broken off, and dry air
                    passed through the whole system t© sweep out the last traces of carbon dioxide
                    and water vapour lingering in the tube. In cases where great accuracy is
                    required it is desirable to sweep out the combustion tube first with a current
                    of pure oxygen and then with air. This ensures the complete oxidation of any
                    trace of carbon that may have escaped the first combustion.</p>
                <p>When the operation is completed the potash bulbs and calcium chloride tube are
                    allowed to cool down to the atmospheric temperature and then again weighed. The
                    increase in weight gives the respective amounts of carbon dioxide and water
                    produced. Since carbon dioxide contains in 11 parts by weight 3 of carbon (CO
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 12 + 2×16 = 44), ⅛ of the weight of the CO
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> obtained is due to carbon. Similarly ½ of the
                    weight of the water found is due to hydrogen (H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O =
                    2x1 + 16 = 18). It is customary to express the results in parts per cent. In
                    practice the hydrogen usually comes out a little too high, and the carbon a
                    little too low.</p>
                <p>Cupric oxide is sometimes replaced by lead chromate in cases where the substance
                    is difficultly combustible, and more particularly when the compound contains
                    chlorine, bromine, or sulphur. In these latter cases were cupric oxide employed,
                    cupric chloride or bromide would be formed, and might volatilize over into the
                    calcium chloride tube, thus unduly increasing its weight. Sulphur in <pb

                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and this gas if allowed to pass into the
                    potash bulbs would be absorbed. These sources of error are avoided by the
                    employment of lead chromate, because non-volatile lead chloride or bromide are
                    formed, and sulphur is oxidized to SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, which is
                    fixed as PbSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. When substances rich in nitrogen are
                    burnt with cupric oxide, nitrogen dioxide is likely to be formed, and this on
                    meeting the air and potash in the bulbs is absorbed, and increases the weight of
                    the CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> apparatus. To obviate this source of error
                    it is necessary when dealing with nitrogenous bodies to plug the end of the
                    combustion tube with a roll of freshly reduced copper gauze. This being kept at
                    a bright red heat during the entire operation decomposes the oxides of nitrogen,
                    and retaining the oxygen, allows only nitrogen to escape. <hi rend="superscript"

                <p>When the substance to be analyzed is a liquid, a known weight is sealed up in a
                    small glass bulb (fig. 6).</p>
                <p>After sealing and weighing (the weight of the empty bulb having been previously
                    determined) the neck of the bulb is broken off, and the broken portion, together
                    with the bulb itself, introduced into the combustion tube, which is afterwards
                    filled up with cupric oxide, &lt;fcc., in the usual manner. In burning liquids
                    the anterior portion of the combustion tube is, as with solids, first heated to
                    redness; the portion containing the bulb is then gradually warmed so as to expel
                    the liquid, which is thus made to distil slowly over the red-hot cupric oxide
                    which effects its combustion.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Determination of Nitrogen.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Two
                    methods are in use for determining this element. Will and Varrentrapp’s method
                    depends upon the fact that many nitrogenous bodies when heated with caustic
                    alkalies yield their nitrogen in the form of ammonia. A known weight of the
                    substance is intimately mixed with soda-lime, <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> and
                    then heated in a combustion tube, the ammonia being absorbed by dilute
                    hydrochloric acid contained in a glass apparatus attached to the end of the
                    tube. (See fig. 7.)</p>
                <p>In conducting an operation of this kind some soda-lime is first introduced into
                    the tube; the substance is then mixed intimately with more sodalime in a mortar,
                    and the mixture transferred to the tube; the mortar is next rinsed out with more
                    soda-lime, and the rinsings are added to the contents of the tube, which is
                    finally filled up with pure soda-lime. When charged the tube is tapped so as to
                    secure a free passage for the escaping gas</p>
                <p>(as in the combustion for the determination of C and H), and after it is laid in
                    the trough of the gas furnace, the acid bulb is attached to it by means of a
                    tightly fitting cork. The combustion is performed in precisely the same manner
                    as in the process of burning with cupric oxide; when it is completed the tail of
                    the tube is broken off, and air drawn through the apparatus so as to draw the
                    last traces of ammonia into the acid. If the substance contains much nitrogen it
                    is advisable to mix it with some compound which gives off a large quantity of
                    gas when heated in the tube. Sugar or starch are convenient substances for this
                    purpose. This dilution of the ammonia prevents its too rapid absorption by the
                    acid, and thus diminishes the risk of acid being drawn back into the hot
                    tube.</p>
                <p>Having by the above process obtained the nitrogen in the form of ammonium
                    chloride, its quantity is determined by precipitation as ammonio-platinic
                    chloride, (NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> PtCl
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, the analysis being performed in the same
                    manner as in the quantitative determination of ammonium by means of platinic
                    chloride. In calculating the results the requisite data are furnished by the
                    facts that 223 ’ 2 parts of the double salt contain 14 of nitrogen, or 197'5
                    parts of platinum correspond to 28 of nitrogen. Thus, if <hi rend="italic"

                    the weight of platinum, and N the weight . . . W×14 P×28 . 100N , of nitrogen,
                    we have N = <hi rend="subscript"> oo</hi>., or <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>----;

                <p>Instead of determining the ammonia gravimetrically it may be absorbed by a known
                    quantity of dilute sulphuric acid of standard strength, and the amount of acid
                    neutralized determined by adding litmus, and then a standard solution of soda
                    till complete neutralization is effected as in ordinary acidimetrical
                    determinations.</p>
                <p>In cases where nitrogen-containing bodies do not yield the whole of that element
                    as ammonia on ignition with soda-lime, Dumas’s process is employed. This process
                    depends upon the fact that all nitrogenous substances yield their nitrogen in
                    the free state when burnt with cupric oxide, and in presence of ignited metallic
                    copper. The method is thus carried out.</p>
                <p>A combustion tube of suitable length is sealed off at one end, and about 2 or 3
                    inches of hydrogen sodium carbonate (NaHCO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>)
                    introduced, after which a small quantity of cupric oxide is added. A known
                    quantity of the substance, intimately mixed with cupric oxide, is next
                    introduced, and then a further quantity of pure cupric oxide, the remainder of
                    the tube being finally filled up with 3 or 4 inches of freshly reduced copper
                    gauze plugging. No special precautions need be taken to keep the cupric oxide
                    dry. A gas passage having been secured through the tube in the usual manner, a
                    delivery tube is tightly adapted to the open end of the combustion tube.</p>
                <p>The tube is placed in a gas furnace, and the end of the delivery tube plunged
                    beneath the surface of mercury contained in a mercurial trough. The first
                    proceeding is to expel the air from the apparatus. This is effected by heating a
                    portion of the hydrogen sodium carbonate in the posterior part of the combustion
                    tube till a bubble of the gas received into caustic potash solution is wholly
                    absorbed. When the apparatus is entirely filled with carbon dioxide, a graduated
                    receiver containing about ½ of its volume of caustic potash solution, the
                    remainder being filled with mercury, is inverted over the end of the delivery
                    tube as in ordinary cases of gas-receiving over the mercurial trough. The
                    combustion is then proceeded with in the usual manner,—the anterior portion of
                    the tube containing the metallic copper being first heated to redness, and the
                    heat gradually carried back till the combustion is completed, when more of the
                    NaHCO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> in the posterior part is heated <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Although the principles upon which the
                    determination of carbon and hydrogen in organic bodies depends remain unaltered,
                    the process has received several modifications which it is unnecessary to
                    describe in detail. Thus in some laboratories, instead of the potash bulbs, a
                    tube filled with “soda-lime” is employed, and the substance, instead of being
                    mixed with the CuO in the tube, is placed in a small boat of porcelain or
                    platinum, and a slow stream of oxygen kept going during the whole process. Other
                    oxidizers have been also proposed instead of cupric oxide, such as potassium
                    perchlorate or a mixture of sulphuric acid and silver iodate, in which latter
                    process the carbon is determined directly from the amount of CO <hi

                <p>This imaginary example may serve to show that the determination of empirical
                    formulae cannot be made according to any fixed set of rules. The errors of
                    experiment are seldom so small as in the supposed illustration, and in cases
                    where these are large, and where the substance contains a large number of atoms
                    in its molecule, great difficulty is often experienced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Molecular Formulae.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The formulae
                    obtained by the method just described express simply the <hi rend="italic"
                        >ratios</hi> existing between the numbers of atoms in the molecule of a
                    substance, without regard to the <hi rend="italic">actual number</hi> of atoms
                    in such a molecule. Reasoning downwards from the law of Avogadro, which has been
                    explained in the foregoing portions of this article, it will be seen that the
                    volume of such molecules as do not undergo dissociation when heated is always
                    equal to the volume of the molecule (2 parts by weight) of hydrogen. To
                    ascertain molecular formula, therefore, all that is necessary is to determine
                    the vapourdensity of the substance as referred to hydrogen. Thus the analysis of
                    benzene, a hydrocarbon obtained from coal tar, leads to the formula CH, but
                    there is no evidence to show whether its molecular formula is CH, C <hi

                    39, so that its molecular weight is 78. Dividing this number in the ratio C: H,
                        <hi rend="italic">is.,</hi> 12:1, we obtain 72: 6 as the actual ratio of the
                    weights of C and H existing in the molecule. Seventy-two parts of C correspond
                    to ½½ = 6 atoms, and 6 parts by weight of hydrogen correspond to ⅜ = 6 atoms, so
                    that the molecular formula of benzene is C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 6</hi>.</p>
                <p>Again, with respect to alcohol. The vapour-density (H = 1) is 23, so that its
                    molecular weight is 46. This number, however, agrees with the molecular weight
                    of a substance having the formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 6</hi> O, since 12 × 2 + 6 +16 = 46; hence this formula
                    must be assigned to alcohol, and we have an illustration of a case in which the
                    empirical and molecular formulae are identical.</p>

                <p>In practice, the vapour-density is determined by the methods of Dumas or

                    the weight of a known volume of vapour is ascertained in the following manner

                <p>A globular glass flask, as light as possible, with a neck fused into it, is first
                    provided. The capacity of the globe may vaιy from ⅛ to ⅜ litre, according to the
                    amount of substance to be operated upon. The neck is drawn out in the blowpipe
                    flame to a capillary termination of about one millimetre diameter, and then bent
                    up so as to project above the surface of the liquid of the bath in which the
                    globe is to be immersed. The globe is first weighed full of air—the temperature
                    and height of the barometer being noted.</p>
                <p>By warming the globe, and plunging the point of the neck into some of the liquid
                    of which the vapour-density is to be determined, a few grammes of the latter are
                    introduced. The globe and its contents are then plunged into a bath of water,
                    paraffin, or fusible metal kept at a constant temperature, at least 20° or 30° C
                    above the boiling-point of the substance. As soon as the vapour ceases to rush
                    out of the capillary orifice of the neck, the point is sealed hermetically by
                    the blowpipe flame, the height of the barometer and the temperature of the bath
                    being observed.</p>

                <p>The globe, after being cleaned and allowed to cool, is again weighed, the
                    temperature and height of the barometer being at the same time observed. The
                    capacity of the globe is measured by breaking the point of the neck under
                    mercury, when the metal rushes in to supply the place of the condensed vapour.
                    As the expulsion of air by the escaping vapour is seldom complete, there usually
                    remains a bubble of residual air, which must be allowed for by running in a
                    known quantity of mercury from a burette. The total quantity of mercury is then
                    poured out and its volume measured. The calculation is made from these data by

                <p>For high temperatures the globe is immersed in the vapours of boiling mercury,

                <p>The substance of which the vapourdensity is to be determined is weighed (about ⅛
                    gram.) in a minute stoppered bottle, and passed up into the Torricellian vacuum.
                    According to the boiling-point of the substance (which is, of course, much
                    lowered by the reduced pressure), the vapour of alcohol, water, aniline, or
                    amylic alcohol is passed through the space between the two tubes till the
                    temperature and volume of vapour remain constant. The height of the mercury
                    column, the temperature to which the vapour is heated, and the height of the
                    barometer in the room being observed, all the necessary data are obtained.</p>

                <p>For exact determinations at high temperatures the tension of mer∙ cury vapour (e)
                    at the temperature (t) must be allowed for, and the pressure upon the vapour

                <p>In some cases the substance of which the molecular formula is to be determined
                    does not admit of vaporization, being decomposed by heat. With such substances,
                    some method other than the determination of the vapour-density must consequently
                    be resorted to. In the case of acid or basic compounds, the problem admits of
                    easy solution. Thus, supposing we desired to determine the molecular weight of
                    acetic acid without having recourse to a vapourdensity determination. Having
                    ascertained that the acid contains one atom of hydrogen replaceable by metals,
                    or, in other words, that it is monobasic, the silver salt is prepared, and the
                    amount of silver determined. All the necessary data are then obtained. Thus,
                    supposing the analysis to give 64√67 per cent, of metal, the molecular weight of
                    the salt, t.e., the weight containing one atom of silver, will be given by the
                    proportion—</p>
                <p>6467: 100 :: 108 <hi rend="italic">.x.</hi></p>
                <p>Whence , <hi rend="italic">x =</hi> 167 .</p>
                <p>The weight of the “acid-radicle” is therefore 167-108 = 59.</p>
                <p>And as one atom of H is replaced by the Ag, the molecular weight of the acid is
                    60.</p>
                <p>The empirical formula deduced from the ultimate analysis would be CH <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = 30, so that the molecular formula is 2(CH <hi

                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ∙</p>
                <p>With poly basic acids the problem is somewhat more complex, but the solution is
                    effected in a similar manner, í.e., by estimating the metal in a normal salt.
                    Silver salts are employed when obtainable, as they are generally anhydrous and
                    easily purified by crystallization.</p>
                <p>As a further illustration we now give an example of the determination of the
                    molecular weight of a basic substance. Supposing an analysis of the base

                    molecular formula can only be indirectly arrived at by considering the chemical
                    transformations of the compound and its relationship to known substances. A
                    molecular formula obtained by this means implies that, could the substance be

                        rend="italic">—</hi> The molecular formula of an organic compound simply
                    expresses the fact that the molecule of such compound contains so many atoms of
                    each of its constituent elements, and in the earlier stages of the science
                    chemists were contented with such representation of their analytical results. As
                    the science developed, however, it soon became evident that substances might
                    have the same percentage composition, or even the same molecular formula, and
                    yet exhibit under the influence of the same reagents totally distinct
                    characters. These facts, which will be more fully discussed in a subsequent part
                    of this article, led to the necessity of devising some method by which organic
                    formulae could be made to represent the behaviour of the respective compounds
                    under the influence of decomposing agents—in other words, the manner in which
                    the compound was capable of splitting up or of being resolved, and, as a
                    necessary result, the converse fact of representing the manner in which the
                    elements of a compound were grouped together. These <hi rend="italic">rational,
                        constitutional,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">structural</hi> formulae must be
                    regarded solely from a chemical point of view; they are symbolic representations
                    of chemical facts, and in no way represent the physical grouping of the atoms in
                    space. They may be most conveniently defined as artificial epitomes of the
                    reactions of compounds, indicating that when decomposed the compounds separate
                    into such and such groups, and that when it is possible to bring these groups or
                    radicles together, the compound can in most cases be built up or
                    synthesized.</p>
                <p>Let us now, by way of illustration, proceed to consider the method of arriving at
                    the constitutional formula of some typical compound.</p>
                <p>The molecular formula of acetic acid, as previously shown by its ultimate
                    analysis and the determination of silver in its silver salt, is—</p>
                <p>C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Being a monobasic acid, one of its hydrogen atoms is replaceable by metals. This
                    fact is expressed, as in the case of inorganic acids, by the formula—</p>
                <p>H.C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>But this formula does not express the whole of the decompositions possible to the
                    acid; the residue C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> being capable of further subdivision, the formula
                    may be further developed. Thus, acetic acid may be formed by the action of
                    acetyl chloride upon water, according to the reaction—</p>
                <p>C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O.C1 + OH <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ∙H + HC1.</p>
                <p>Thus the radicle <hi rend="italic">acetyl</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O is shown to enter into the composition of
                    acetic acid, and the formula therefore becomes—</p>
                <p>H.O.C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O.</p>
                <p>In confirmation of this formula several reactions might be mentioned in which the
                    acetyl group is left unchanged, while the hydroxyl, HO, is withdrawn and
                    replaced by other elements or radicles. For example—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Isomerism.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> It has been mentioned
                    that organic substances may have the same percentage composition and molecular
                    formula, and yet exhibit totally distinct chemical and physical characters. To
                    this phenomenon the general term <hi rend="italic">isomerism</hi> is applied,
                    and the compounds are termed <hi rend="italic">isomerides,</hi> or are said to
                    be <hi rend="italic">isomeric.</hi> The differences between isomeric bodies are
                    well explained on the view that such bodies possess different constitutions, or
                    that their elements are grouped in different ways. Constitutional formulae are
                    thus absolutely indispensable for the representation of isomerides. As will be
                    seen subsequently, there can be several kinds of isomerism, but we shall here
                    restrict the term to two classes of cases.</p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="italic">Isomerism proper</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Physical
                        Isomerism.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In these cases the substances are
                    identical in their composition, vapour-density, and chemical behaviour, but
                    exhibit different physical properties. Thus there are several hydrocarbons known
                    as <hi rend="italic">terpenes,</hi> having the formula C <hi rend="subscript">
                        10</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 16</hi>, which exist in the oils of
                    turpentine, lemon, bergamot, orange, &amp;c., and which exhibit the same
                    behaviour under the influence of chemical reagents, differing only in their
                    odour and action upon polarized light. Again, the empirical formula C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 6</hi> includes several organic acids (tartaric acid being
                    one of the number) which are physical isomerides differing from one another only
                    in their crystalline form and action upon polarized light.</p>
                <p>(2.) <hi rend="italic">Chemical Isomerism.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In these
                    cases the compounds are identical in composition and in their molecular
                    formulae, but differ in physical properties and chemical behaviour in certain
                    reactions.</p>
                <p>For instance, by taking one atom of hydrogen from the hydrocarbon propane (C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>) we obtain the
                    radicle propyl (C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi>),
                    and if we suppose one atom of hydrogen in marsh gas or methane (CH <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) to be replaced by propyl, we get the hydrocarbon
                    tetrane or diethyl—</p>
                <p>∕H (C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> c⅛ <hi
                        rend="superscript"> c</hi>-⅛</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">(h (h</hi></p>
                <p>Methane. Tetranβ.</p>
                <p>Now propyl can be written in two different ways, according as the elements are
                    grouped differently; thus—</p>
                <p>(CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> CH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CH <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) ’, or</p>
                <p>(CHCH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>)'.</p>
                <p>The differences are still more strikingly shown by the use of graphic
                    formulae—</p>

                <p>Distinguishing these radicles from each other by the names propyl and
                    pseudopropyl, it is clear that we can have a tetrane containing propyl and
                    another containing pseudopropyl—</p>

                <p>The graphic formulae help to show still more clearly that the elements can be
                    grouped only in two different ways—</p>

                <p>The fact thus shown possible by formulation is borne out experimentally. Two
                    tetranes actually exist,—one, which from its mode of formation can be shown to
                    be propyi-methane or diethyl, having a boiling point of Γ C., the other, which
                    can be shown to be pseudopropyl-methane, boiling at - 15° C.</p>
                <p>The experimental confirmation does not, however, end here. The same isomerism can
                    be shown to exist among all the derivatives of these two propyls. Thus we

                <p>This list might be considerably extended, but sufficient examples have been given
                    to illustrate the phenomena under consideration.</p>
                <p>Not only do these isomerides differ in physical properties, but they exhibit
                    different and characteristic transformations under the action of the same
                    reagent. Thus, normal propyl alcohol when oxidized yields propionic acid :—</p>

                <p>Under the same circumstances pseudopropyl alcohol yields the substance known as
                    acetone or dimethyl ketone :—</p>

                <p>Pseudopropyl alcohol. Acetone. Water.</p>
                <p>The distinguishing character of this class of isomers is that the isomerides can
                    be shown to belong to the same series of compounds, or, according to
                    Schorlemmer, “they contain the same number of carbon atoms linked together.”</p>
                <p>Reactions that give rise to the formation of a compound capable of existing in
                    two isomeric modifications frequently result in the production of both isomers,
                    but the precise conditions which regulate the relative quantities of the two
                    compounds are not yet known.</p>
                <p>Certain relationships have been shown to exist between the physical and chemical
                    properties of isomeric bodies, although numerous exceptions render the exact
                    expression of these relationships an impossibility in the present state of
                    knowledge. Thus, as a rule, the boiling points of the compounds of an isomeric
                    series are lower than those of the normal series (see preceding table)—or, more
                    generally, the boiling point is higher the more simple the constitution of the
                    substance.</p>
                <p>Since different amounts of heat are concerned in the production of isomeric
                    bodies, it must be admitted that such bodies are stored with different amounts
                    of potential energy. Adopting this view, some chemists have recently sought an
                    explanation of isomerism in the different amounts of potential energy thus
                    contained in isomerides, and have thrown distrust upon the “constitutional”
                    theory. In taking this view, however, the true position seems reversed —the fact
                    that isomerides contain different stores of potential energy by no means does
                    away with the hypothesis that they possess different constitutions. It seems, on
                    the contrary, that the difference of energy is accounted for on the view that
                    the bodies possess a difference of constitution, since the contained energy
                    results from the relative positions of the atoms or radicles with regard to the
                    intra-molecular chemical forces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metamerism.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Compounds having the
                    same molecular formula may result from the combination of totally distinct
                    radicles, and exhibit in consequence not only a marked difference of physical
                    properties, but in almost all cases different chemical transformations under the
                    influence of the same reagent. Such substances are said to be <hi rend="italic"

                    is to be observed that, as with true isomeric compounds, two metameric bodies
                    are frequently produced in the same reaction. For instance, most of the methods
                    given for obtaining ethyl cyanide yield a mixture of this compound with the
                    isocyanide.</p>

                    seldom great. In the carbon atom we meet with the greatest tendency to unite

                    in the free state. From this and previous considerations it follows, that “all
                    hydrocarbons contain an even number of atoms of hydrogen,” and further, “that
                    the sum of the atoms of monad and triad elements contained in the molecule of a

                    order to assist in bringing the vast numbers of organic compounds within the
                    scope of some system of classification, chemists frequently adopt the convenient
                    division of them into fatty and aromatic groups.</p>
                <p>It will be seen subsequently that most organic compounds may be regarded as
                    derived by substitution from hydrocarbons. <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>

                        rend="smallcaps">H</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 2b-4</hi> series,
                    with their derivatives, constitute the fatty group, so called because many of
                    its members exist in fatty bodies. The hydrocarbons of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >C.H</hi><hi rend="subscript                     smallcaps"> 2b</hi><hi
                        rend="smallcaps">„</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 6</hi>, &amp;c.,
                    series, with their derivatives, are termed the aromatic group, because many of
                    the compounds are obtained from balsams, essential oils, gumresins, and other
                    aromatic substances. The chief characteristic of the aromatic group is the
                    comparative stability of its compounds, for, whereas the artiad (t.e., even)
                    radicles of the fatty group act as unsaturated groups entering freely into
                    direct combination with other elements, the aromatic radicles act more like
                    saturated groups entering into direct combination only with difficulty, and
                    forming substitution compounds with comparative ease.</p>
                <p>The division here made between fatty and aromatic substances must not be regarded
                    as one having a sharply defined boundary line. In point of fact, the two series
                    merge into one another, and compounds belonging to one group can be transformed
                    into compounds of the other. Thus benzene, the typical hydrocarbon of the
                    aromatic group, can be formed directly from ethine or acetylene, a hydrocarbon

                <p>The fourteen families now enumerated, although comprising most of the known
                    organic substances, still leave outstanding a large number of compounds, of
                    which the constitution has not yet been determined, and which consequently
                    cannot be referred to any of the above groups. We propose to consider briefly
                    the individual families in succession, describing the mode of preparation and
                    properties of the most important members of each family, and then proceeding to

                    substances, and which forms as it wère a connecting link between these and

                    Cy <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is generally prepared by heating the cyanide of
                    some heavy metal (usually mercury): HgCy <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = Hg + Cy
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. A brown substance, most probably a polymeride
                    of cyanogen, known as <hi rend="italic">paroeyanogen,</hi> is always formed in
                    this reaction.</p>
                <p>Cyanogen is a colourless gas, having a pungent odour resembling that of bitter
                    almond oil. It burns in air with a purple flame, and is extremely poisonous. The
                    gas is condensable into a liquid under a pressure of about 4 atmospheres. The
                    liquid boils at - 21° C., and solidifies at - 34° C. Water absorbs about 4
                    volumes of the gas in the cold. The aqueous solution decomposes on standing,
                    ammonium oxalate being the chief product of the reaction: C <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 2</hi> N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 4OH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> =

                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. At the same time
                    small quantities of urea, ammonium carbonate, and cyanide are formed. The
                    addition of a mineral acid to the solution greatly retards the decomposition,
                    oxamide being then produced: C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> N <hi

                    HCy.—This compound is formed synthetically by passing electric sparks through a
                    mixture of nitrogen and ethine gases: C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2HCN^. In
                    practice benzene vapour may be used instead of pure ethine, as it is partially
                    resolved into the latter substance by the action of the spark. The anhydrous
                    acid is also obtained by passing dry hydrogen sulphide over mercuric cyanide.
                    The aqueous solution of the acid is prepared by the action of acids upon
                    metallic cyanides: HC1 + KCN = KC1 + HCN; by the action of ammonia on
                    chloroform: NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + CHCl <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    = HCN + 3HC1; and also (most conveniently) by heating a mixture of 5 parts of
                    potassium ferrocyanide with 3 parts of sulphuric acid and 4 parts of water.</p>
                <p>The pure acid is a colourless liquid, having an odour of bitter almonds; it is a
                    most violent poison. Its boiling-point is 26 <hi rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 5
                    C. and its point of solidification - 15° C. The pure acid and its strong aqueous
                    solution are both inflam ’ mable, burning in air with a violet flame. Both thé
                    anhy drous and aqueous acids are very unstable, the formel decomposing into
                    ammonia and a brown substance, and the latter undergoing the same decomposition
                    with the additional formation of ammonium formate. Small quantities of formic or
                    of a mineral acid prevent this décomposition, but on mixture with strong acids,
                    a complete decomposition into formic acid ensues :—</p>

                    Of these the most important is potassium cyanide, which can be formed by passing

                <p>This salt is also produced by heating potassium ferrocyanide either alone or
                    mixed with potassium carbonate. Most of the metallic cyanides can be prepared by
                    the action of hydrocyanic acid upon the oxides and hydroxides of the metals, or
                    by double decomposition.</p>
                <p>The cyanides have a remarkable tendency to form double salts, such, for example,
                    as the double cyanide of potassium and silver, KCy,AgCy.</p>
                <p>Of these double cyanides a certain number are decomposed by the action of a

                <p>Other double cyanides do not decompose in this manner by the action of mineral
                    acids; the heavy metal cannot be detected by its ordinary reagents, and no HCy
                    is evolved. Thus the double cyanide of potassium and iron, 4KCy,FeCy <hi

                <p>The action of water upon nitriles thus gives rise to the formation of an acid

                    unchanged, we may consider that in these reactions cyanogen (CN) is converted

                <p>It has been further stated that both the nitriles and organic acids can be
                    formulated as hydrocarbon derivatives —in the former the H of the radicle being
                    replaced by (CN)', and in the latter by (COOH)'. Starting then with the cyanide
                    of a hydrocarbon radicle, we get by the action of water an acid containing one
                    atom of carbon more than the hydrocarbon from which the acid is derived, and in
                    this manner acids can be built up from their parent hydrocarbons, and the number
                    of their contained semimolecules of carboxyl increased; thus—</p>

                    decomposition of organic matter excluded from the air, and is thus produced at
                    the bottom of stagnant ponds, marshes, &amp;c. This gas is the “firedamp” of
                    coal mines; it is found in volcanic gases, and the gas issuing from a mud
                    volcano in the Crimea is almost pure methane. The normal paraffins are found in
                    coal formations and other bituminous strata. Thus, American petroleum contains a
                    mixture of all the paraffins from marsh gas to pentadecane (C <hi

                    members. In boring for rock oil large quantities of methane escape, and from the
                    freshly drawn petroleum ethane and propane are given off as gases at the
                    ordinary temperature of the air. On distilling off the liquid portion (known
                    commercially as “paraffin oil ”) the higher members of the series remain as
                    white crystalline solids. Many paraffins occur also in the oil obtained by the
                    destructive distillation of Boghead and cannel coal. Solid paraffins are
                    likewise formed in the destructive distillation of wood, coal, bituminous shale,
                    &amp;c., and are found native, as <hi rend="italic">fossil wax, ozokerite,

                <p>The number of possible methods of representing a paraffin thus greatly increases
                    with the complexity of the molecule, but it must not be inferred from these
                    formulae that the radicles represented as composing a paraffin molecule have a
                    separate existence in the compound. Such formulation expresses simply the

                <p>Thus it must not be supposed that, because ethane may be written as dimethyl,
                    ethane contains methyl. On treating ethane with chlorine, for example, we do not

                <p>Turning to the graphic formulae made use of in illustrating the formation of

                <p>Thus, with the increase of the number of atoms in the molecule we have an
                    increased number of hydrocarbon radicles coalescing to form the paraffin; in
                    other words, we have increased complexity of structure, and thus the possible
                    modes of arrangement, or the possible number of isomerides (see p. 550), becomes
                    greater as the number of atoms becomes greater. The three first members, as will
                    be seen from the above formulae, can only be written in the manner shown, and no
                    isomerides exist. The fourth member, butane or tetrane, as already shown, when
                    treating of isomerism (p. 550), can be written in two ways, and two isomerides
                    are known. Similarly there can be three pentanes, four hexanes, six heptanes,
                    &amp;c.</p>

                <p>With regard to the general properties of a paraffin, as compared with those of
                    its isomerides, it has been observed that the boiling-points and specific
                    gravities of the normal compounds are higher than those of the isomers. With
                    respect to chemical stability, the normal paraffins are more difficultly

                <p>Ethine or acetylene may be formed directly from its elements by causing the
                    electric arc to pass between poles of dense carbon in an atmosphere of hydrogen.

                    incondensable gas, having a characteristic odour. It is absorbed by an
                    ammoniacal solution of cuprous chloride, forming a red precipitate of cuprous

                <p>The synthesis of benzene from ethine has already been alluded to (p. 552). In
                    accordance with this mode of formation, the structural formula of benzene may be
                    written—</p>

                <p>This formula, as will be seen on inspection, is in accordance with the fact that
                    benzene can act as a hexatomic radicle, combining directly (though with
                    difficulty) with 6 halogen atoms. Owing to the complex structure of the benzene
                    molecule, an immense number of isomers are capable of existing. A few of the
                    most important cases may be here elucidated.</p>
                <p>Let us, in the first instance, suppose one atom of H to be replaced by another
                    element or radicle. Supposing (as there is at present no reason for doubting)
                    that all the H and C atoms in the molecule have the same property, it is obvious
                    that there can be no isomer of a mono-substitution derivative, and thus we know
                    only one methyl benzene, chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Passing on to the poly-substitution derivatives, we have several possible causes
                    of isomerism. Thus, the H atom may be replaced by one radicle, or more than one
                    H atom may be replaced by an equivalent number of radicles, furnishing the same
                    total number of C and H atoms. For instance—</p>

                <p>Dimethyl-benzone Is metameric with Ethyl-benzene.</p>
                <p>Similarly diethyl-benzene is isomeric with tetramethylbenzene, &amp;c., &amp;c.
                    Another cause of isomerism is to be found in the C <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi>
                    H <hi rend="subscript"> 2n+1</hi> or other radicles replacing the H in the
                    benzene molecule, since these radicals themselves admit of isomeric
                    modifications, as has already been seen when the paraffin series were discussed.
                    Thus, we may have—</p>

                    which of the six H atoms is replaced. Di-derivatives containing two atoms oi the
                    same element or radicle are capable of three isomeric modifications, according
                    as the replaced atoms are those numbered in the graphic formula 1 2 or 1 3 or 1
                    4. All other arrangements will be found on trial to be reducible to these (X

                <p>In like manner there can be three tri-or tetra-derivatives, and only one penta-or
                    hexa-derivative, when the H atoms are replaced by the same element or
                    radicle.</p>
                <p>When the H atoms are replaced by three or more different elements or radicles the
                    possible number of isomerides is greater than when replaced by the same number
                    of similar elements or radicles, because the arrangements of the latter with
                    regard to one another are then capable of variation. Thus, there can be only
                    three di-derivatives containing two different elements or radicles XY, because
                    the reversal of their order does not affect the relative positions of X to Y.
                    But when three H atoms are replaced by XXY elements or radicles we may have, for
                    every isomeride depending on the relative position of XXY to one another and to
                    the remaining H atoms, corresponding isomerides depending on the order XYX. The
                    same reasoning applies to the higher derivatives.</p>

                    considered as derivatives of hydrocarbons by the substitution of hydroxyl for
                    hydrogen, and, consequently, as compounds of hydroxyl with hydrocarbon radicles
                    (p. 553). Each series of hydrocarbons can thus be supposed to give rise to a
                    corresponding series of alcohols :—</p>

                    the present series of alcohols as derivatives of paraffins, it follows that
                    these alcohols can be likewise regarded as methane derivatives :—</p>

                <p>It will be convenient to distinguish the carbon atom in combination with hydroxyl
                    as the “typical carbon atom.”</p>
                <p>The higher members of the series are susceptible of several kinds of isomerism,
                    which may now be considered. Passing over the first two members, which are not
                    capable of being formulated in more than one way, the third member (propyl
                    alcohol) may be written as—</p>
                <p>C. C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. HO or C(CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H. HO Ethyl carbinol. Dimethyl carbinol.</p>
                <p>Thus, the first kind of isomerism consists in the replacement of one C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> n</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2n+1</hi> radicle by two
                    others, each containing a smaller number of carbon atoms. The fourth member of
                    the series (tetryl or butyl alcohol) may be written :—</p>
                <p>C.C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi>.H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.HO C(CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>)(C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>)H,HO C(CH <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.HO</p>
                <p>Propyl carbinol. Methyl-ethyl carbinol. Trimethyl carbinol.</p>
                <p>The next kind of isomerism, as exemplified by the third of the above formulae,
                    consists in the substitution of three C <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2n+1</hi> radicles for the three hydrogen atoms of
                    carbinol.</p>
                <p>Now, as carbinol contains but three replaceable hydrogen atoms (not regarding the
                    atom contained in the hydroxyl, the replacement of which gives rise to a new
                    class of compounds), trimethyl carbinol is the type of a series of alcohols, in
                    which the number of C <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                        2n+1</hi> radicles combined with the typical carbon atom is a maximum. The
                    isomeric alcohols of the present series can thus be conveniently classified
                    under the three following groups :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Primary alcohols,</hi> in which the typical carbon atom is
                    combined with but one other carbon atom—</p>
                <p>C(C <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2n+1</hi>)H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,HO.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Secondary alcohols,</hi> in which the typical carbon atom is
                    combined with two other carbon atoms—</p>
                <p>C(C <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2n+1</hi>) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H.HO.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Tertiary alcohols,</hi> in which the typical carbon atom is
                    combined with three other carbon atoms—</p>
                <p>C(C <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2n+1</hi>) <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ∙HO.</p>
                <p>Another cause of isomerism among alcohols is to be found in the constitution of
                    the C <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2n+1</hi> radicles
                    (see also p. 550). Thus we may have—</p>
                <p>C.C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi>.H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.HO isomeric with C.CH(CH <hi rend="subscript">

                    carbinol.</p>
                <p>C(CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>)(C <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 9</hi>)H.HO „ C.CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> [CH <hi

                    carbinol.</p>
                <p>Each of the three above-named groups is thus capable of a further division into
                    two sub-groups, such as <hi rend="italic">normal</hi><pb break="no"

                    known, but a large number have yet to be discovered to complete the series. The

                <p>These alcohols (up to nonyl alcohol) are limpid liquids, the viscidity of which
                    increases with the molecular weight. The three other members are white
                    crystalline solids. Methyl, ethyl, and propyl alcohols are readily miscible with
                    water, the remaining members are more or less of the nature of oils. Most of
                    these alcohols possess peculiar and characteristic odours. The boiling-points of
                    the isomers are generally lower than those of the corresponding normal
                    alcohols.</p>

                <p>The synthesis of alcohols from the corresponding olefines has already been
                    alluded to (p. 559). Since ethine can be formed directly from its elements (p.
                    559), and ethene from ethine (p. 559), it is obvious that ethyl alcohol can by
                    these means be formed synthetically.</p>
                <p>Secondary alcohols are produced by the action of nascent hydrogen on ketones
                    :—</p>

                <p>The metamerism of the three groups of alcohols is strikingly displayed by their
                    behaviour on oxidation. Thus, primary or iso-primary alcohols are oxidized first

                <p>Tertiary alcohols are probably first oxidized to ketones, and ultimately to a

                    the alcohol.</p>
                <p>By particular reactions an alcohol of one group can be converted into an isomer
                    of another group, such, for instance, as normal primary butyl alcohol into the
                    isoprimary alcohol, and the latter into the tertiary alcohol.</p>
                <p>In many of their reactions alcohols are the analogues of water; for instance—</p>

                <p>The glucoses exhibit the characters both of aldehydes and of alcohols; the
                    saccharoses bear the same relationship to the glucoses that the polyethenic
                    glycols bear to glycol; the amyloses are formed from the saccharoses by the
                    elimination of one molecule of water.</p>
                <p>Many of the sugars are widely diffused throughout the vegetable kingdom—the sugar
                    in ordinary use being obtained from the sugar-cane and sugar-beet. Dextrose and
                    levulose are found in honey, ripe fruits, &amp;c., lactose in milk, inosite in
                    flesh. Gum-arabic is the dried exudation of certain species of <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The reactions are often accelerated and in some cases remarkably modified by
                    light or heat. The presence of iodine, antimony, &lt;kc., frequently assists the
                    action of chlorine. Chlorine is more energetic than bromine, and the action of
                    iodine less energetic than that of bromine,—iodine, in fact, does not act
                    directly on the paraffins. By the direct action of halogens on paraffins a
                    mixture containing more than one derivative is generally obtained. Thus, when
                    chlorine and methane are mixed and exposed to diffused light (explosion takes
                    place in direct sunlight), the whole series of derivatives CH <hi

                <p>Unsaturated hydrocarbons first of all combine directly with a certain number of
                    halogen atoms. In some cases the number of halogen atoms thus taken up restores

                <p>The haloid ethers are liable to the same isomeric modifications as their parent
                    hydrocarbons and derivatives. The conditions which determine the production of
                    any particular modification cannot in all oases be laid down with precision. For
                    instance, the di-haloid paraffin derivatives obtained from the paraffins are in
                    some cases identical and in other cases isomeric with the corresponding
                    compounds produced by the direct union of halogens with olefines. Again, the
                    higher members of the paraffin series when acted on by chlorine yield
                    simultaneously two isomeric (primary and secondary) mono-chlorinated
                    derivatives. As a final example, when chlorine acts upon <hi rend="italic"

                    place with boiling toluene the substitution takes place in the methyl radicle,
                    thus forming <hi rend="italic">benzyl</hi> compounds (C <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>Alcohols are reproduced from their haloid ethers by the action of KHO (see p.
                    563), or by first converting the haloid ether into an acetate of the radicle by
                    treatment with silver acetate, and then acting on the acetate with KHO. Tho
                    alcohols thus formed are similar in isomeric constitution to the haloid ethers
                    from which they are obtained. For instance, (CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>)
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CH.I (pseudopropyl iodide) when made to undergo

                    Isomeric haloid ethers are thus named in accordance with the radicle composing
                    the alcohols from which they are obtained, or to which they give rise on
                    conversion into acetates and treatment with KHO; thus, we have the following

                <p>The same relations exist between the haloid ethers and their isomerides as
                    between the paraffins and their isomerides. Thus, the boiling points and
                    specific gravities of the normal ethers are higher, and their chemical stability
                    is greater than that of the isomerides.</p>
                <p>By the action of nascent hydrogen many haloid ethers are restored to the

                <p>As will be seen from these equations, a given quantity of H <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> is theoretically capable of
                    etherifying an unlimited quantity of alcohol; practically, however, a limit is
                    reached. If a mixture of alcohols is employed at starting, a compound ether is
                    produced.</p>
                <p>Ethyl ether is a colourless, mobile liquid, but very slightly soluble in water,
                    and possessing an agreeable odour. It boils at 35° ’ 5 C. By the action of

                <p>It will be seen from these formulae that aldehydes are derived from alcohols by

                <p>The aldehydes of monohydric alcohols are metameric with the oxides (ethers) of
                    dyad radicles. Thus, ethyl aldehyde, CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.COH, is
                    metameric with ethene oxide (C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi

                        3</hi> (CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>)]"O. The aldehydes are liable also
                    to the isomerism of their contained hydrocarbon radicles, while aromatic
                    aldehydes of dihydric alcohols are susceptible of the isomerism incident to the
                    relative positions of the COH groups.</p>
                <p>By the action of oxidizing agents aldehydes are converted into acids containing
                    the same number of carbon atoms; thus, R' being the monatomic radicle—</p>

                    first results of the introduction of hydroxyl into the methyl group. The next
                    step in oxidation removes the two remaining hydrogen atoms from this group with
                    the formation of aldehydes, and the final result of the oxidation is to convert
                    COH into carboxyl COOH, with the formation of acids. Aldehydes thus occupy a
                    position intermediate between alcohols and acids :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Classification.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> By inspecting the
                    formulae given at the commencement of the present section, it will be seen that
                    the number of times COOH occurs in an acid is dependent on the number of times
                    the group CH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.OH occurs in the parent alcohol. Now,
                    organic like mineral acids when brought into contact with metallic oxides or
                    hydroxides, give rise to the formation of <hi rend="italic">salts,</hi> in which
                    H, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, &amp;c., are
                    replaced by M', M' <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> or Μ", M' <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi> or M'", &amp;c.; but the hydrogen thus replaceable is found to be not
                    that which enters simply into the composition of HO, as with mineral acids, but
                    that which exists in the group COOH. The basicity of an organic acid depends
                    therefore on the number of carboxyl groups it contains—acids containing 1, 2, 3,
                        <hi rend="italic">n</hi> carboxyl groups being mono-, di-, tri-,

                    corresponding primary alcohols and aldehydes (pp. 563 and 567); 2. By the action
                    of mineral acids or alkalies on the cyanoderivatives of the paraffins obtained
                    by the methods previously given (p. 566; see also p. 555); 3. By the action of

                    the methyl series are most conveniently formulated as derivatives of the first
                    term carbinol, so the present acids may be regarded as derived from formic or
                    acetic acids, the two first members of the series :—</p>

                <p>The first kind of isomerism which we have to consider is that depending on the
                    replacement of one C.H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, <hi rend="subscript">
                        +1</hi> radicle by two or three others, each containing a smaller
                    nuπft&gt;er of carbon atoms. (Compare with isomerism of alcohols, p. 562.) Thus
                    we may have the following isomerides :— <hi rend="smallcaps">ch</hi><hi

                <p>Propacetic or Methyl-ethacetic Trimethacetic valeric acid. acid. acid.</p>
                <p>Acids are thus classified in the same manner as the alcohols, into primary,
                    secondary, and tertiary, according as the carbon atom in combination with
                    carboxyl is combined with one, two, or three other carbon atoms.</p>
                <p>Another kind of isomerism is dependent on the isomerism of the radicles replacing
                    the H of the CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> of the acetic acid; thus—</p>
                <p>C(C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi>)H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. COOH C[CH(CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi

                <p>Propacetic acid. is isomeric with Pseudopropacetic acid.</p>
                <p>Each of the three groups of acids is accordingly subdivided into normal and
                    iso-acids, although the series are far from being complete.</p>

                <p>These acids exhibit the general physical properties of all homologous series. Up
                    to pelargonic acid they are limpid liquids, possessing penetrating odours, and
                    of increasing viscidity; the remaining members are solid fats. The acids of this
                    series are found in nature in the free state (formic acid in ants, cerotic acid
                    in beeswax, &lt;fcc,), or as glyceric, &amp;c., ethereal salts, in natural fats
                    (mutton fat, glyceric stearate; spermaceti, cetylic palmitate, &amp;c.); hence
                    the term “fatty series.” Formic acid can be prepared by certain special
                    methods—1. By passing carbon monoxide over moist potash (CO + KHO = H.COOK); 2.
                    By heating dry oxalic acid with glycerine (H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> = CO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + H.COOH). Acetic acid also can be synthesized from
                    ethine and oxygen in presence of potash (C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + O-t-KHO = C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> KO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>). This acid is
                    obtained on the large scale by the dry distillation of wood, and is likewise
                    contained in vinegar. Butyric acid is formed by the fermentation of sugar in
                    presence of chalk and putrefying cheese or milk. The metallic salts formed by
                    the fatty acids furnish the organic acids unchanged on distillation with a
                    mineral acid. The potassium salts, when distilled with potassium formate, yield
                    the corresponding aldehydes—</p>

                    Aldehyde.</p>
                <p>The aldehydes can be converted into the alcohols by the action of nascent
                    hydrogen, and from the alcohols the haloid ethers can be obtained, which, by
                    methods now known to the reader, can be converted into nitriles, and these again
                    into acids containing one more atom of carbon than the alcohol (p. 555). It will
                    be obvious that by these reactions the homologous series of fatty acids can be
                    ascended term by term. By the action of chlorine, &amp;c., on the fatty acids
                    substitution-compounds are obtained. Thus acetic acid is converted into CH <hi

                <p>These compounds are derived from acids by the substitution of hydrocarbon
                    radicles for hydrogen, but it is only the hydrogen entering into the composition
                    of hydroxyl that can be thus replaced. Thus, the number of ethereal salts that
                    any acid can form depends upon the number of times it contains HO; in other
                    words, an íi-hydric acid can form <hi rend="italic">n</hi> ethereal salts. It
                    has been previously mentioned that the basicity of an organic acid depends upon
                    the number of times it contains COOH, hence it follows that monohydric acids
                    must be monobasic, but n-hydric acids may be 1,2, 3, η-basic. For example,
                    tartaric acid is tetrahydric, but as only two of its hydrogen atoms are
                    replaceable by metals it is dibasic, and consequently contains 2(COOH). But this
                    acid being tetrahydric contains 4(HO), and has thus four hydrogen atoms
                    replaceable by radicles, giving rise to four ethereal salts :—</p>

                    of the radicle from which the amine is derived in cases where such isomerism is
                    possible.</p>
                <p>The action of nascent hydrogen on the nitriles gives rise to the formation of

                <p>The nitriles can be obtained from the alcohols by combining the latter with
                    sulphuric acid, converting the sulpho-acid thus produced into a potassium salt,
                    and distilling this with potassium cyanide (p. 566). By combining all these
                    reactions the homologous series of alcohols can be ascended. To give an
                    illustration :— <hi rend="italic">Methyl alcohol</hi> is combined with sulphuric
                    acid, and the resulting sulphoacid converted into potassium methylsulphate. This

                    when methyl cyanide (acetonitrile) is produced; this when acted on by nascent
                    hydrogen is converted into ethylamine, which by the action of nitrous acid is

                <p>Most of the reactions made use of in preparing the cyanides give rise to the
                    simultaneous formation of isocyanides (see p. 555); the latter bodies are in
                    excess when the iodides of the radicles are made to act upon silver cyanide.
                    Isocyanides are also obtained by heating primary amines with chloroform and
                    caustic potash :—</p>

                <p>This reaction affords a ready means of distinguishing primary amines, as the
                    isocyanides are at once detected, even in the smallest traces, by their powerful
                    and nauseous odours. The carbamines reduce many metallic oxides (such as HgO, Ag
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, &amp;c.) with the formation of cyanates of
                    the contained hydrocarbon radicles. They possess properties decidedly more basic
                    than their metamerides, combining energetically with acids to form salts. When
                    heated in sealed tubes the isocyanides are partially transformed into the
                    corresponding nitriles.</p>

                    primary, secondary, or tertiary. When aniline hydrochloride and methyl alcohol
                    are heated together in a sealed tube, the amido-hydrogen is partially or
                    entirely replaced by methyl, giving rise to the formation of methyl and
                    dimethyl-aniline hydrochlorides. When both atoms of amido-hydrogen have been
                    thus replaced, if the heating is continued the phenylic hydrogen becomes
                    replaced by methyl giving rise to dimethyl-toluidine and its homologues. This
                    interesting intra-molecular substitution was discovered by Hofmann. The nature
                    of the transformation will be seen from the following formulae :—</p>

                    hitherto been made clear. Among the cinchona alkaloids—of which the valuable
                    medicine quinine is a member—some interesting cases of physical isomerism occur.
                    Many bases have been obtained by the action of reagents on the opium alkaloids.
                    A base isomeric with coni ne has been prepared artificially by heating normal
                    butyl aldehyde with an alcoholic solution of ammonia so as to produce <hi

                <p>It has been recently observed by Dr Otto Witt that the peculiar properties of
                    organic colouring substances are in most cases due to the combined presence of
                    two groups or radicles attached to a carbon nucleus. The one which is the
                    colour-producing group is termed the <hi rend="italic">chromophore,</hi> the
                    other is a salt-forming group, ι.e , a group which confers upon a molecule
                    either acidity or basicity. A substance containing a chromophore does not become
                    a colour until the salt-forming group is introduced into the molecule; such
                    potential colouring matters are therefore termed <hi rend="italic"
                        >chromogens.</hi> The chromophoric group exercises its influence more
                    powerfully in the salts of colouring substances. The principal salt-forming
                    groups combined with aromatic nuclei are HO and NH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    so that most chromogens of this class give rise to two colours according as one
                    or other of the foregoing radicles enters into their composition.</p>
