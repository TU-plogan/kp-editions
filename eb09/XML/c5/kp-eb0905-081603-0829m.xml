                    son of Drusus and Antonia, and grandson of Livia, the wife of Augustus.
                    Paralyzed and lame, and unable to speak with distinctness, he was an object of
                    scorn even to his mother; and the natural diffidence and timidity of his
                    character were increased by neglect and insult, till he was regarded as little
                    better than an imbecile. His time was spent chiefly in the society of servants,
                    and devoted to the industrious pursuit of literature; and until his accession he
                    took no real part in public affairs, though Caligula honoured <pb break="no"

                    was Plautia Urgulanilla, whom he divorced because he suspected her of designs
                    against his life; his second, Aelia Petina, was also divorced; and his third was
                    the infamous Valeria Messalina. In 41 <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.,</hi> on the
                    murder of Caligula, Claudius was seized by the praetorians, and declared
                    emperor. As soon as he gained resolution to assume the authority of his office,
                    he proclaimed an amnesty for all except Chaerea, the assassin of his
                    predecessor, and one or two others. The account, however, of his painstaking
                    government, his laborious personal administration of justice, his conquest of
                    Britain, his extension of <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Ûiq</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >jus</hi><hi rend="italic">honorum</hi> to the Gauls, his construction of the
                    Claudian aqueduct and the harbour of Ostia, are matters of history (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Roman History).</hi> The cruelties of his reign appear to have
                    been due to the facility of character which placed him completely under the
                    influence of his favourite freedmen, of whom the most conspicuous were
                    Narcissus, Pallas, and Polybius, and of his wife, the vicious and shameless
                    Messalina, whom he fondly loved and honoured. At length, according to the
                    account of Tacitus, Messalina went through the ceremony of marriage with one of
                    her lovers, and urged by her former confederate Narcissus, the emperor allowed
                    her to be seized, aud Narcissus put her to death. Suetonius throws a somewhat
                    different light on the story, making it rather more probable, for he tells us
                    that there was a rumour that the emperor desired and assisted in the marriage,
                    because he had been warned by a soothsayer that the husband of Messalina was
                    about to fall into misfortune. The next and fourth wife of Claudius was his
                    niece Agrippina, a woman as criminal as any of her predecessors. She prevailed
                    upon him to set aside his own son Britannicus in favour of Nero, her son by a
                    former marriage; and in 54 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> that she might place
                    the act beyond recall, she put the emperor to death by means of poison.</p>
                <p>Encouraged by Livy, as Suetonius asserts, and assisted by the freedmen who
                    attended him, Claudius produced a history of Rome, commencing with the battle of
                    Actium (31 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> in 41 books, a defence of Cicero
                    against Asinius Pollio, memoirs of his own life, and, in Greek, a history of
                    Carthage and a history of Etruria; but none of his writings have come down to
                    us. He introduced three new letters into the Latin alphabet—the digamma, the <hi
                    rend="italic">ψ,</hi> and another not now known; but they appear to have been
                    dropped at his death.</p>
                <p>The principal authority for the life and times of Claudius is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annals</hi> of Tacitus, in whose high-coloured pictures there is
                    much that gives rise to a suspicion of exaggeration. Suetonius and Dion Cassius
                    are even less trustworthy.</p>
