                <p>CHRONOLOGY (from the Greek <hi rend="italic">χρονολογία,</hi> computation of
                    time) is the science which treats of time. Its object is to arrange and exhibit
                    the various events which have occurred in the history of the world in the order
                    of their succession, and to ascertain the intervals of time between them.</p>
                <p>The preservation of any record, however rude, of the lapse of time implies some
                    knowledge of the celestial motions, by which alone time can be accurately
                    measured, and some advancement in the arts of civilized life, which could only
                    be attained by the accumulated experience of many generations. Before the
                    invention of letters the memory of past transactions could not be preserved
                    beyond a few years with any tolerable degree of accuracy. Events which greatly
                    affected the physical condition of the human race, or were of a nature to make a
                    deep impression on the minds of the rude inhabitants of the earth, might be
                    vaguely transmitted through several ages by traditional narrative; but intervals
                    of time, expressed by abstract numbers, and these constantly varying besides,
                    would soon escape the memory. The invention of the art of writing afforded the
                    means of substituting precise and permanent records for vague and evanescent
                    tradition; but in the infancy of the world, mankind had learned neither to
                    estimate accurately the duration of time, nor to refer passing events to any
                    fixed epoch. Writing was practised many centuries before historians began to
                    assign dates to the events they narrated. The masterpieces of Herodotus and
                    Thucydides, while setting forth, each in the manner suited to the author’s aim,
                    events in the order of their succession, are stories without dates.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0723-0710"/>
                <p>For these reasons the history of the early ages of the world is involved in
                    almost impenetrable obscurity, and chronology, comparatively speaking, is only
                    of recent origin. After political relations began to be established, the
                    necessity of preserving a register of passing seasons and years would soon be
                    felt, and the practice of recording important transactions must have grown up as
                    a necessary consequence of social life. But of these early records a very small
                    portion only has escaped the ravages of time and barbarism.</p>
                <p>The earliest written annals of the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans are
                    irretrievably lost. The traditions of the Druids perished with them. A Chinese
                    emperor has the credit of burning “the books” extant in his day (about 220 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), and of burying alive the scholars who were
                    acquainted with them. And a Spanish adventurer destroyed the picture records
                    which were found in the <hi rend="italic">pueblo</hi> of Montezuma.</p>
                <p>Of the more formal historical writings in which the first ineffectual attempts
                    were made in the direction of systematic chronology we have no knowledge at
                    first-hand. Of Hellenicus, the Greek logographer, who appears to have lived
                    through the greater part of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and
                    who drew up a chronological list of the priestesses of Here at Argos; of
                    Ephorus, who lived in the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and is
                    distinguished as the first Greek who attempted the composition of a universal
                    history; and of Timaeus, who in the following century wrote an elaborate history
                    of Sicily, in which he set the example of using the Olympiads as the basis of
                    chronology, the works have perished, and our meagre knowledge of their contents
                    is derived only from fragmentary citations in later writers. The same fate has
                    befallen the works of Berosus and Manetho, Eratosthenes and Apollodorus.
                    Berosus, a priest of Belus living at Babylon in the 3d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> added to his historical account of Babylonia a
                    chronological list of its kings, which he claimed to have compiled from genuine
                    archives preserved in the temple. Manetho, likewise a priest, living at
                    Sebennytus in Lower Egypt in the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    wrote in Greek a history of Egypt, with an account of its thirty dynasties of
                    sovereigns, which he professed to have drawn from genuine archives in the
                    keeping of the priests. Of these works fragments only, more or less copious and
                    accurate, have been preserved. Eratosthenes, who in the latter half of the 2d
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> was keeper of the famous Alexandrian
                    Library, not only made himself a great name by his important work on geography,
                    but by his treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Chronographia,</hi> one of the
                    first attempts to establish an exact scheme of general chronology, earned for
                    himself the title of “father of chronology.” His method of procedure, however,
                    was usually conjectural; and guess-work, however careful, acute, and plausible,
                    is still guess-work and not testimony. Apollodorus, an Athenian who flourished
                    in the middle of the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> wrote a metrical
                    chronicle of events, ranging from the supposed period of the fall of Troy to his
                    own day. These writers were followed by other investigators and systematizers in
                    the same field, but their works are lost. Of the principal later writers whose
                    works are extant, and to whom we owe what little knowledge we possess of the
                    labours of their predecessors, mention will be made hereafter.</p>
                <p>The absence or incompleteness of authentic records, however, is not the only
                    source of obscurity and confusion in the chronology of remote ages. There can be
                    no exact computation of time or placing of events without a fixed point or epoch
                    from which the reckoning takes its start. It was long before this was
                    apprehended. When it began to be seen, various epochs were selected by various
                    writers; and at first each small separate community had its own epoch and method
                    of time-reckoning. Thus in one city the reckoning was by succession of kings, in
                    another by archons or annual magistrates, in a third by succession of priests.
                    It seems now surprising that vague counting by generations should so long have
                    prevailed and satisfied the wants of inquiring men, and that so simple, precise,
                    and seemingly obvious a plan as counting by years, the largest natural division
                    of time, did not occur to any investigator before Eratosthenes.</p>
                <p>Precision, which was at first unattainable for want of an epoch, was afterwards
                    no less unattainable from the multiplicity, and sometimes the variation, of
                    epochs. But by a natural process the mischief was gradually and partially
                    remedied. The extension of intercourse between the various small groups or
                    societies of men, and still more their union in larger groups, made a common
                    epoch necessary, and led to the adoption of such a starting point by each larger
                    group. These leading epochs continued in use for many centuries. The task of the
                    chronologer was thus simplified and reduced to a study and comparison of dates
                    in a few leading systems.</p>
                <p>The most important of these systems in what we call ancient times were the
                    Babylonian, the Greek, and the Roman. The Jews had no general era, properly so
                    called. In the history of Babylonia, the fixed point from which time was
                    reckoned was the era of Nabonassar, 747 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Among the
                    Greeks the reckoning was by Olympiads, the point of departure being the year in
                    which Coroebus was victor in the Olympic Games, 776 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> The Roman chronology started from the foundation of the city, the
                    year of which, however, was variously given by different authors. The most
                    generally adopted was that assigned by Varro, 753 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    It is noteworthy how nearly these three great epochs approach each other,—all
                    lying near the middle of the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But it
                    is to be remembered that the beginning of an era and its adoption and use as
                    such are not the same thing, nor are they necessarily synchronous. Of the three
                    ancient eras above spoken of, the earliest is that of the Olympiads, next that
                    of the foundation of Rome, and the latest the era of Nabonassar. But in order of
                    adoption and actual usage the last is first. It is believed to have been in use
                    from the year of its origin. It is not known when the Romans began to use their
                    era. The Olympiads were not in current use till about the middle of the 3d
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when Timaeus, as already mentioned, set
                    the example of reckoning by them. Of these and other ancient and modern eras a
                    full account is given in the following pages.</p>
                <p>Even after the adoption in Europe of the Christian era, a great variety of
                    methods of dating—national, provincial, and ecclesiastical—grew up and prevailed
                    for a long time in different countries, thus renewing in modern times the
                    difficulties experienced in ancient times from diversities of reckoning. An
                    acquaintance with these various methods is indispensable to the student of the
                    charters, chronicles, and legal instruments of the Middle Ages.</p>
                <p>In reckoning years from any fixed epoch in constant succession, the number
                    denoting the years is necessarily always on the increase. But rude nations and
                    illiterate people seldom attach any definite idea to large numbers. Hence it has
                    been a practice, very extensively followed, to employ cycles or periods,
                    consisting of a moderate number of years, and to distinguish and reckon the
                    years by their number in the cycle. The Chinese and other nations of Asia
                    reckon, not only the years, but also the months and days, by cycles of sixty.
                    The Saros of the Chaldeans, the Olympiad of the Greeks, and the Roman Indiction
                    are instances of this mode of reckoning time. Several cycles were formerly known
                    in Europe; but most of them were invented for the purpose of adjusting the solar
                    and lunar divisions of time, and were rather employed in the regulation of the
                    calendar than as chronological eras. They are frequently, however, of very great
                    use in <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n724/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0724-0711"/> fixing dates that have been otherwise imperfectly
                    expressed, and consequently form important elements of chronology.</p>
                <p>Chronology has shared with history the fruits of the novel researches and
                    remarkable discoveries in the field of antiquity which have especially
                    distinguished the present century. The <hi rend="italic">memorabilia</hi> of
                    early peoples and ages were set down not only in written records but in
                    monumental inscriptions. The latter, graven on stone or metal, could resist the
                    touch of time and the hand of the barbarian better than the former; and although
                    at various times terrible havoc has been made among them, immense numbers are in
                    existence to this day. In Assyria, Egypt, Persia, Greece, and Italy, the
                    practice of monumental inscription was very general. These inscriptions have
                    attracted the attention of learned men from very remote ages. But as
                    contributions to history and chronology, they have within the present century
                    risen into new and surprising importance. By Grotefend’s decipherment of the
                    cuneiform characters, the language of the Babylonian and Persian inscriptions,
                    and by Young’s decipherment of hieroglyphics, the language of the Egyptian
                    monuments, two discoveries made within a few years of each other, new fields of
                    vast extent and unknown richness have been opened to historical explorers. These
                    fields are now being diligently worked by some of the greatest living scholars;
                    and from granite block and fragile papyrus roll results are already obtained of
                    rare value and of rarer promise. The Assyrian inscribed cylinders, disinterred
                    but thirty years ago, are yielding up the secrets of a long-buried past,
                    enlarging the horizon of history, and even furnishing the means of giving a
                    precise chronology to periods where all was vague. The publication of the
                    Assyrian Canon by Sir Henry Rawlinson in 1862, verified as it was by the
                    subsequent discovery of a record of a solar eclipse, must mark an epoch in
                    chronological science. Egyptian researches and interpretations have been of
                    similar service, and have strongly tended, if not to establish the complete
                    accuracy, at least to indicate the credibility, of Manetho’s account of the
                    Egyptian dynasties. The period through which these dynasties apparently reached
                    was so vast, stretching so far beyond the traditionally accepted limits of man’s
                    existence on the earth, that modern chronologers, when they grew critical, could
                    for a long time only shake their heads in profound doubt over Manetho and his
                    vistas of shadowy kings. For Egyptian chronology the discovery by Mariette, in
                    1864, of the <hi rend="italic">Apis Steloe</hi> is one of the highest
                    importance. A flood of light has been poured on some obscure pages of early
                    Persian history by the great cuneiform inscription of Behistun, discovered in
                    1835 by Colonel Rawlinson, who subsequently copied and translated it,</p>
                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Calendar</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi>
                    that part of chronology has been already treated of which relates to the
                    measurement of time, and the principal methods explained with sufficient detail
                    that have been employed, or are still in use, for adjusting the lunar months of
                    the solar year, as well as the intercalations necessary for regulating the civil
                    year according to the celestial motions. In the present article it is our
                    purpose to give an account (without repeating what has been discussed in full in
                    the article just named) of the different <hi rend="italic">Eras</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Periods</hi> that have been employed by historians, and by the
                    different nations of the world, in recording the succession of time and events,
                    to fix the epochs at which the eras respectively commenced, to ascertain the
                    form and the initial day of the year made use of, and to establish their
                    correspondence with the years of the Christian era. These elements will enable
                    us. to convert, by a simple arithmetical operation, any historical date, of
                    which the chronological characters are given according to any era whatever, into
                    the corresponding date in our common are of the Incarnation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Julian Period.</hi></p>
                <p>Although the Julian Period (the invention of Joseph Scaliger, in 1582) is not,
                    properly speaking, a chronological era, yet, on account of its affording
                    considerable facilities in the comparison of different eras with one another,
                    and in marking without ambiguity the years before Christ, it is very generally
                    employed by chronologers. It consists of 7980 Julian years; and the first year
                    of the Christian era corresponded with the year 4714 of the Julian period. (See
                    vol. iv. p. 670.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Olympiads.</hi></p>
                <p>The Olympic games, so famous in Greek history, were celebrated once every four
                    years, between the new and full moon first following the summer solstice, on the
                    small plain named Olympia in Elis, which was bounded on one side by the River
                    Alpheus, on another by the small tributary stream the Cladeus, and on the other
                    two sides by mountains. The games lasted five days. Their origin, lost in the
                    dimness of remote antiquity, was invested by priestly legends with a sacred
                    character. They were said to have been instituted by the Idaean Heracles, to
                    commemorate his victory over his four brothers in a foot race. According to a
                    tradition, possibly more authentic, they were re-established by Iphitus, king of
                    Elis, in concert with the Spartan Lycurgus and Cleosthenes of Pisa. The practice
                    was long afterwards adopted of designating the Olympiad, or period of four
                    years, by the name of the victor in the contests of the stadium, and of
                    inscribing his name in the gymnasium of Olympia. The first who received this
                    honour was Coroebus. The games in which Coroebus was victor, and which form the
                    principal epoch of Greek; history, were celebrated about the time of the summer
                    solstice 776 years before the common era of the Incarnation, in the 3938th year
                    of the Julian period, and twenty-three years, according to the account of Varro,
                    before the foundation of Rome.</p>
                <p>Before the introduction of the Metonic cycle, the Olympic year began sometimes
                    with the full moon which followed, at other times with that which preceded the
                    summer solstice, because the year sometimes contained 384 days instead of 354.
                    But subsequently to its adoption, the year always commenced with the eleventh
                    day of the moon which followed the solstice. In order to avoid troublesome
                    computations, which it would be necessary to recommence for every year, and of
                    which the results differ only by a few days, chronologers generally regard the
                    1st of July as the commencement of the Olympic year. Some authors, however,
                    among whom are Eusebius, Jerome, and the historian Socrates, place its
                    commencement at the 1st of September; these, however, appear to have confounded
                    the Olympic year with the civil year of the Greeks, or the era of the
                    Seleucidae.</p>
                <p>It is material to observe, that as the Olympic years and periods begin with the
                    1st of July, the first six months of a year of our era correspond to one Olympic
                    year, and the last six months to another. Thus, when it is said that the first
                    year of the Incarnation corresponds to the first of the 195th Olympiad, we are
                    to understand that it is only with respect to the last six months of that year
                    that the correspondence takes place. The first six months belonged to the fourth
                    year of the 194th Olympiad. In referring dates expressed by Olympiads to our
                    era, or the contrary, we must therefore distinguish two cases.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">1st,</hi> When the event in question happened between the 1st
                    of January and the 1st of the following July, the.sum of the Olympic year and of
                    the year before Christ is always equal to 776. The year of the era, therefore,
                    will be found by subtracting the number of the Olympic year from 776.</p>

                <p>For example, Varro refers the foundation of Rome to the 21st of April of the
                    third year of the sixth Olympiad, and it is required to find the year before our
                    era. Since five Olympic periods have elapsed, the third year of the sixth
                    Olympiad is 5x4 + 3 = 23; therefore, subtracting 23 from 776, we have 753, which
                    is the year before Christ to which the foundation of Rome is referred by
                    Varro.</p>
                <p>2c?, When the event took place between the summer solstice and the 1st of January
                    following, the sum of the Olympic year and of the year before Christ is equal to
                    777. The difference therefore between 777 and the year in one of the dates will
                    give the year in the other date. Thus, the moon was eclipsed on the 27th of
                    August, a little before midnight, in the year 413 before our era; and it is
                    required to find the corresponding year in the Olympic era. Subtract 413 from
                    777, the remainder is 364; and 364 divided by four gives 91 without a remainder;
                    consequently the eclipse happened in the fourth year of the ninety-first
                    Olympiad, which is the date to which it is referred by Thucydides.</p>
                <p>If the year is after Christ, and the event took place in one of the first six
                    months of the Olympic year, that is to say, between July and January, we must
                    subtract 776 from the number of the Olympic year to find the corresponding year
                    of our era; but if it took place in one of the last six months of the Olympic
                    year, or between January and July, we must deduct 777. The computation by
                    Olympiads seldom occurs in historical records after the middle of the 5th
                    century of our era.</p>
                <p>The names of the months were different in the different Grecian states. The Attic
                    months, of which we possess the most certain knowledge, were named as follows

                <p>Era of the Foundation of Rome.</p>
                <p>After the Olympiads, the era most frequently met with in ancient history is that
                    of the foundation of Rome, which is the chronological epoch adopted by all the
                    Roman historians. There are various opinions respecting the year of the
                    foundation of Rome.</p>
                <p>lsζ Fabius Pictor places this event in the latter half of the first year of the
                    eighth Olympiad, which corresponds with the 3967th of the Julian period, and
                    with the year 747 B.c.</p>
                <p>2c?, Polybius places it in the second year of the seventh Olympiad, corresponding
                    with 3964 of the Julian period, and 750 B.c.</p>
                <p>3d, Μ. Porcius Cato places it in the first year of the seventh Olympiad, that is,
                    in 3963 of the Julian period, and 751 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">4íä,</hi> Verrius Flaccus places it in the fourth year of the

                    >b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>A knowledge of these different computations is necessary, in order to reconcile
                    the Roman historians with one another, and even any one writer with himself.
                    Livy in general adheres to the epoch of Cato, though he sometimes follows that
                    of Fabius Pictor. Cicero follows the account of Varro, which is also in general
                    adopted by Pliny. Dionysius of Halicarnassus follows Cato. Modern chronologers
                    for the most part adopt the account of Varro, which is supported by a passage in
                    Censorinus, where it is stated that the 991st year of Rome commenced with the
                    festival of the Palilia, in the consulship of Ulpius and Pontianus.</p>
                <p>Now this consulship corresponded with the 238th year of our era; therefore,
                    deducting 238 from 991, we have 753 to denote the year before Christ. The
                    Palilia commenced on the 21st of April; and all the accounts agree in regarding
                    that day as the epoch of the foundation of Rome.</p>
                <p>The Romans employed two sorts of years, the civil year, which was used in the
                    transaction of public and private affairs, and the consular year, according to
                    which the annals of their history have been composed. The civil year commenced
                    with the calends of January, but this did not hold a fixed place in the solar
                    year till the time of Julius Caesar (see vol. iv. p. 666.) The installation of
                    the consuls regu lated the commencement of the consular year. The initial day of
                    the consulate was never fixed, at least before the 7th century of Rome, but
                    varied with the different accidents which in times of political commotion so
                    frequently occurred to accelerate or retard the elections. Hence it happens that
                    a consular year, generally speaking, comprehends a part not only of two Julian
                    years, but also of two civil years. The consulate is the date employed by the
                    Latin historians generally, and by many of the Greeks, down to the 6th century
                    of our era.</p>
                <p>In the era of Rome the commencement of the year is placed at the 21st of April;
                    an event therefore which happened in the months of January, February, March, or
                    during the first twenty days of April, in the year (for example) 500 of Rome,
                    belongs to the civil year 501. Before the time of the Decemvirs, however,
                    February was the last month of the year. Many authors confound the year of Rome
                    with the civil year, supposing them both to begin on the 1st of January. Others
                    again confound both the year of Rome and the civil year with the Julian year,
                    which in fact became the civil year after the regulation of the calendar by
                    Julius Caesar. Through a like want of attention, many writers also, particularly
                    among the moderns, have confounded the Julian and Olympic years, by making an
                    entire Julian year correspond to an entire Olympic year, as if both had
                    commenced at the same epoch. Much attention to these particulars is required in
                    the comparison of ancient dates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Christian Era.</hi></p>
                <p>The Christian or vulgar era, called also the era of the Incarnation, is now
                    almost universally employed in Christian countries, and is even used by some
                    Eastern nations. Its epoch or commencement is the 1st of January in the fourth
                    year of the 194th Olympiad, the 753d from the foundation of Rome, and the 4714th
                    of the Julian period. It is usually supposed to begin with the year of the birth
                    of Christ, but there are various opinions with regard to the year in which that
                    event took place. This epoch was introduced in Italy in the 6th century, by
                    Dionysius the Little, a Roman abbot, and began to be used in Gaul in the 8th,
                    though it was not generally followed in that country till a century later. From
                    extant charters it is known to have been in use in England before the close of
                    the 8th century. Before its adoption the usual practice in Latin countries was
                    to distinguish the years by their number in the cycle of Indiction.</p>
                <p>In the Christian era the years are simply distinguished by the cardinal numbers;
                    those before Christ being marked <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (Before Christ),
                    or <hi rend="smallcaps">a.c.</hi> (Ante Christum), and those after Christ
                    A.r&gt;. (Anno Domini). This method of reckoning time is more convenient than
                    those which employ cycles or periods of any length whatever; but it still fails
                    to satisfy in the simplest manner possible all the conditions that are necessary
                    for registering the succession of events. For, since the commencement of the era
                    is placed at an intermediate period of history, we are compelled to resort to a
                    double manner of reckoning, backward as well <pb break="no"

                    the want of uniformity in the method of numbering the preceding years.
                    Astronomers denote the year which preceded the first of our era by 0, and the
                    year previous to that by 1 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >;</hi> but chronologers, in conformity with common notions, call the year
                    preceding the era 1 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> the previous year 2 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and so on. By reckoning in this manner, there is an
                    interruption in the regular succession of the numbers; and in the years
                    preceding the era, the leap years, instead of falling on the fourth, eighth,
                    twelfth, &amp;c., fall, or ought to fall, on the first, fifth, ninth,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the chronicles of the Middle Ages much uncertainty frequently arises
                    respecting dates on account of the different epochs assumed for the commencement
                    of the Christian year. Dionysius, the author of the era, adopted the day of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Annunciation,</hi> or the 25th of March, which preceded the
                    birth of Christ by nine months, as the commencement of the first year of the
                    era. This epoch therefore precedes that of the vulgar era by nine months and
                    seven days. This manner of dating was followed in some of the Italian states,
                    and continued to be used at Pisa even down to the year 1745. It was also adopted
                    in some of the Papal bulls; and there are proofs of its having been employed in
                    France about the middle of the 11th century. Some chroniclers, who adhere to the
                    day of the Annunciation as the commencement of the year, reckon from the 25th of
                    March following our epoch, as the Florentines in the 10th century. Gregory of
                    Tours, and some writers of the 6th and 7th centuries, make the year commence
                    sometimes with the 1st of March, and sometimes with the 1st of January. In
                    France, under the third race of kings, it was usual to begin the year with
                    Easter; and this practice continued at least till the middle of the 16th
                    century, for an edict was issued by Charles IX. in the month of January 1663,
                    ordaining that the commencement of the year should thenceforth be considered as
                    taking place on the 1st of January. An instance is given, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >PArt de Verifier les Dates,</hi> of a date in which the year is reckoned from
                    the 18th of March; but it is probable that this refers to the astronomical year,
                    and that the 18th of March was taken for the day of the vernal equinox. In
                    Germany, about the 11th century, it was usual to commence the year at Christmas;
                    and this practice also prevailed at Milan, Rome, and other Italian cities, in
                    the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries.</p>
                <p>In England, the practice of placing the beginning of the year at Christmas was
                    introduced in the 7th century, and traces of it are found even in the 13th.
                    Gervase of Canterbury, who lived in the 13th century, mentions that almost all
                    writers of his country agreed in regarding Christmas day as the first of the
                    year, because it forms, as it were, the term at which the sun finishes and
                    recommences his annual course. In the 12th century, however, the custom of
                    beginning the civil year with the day of the Annunciation, or the 25th of March,
                    began to prevail, and continued to be generally followed from that time till the
                    reformation of the calendar in 1752. The historical year has always been
                    reckoned by English authors to begin with the 1st of January. The liturgie year
                    of the Church of England commences with the first Sunday of Advent.</p>
                <p>A knowledge of the different epochs which have been chosen for the commencement
                    of the year in different countries is indispensably necessary to the right
                    interpretation of ancient chronicles, charters, and other documents in which the
                    dates often appear contradictory. We may cite an example or two. It is well
                    known that Charles the Great was crowned emperor at Rome on Christmas day in the
                    year 800, and that he died in the year 814, according to our present manner of
                    reckoning. But in the annals of Metz and Moissac, the coronation is stated to
                    have taken place in the year 801, and his death in 813. In the first case the
                    annalist supposes the year to begin with Christmas, and accordingly reckons the
                    25th of December and all the following days of that month to belong to 801,
                    whereas in the common reckoning they would be referred to the year 800. In the
                    second case the year has been supposed to begin with the 25th of March, or
                    perhaps with Easter; consequently the first three months of the year 814,
                    reckoning from the 1st of January, would be referred to the end of the year 813.
                    The English Revolution is popularly called the Revolution of 1688. Had the year
                    then begun, as it now does, with the 1st of January, it would have been the
                    revolution of 1689, William and Mary being received as king and queen in
                    February in the year 1689; but at that time the year was considered in England
                    as beginning on the 25th of March. Another circumstance to which it is often
                    necessary to pay attention in the comparison of dates, is the alteration of
                    style which took place on the adoption of the Gregorian Calendar (see vol. iv.
                    pp. 671 <hi rend="italic">sqq.)</hi><hi rend="italic">Era of the Creation of the
                    World.</hi></p>
                <p>As the Greek and Roman methods of computing time were connected with certain
                    pagan rites and observances, which the Christians held in abhorrence, the latter
                    began at an early period to imitate the Jews in reckoning their years from the
                    supposed period of the creation of the world. The chronological elements on
                    which both Jews and Christians founded their computations for determining this
                    period were derived from the Old Testament narratives, which have been
                    transmitted to us through three distinct channels. These are the Hebrew text of
                    the Scriptures, the Samaritan text, and the Greek version known as the
                    Septuagint. In respect of chronology, the three accounts are totally
                    irreconcilable with each other; and no conclusive reason can be given for
                    preferring any one of them to another. We have no concurrent testimony with
                    which to compare them; nor is it even known which of them was regarded as the
                    most probable by the Jews themselves, when the books of the Old Testament, were
                    revised and transcribed by Ezra. The ordinary rules of probability cannot be
                    applied to a state of things in which the duration of human life is represented
                    as extending to nearly a thousand years.</p>
                <p>From computations founded on loose and conflicting data it would be vain to look
                    for knowledge or even for concord of opinion. From the very nature of the case
                    discussion is hopeless labour. The subject is one to which the saying <hi
                    rend="italic">Quot homines tot sententioe</hi> applies with almost literal
                    truth. Des Vignoles, in the preface to his <hi rend="italic">Chronology of
                    Sacred History,</hi> asserts that he collected upwards of two hundred different
                    calculations, the shortest of which reckons only 3483 years between the creation
                    of the world and the commencement of the vulgar era, and the longest 6984. The
                    difference amounts to thirty-five centuries. It suffices, therefore, to point
                    out that the so-called era of the creation of the world is a purely conventional
                    and arbitrary epoch; that, practically, it means the year 4004 B.c.,— this being
                    the date which, under the sanction of Archbishop Ussher’s opinion, has won its
                    way, among its hundreds of competitors, into most general acceptance. The reader

                    afterwards regarded as the beginning of the ecclesiastical or legal year. In
                    civil affairs, and in the regulation of the jubilees and sabbatical years, the
                    Jews still adhere to the ancient year, which begins with the month Tisri, about
                    the time of the autumnal equinox. (On the regulation of the J ewish year, see
                    vol. iv. p. 677.)</p>
                <p>After their dispersion, the Jews were constrained to have recourse to the
                    astronomical rules and cycles of the more enlightened heathen, in order that
                    their religious festivals might be observed on the same days in all the
                    countries through which they were scattered. For this purpose they adopted a
                    cycle of eighty-four years, which is mentioned by several of the ancient fathers
                    of the church, and which the early Christians borrowed from them for the
                    regùlation of Easter. This cycle seems to be neither more nor less than the
                    Calippic period of seventy-six years, with the addition of a Greek octaeteris,
                    in order to disguise its true source, and give it an appearance of originality.
                    In fact, the period of Calippus containing 27,759 days, and the octaeteris 2922
                    days (see vol. iv. p. 688), the sum, which is 30,681, is exactly the number of
                    days in eighty-four Julian years. But the addition was very far from being an
                    improvement on the work of Calippus; for instead of a difference of only five
                    hours and fifty-three minutes between the places of the sun and moon, which was
                    the whole error of the Calippic period, this difference, in the period of
                    eighty-four years, amounted to one day, six hours, and forty-one minutes.
                    Buccherius places the commencement of this cycle in the year 162 B.c.; Prideaux
                    in the year 291 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> According to the account of
                    Prideaux, the fifth cycle must have commenced in the year 46 of our era; and it
                    was in this year, according to St Prosperus, that the Christians began to employ
                    the Jewish cycle of eighty-four years, which they followed, though not
                    uniformly, for the regulation of Easter, till the time of the Council of
                    Nice.</p>
                <p>Soon after the Nicene council, the Jews, in imitation of the Christians,
                    abandoned the cycle of eighty-four years, and adopted that of Meton, by which
                    their lunisolar year is regulated at the present day. This improvement was first
                    proposed by Rabbi Samuel, rector of the Jewish school of Sora in Mesopotamia,
                    and was finally accomplished in the year 360 of our era by Rabbi Hillel, who
                    introduced that form of the year which the Jews at present follow, and which,
                    they say, is to endure till the coming of the Messiah.</p>
                <p>Till the 15th century the Jews usually followed the era of the Seleucidae or of
                    Contracts. Since that time they have generally employed a mundane era, and dated
                    from the creation of the world, which, according to their computation, took
                    place 3760 years and about three months before the commencement of our era. No
                    rule can be given for determining with certainty the day on which any given
                    Jewish year begins, without entering into the minutiae of their irregular and
                    complicated calendar. A table comprising twelve cycles of Jewish years will be
                    found at pp. 678, 679 of vol. iv.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of Constantinople.</hi></p>
                <p>This era, which is still used in the Greek Church, and was followed by the
                    Russians till the time of Peter the Great, dates from the creation of the world.
                    The Incarnation falls in the year 5509, and corresponds, as in our era, with the
                    fourth year of the 194th Olympiad. The civil year commences with the 1st of
                    September; the ecclesiastical year sometimes with the 21st of March, sometimes
                    with the 1st of April. It is not certain whether the year was considered at
                    Constantinople as beginning with September before the separation of the Eastern
                    and Western empires.</p>
                <p>At the commencement of our era there had elapsed 5508 years and four months of
                    the era of Constantinople. Hence the first eight months of the Christian year 1
                    coincide with the Constantinopo]itan year 5509, while the last four months
                    belong to the year 5510. In order, therefore, to find the year of Christ
                    corresponding to any given year in the era of Constantinople, we have the
                    following rule :— If the event took place between the 1st of January and the end
                    of August, subtract 5508 from the given year; but if it happened between the 1st
                    of September and the end of the year, subtract 5509.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of Alexandria.</hi></p>
                <p>The chronological computation of Julius Africanus was adopted by the Christians
                    of Alexandria, who accordingly reckoned 5500 years from the creation of Adam to
                    the birth of Christ. But in reducing Alexandrian dates to the common era, it
                    must be observed that Julius Africanus placed the epoch of the Incarnation three
                    years earlier than it is placed in the usual reckoning, so that the initial day
                    of the Christian era fell in the year 5503 of the Alexandrian era. This
                    correspondence, however, continued only from the introduction of the era till
                    the accession of Diocletian, when an alteration was made by dropping ten years
                    in the Alexandrian account. Diocletian ascended the imperial throne in the year
                    of Christ 284. According to the Alexandrian computation, this was the year 5787
                    of the world, and 287 of the Incarnation; but on this occasion ten years were
                    omitted, and that year was thenceforth called the year 5777 of the world, and
                    277 of the Incarnation. There are, consequently, two distinct eras of
                    Alexandria, the one being used before and the other after the accession of
                    Diocletian. It is not known for what reason the alteration was made; but it is
                    conjectured that it was for the purpose of causing a new revolution of the cycle
                    of nineteen years (which was introduced into the ecclesiastical computation
                    about this time by Anatolius, bishop of Hierapolis) to commence with the first
                    year of the reign of Diocletian. In fact, 5777 being divided by 19 leaves 1 for
                    the year of the cycle. The Alexandrian era continued to be followed by the Copts
                    in the 15th century, and is said to be still used in Abyssinia.</p>
                <p>Dates expressed according to this era are reduced to the common era by
                    subtracting 5502, up to the Alexandrian year 5786 inclusive, and after that year
                    by subtracting 5492; but if the date belongs to one of the four last months of
                    the Christian year, we must subtract 5503 till the year 5786, and 5493 after
                    that year.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mundane Era of Antioch.</hi></p>
                <p>The chronological reckoning of Julius Africanus formed also the basis of the era
                    of Antioch, which was adopted by the Christians of Syria, at the instance of
                    Panodorus, an Egyptian monk, who flourished about the beginning of the 4th
                    century. Panodorus struck off ten years from the account of Julius Africanus
                    with regard to the years of the world, and he placed the Incarnation three years
                    later, referring it to the fourth year of the 194th Olympiad, as in the common
                    era. Hence the era of Antioch differed from the original era of Alexandria by
                    ten years; but after the alteration of the latter at the accession of
                    Diocletian, the two eras coincided. In reckoning from the Incarnation, however,
                    there is a difference of seven years, that epoch being placed, in the reformed
                    era of Alexandria, seven years later than in the mundane era of Antioch or in
                    the Christian era.</p>
                <p>As the Syrian year began in autumn, the year of Christ corresponding to any year
                    in the mundane era of Antioch is found by subtracting 5492 or 5493 according as
                    the event falls between January and September or from September to January.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of Naboìiassar.</hi></p>
                <p>This era is famous in astronomy, having been generally followed by Hipparchus and
                    Ptolemy. It is believed to have been in use from the very time of its origin;
                    for the observations of eclipses which were collected in Chaldea by
                    Callisthenes, the general of Alexander, and transmitted by him to Aristotle,
                    were for the greater part referred to the commencement of the reign of
                    Nabonassar, founder of the kingdom of the Babylonians. It is the basis of the
                    famous Canon of Kings, also called Mathematical Canon, preserved to us in the
                    works of Ptolemy, which, before the recent astonishing discoveries at Nineveh,
                    was the sole authentic monument of Assyrian and Babylonian history known to us.
                    The epoch from which it is reckoned is precisely determined by numerous
                    celestial phenomena recorded by Ptolemy, and corresponds to Wednesday at
                    mid-day, the 26th of February of the year 747 before Christ. The year was in all
                    respects the same as the ancient Egyptian year. On account of the difference in
                    the length of the Julian and Babylonian years, the conversion of dates according
                    to the era of Nabonassar into years before Christ is attended with considerable
                    trouble. The surest way is to follow a comparative table. Frequently the year
                    cannot be fixed with, certainty, unless we know also the month and the day.</p>
                <p>The Greeks of Alexandria formerly employed the era of Nabonassar, with a year of
                    365 days; but soon after the reformation of the calendar by Julius Caesar, they
                    adopted, like other Roman provincials, the Julian intercalation. At this time
                    the first of Thoth had∙receded to the 29th of August. In the year 136 of our
                    era, the first of Thoth in the ancient Egyptian year corresponded with the 20th
                    of July, between which and the 29th of August there are forty days. The adoption
                    of the Julian year must therefore have taken place about 160 years before the
                    year 136 of our era (the difference between the Egyptian and Julian years being
                    one day in four years), that is to say, about the year 25 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> In fact, the first of Thoth corresponded with the 29th of August in

                    >b.c.</hi><hi rend="italic">Era of the Seleucidae, or Macedonian Era.</hi></p>
                <p>The era of the Seleucidae dates from the time of the occupation of Babylon by
                    Seleucus Nicator, 311 years before Christ, in the year of Rome 442, and twelve
                    years after the death of Alexander the Great. It was adopted not only in the
                    monarchy of the Seleucidae but in general in all the Greek countries bordering
                    on the Levant, was followed by the Jews till the 15th century, and is said to be
                    used by some Arabians even at the present day. By the Jews it was called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Era of Contracts,</hi> because the Syrian governors compelled them
                    to make use of it in civil contracts; the writers of the books of Maccabees call
                    it the <hi rend="italic">Era of Kings.</hi> But notwithstanding its general
                    prevalence in the East for many centuries, authors using it differ much with
                    regard to their manner of expressing dates, in consequence of the different
                    epochs adopted for the commencement of the year. Among the Syrian Greeks the
                    year began with the month Elul, which corresponds to our September. The
                    Nestorians and Jacobites at the present day suppose it to begin with the
                    following month, or October. The author of the first book of Maccabees makes the
                    era commence with the month Nisan, or April; and the author of the second book
                    with the first Tishrin, or October. Albategni, a celebrated Arabian astronomer,
                    dates from the 1st of October. Some of the Arabian writers, as Alfergani, date
                    from the 1st of September. At Tyre the year was counted from the 19th of our
                    October, at Gaza from the 28th of the same month, and at Damascus from the
                    vernal equinox. These discrepancies render it extremely difficult to determine
                    the exact correspondence of Macedonian dates with those of other eras; and the
                    difficulty is rendered still greater by the want of uniformity in respect of the
                    length of the year. Some authors who follow the Macedonian era, use the Egyptian

                <p>According to the computation most generally followed, the year 312 of the era of
                    the Seleucidae began on the 1st of September in the Julian year preceding the

                <p>Some of the Greek historians have assumed as a chronological epoch the death of
                    Alexander the Great, which took place in the year 325 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> The form of the year is the same as in the preceding era. This era
                    has not been much followed; but it requires to be noticed in order that it may
                    not be confounded with the era of the Seleucidae.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of Tyre.</hi></p>
                <p>The era of Tyre is reckoned from the 19th of October, or the beginning of the
                    Macedonian month Hyperberetaeus, in the year 126 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    In order·, therefore, to reduce it to the common era, subtract 125; and when the
                    date is <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> subtract it from 126. Dates expressed
                    according to this era occur only on a few medals, and in the acts of certain
                    councils.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Caesarcan Era of Antioch.</hi></p>
                <p>This era was established to commemorate the victory obtained by Julius Caesar on
                    the plains of Pharsalia, on the 9th of August in the year 48 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and the 706th of Rome. The Syrians computed it from
                    their month Tishrin I.; but the Greeks threw it back to the month Gorpiaeus of
                    the preceding year. Hence there is a difference of eleven months between the
                    epochs assumed by the Syrians and the Greeks. According to the computation of
                    the Greeks, the 49th year of the Caesarean era began in the autumn of the year
                    preceding the commencement of the Christian era; and, according to the Syrians,
                    the 49th year began in the autumn of the first year of the Incarnation. It is

                <p>The conquest of Spain by Augustus, which was com pleted in the thirty-ninth year
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> gave rise to this era, which began with the
                    first day of the following year, and was long used in Spain and Portugal, and
                    generally in all the Roman provinces subdued by the Visigoths, both in Africa
                    and the South of France. Several of the councils <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0729-0716"/> of Carthage, and also that of Arles, are dated
                    according to this era. After the 9th century it became usual to join with it in
                    public acts the year of the Incarnation. It was followed in Catalonia till the
                    year 1180, in the kingdom of Aragon till 1350, in Valencia till 1358, and in
                    Castile till 1382. In Portugal it is said to have been in use so late as the
                    year 1415, or 1422, though it would seem that after the establishment of the
                    Portuguese monarchy, no other era was used in the public acts of that country
                    than that of the incarnation. As the era of Spain commenced with the 1st of
                    January, and the months and days of the year are those of the Julian calendar,
                    any date is reduced to the common era by subtracting thirty-eight from the
                    number of the year.</p>

                    Era of Augustus.</hi></p>
                <p>This era was established to commemorate the battle of Actium, which was fought on
                    the 3d of September, in the year 31 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and in the
                    15th of the Julian era. By the Romans the era of Actium was considered as
                    commencing on the 1st of January of the 16th of the Julian era, which is the
                    30th <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The Egyptians, who used this era till the
                    time of Diocletian, dated its commencement from the beginning of their month
                    Thoth, or the 29th of August; and the Eastern Greeks from the 2d of September.
                    By the latter it was also called the era of Antioch, and it continued to be used
                    till the 9th century. It must not be confounded with the Caesarean era of
                    Antioch, which began seventeen years earlier. Many of the medals struck by the
                    city of Antioch in honour of Augustus are dated according to this era.</p>
                <p>Besides the era of Actium, there was also an Augustan era, which commenced four
                    years later, or 27 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the year in which Augustus
                    prevailed on the senate and people of Rome to decree him the title of Augustus,
                    and to confirm him in the supreme power of the empire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of Diocletian, or Era of Martyrs.</hi></p>
                <p>It has been already stated that the Alexandrians, at the accession of the Emperor
                    Diocletian, made an alteration in their mundane era, by striking off ten years
                    from their reckoning. At the same time they established a new era, which is
                    still followed by the Abyssinians and Copts. It commences with the 29th of
                    August (the first day of the Egyptian year) of the year 284 of our era, which
                    was the first of the reign of Diocletian. The denomination of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Era of Martyrs,</hi> subsequently given to it in commemoration of the
                    persecution of the Christians, would seem to imply that its commencement ought
                    to be referred to the year 303 of our era, for it was in that year that
                    Diocletian issued his famous edict; but the practice of dating from the
                    accession of Diocletian has prevailed. The ancient Egyptian year consisted of
                    365 days; but after the introduction of the Julian calendar, the astronomers of
                    Alexandria adopted an intercalary year, and added six additional days instead of
                    five to the end of the last month of every fourth year. The year thus became
                    exactly similar to the Julian year. The Egyptian intercalary year, however, does
                    not correspond to the Julian leap year, but is the year immediately preceding;
                    and the intercalation takes place at the end of the year, or on the 29th of
                    August. Hence the first three years of the Egyptian intercalary period commence
                    on the 29th of our August, and the fourth commences on the 30th of that month.
                    Before the end of that year the Julian intercalation takes place, and the
                    beginning of the following Egyptian year is restored to the 29th of August.
                    Hence to reduce a date according to this era to our own reckoning, it is
                    necessary, for common years, to add 283 years and 240 days; but if the date
                    belongs to the first three months of the year following the intercalation, or,
                    which is the same thing, if in the third year of the Julian cycle it falls
                    between the 30th of August and the end of the year, we must add 283 years and
                    241 days. The Ethiopians do not reckon the years from the beginning of the era
                    in a consecutive series, but employ a period of 532 years, after the expiration
                    of which they again begin with 1. This is the Dionysian or Great Paschal Period,
                    and is formed by the multiplication of the numbers 28 and 19, that is, of the
                    solar and lunar cycles, into each other.</p>
                <p>The following are the names of the Ethiopian or Abyssinian months, with the days
                    on which they begin in the Julian calendar, or old style;—</p>

                <p>The additional or epagomenal days begin on the 24th of August. In intercalary
                    years the first seven months commence one day later. The Egyptian months,
                    followed by the modern Copts, agree with the above in every respect excepting
                    the names.</p>

                <p>The cycle of Indiction, already explained at p. 670 of vol. iv., was very
                    generally followed in the Roman empire for some centuries before the adoption of
                    the Christian era. Three Indictions may be distinguished; but they differ only
                    in regard to the commencement of the year.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Constantinopolitan Indiction,</hi> like the Greek year,
                    commenced with the month of September. This was followed in the Eastern empire,
                    and in some instances also in France.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Imperial</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Constantinian
                    Indiction</hi> is so called because its establishment is attributed to
                    Constantine. This was also called the <hi rend="italic">Caesarean
                    Indixtion.</hi> It commences on the 24th of September. It is not unfrequently
                    met with in the ancient chronicles of France and England.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pontifical
                    Indiction</hi> began on the 25th of December or 1st of January, according as the
                    Christian year was held to commence on the one or other of these days. It is
                    often employed in papal bulls, especially after the time of Gregory VII., and
                    traces of its use are found in early French authors.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of the Armenians.</hi></p>
                <p>The epoch of the Armenian era is that of the Council of Tiben, in which the
                    Armenians consummated their schism from the Greek Church by condemning the acts
                    of the Council of Chalcedon; and it corresponds to Tuesday, the 9th of July of
                    the year 552 of the Incarnation. In their civil affairs the Armenians follow the
                    ancient vague year of the Egyptians; but their ecclesiastical year, which begins
                    on the 11th of August, is regulated in the same manner as the Julian year, every
                    fourth year consisting of 366 days, so that Easter and the other festivals are
                    retained at the same place in the seasons as well as in the civil year. The
                    Armenians also make use of the mundane era of Constantinople, and sometimes
                    conjoin both methods of computation in the same documents. In their
                    correspondence and transactions with Europeans, they generally follow the era of
                    the Incarnation, and adopt the Julian year.</p>
                <p>To reduce the civil dates of the Armenians to the Christian era, proceed as
                    follows. Since the epoch is the 9th of July, there were 176 days from the
                    beginning of the Armenian era to the end of the year 552 of our era; and since
                    552 was a leap year, the year 553 began a Julian intercalary period. Multiply,
                    therefore, the number of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n730/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0730-0717"/> Armenian years elapsed by 365; add the number of
                    days from the commencement of the current year to the given date; subtract 176
                    from the sum, and the remainder will be the number of days from the 1st of
                    January 553 to the given date. This number of days being reduced to Julian
                    years, add the result to 552, and the sum gives the day in the Julian year, or
                    old style.</p>
                <p>In the ecclesiastical reckoning the year begins on the 11th of August. To reduce
                    a date expressed in this reckoning to the Julian date, add 551 years, and the
                    days elapsed from the 1st of January to the 10th of August, both inclusive, of
                    the year 552,—that is to say (since 552 is a leap year), 223 days. In leap
                    years, one day must be subtracted if the date falls between the 1st of March and
                    10th of August.</p>

                <p>The era in use among the Turks, Arabs, and other Mahometan nations is that of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Hegira</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Hefra,</hi> the flight of the
                    prophet from Mecca to Medina, 622 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Its
                    commencement, however, does not, as is sometimes stated, coincide with the very
                    day of the flight, but precedes it by sixty-eight days. The prophet, after
                    leaving Mecca, to escape the pursuit of his enemies, the Koreishites, hid
                    himself with his friend Abubekr in a cave near Mecca, and there lay for three
                    days. The departure from the cave and setting out on the way to Medina is
                    assigned to the ninth day of the third month, Rabia I.—corresponding to the 22d
                    of September of the year 622 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The era begins from
                    the first day of the month of Moharram preceding the flight, or first day of
                    that Arabian year, which coincides with Friday, July 16, 622 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> It is necessary to remember that by astronomers and
                    by some historians the era is assigned to the preceding day, July 15. It is
                    stated by D’Herbelot that the era of the Hegira was instituted by Omar, the
                    second caliph, in imitation of the Christian era of the martyrs. (For details of
                    the Mahometan year, names and length of months, and for the method of reduction
                    of Mahometan dates to Christian, see vol. iv. pp. 679-681).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of Υezdegird, or Persian or Gelaloean Era.</hi></p>
                <p>This era commences with the elevation of Yezdegird III. to the throne of Persia,
                    on the 16th of June in the year of our era 632. Till the year 1079 the Persian
                    year resembled that of the ancient Egyptians, consisting of 365 days without
                    intercalation; but at that time the Persian calendar was reformed by
                    Gelal-ed-din Malek Shah, sultan of Khorasan, and a method of intercalation
                    adopted which, though less convenient, is considerably more accurate than the
                    Julian. The intercalary period is 33 years,—one day being added to the common
                    year seven times successively at the end of four years, and the eighth
                    intercalation being deferred till the end of the fifth year (see vol. iv. p,
                    667). This era was at one period universally adopted in Persia, and it still
                    continues to be followed by the Parsees of India. The months consist of thirty
                    days each, and each day is distinguished by a different name. According to
                    Alfergani, the names of the Persian months are as follows :—</p>

                <p>As it does not appear that the above-mentioned rule of intercalation was ever
                    regularly followed, it is impossible to assign exactly the days on which the
                    different years begin. In some provinces of India the Parsees begin the year
                    with September, in others they begin it with October. We have stated that the
                    era began with the 16th June 632. But the vague year, which was followed till
                    1079, anticipated the Julian year by one day every four years. In 447 years the
                    anticipation would amount to about 112 days, and the beginning of the year would
                    in consequence be thrown back to near the beginning of the Juhan year 632. To
                    the year of the Persian era, therefore, add 631, and the sum will be the year of
                    our era in which the Persian year begins.</p>

                <p>From the time of the Emperor Yaou, upwards of 2000 years <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> the Chinese had two different years,—a civil year, which was
                    regulated by the moon, and an astronomical year, which was solar. The civil year
                    consisted in general of twelve months or lunations, but occasionally a
                    thirteenth was added, in order to preserve its correspondence with the solar
                    year. Even at that early period the solar or astronomical year consisted of 365½
                    days, like our Julian year; and it was arranged in the same manner, a day being
                    intercalated every fourth year.</p>
                <p>According to the missionary Gaubil, the Chinese divided the day into 100 <hi

                    minute into 100 seconds. This practice continued to prevail till the 17th
                    century, when, at the instance of the Jesuit Schall, president of the tribunal
                    of mathematics, they adopted the European method of dividing the day into
                    twenty-four hours, each hour into sixty minutes, and each minute into sixty
                    seconds. The civil day commences at midnight and ends at the midnight
                    following.</p>

                    >b.c.,</hi> the civil year of the Chinese has begun with the first day of that
                    moon in the course of which the sun enters into the sign of the zodiac which
                    corresponds with our sign Pisces. From the same period also, they have employed,
                    in the adjustment of their solar and lunar years, a period of nineteen years,
                    twelve of which are common, containing twelve lunations each, and the remaining
                    seven intercalary, containing thirteen lunations. It is not, how ever, precisely
                    known how they distributed their months of thirty and twenty-nine days, or, as
                    they termed them, great and small moons, This, with other matters appertaining
                    to the calendar, was probably left to be regulated from time to time by the
                    mathematical tribunal.</p>
                <p>The Chinese divide the time of a complete revolution of the sun with regard to
                    the solstitial points into twelve equal portions, each corresponding to thirty
                    days, ten hours, thirty minutes. Each of these periods, which is denominated a
                    <hi rend="italic">tsëĕ,</hi> is subdivided into two equal portions called <hi
                    rend="italic">chung-ki</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tsie-ki,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">chung-ki</hi> denoting the first half of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tsëĕ,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">tsie-ki</hi> the latter half. Though the
                    <hi rend="italic">tsëĕ</hi> are thus strictly portions of solar time, yet, what
                    is remarkable, though not peculiar to China, they give their name to the lunar
                    months, each month or lunation having the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n731/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0731-0718"/> name of the <hi rend="italic">chung-ki</hi> or
                    sign at which the sun arrives during that month. As the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tdèë</hi> is longer than a synodic revolution of the moon, the sun cannot
                    arrive twice at a <hi rend="italic">clιuιιg-ki</hi> during the same lunation;
                    and as there are only twelve <hi rend="italic">teeĕ,</hi> the year can contain
                    only twelve months having different names. It must happen sometimes that in the
                    course of a lunation the sun enters into no new sign; in this case the month is
                    intercalary, and is called by the same name as the preceding month.</p>
                <p>For chronological purposes, the Chinese, in common with some other nations of the
                    east of Asia, employ cycles of sixty, by means of which they reckon their days,
                    moons, and years. The days are distributed in the calendar into cycles of sixty,
                    in the same manner as ours are distributed into weeks, or cycles of seven. Each
                    day of the cycle has a particular name, and as it is a usual practice, in
                    mentioning dates, to give the name of the day along with that of the moon and
                    the year, this arrangement affords great facilities in verifying the epochs of
                    Chinese chronology. The order of the days in the cycle is never interrupted by
                    any intercalation that may be necessary for adjusting the months or years. The
                    moons of the civil year are also distinguished by their place in the cycle of
                    sixty; and as the intercalary moons are not reckoned, for the reason before
                    stated, namely, that during one of these lunations the sun enters into no new
                    sign, there are only twelve regular moons in a year, so that the cycle is
                    renewed every five years. Thus the first moon of the year 1873 being the first
                    of a new cycle, the first moon of every sixth year, reckoned backwards or
                    forwards from that date, as 1868, 1863, &lt;fcc., or 1877, 1882, &amp;c., will
                    also commence a new lunar cycle of sixty moons. In regard to the years, the
                    arrangement is exactly the same. Each has a distinct number or name which marks
                    its place in the cycle, and as this is generally given in referring to dates,
                    along with the other chronological characters of the year, the ambiguity which
                    arises from following a fluctuating or uncertain epoch is entirely obviated. The
                    present cycle began in the year 1864 of our era; the year 1876 is consequently
                    the 13th of the current cycle.</p>
                <p>The cycle of sixty is formed of two subordinate cycles or series of characters
                    one of ten and the other of twelve, which are joined together so as to afford
                    sixty different combinations. The names of the characters in the cycle of ten,
                    which are called <hi rend="italic">celestial</hi> signs, are—</p>
                <p>1. Keă; 2. Yïh; 3. Ping; 4. Ting; 5. Woo;</p>
                <p>6. Ke; 7. Kăng; 8. Sin; 9. Jin; 10. Kwei; and in the series of 12, denominated
                    <hi rend="italic">terrestrial</hi> signs,</p>
                <p>1. Tsze; 2. Chow; 3. Yin; 4. Maou; 5. Shin; 6. Sze; 7. Woo; 8. We; 9. Shin; 10.
                    Yew; 11. Seŭh; 12. Hae. The name of the first year, or of the first day, in the
                    sexagenary cycle is formed by combining the first words in each of the above
                    series; the second is formed by combining the second of each series, and so on
                    to the tenth. For the next year the first word of the first series is combined
                    with the eleventh of the second, then the second of the first series with the
                    twelfth of the second, after this the third of the first series with the first
                    of the second, and so on till the sixtieth combination, when the last of the
                    first series concurs with the last of the second. Thus Keă-tsze is the name of
                    the first year, Yĭh-Chow that of the second, Keă-seuh that of the eleventh,
                    Yïh-hae that of the twelfth, Ping-tsze that of the thirteenth, and so on. The
                    order of proceeding is obvious.</p>
                <p>In the Chinese history translated into the Tatar dialect by order of the emperor
                    Kang-he. who died in 1721, the characters of the cycle begin to appear at the
                    year 2357 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> From this it has been inferred that the
                    Chinese empire was established previous to that epoch; but it is obviously so
                    easy to extend the cycles backwards indefinitely, that the inference can have
                    very little weight. The characters given to that year 2357 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> are Keă-shin, which denote the 41st of the cycle. We must, therefore,
                    suppose the cycle to have begun 2397 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> or forty
                    years before the reign of Yaou. This is the epoch assumed by the authors of <hi
                    rend="italic">E Art de Verifier les Dates.</hi> The mathematical tribunal has,
                    however, from time immemorial counted the first year of the first cycle from the
                    eighty-first of Yaou, that is to say, from the year 2277 B.c.</p>
                <p>Since the year 163 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Chinese writers have
                    adopted the practice of dating the year from the accession of the reigning
                    emperor. An emperor, on succeeding to the throne, gives a name to the years of
                    his reign. He ordains, for example, that they shall be called Ta-te. In
                    consequence of this edict, the following year is called the first of Ta-te, and
                    the succeeding years the second, third, fourth, &amp;c., of Ta-te, and so on,
                    till· it pleases the same emperor or his successor to ordain that the years
                    shall be called by some other appellation. The periods thus formed are called by
                    the Chinese Nien-hao. According to this method of dating the years a new era
                    commences with every reign; and the year corresponding to a Chinese date can
                    only be found when we have before us a catalogue of the Nien-hao, with their
                    relation to the years of our era.</p>
                <p>The Chinese chronology is discussed with ample detail by Freret, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs of the Academy of Inscriptions,</hi> tom. xviii.; and an
                    abridgment of his memoir is given in <hi rend="italic">EArt de Verifier les
                    Dates</hi> (tom. ii. p. 284, <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >seq.</hi>; ed. in 4to, 1818), from which the preceding account is principally
                    taken.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Indian Chronology.</hi></p>
                <p>The method of dividing and reckoning time followed by the various nations of
                    India resembles in its genera] features that of the Chinese, but is rendered
                    still more complex by the intermixture of Mahometan with Hindu customs. Like the
                    Chinese, the Hindus have a solar year, which is generally followed in the
                    transaction of public business, especially since the introduction of European
                    power; and they have also a lunar year, which regulates their religious
                    festivals, and which they follow in their domestic arrangements. Their solar
                    year, or rather sidereal year, is measured by the time in which the sun returns
                    to the same star, and is consequently longer than our astronomical year, by the
                    whole quantity of the precession of the equinoxes. It is reckoned by the Hindus
                    at 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, 30 seconds, and consequently exceeds a
                    Gregorian year by one day in sixty years. The Indian zodiac is divided into
                    twelve solar and twenty-eight lunar signs; and the year begins with the sun’s
                    arrival at the first degree of the first sign. The month is the time the sun
                    takes to pass through one sign; and as each sign contains the same number of
                    degrees, the months vary somewhat in length, according as the sun is nearer the
                    apogee or the perigee. The longest month may contain 31 days, 14 hours, 39
                    minutes, and the shortest only 29 days. 8 hours, 21 minutes. The civil months,
                    however, depend solely ou the moon; though, with the same perversion of
                    ingenuity which we have already remarked with regard to the Chinese, and of
                    which it would be difficult to find an example except in the east of Asia, they
                    derive their names from the solar signs of the zodiac. The first civil month
                    commences with the day after the full moon of that lunation in the course of
                    which the sun enters the first Hindu sign, and so on with the others. When the
                    sun enters into no new sign during the course of alunation, the month is
                    intercalary, and is called by the name of that which precedes or follows it,
                    which some prefix to distinguish it from the regular month. In some provinces of
                    India, as in Bengal, the civil month commences with the day after the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n732/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0732-0719"/> new moon; but in the upper or northern provinces,
                    it begins, as we have stated, with the day after the full moon. From the manner
                    in which they are reckoned, it is evident that the Hindu months, both solar and
                    lunar, neither consist of an entire number of days, nor are regulated by any
                    cycle, but depend solely on the motion of the sun and moon. The time of their
                    commencement is different on every different meridian; and a Hindu has no means
                    of knowing beforehand on what day any month begins, excepting by consulting his
                    almanac. The civil day in all parts of India begins at sunrise.</p>
                <p>The Hindu eras have been the subject of much controversy. According to the dreams
                    of Indian mythology, the duration of the world is limited to four <hi
                    rend="italic">yugs</hi> or ages, three of which have already passed, and the
                    fourth, which is the <hi rend="italic">kalv-yug,</hi> is the last and most
                    deteriorated. It is this only which has any reference to authentic chronology.
                    It forms the principal era of India, and comprehends several others in common
                    use, as the era of Vicramaditya, the era of Salivahana, the Bengalee era, and
                    the cycle of sixty years.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Kalτ-yug</hi> commenced in the year 3101 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The year is sidereal, and begins when the sun enters
                    the first sign of the Hindu zodiac, which at present happens about the 11 th of
                    April. Owing to the precession of the equinoxes the beginning of the year
                    advances in the seasons at the rate of about one day in sixty years.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Era of Vicramaditya</hi> is reckoned from the year 57 B.c.,
                    which corresponds to 3044: of the Kali∙yug. This era, the years of which are
                    called <hi rend="italic">Samvai,</hi> prevails chiefly in the higher or northern
                    provinces of India, and in Guzerat. Its name is derived from that of a sovereign
                    of* Malwa, who, by defeating Saka, king of Delhi, acquired possession of the
                    principal throne of India. Whether the year from which it is reckoned was that
                    of the accession or death of this prince is uncertain. The years are reckoned in
                    the same manner as those of the Kali-yug; and it may be remarked of the Indian
                    eras in general that, though some of them profess to be counted from the deaths
                    of their kings, or other historical events, they all commence at the time the
                    sun reaches the same point in his annual course through the zodiac.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Era of Salivahana</hi> is the year 78 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> which corresponds to 3179 of the Kali-yug, and 135 of the
                    Vicramaditya. The name is derived from Salivahan, who is said to have reigned
                    many years over the kingdom of Narsinga, and to have been a liberal encourager
                    cf the arts and sciences. It is generally used in records or writings of
                    importance, but is most prevalent in the southern provinces of Hindustan. The
                    years are called <hi rend="italic">Saka.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Fuslee Era,</hi> from the near coincidence of its dates
                    with those of the Hegira, seems to have been imposed on the natives of India by
                    their Mahometan conquerors. It is principally used in revenue transactions, and
                    is pretty generally known over India. There are several eras of this name; but
                    the most common is that which is reckoned from the year 590 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> At Madras the commencement of the Fuslee year is fixed on the 12th of
                    July. In Bengal it begins in September, or with the full moon preceding the
                    autumnal equinox.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bengalee Era</hi> is also supposed to be derived from the
                    Hegira; but the year is measured by solar time, and therefore differs entirely
                    from the Mahometan year, which is purely lunar. At the present time the Bengalee
                    epoch is about nine years later than the Hegira,—the year 1245 of the Hegira
                    having commenced in July 1829, and the Bengalee year 1236 in April 1829. The
                    sidereal year exceeds the lunar year by 10 days 21 ½ hours nearly; consequently,
                    by reckoning backwards, it will be found that the dates of the Bengalee era and
                    of the Hegira coincided about the middle of the 16th century. History is silent
                    on the subject; but it seems probable, that though the epoch of the Hegira was
                    partially adopted in India, the Hindus pertinaciously resisted all attempts to
                    disturb their ancient methods of reckoning the subdivisions of the year.</p>
                <p>Besides the Indian eras here enumerated, there are some others which are less
                    generally known, or which are followed only in particular provinces. The cycle
                    of sixty years is also sometimes used, particularly in connection with the era
                    of Vicramaditya. According to the Bengal account, the first cycle began 3185
                    years <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi> and the year 1876 of our era is
                    consequently the twenty-first of the eighty-fifth cycle. In the Telinga account
                    the first cycle began 3114 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi> and the year 1876 is
                    the tenth of the eighty-fourth cycle.</p>

                    only extant in their entirety) of universal history compiled (about 8 <hi

                <p>Chronological tables, however unattractive to minds whose inclinations or
                    occupations do not lie in the direction of them, are of much value and real
                    interest for those who have knowledge and occasion to make a right use of them.
                    To the historical student they not only serve as a storehouse of individual
                    facts with dates, but by the orderly juxtaposition and sequence of these they
                    indicate relations. They are maps on which are delineated or suggested the lines
                    of the main currents in the ocean of human history. When the student, engaged on
                    any special series of events, desires to find their place and surroundings in
                    world-history, he has but to turn to such tables, and a glance or two will
                    inform him.</p>
                <p>In the preparation of the subjoined table great pains have been taken to bring it
                    as closely as possible into agreement with the results of recent historical and
                    chronological determinations. -Events and dates of purely legendary character,
                    once accepted as historical facts with unquestioning acquiescence, have no place
                    in it; and the whole has been subjected to a searching examination and
                    comparison with the best sources of information. The conflict of the authorities
                    makes absolute certainty in many cases unattainable. The reader will therefore
                    remember in using the table, that, as differences and authorities cannot be
                    given, the dates are necessarily in some cases approximate or probable only.</p>
