                    this he has become the greatest and the most national exponent of Slavonic or
                    more especially Polish nationality in music. In looking through the list of his
                    compositions, teeming with mazurkas, valses, polonaises, and other forms of
                    national dance music, one could hardly suppose that here one of the most
                    melancholy natures has revealed itself. This seeming paradox is solved by the
                    type of Chopin’s nationality, a nationality of which it has justly been said
                    that its very dances are sadness intensified. But notwithstanding this strongly
                    pronounced national type of his compositions, his music is always expressive of
                    his individual feelings and sufferings to a degree rarely met with in the annals
                    of the art. He is indeed the lyrical composer <hi rend="italic">par
                    excellence</hi> of the modern school, and the intensity of his expression finds
                    its equal in literature only in the songs of Heinrich Heine, to whom Chopin has
                    been justly compared. A sensation of such high-strung passion cannot be
                    prolonged. Hence we see that the shorter forms of music, the étude, the
                    nocturne, besides the national dances already alluded to, are chosen by Chopin
                    in preference. Even where he treats the larger forms of the concerto or the
                    sonata, this concentrated not to say pointed character of Chopin’s style becomes
                    obvious. The more extended dimensions seem to encumber the freedom of his
                    movements. The concerto for pianoforte with accompaniment of the orchestra in E
                    may be instanced. Here the adagio takes the form of a romance, and in the final
                    rondo the rhythm of a Polish dance be comes recognizable while the
                    instrumentation throughout is meagre and wanting in colour. Chopin is out of his
                    element, and even the beauty of his melodies and harmonies cannot <pb break="no"

                    Fortunately he himself knew the limits of his power, and with very few
                    exceptions his works belong to that class of minor compositions of which he was
                    an unrivalled master. Barring a collection of Polish songs, two concertos, and a
                    very small number of concerted pieces of chamber music, almost all his works are
                    written for the pianoforte solo; the symphony, the oratorio, the opera he never
                    attempted.</p>
                <p>The outer life of Chopin was exceedingly simple and almost totally wanting in
                    incident of any kind. His first musical education he received from a Polish
                    musician of the name of Ziwna, who is said to have been a passionate admirer of
                    J. S. Bach. He also received a good general education at one of the first
                    colleges of Warsaw, where he was supported by the liberality of Prince Antoine
                    Radziwill, a generous protector of artistic talent and himself well known as the
                    composer of music to Goethe’s <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> and other works. His
                    musical genius opened to Chopin the best circles of Polish society, a society at
                    that time unrivalled in Europe for its ease of intercourse, the beauty and grace
                    of its women, and its liberal appreciation of artistic gifts. These early
                    impressions of refined life were of lasting influence on Chopin’s development
                    both as a man and as an artist. He never was and never wished to be a popular
                    composer; his works are full of the subtlest touches of sentiment, they breathe
                    indeed the perfume of the <hi rend="italic">salon,</hi> and it is the sign of
                    highest power in Chopin that his artistic nature could live in, and even derive
                    new vitality from this -dangerous atmosphere. While at college he received
                    thorough instruction in the theory of his art from Joseph Elsner, a learned
                    musician and director of the conservatoire at Warsaw. When in 1829 he left his
                    native town for Vienna, where his <hi rend="italic">debut</hi> as a pianist took
                    place, he was in all respects a perfectly formed and developed artist. This
                    feature again is characteristic of Chopin’s work. There is in his compositions
                    little of that gradual progress which, for instance, in Beethoven necessitates a
                    classification of his works according to different periods. Chopin’s
                    individuality and his style were distinctly-pronounced in that first <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Giovanni Fantasia</hi> which excited the wondering enthusiasm
                    of Robert Schumann. The same mine of sentiment he worked ever after, but it was
                    one of unbounded wealth. His first appearance in public seems to have been
                    marked by considerable success. A correspondent of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung,</hi> at that time the first organ of music in
                    Germany, writing from Vienna, November 1829, says that “Μ. Chopin has placed
                    himself in the first rank of pianists,” and goes on to speak in enthusiastic
                    terms of “his delicacy of touch, his rare mechanical dexterity, the melancholy
                    tints of his <hi rend="italic">nuances,</hi> and the splendid clearness of his
                    phrasing.” In 1831 he left Vienna with the intention of visiting London; but on
                    his way to England he reached Paris and settled there for the rest of his life.
                    Here again he soon became the favourite and musical hero of society. His
                    connection with Madame Dudevant, better known by her literary pseudonym of
                    George Sand, is an important feature of Chopin’s life. When in 1837 his health
                    began to fail, George Sand went with him to Majorca, and it was mainly owing to
                    her tender care that the composer recovered his health for a time. The last ten
                    years of his life were a continual struggle with the pulmonary disease to which
                    he succumbed October 17,1849. The year before his death he visited England,
                    where he was received with enthusiasm by his numerous admirers. A distinguished
                    English amateur thus records his impressions of Chopin’s style of
                    pianoforteplaying compared with those of other masters. “His technical
                    characteristics may be broadly indicated as negation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >bravura,</hi> absolute perfection of finger-play, and of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >legatissimo</hi> touch, on which no other pianist has ever so entirely leant,
                    to the exclusion of that high relief and point which the modern German school,
                    after the examples of Liszt and Thalberg, has so effectively developed. It is in
                    these features that we must recognize that <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grundverschiedenheit</hi> (fundamental difference) which according to
                    Mendelssohn distinguished Chopin’s playing from that of these masters, and in no
                    less degree from the example and teaching of Moscheles Imagine a delicate man of
                    extreme refinement of mien and manner, sitting at the piano and playing with no
                    sway of the body and scarcely any movement of the arms, depending entirely upon
                    his narrow feminine hands and slender fingers. The wide arpeggios in the left
                    hand, maintained in a continuous stream of tone by the strict legato and fine
                    and constant use of the damper-pedal, formed an harmonious substructure for a
                    wonderfully poetic cantabile. His delicate pianissimo, the ever-changing
                    modifications of tone and time (tempo rubato) were of indescribable effect. Even
                    in energetic passages he scarcely ever exceeded an ordinary mezzoforte. His
                    playing as a whole was unique in its kind, and no traditions of it can remain,
                    for there is no school of Chopin the pianist, for the obvious reason that he
                    could never be regarded as a public player, and his best pupils were nearly all
                    amateurs.”</p>
                <p>A detailed analysis of Chopin’s single works would be impossible. The following
                    is a list of the most important of his compositions :— Two concertos for
                    pianoforte, with orchestra, in E minor (Op. 11) and F minor (Op. 21)
                    respectively; trio for pianoforte and strings, in G minor (Op. 8); three sonatas
                    for pianoforte solo (Op. <hi rend="italic">4,</hi> 35, 58); one for pianoforte
                    and violoncello (Op. 65), G minor; fifty-two mazurkas, contained in the
                    collections numbered Op. 6, 7, 17, <hi rend="italic">24,</hi> 30, 33, 41, 50,
                    56, 59, 63, 67, 68 (Nos. 50-52 without number of Op.); études (Op. 10, 25);
                    nocturnes (Op. 9, 15, 27, 32, 37, 48, 55, 62, 72); preludes (Op. 28, 45);
                    polonaises (Op. 3, 22, 26, 40, 44 53, 61, 71); valses (Op. 18, 34, 42, 64, 69,
                    70); besides numerous variations, impromptus, and other miscellaneous
                    compositions, also settings of seventeen Polish national songs for one voice,
                    with pianoforte accompaniment. Franz Liszt has written a charming sketch of
                    Chopin’s life and art <hi rend="italic">(F. Chopin,</hi> par F. Liszt, Paris,
                    1851), and a very appreciative though somewhat eccentric analysis of his work
                    appeared anonymously in 1842 <hi rend="italic">(An Essay on the JForks of
                    Frederic Chopin,</hi> London). A complete and excellent collection of Chopin’s
                    pianoforte works in 6 vols, has been edited by K. Klindworth. (F. H.)</p>
