                <p><label type="entry">CHATHAM ISLANDS</label>, a group in the Pacific, 560 miles
                    east of New Zealand, lying between 43° 40' and 45° 20' S. lat., and between 176°
                    10' and 177° 20' W. long. It consists of three islands, a large one called
                    Wari-Kauri, or Chatham Island, a smaller one, Rangi-Haute, or Pitt’s Island, and
                    a third, Rangatira, or South-east Island. There are also several small rocky
                    islets. Chatham Island, according to Dieffenbach, contains an area of 305,280
                    acres; of which, however, 57,600 acres are lakes and lagoons. In the centre is a
                    large brackish lake called Tewanga, about 25 miles long and 6 or 7 broad, which
                    at the southern end is separated from the sea by a sandbank only 150 yards wide,
                    which it occasionally bursts through. The southern part of the island has an
                    undulating surface, and is covered either with an open forest or with high
                    ferns. In general the soil is extremely fertile, and where it is naturally
                    drained, a rich vegetation of fern and flax <hi rend="italic">(Phormium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tenax)</hi> has sprung up, giving firmness to the soil and
                    yielding a rich harvest to the planter. On the north-west are three or four
                    conical hills of basalt, which are surrounded by oases of fertile soil. On the
                    western side is Petre Bay, 40 miles across, on which, at the mouth of the River
                    Mangatu, is Waitangi, the principal settlement. The country to the east of the
                    great lagoon is quite flat, and is scarcely 50 feet above the sea-level. The
                    climate is very mild, in winter varying only from 45° to 60°. The changes of
                    temperature are less sudden than in New Zealand. The inhabitants cultivate
                    potatoes, turnips, cabbages, taro (esculent arum), tobacco, and pumpkins. The
                    trees and shrubs resemble those of New Zealand, but the former are of very small
                    size. Horses and cattle are bred in considerable numbers for the New Zealand
                    market. Birds of many kinds, chiefly ducks, snipes, plovers, curlews, redbills,
                    sandlarks, and parroquets, abound. Fish are plentiful on the coast, and whaling
                    is actively prosecuted all round the group. Pitt’s Island is about 12 miles long
                    and 8 broad; it has no harbour. These islands were discovered in 1791 by
                    Lieutenant Broughton, who gave them the name of Chatham from the brig which he
                    commanded. The natives, who are known as Morions or Maiorioris, were conquered
                    in 1832-33 by the Maoris of New Zealand, who killed great numbers of them, and
                    in 1839 half of those left died of an epidemic of influenza. Their numbers have
                    been reduced from 1500 to 140, and they are now a feeble and degenerate race.
                    The geology and the flora and fauna of the islands indicate their physical
                    connection with New Zealand, to which politically they belong.</p>
