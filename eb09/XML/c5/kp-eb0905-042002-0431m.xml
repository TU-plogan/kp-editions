                <p><label type="entry">CHARLES XII</label>., king of Sweden, was born at Stockholm
                    on June 27, 1682. He received an excellent education, and was able to speak
                    German, French, and Latin fluently. In the spring of 1697 his father, Charles
                    XL, died, and the prince, then only in his fifteenth year, was declared of age
                    by the States-General and invested with the royal authority. As might have been
                    expected, the boy-king showed himself but little disposed for state affairs. His
                    time was divided between study and amusement <hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">now</hi> he was poring over the exploits of Alexander in the pages
                    of Quintus Curtius, now spending whole hours in gymnastic exercises, or joining
                    a hunting party in the pursuit of the bear; and thus he was rapidly developing
                    the iron strength of constitution which he displayed in his subsequent
                    campaigns. At this juncture Frederick IV., king of Denmark, conceived the idea
                    of wresting the crown from the young king, and adding Sweden to his possessions
                    in the Scandinavian peninsula, and Augustus II., king of Poland and elector of
                    Saxony, and the czar, Peter the Great, agreed to second his enterprize by
                    seizing the continental provinces of Sweden. The Danes struck the first blow by
                    invading the territories of Holstein Gottorp, and the duke, who had married the
                    sister of Charles, fled to Stockholm and begged for assistance to recover his
                    states. Charles proposed immediate operations against Denmark, confident in his
                    own prowess and in promises of substantial aid received from the court of St
                    James’s, for William of Orange saw in Sweden a valuable ally for his Continental
                    policy, and was resolved not to allow the balance of power in the north to be
                    destroyed by the triple alliance. Sir George Rooke, with an Anglo-Dutch
                    squadron, formed a junction with the Swedish fleet, and at the head of
                    fifty-four sail of the line swept the Baltic, drove the Danish fleet into
                    Copenhagen, and bombarded the city, doing, however, little damage. Meanwhile
                    Charles had landed in Zealand with a Swedish army, leading his troops to the
                    shore in person, and wading through the water up to his chin in his eagerness to
                    land. The Danes, inferior in numbers, retired before him, and Frederick seeing
                    his capital threatened with a siege by land and sea, abandoned the triple
                    alliance,, and sued for peace, leaving Charles free to turn his arms against
                    Russia and Poland.</p>
                <p>From this campaign we may date Charles’s assumption of those Spartan manners
                    which distinguished him for the rest of his life. He gave up the use of wine; at
                    night he slept upon his cloak spread upon the floor of his room or on the ground
                    in the open air. His dress was of the plainest, his whole wardrobe consisting of
                    a suit of blue cloth with copper buttons. He seemed to care for no pleasure or
                    amusement; he had an amount of endurance which defied fatigue, and he was alike
                    insensible to the heat of summer and the almost arctic cold of a northern
                    winter. Hardy, brave to the extent of recklessness, capable of inspiring in his
                    followers personal devotion to himself, and with all that astute and sagacious
                    in council, he was the very model of a soldier king. Yet in the end Sweden
                    reaped no advantage even from his victories. He had left Stockholm to defend the
                    country from a pressing danger, but once he had tasted the pleasures of military
                    success, he allowed himself to be allured onward to a career of conquest, and he
                    never saw his capital again.</p>
                <p>When Frederick sued for peace, Peter the Great was threatening Narva and the
                    Swedish province of Livonia on the Gulf of Finland, while Augustus IL, elector
                    of Saxony and king of Poland, was besieging Riga, then a Swedish town. Charles
                    disembarked in Livonia with 20,000 men. The Russian army, said to have been
                    50,000 strong, lay before Narva in an entrenched camp. With 10,000 of the
                    splendidly disciplined infantry of Sweden, Charles attacked them there on
                    November 30, 1700. In a quarter of an hour the camp was stormed, and the Russian
                    army, which must have been largely composed of raw troops, was completely routed
                    and dispersed. Turning southward, Charles marched against the Saxons and Poles,
                    defeated them on the banks of the Dwina, and raised the siege of Riga. He might
                    now have dictated a peace which would have given Sweden an undisputed
                    pre-eminence in Northern Europe. But his ambition was aroused; Augustus was by
                    no means a popular king, and while continuing the war against him, Charles
                    intrigued with the party adverse to him in Poland. The Saxon army of Augustus
                    was defeated in the battle of Clissow (1703), and Poland was occupied by the
                    victorious Swedes. Radziejowski. the cardinal primate, declared the throne
                    vacant, and under the influence of Charles, the diet conferred the crown upon
                    his friend Stanislas Leszczynski, the young palatine of Posnania. But even now
                    Charles would not sheath the sword. He carried the war into Saxony, overran the
                    hereditary states of Augustus, and in 1706 dictated to him the peace of
                    Altranstadt, by which Augustus resigned all claim to the throne of Poland, and
                    further agreed to give up to the conqueroι ’ John Reginald Patkul, the
                    ambassador of the czar at Dresden. Patkul was by birth a Livonian, and therefore
                    a subject of Sweden, but he had transferred his allegiance to Russia, and it was
                    said that he was the real author of the league between Russia, Poland, and
                    Denmark. It was very doubtful if he could have been adjudged guilty of treason,
                    and in any case his position as ambassador ought to have protected him; but
                    Charles thought only of vengeance, and after the form of a trial had been gone
                    through, Patkul was condemned to be broken on the wheel, and the cruel sentence
                    was executed, the king refusing to mitigate it in the least degree. The whole
                    affair has left an indelible blot upon his memory, and it shows how much of
                    vindictive passion was concealed under a perfectly impassive exterior. Even had
                    Charles been willing now to bring the war to a close, the execution of his
                    ambassador would not have allowed the czar to accept a peace. Twice he invaded
                    Poland, but each <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n432/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0432-0421"/> time he had to retire before the Swedes. By the
                    autumn of 1707 Charles had collected 43,000 men in Saxony; a reserve of 20,000
                    under General Levenhaupt was in Poland, and a third army, 15,000 strong, was
                    upon the frontier of Finland. In the following January, in the midst of the ice
                    and snow, he suddenly broke up his camp, marched against the Russians, surprised
                    and almost captured the czar at Grodno, and then continued his advance, driving
                    the Russians before him, and defeating them in numerous encounters. He had
                    forced the Beresina and won a battle near Smolensko, and the way to Moscow lay
                    almost open before him, when, to the surprise of his army, he turned southward
                    to the district of the Ukraine, The fact was that he had a secret treaty of
                    alliance with the hetmann of the Cossacks of the Ukraine, Mazeppa, whose
                    romantic story has been made so famous by the verse of Byron. The hetmann had
                    promised to join the Swedes with 30,000 Cossacks and abundant supplies. But
                    when, after a difficult march, Charles reached the Ukraine, he found that the
                    Russians had discovered and frustrated Mazeppa’s design, and the hetmann brought
                    him only a handful of followers. Nor was this his only disappointment. A
                    reinforcement of 15,000 men under Levenhaupt was intercepted and cut to pieces
                    by the czar, and after wasting the summer in a desultory warfare, the Swedes
                    found themselves overtaken by the severe winter of 1708-1709 in the midst of an
                    enemy’s country. Still Charles would not abandon the idea of reaching Moscow.
                    Though his army was reduced by cold and privations to 23,000 men, he maintained
                    himself till spring, and then besieged the fortress of Pultowa. The place held
                    out until July, when the czar approached at the head of a large army. On the 7th
                    Charles was wounded in reconnoitring the enemy. In the famous battle which took
                    place next day he had to be carried in a litter amongst his staff. The battle
                    ended in the complete defeat of the Swedes. Charles, leaving most of his
                    officers prisoners in the hands of the enemy, fled with a few attendants across
                    the Bug into theTurkish territories, and was hospitably received by the Turks at
                    Bender on the Dniester.</p>
                <p>Charles resided three years in Turkey, during all which time his expenses, and
                    those of his numerous household, were paid by the Turkish Government, in
                    accordance with a very liberal interpretation of the Eastern law of hospitality.
                    From the day of his arrival at Bender his constant aim was to involve Russia and
                    Turkey in war. He succeeded in producing an outbreak of hostilities; the Turks
                    outmanoeuvred and surrounded Peter and his army on the banks of the Pruth, and·
                    the czar would have been either killed or taken had not his wife Catherine, by
                    her energy and courage, obtained an armistice for him on favourable terms from
                    the grand vizier. Removing his residence to Vranitza, where his followers formed
                    a little camp around the strongly-built house in which he lived, Charles
                    continued his intrigues to produce another war with Russia, and though once on
                    the point of success, he eventually failed, and the counter-intrigues of the
                    czar began to produce an effect at Constantinople. At this time Charles occupied
                    a very humiliating position, short of money, afraid to leave Turkey for fear of
                    falling into an enemy’s hands, dreading at any moment to be betrayed by the
                    Turks, and knowing that all his conquests had been useless, and that the Swedish
                    provinces were being invaded by Danes, Saxons, Poles, and Russians. The Porte
                    displayed a singular amount of patience in treating with him, but at length it
                    became evident that so long as Charles felt himself safe among his Polish and
                    Swedish guards at Vranitza he would not leave Turkey. A fetva of the
                    Sheikh-ul-Islam declared that the rights of hospitality would not now be
                    violated by his forcible removal, and Ismaël Pacha, the governor of the
                    district, received orders to seize him dead or alive.</p>
                <p>Charles having persistently refused to come to terms, Ismaël, with several
                    thousand janissaries and Tartars, surprised the little camp and took his 300
                    guards prisoners; he then attacked the house held by Charles and forty of his
                    suite. The king defended himself desperately; the house was set on fire over his
                    head, and he was retiring, driven out by the flames, when his spurs became
                    entangled, and he fell and was secured and disarmed by the janissaries. His
                    eyebrows were singed and his clothes tom and stained with blood. For a while he
                    was kept in honourable imprisonment, then he was allowed to reside with a few
                    attendants at Demotica, where he still spoke of departing escorted by a Turkish
                    army, and feigned illness in order to gain time for negotiations, which in the
                    end led to nothing. The king of Prussia was desirous of forming a league with
                    him against the czar, and would have secured for him an honourable return to his
                    states, the one condition being that Stanislas should abdicate and Augustus II.
                    be recognized as king of Poland. Stanislas was quite willing to abandon his
                    doubtful claim to the throne, but Charles with characteristic obstinacy refused
                    to listen to the proposal. “If,” he said, “my friend Stanislas will not be king,
                    I can find some one else to take his place.” At length he saw that there was no
                    chance of the Porte granting his demands, and sending his respectful adieux to
                    Constantinople, he set out suddenly with only two attendants, and travelling
                    unceasingly, riding by day and sleeping in a carriage or cart at night, he
                    passed through the Austrian territories, Bavaria, Westphalia, and Mecklenburg,
                    and thus avoiding the districts held by his enemies, reached his own town of
                    Stralsund, in Swedish Pomerania, late at night, on November 21∙, 1714, after a
                    journey of sixteen days. He announced himself as a Swedish officer charged with
                    important despatches from Bender. The governor received him at once in his
                    bedroom, and asking for news of the king, recognized Charles by the sound of his
                    voice when he replied, and the tidings of his arrival soon spread through the
                    city, which was illuminated for the rest of the night. The return of Charles
                    only drew more closely the alliance between the powers which had been plotting
                    in his absence the dismemberment of Sweden. Stralsund was besieged by a combined
                    army of Saxons, Danes, Prussians, and Russians. Charles made a protracted
                    defence, but on December 23, 1715, the place was forced to capitulate, the king
                    embarking immediately before the surrender, and taking up his residence at Lund
                    in Scania.</p>
                <p>Arrived in Sweden, he took measures to protect the coasts of the kingdom against
                    a descent of his enemies, and with a small army invaded Norway in March 1716; he
                    overran a large part of the country, but was forced to retire for want of
                    supplies. About this time the Baron von Görtz, a German officer, who had during
                    his stay in Turkey become his principal adviser, proposed to him a complete
                    change of policy, and Charles immediately accepted the scheme which Görtz had
                    elaborated, and of which he had already executed some of the preliminaries. He
                    proposed that Charles should make peace with the czar, cede to him the Baltic
                    provinces of Sweden, and gain his alliance. The allies were to replace Stanislas
                    on the throne of Poland and restore the duke of Holstein to his states which had
                    been seized by Denmark. Charles was to invade and conquer Norway, and then land
                    a small army in Scotland, and with the help of the Jacobites, restore the house
                    of Stuart in England, Cardinal Alberoni, then all-powerful in Spain, promising
                    to assist in the accomplishment of this part of the project The other allies had
                    lately been showing a marked jealousy of the growing power of the czar, and it
                    was no difficult matter for Görtz to detach him from the alliance and negotiate
                    a <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n433/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0433-0422"/> peace on the part of Sweden. This first step
                    being successfully accomplished, Charles burst into Norway, speedily occupied
                    several provinces, and in the early winter of 1718 besieged Fredrikshall, a
                    strong fortress, which was regarded as the key of Norway. On Sunday, November
                    30, accompanied by his staff, and by Siguier and Maigret, two French officers in
                    his service, he visited the trenches in the afternoon. Arrived in the foremost
                    trench he found fault with the progress of the work, sent for some more sappers,
                    and leaning on the gabions in front of the trench, himself directed their
                    operations. Night came on rapidly, but still he remained there exposed to the
                    shot of the fortress, for the Danes threw up light-balls, and kept up a
                    continual fire from their batteries. His officers in vain endeavoured to
                    persuade him to retire from his dangerous post, he obstinately refused even to
                    shelter himself behind the gabions, though several of those around him had been
                    struck, and about nine o’clock, when the moon had risen and shining on the snow
                    made the night almost as bright as day, a well-aimed shot struck him on the
                    temple, his head fell forward, his hand instinctively grasped his sword hilt,
                    and his officers running up found him leaning over the gabions dead. A musket
                    ball had passed through his head, destroying his left eye and driving the right
                    out of its orbit. The shot put an end at once to the invasion of Norway, the
                    projects of Görtz, and the power of Sweden in the north of Europe.</p>
                <p>Before the end of the following year it began to be whispered that the shot which
                    killed Charles came not from the ramparts of Fredrikshall, but from the Swedish
                    trenches. The two French officers were in turn pointed out as the probable
                    assassîhs, and Siguier’in the ravings of fever actually charged himself with the
                    murder. On his recovery he denied it, but his involuntary self-accusation was
                    generally believed in preference to his denial. Others laid the alleged crime
                    upon the Swedish generals Cronstadt and Stiernross, and it was said that they
                    had been bribed to break up the project of Görtz by a successful pistol-shot
                    before Fredrikshall. In 1746 the tomb of Charles XII. was opened and the remains
                    were examined in order to see if in this way the question could be settled. The
                    officials charged with the examination seem to have known very little about
                    surgery. They at first suggested that the hole through the skull was made by a
                    dagger; then apparently misled by their ignorance of the well-known fact that
                    the wound at the point of exit is almost invariably larger than that at the
                    point where the bullet enters, they alleged that the ball had struck the right
                    side of the king’s head, which was turned away from the fortress. This naturally
                    confirmed the belief that he had been assassinated, although a great mass of
                    concurrent testimony tended to exculpate every one who had been charged with the
                    crime. To solve the mystery of his death, the body was again exhumed by Charles
                    XV., so recently as 1859, when a careful examination of the skull by three
                    eminent medical professors led to the conclusion that the fatal shot had been
                    fired from a distance on the king’s left, and from a higher level than that on
                    which he stood. Thus it was finally proved that Charles fell, not by the hand of
                    a traitor, but from his recklessly exposing himself to the fire of the
                    fortress.</p>
                <p>The character of Charles was a strange mixture of good and evil. In him almost
                    everything was vitiated by. a kind of exaggeration. Thus his courage at times
                    degenerated into rashness, his determination into mere obstinacy. While we
                    praise his temperate and simple habits, we cannot be sure that, in despising the
                    ostentation and luxury of his brother kings, he was not actuated by a subtle
                    vanity that made him more proud of the blue coat with copper buttons than
                    another would have been of a richly embroidered uniform. His victories and
                    conquests are all the more wonderful when we consider how young he was at the
                    time of his greatest achievements. He was only eighteen when he extorted a peace
                    from Frederick of Denmark and defeated the Russians at Narva, and he was only
                    twenty-one when the victory of Clissow made him master of the destinies of
                    Poland. War had not in those days the lightning rapidity of modern times, or
                    Charles might have more than rivalled the victories of the first Napoleon. But
                    he was really little more than a soldier; as a statesman he must be placed below
                    the second rank, and the only result of his reign was the weakening and
                    impoverishment of his kingdom. He found Sweden one of the first powers of
                    Europe, he left her fallen to a secondary place, and she has never recovered her
                    former position.</p>

                    officers. Voltaire’s well-known memoir is useful, but contains several
                    inaccuracies. There are also very full biographies by Fryxell and Lundblad.
                    Among contemporary publications there is a curious account of his wars “by a
                    Scots gentleman in the Swedish service,” the first edition of which appeared iu
                    London in 1715, before the death of Charles, the second in 1718. The real author
                    was Daniel Defoe. (A. H. A.)</p>
