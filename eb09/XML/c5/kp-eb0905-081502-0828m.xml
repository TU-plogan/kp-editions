                    as we learn from himself (Epist. 1), an Egyptian by birth, and probably a native
                    of Alexandria. It may be conjectured from his name that he was of Roman
                    extraction, and it is hardly possible that he should have acquired such mastery
                    over the Latin language if it had not been familiar to him from his boyhood. We
                    have, however, his own authority for the assertion that his first poetical
                    compositions were in Greek, and that he had written nothing in Latin before 395
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> In that year he appears to have come to Rome, and
                    made his <hi rend="italic">début</hi> as a Latin poet by a panegyric on the
                    consulship of Olybrius and Probinus, the first brothers not belonging to the
                    imperial family who had ever simultaneously filled the office of consul. This
                    piece proved the precursor of the series of panegyrical poems which compose the
                    bulk of his writings. In 396 appeared the encomium on the third consulship of
                    the Emperor Honorius, and the epic on the downfall of Rufinus, the unworthy
                    minister of Arcadius at Constantinople. This revolution was principally effected
                    by the contrivance of Stilicho, the great general and minister of Honorius.
                    Claudian’s poem appears to have obtained his patronage, or rather perhaps that
                    of his wife Serena, by whose interposition the poet was within a year or two
                    enabled to contract a wealthy marriage in Africa (Epist. 2). Previous to this
                    event he had produced (398) his panegyric on the fourth consulship of Honorius,
                    his epithalamium on the marriage of Honorius to Stilicho’s daughter, Maria, and
                    his poem on the Gildonic war, celebrating the repression of a revolt in Africa.
                    To these succeeded his piece on the consulship of Mallius Theodorus (399), the
                    unfinished or mutilated invective against the Byzantine prime minister
                    Eutropius, in the same year, the epics on Stilicho’s first consulship and on his
                    repulse of Alaric (400 and 403), and the panegyric on the sixth consulship of
                    Honorius (404). From this time all trace of Claudian is lost, and he is
                    generally supposed to have perished with his patron Stilicho in 408. It may,
                    however, be plausibly conjectured that he must have died in 404, as he could
                    hardly otherwise have omitted to celebrate the greatest of Stilicho’s
                    achievements, the destruction of the barbarian host led by Radagaisus in the
                    following year. Nor, on the other hand, is ground wanting for the surmise that
                    he may have survived Stilicho, as in the dedication to the second book of his
                    epic on the <hi rend="italic">Rape of Proserpine,</hi> he speaks of his disuse
                    of poetry in terms hardly reconcilable with the fertility which, as we have
                    seen, he displayed during his patron’s lifetime. From the manner in which
                    Augustine alludes to him in his <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Civitate</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei,</hi> it may be inferred that he was no
                    longer living at the date of the composition of that work, between 415 and
                    428.</p>
                <p>We have already enumerated Claudian’s chief poems, to which only remain to be
                    added a number of short descriptive pieces and epigrams, his lively Fesceunines
                    on the emperor’s marriage, his panegyric on Serena, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gigantomadιia,</hi> a fragment of an unfinished epic. Several poems expressing
                    Christian sentiments are undoubtedly spurious. There can be no question of his
                    paganism, which, however, neither prevented his celebrating Christian rulers and
                    magistrates nor his enjoying the distinction of a court laureate. We have his
                    own authority for his having been honoured by a bronze statue in the forum,
                    although the inscription on the pedestal which Pomponius Laetus professed to
                    have discovered in the 15th century is almost certainly spurious.</p>
                <p>Claudian’s position in literature is unique. It is sufficiently remarkable that,
                    after nearly three centuries of torpor, the Latin muse should have experienced
                    any revival in the age of Honorius, nothing less than amazing that this revival
                    should have been the work of a foreigner, most surprising of all that a just and
                    enduring celebrity should have been gained by official panegyrics on the
                    generally uninteresting transactions of an inglorious epoch. The first of these
                    particulars bespeaks Claudian’s taste, rising superior to the prevailing
                    barbarism, the second his command of language, the third his rhetorical skill.
                    As remarked by Gibbon, “he was endowed with the rare and precious talent of
                    raising the meanest, of adorning the most barren, and of diversifying the most
                    similar topics.” This gift is especially displayed in his poem on the downfall
                    of Rufînus, where the punishment of a public malefactor is exalted to the
                    dignity of an epical subject by the magnificence of diction and the ostentation
                    of supernatural machinery. The noble exordium, in which the fate of Rufinus is
                    propounded as the vindication of divine justice, places the subject at once on a
                    dignified level; and the council of the infernal powers has afforded a hint to
                    Tasso, and through him to Milton. The inevitable monotony of the panegyrics on
                    Honorius is relieved by just and brilliant expatiation on the duties of a
                    sovereign. In his celebration of Stilicho’s victories Claudian found a subject
                    more worthy of his powers, and some passages, such as the description of the
                    flight of A1aric, and of Stilicho’s arrival at Rome, and the felicitous parallel
                    between his triumphs and those of Marius, rank among the brightest ornaments of
                    Latin poetry. Claudian’s panegyric, however lavish and re <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0829-0816"/> gardless of veracity, is in genera! far less
                    offensive than usual in his age, a circumstance attributable partly to his more
                    refined taste and partly to the genuine merit of his patron Stilicho. He is a
                    valuable authority for the history of his times, and is rarely to be convicted
                    of serious inaccuracy in his facts, whatever may be thought of the colouring he
                    chooses to impart to them. As correctly observed by his latest critic, Mr
                    Hodgkin, he was animated by true patriotic feeling, in the shape of a reverence
                    for Rome as the source and symbol of law, order, and civilization. Outside the
                    sphere of actual life he is less successful; his <hi rend="italic">Rape of
                    Proserpine,</hi> though the beauties of detail are as great as usual, betrays
                    his deficiency in the creative power requisite for dealing with a purely ideal
                    subject. This denotes the rhetorician rather than the poet, and in general it
                    may be said that his especial gifts of vivid natural description and of copious
                    illustration, derived from extensive but not cumbrous erudition, are fully as
                    appropriate to eloquence as to poetry. In the general cast of his mind and
                    character of his writings, and especially in his faculty for bestowing enduring
                    interest upon occasional themes, we may fitly compare him with Dryden,
                    remembering that while Dryden exulted in the energy of a vigorous and
                    fast-developing language, Claudian was cramped by an artificial diction,
                    confined to the literary class.</p>
                <p>Claudian’s works must have been carefully edited in his own time, for his
                    epigrams include several short pieces evidently prepared for insertion in or
                    rejected from poems of greater compass. The <hi rend="italic">editio
                    princeps</hi> was printed at Vicenza in 1482; the best subsequent editions are
                    those by Gesner (1759), Burmann (1760), and Jeep (1872). There is a complete
                    English translation of little merit, by Abraham Hawkins (London, 1817), and a
                    version of the <hi rend="italic">Rape of Proserpine,</hi> by Dean Howard. Some
                    excellent criticism on Claudian will be found in Professor Ramsay’s article in
                    Smith’s Classical Dictionary, and in two lectures by Mr Thomas Hodgkin
                    (Newcastle, 1875). <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. g.)</hi></p>
