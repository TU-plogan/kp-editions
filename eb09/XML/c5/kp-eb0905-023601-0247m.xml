                    marvellous prosperity for Spain, while the Moors were being finally conquered,
                    America was discovered, and the Spanish chivalry was in its very bloom. In 1501,
                    being requested in marriage by Henry VII. for his eldest son Arthur, Catherine
                    embarked at Coruña, landed at Plymouth the 2d October, and, with the usual
                    pageantry, was united to Arthur the month following. Their marriage was of no
                    long duration; in the April of next year Arthur died. His widow, however,
                    continued to reside in England, as proposals were made and accepted for her
                    betrothal to Henry, second son of Henry VII., now heir-presumptive to the
                    throne. Catherine, already eighteen, was disinclined to an engagement with a boy
                    of thirteen; nevertheless the ceremony of betrothal took place in 1503. The
                    marriage did not take place till 1509, after the accession of Henry to the
                    throne, a dispensation from the Pope having been procured. The early years of
                    the marriage were happy enough. Henry was a handsome, affable, and jovial king,
                    fond of magnificent display, covetous of distinction in the tilting ground, and
                    ambitious of popularity. His wife had the good sense to humour him in his
                    favourite diversions, while she herself lived a dignified self-denying life of
                    almost conventual strictness, conscientious in the performance of her religious
                    duties, devoted to her husband, kind to her friends, charitable to her enemies,
                    and careful of the interests of her adopted country. In the year of Flodden
                    (1513) she was regent of the kingdom during the absence of Henry in France, and
                    performed the duties of that office with great courage and ability. But the
                    repeated loss of children cast a gloom over those years. Three sons died almost
                    as soon as they were born; Mary, a sickly child, born in 1516, was the only
                    survivor.</p>
                <p>It was not till 1527 that Henry’s scruples as to the validity of his marriage
                    with Catherine became public, though there can be no doubt his affections had
                    been alienated from her long before. It was anticipated by Henry and Clement
                    that the conventual habits of Catherine would have rendered it easy for her to
                    retire from the throne, and spend the rest of her life in a monastery. But they
                    were mistaken; however submissive she might be to her husband in everything
                    else, and however.ready to act charitably towards the minor irregularities of
                    his conduct, she was resolved not to allow any doubt to be cast upon the
                    legality of their marriage or the title to the throne of her daughter Mary, nor
                    to surrender any of her rights as queen. This the Papal legate, Campeggio, soon
                    found out on his arrival in England in 1528. After long hesitation, and much
                    tortuous diplomatic manoeuvring on the side of the Pope, a court, consisting of
                    the legates Campeggio and Wolsey, was at last constituted, 28th May 1529, at
                    Blackfriars, to hear the case of the royal parties. Catherine appeared only to
                    protest against the legality of the court; and then after a solemn address to
                    the king for justice, appealed to the Pope, and withdrew. Notwithstanding the
                    proceedings for the divorce, and the fact that Henry had brought Anne Boleyn to
                    live in the palace, Catherine and he were not quite separated till the beginning
                    of 1531, when, finding lie could not prevail upon her to. withdraw her appeal to
                    the Pope, or in any way to give up her passive resistance, he commanded her to
                    retire from Windsor. After that she never saw him again, nor her daughter Mary.
                    Her residence was often changed; but it was principally at Ampthill. At length
                    an open declaration of the Pope against Henry obliged the monarch to solve the
                    difficulty by the assertion of the royal supremacy (1531). In a court held at
                    Dunstable, Cranmer, recently appointed archbishop of Canterbury, pronounced the
                    marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void (1533). Naturally, Catherine,
                    though still as charitably disposed as ever towards Henry, treated this and all
                    other attempts to deprive her of her rights with resolute contempt. Her health,
                    which had begun to fail long before the divorce was agitated, now completely
                    gave way. After writing a letter of forgiveness and of gentle admonition to her
                    husband, and taking all the care she could of her faithful attendants, she died
                    at Kimbolton Castle the 7th January 1536. (See Miss Strickland’s <hi
