                <p><label type="entry">CAVALIER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jean</hi></label> (c.
                    1680-1740), the famous chief of the Camisards, was born at Ribaute, near Anduse,
                    in Lower Languedoc. The date of his birth is variously given between 1679 and
                    1685. It could hardly be so late as the last-named year, and may probably be
                    assigned to the period between 1679 and 1681. He was the son of a peasant, and
                    in boyhood was employed first in keeping sheep, and afterwards as a baker’s
                    apprentice. A pious mother trained him in the Reformed faith. The persecution of
                    Protestants, which began after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and which
                    was carried on with pitiless cruelty in the Cevennes, drove him from his native
                    land in 1701, and he took refuge at Geneva. By the <hi rend="italic"
                        >dragonnades</hi> of Louis XIV. the Protestants of the Cevennes were at last
                    driven to revolt; and Cavalier, inspired with the hope of being their deliverer,
                    a hope which was raised to the pitch of enthusiasm, it is said, by certain
                    prophecies, returned to his own country in 1702. The insurrection broke out in
                    July of that year, and Cavalier was one of the chosen leaders. Roland was named
                    generalissimo, but Cavalier soon rose to share the chief command with him.
                    Untrained in arms, he displayed not only a fiery courage, but extraordinary
                    military skill. This must have been owing to some extent to the eager attention
                    which he had paid, while keeping his sheep, to the manoeuvres of the troops
                    which were stationed in his native district. Although the <hi rend="italic"
                        >enfants de Dieu,</hi> as the insurgents were called, numbered at the most
                    only 3000 men in arms, they coped successfully again and again with the much
                    more numerous forces of the king, and were never entirely conquered. After
                    several affairs Cavalier changed the theatre of war to the Vivarais; and on the
                    10th of February 1703 be defeated the royalist troops on the Ardèche. A few days
                    later he was completely defeated on the same ground and was supposed to have
                    fallen. But he reappeared, was again defeated at Tour-de-Bellot (April 30), and
                    again recovered himself, recruits flocking to him to fill up the places of the
                    slain. By a long series of successes he raised his reputation to the highest
                    pitch, and gained the full confidence of the people. It was in vain that more
                    and more rigorous measures were adopted against the Camisards; in vain that
                    their mountain district was ravaged, sacked, and burned by the Catholics.
                    Cavalier boldly carried the war into the plain, made terrible reprisals, and
                    threatened even Nîmes itself. On April 16, 1704, he encountered Marshal
                    Montrevel himself at the bridge of Nages, with 1000 men against 5000; and though
                    defeated after a desperate conflict, he made a successful retreat with two
                    thirds of his men. Marshal Villars was next sent against him, and instead of
                    fighting proposed negotiation. Roland resolutely turned a deaf ear to him; but
                    Cavalier agreed to treat. A conference was held at Nîmes, hostages being given
                    to Cavalier; and he appeared with an armed and mounted escort, which was drawn
                    up facing the guard of the marshal. The terms proposed were deferred to the
                    decision of the king, Cavalier in the meanwhile retiring tσ Calvisson. In this
                    place for some days the Camisard∆ held their meetings openly, and thousands
                    eagerly flocked to them. The result of the negotiation was that Cavalier
                    received for himself a commission with a pension of 1200 livres, and for his
                    brother a captain’s commission. He was authorized to form a regiment of
                    Camisards to be sent to Spain; and liberty was restored to his father and other
                    Protestant prisoners. The treaty, which did not include any provision for
                    general liberty of conscience, excited great indignation among the companions of
                    Cavalier. They called him traitor and coward, and deserted him. Disheartened,
                    and with little confidence in the promises of the court, Cavalier afterwards
                    visited Paris for the purpose of an interview with Louis XIV. He was presented
                    privately to the king at Versailles, but was ill received. His disappointment<pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0272-0261"/> and the reports which were current of
                    intended attempts on his life or liberty induced him to leave France. He went to
                    Switzerland, and afterwards to Holland; and there he married a daughter of
                    Madame Dunoyer, the latter a lady of Nîmes, who had once been sought in marriage
                    by Voltaire. He then passed into England for the purpose of recruiting his
                    regiment of Camisards. He had an interview with Queen Anne, of which conflicting
                    accounts are given. But so highly was his military genius valued that he was
                    sent with his regiment to take part in the famous expedition to Spain, under the
                    earl of Peterborough and Sir Cloudesley Shovel (May 1705). At the battle of
                    Almanza his Camisards encountered a French regiment which they had met in the
                    Cevennes, and, without firing, the foes rushed to a hand to hand fight and made
                    a fearful slaughter. Cavalier was severely wounded, and was saved from death by
                    an English officer. On his return to England a small pension was given him, and
                    after long waiting he was made a major-general and named governor of J ersey.
                    This post was afterwards exchanged for the governorship of the Isle of Wight.
                    Cavalier died at Chelsea, in the first half of May 1740, and there his remains
                    were interred. Malesherbes, the courageous friend and defender of Louis XVI.,
                    bears the following eloquent testimony to this young hero of the Cevennes :—“I
                    confess,” he says, “that this warrior, who, without ever having served, found
                    himself by the mere gift of nature a great general,—this Camisard who was bold
                    to punish a crime in the presence of a fierce troop which maintained itself by
                    like crimes,—this coarse peasant who, when admitted at twenty years of age into
                    the society of cultivated people, caught their manners and won their love and
                    esteem,—this man who, though accustomed to a stormy life, and having just cause
                    to be proud of his success, had yet enough philosophy in him by nature to enjoy
                    for thirty-five years a tranquil private life,—appears to me to be one of the
                    rarest characters to be found in history.” There is a work, little esteemed,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the War in the Cevennes, under Colonel
                        Cavalier,</hi> which appears to have been written not by Cavalier himself
                    but by a French refugee named Galli. For a more detailed account see Mrs Bray’s
