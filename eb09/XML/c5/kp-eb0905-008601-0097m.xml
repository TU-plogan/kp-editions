                    rend="italic">atomic weight,12)</hi> is one of the most important of the
                    chemical elements. It occurs pure in the diamond, and nearly pure as graphite or
                    plumbago; it is a constituent of all animal and vegetable tissues and of coal;
                    and it also enters into the composition of many minerals, such as chalk and
                    dolomite.</p>
                <p>Carbon is a solid substance, destitute of taste and odour; but it occurs in
                    several modifications which exhibit very diverse physical properties. Thus, it
                    is met with in the form of the diamond in transparent crystals belonging to the
                    regular or cubical system, which conduct electricity but slowly; and in the form
                    of graphite in opaque crystals belonging to the hexagonal system, which conduct
                    electricity nearly as well as the metals. The diamond is the hardest substance
                    known, and has a relatively high specific gravity (3 ’ 33 to 3 <hi

                    black shining streak when rubbed upon paper, and has a much lower specific
                    gravity (245 to 2 ’ 35). In addition to these two crystalline modifications of
                    carbon there are a number of varieties of non-crystalline or amorphous carbon,
                    which, however, exhibit the greatest differences in physical properties.</p>
                <p>By heating to the high temperature afforded by a powerful galvanic battery, both
                    the diamond and amorphous carbon are converted into graphite. In the electric
                    arc carbon appears to be converted into vapour; but the temperature which is
                    required to volatilize it is extremely high; in fact, it has been
                    calculated<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dewar, <hi

                    boiling-point of carbon is not less than about 7000° on the centigrade
                    scale.</p>
                <p>Although the various allotropic modifications of carbon eannot always be
                    satisfactorily distinguished by their physical properties, they may readily be
                    distinguished, as Berthelot has shown, by their behaviour on treatment with
                    certain oxidizing agents. The diamond is not affected thereby even after
                    prolonged and reiterated treatment. The different varieties of amorphous carbon,
                    however, are more or less readily entirely converted into humus-like substances,
                    or “humic acids,” <hi rend="italic">soluble</hi> in water, whereas the different
                    varieties of graphite furnish “graphitic oxides,” which are <hi rend="italic"
                    >insoluble</hi> in water, and especially characterized by the property of
                    undergoing decomposition with deflagration when heated. The method of treatment
                    adopted by Berthelot is as follows. The carbon in the form of aa impalpable
                    powder is mixed with the aid of a card with five times its weight of pulverized
                    potassic chlorate, and this mixture is then formed little by little into a paste
                    wi ι fuming nitric acid. In performing these operations great care is necessary
                    in order to avoid explosions, and at most five grams of carbon should be taken.
                    The mixture, contained in a small open flask, is allowed to stand several hours,
                    and is then heated for three or four days without interruption to a temperature
                    not higher than 50° or 60° C.; the mass is then diluted with water and washed by
                    decantation with tepid water. It is necessary as a rule to repeat this series of
                    operations several times in order entirely to dissolve the amorphous carbons, or
                    to convert the graphites into graphitic oxides.</p>
                <p>Berthelot has examined a very large number of varieties of carbon in this manner
                    with the following results. The carbon of wood charcoal, animal charcoal, coke,
                    the so-called metallic carbon obtained by decomposing hydrocarbons by passing
                    their vapours through a red-hot tube, gas-retort carbon, and various specimens
                    of anthracite from different sources, all dissolved entirely with more or less
                    readiness when treated in the above manner; lamp black, however, furnished a
                    small amount of graphitic oxide. The amorphous carbon of the meteorite of
                    Cranbourne (Australia) furnished a graphitic oxide identical with that obtained
                    by similarly treating graphite from cast-iron, -but the carbon of the Orgueil
                    meteorite was entirely soluble. The carbon of the Greenland meteoric rock
                    discovered by Nordenskiold also dissolved entirely with the exception of a very
                    insignificant residue.</p>
                <p>Berthelot also examined the action of various agents on carbon, and finds that
                    heat alone is without influence; that is to say, the graphites are not changed
                    into amorphous carbon, or the amorphous carbons into graphite, when heated to
                    whiteness in an atmosphere of hydrogen or of chlorine. When, however, a pencil
                    of gas-retort carbon is inflamed in an atmosphere of'oxygen, and then as soon as
                    the point is fully incandescent plunged into water, the part which has been
                    heated contains a small quantity of graphite. On examining the pencils of carbon
                    employed in producing the electric light it was found that the spongy mass of
                    carbon collected on the negative pole contained a large proportion of graphite,
                    but that only traces were present in the pencil employed as positive pole, which
                    appears to indicate that it is necessary for the carbon to undergo
                    volatilization in order that it may be converted into graphite. The graphite
                    thus produced is not identical with that contained in cast-iron, nor with
                    natural plumbago-; the same variety of graphite is produced, however, when the
                    diamond is heated in the electric arc. The carbon separated from the various
                    hydrocarbons by heat alone consists entirely of amorphous carbon, but that
                    obtained on decomposing marsh gas by the electric spark contains a small
                    quantity of graphite, and the carbon resulting from the decomposition of
                    perchloride of carbon and bisulphide of carbon at a red heat contains a
                    considerable proportion of graphite; that resulting from the decomposition of
                    cyanogen by the electric spark contains only traces of graphite.</p>
                <p>The specific heats of the several modifications of carbon also differ
                    considerably; that is to say, the amounts of heat required to raise equal
                    weights through the same number of degrees of temperature are different. The
                    diamond has the lowest, and amorphous carbon the highest specific heat; or to

                    in two distinct modifications, one of which, like the Borrowdale graphite, is
                    fine-grained and amorphous; the other, like the Ceylon variety, is composed of
                    small flat plates. Native graphite contains from 95 to nearly 100 per cent, of
                    carbon, the impurity being usually small quantities of silicates. Graphite, also
                    called plumbago or black lead, is used for making so-called lead pencils, for
                    polishing iron work, for lubricating machinery, for making crucibles, and in the
                    electrotype process for coating the surfaces of wood, plaster-of-paris,
                    gutta-percha, and other non-conducting materials, so as to render them

                <p>The behaviour of graphite on treatment with a mixture of potassic chlorate and

                    explosive violence, leaving a residue which still contains hydrogen and oxygen,

                    which crystallizes from cast-iron and that obtained by heating amorphous carbon
                    in the electric arc are similarly treated, graphitic oxides are produced which
                    differ from each other, and from the oxide formed from native graphite; it is
                    therefore supposed that these graphites are distinct substances (Berthelot, <hi

                    and oxygen, from which it can only be freed by long-continued ignition at a

                    parts of the retorts. It is a good conductor of heat and electricity, and burns
                    with difficulty, and is therefore employed in producing the electric light, and

                    the dioxide over red-hot carbon. Both are colourless, odourless gases. The union
                    of carbon with oxygen gives rise to the evolution of a very large amount of
                    heat, but much less heat is produced by the union of the first half of the
                    oxygen than by the union of the second half. Thus the combination of 12 grams of
                    carbon with 16 grams of oxygen to form 28 grams of carbonic oxide gives rise to
                    the evolution of about 25,000 units of heat, but no less than 69,000 units are
                    produced by the addition of a second 16 grams of oxygen to form carbonic
                    dioxide. It is supposed that in the first instance very much less heat is
                    evolved because energy, which otherwise would appear in the form of heat, is
                    expended in converting the solid carbon into the state in which it exists in
                    gaseous carbonic oxide and dioxide, since it is observed that in those cases in

                    pressure of 36 atmospheres at 0° C. it is converted into a colourless mobile
                    liquid. When the liquid is suddenly relieved from the pressure under which alone
                    it can exist, part of it at once passes back into the state of gas, and heat is
                    abstracted so rapidly that the remaining portion of the liquid solidifies. By
                    allowing a jet of the liquid dioxide to pass into a cylindrical metal box,
                    having within it an inclined metal tongue against which the jet of liquid
                    impinges, a considerable quantity of the solid may be collected in the form of a
                    white flocculent mass like snow. Like all flocculent substances, it conducts
                    heat but slowly, and may be preserved for a considerable time. By mixing it with
                    ether its heat-conducting power is greatly increased; it therefore evaporates
                    much more quickly, and a much lower temperature is obtained than with the solid
                    alone, and by placing the mixture under the receiver of an air-pump and
                    exhausting, a still greater degree of cold is produced. According to Faraday, an
                    alcohol thermometer plunged into a bath of the solid carbonic dioxide and ether
                    in air indicates a temperature of - 76° C., and in the same bath under a
                    receiver exhausted to within 12 inches of the atmospheric pressure it fell to -
                    110° C.; at the latter temperature alcohol assumes the consistence of a thick
                    oil.</p>

                    not the only oxides of carbon which are capable of existing. When a current of
                    pure and dry carbonic oxide is circulated through a Siemen’s induction-tube, and
                    there submitted to the action of electricity, a decomposition of the gas occurs.
                    Carbonic dioxide is formed, and simultaneously with its formation a solid
                    deposit may be observed in the induction-tube; this deposit appears as a
                    transparent film of a red-brown colour. It is entirely soluble in water, which
                    is strongly coloured by it, and the solution has an intensely acid reaction. In
                    the dry condition, before it has been in contact with water, it is an oxide of

                    what may be termed an homologous series of “oxycarbons,” of which the unit of
                    carbon with the weight 12 <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be regarded as the first
                    term, and of which the adjacent terms differ by an increment of carbonic oxide,
                    CO, weighing 28, precisely as homologous series of hydrocarbons differ by the
                    increment CH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. <hi rend="smallcaps">Two</hi> at

                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>; the solution has a sharp and slightly acid taste, and
                    turns the blue colour of litmus to wine-red. The volume of carbonic dioxide
                    dissolved by water diminishes as the temperature rises, and at the boiling heat
                    the whole is expelled from solution; the volume dissolved by water at a given
                    temperature is nearly the same, however, under all pressures, so that the weight
                    of gas absorbed increases in nearly the same proportion as the pressure. On
                    removing the pressure the gas is given off with effervescence. Ordinary
                    soda-water consists merely of water impregnated with carbonic dioxide by
                    mechanical pressure. When lime water is added to a solution of carbonic acid, or
                    carbonic dioxide is passed into lime water, a white precipitate of calcic
                    carbonate or carbonate of lime, the chief constituent of ordinary chalk, is
                    produced :—</p>

                    Carbonic acid. Calcic carbonate. Water.</p>
                <p>On continuing to pass the gas the precipitate becomes dissolved owing to the
                    formation of an acid carbonate or bicarbonate, which is fairly soluble in water,
                    the carbonate being almost insoluble :—</p>
                <p>CaCO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Ca(CO <hi

                    Carbonic acid. Calcic bicarbonate.</p>
                <p>If the solution of the bicarbonate be heated, carbonic dioxide is given off and
                    the calcic carbonate is precipitated, the bicarbonate being decomposed. The lime
                    salt may also be removed from the solution, with the exception of the small
                    amount of calcic carbonate which the water is capable of dissolving, by
                    carefully adding lime water or a solution of ordinary washing soda as long as a
                    precipitate is produced. The action of lime water in this case is to convert the
                    soluble bicarbonate into the insoluble carbonate; thus :—</p>

                    carbonate.</p>
                <p>These facts serve to explain the “hardness,” as it is termed, of many natural
                    waters, and the methods employed to render such waters soft. A water which, like
                    rain water, readily produces a lather with soap is said to be a soft water,
                    whereas one which does not readily yield a lather, but forms a large amount of
                    curd, is said to be a hard water. The hardness of most natural spring waters is
                    chiefly due to dissolved calcic bicarbonate, which is formed by the action of
                    the carbonic acid dissolved in rain upon the calcareous materials with which the
                    water comes in contact during its passage through the earth. Ordinary soap
                    consists of the sodic salts of certain fatty acids, and is soluble in water; but
                    the lime salts of these acids are insoluble, so that when the soap is used with
                    the hard water a double decomposition takes place, the calcic bicarbonate being
                    converted into sodic bicarbonate and the sodasoap into a lime soap or curd. Such
                    waters may be rendered soft, that is to say, the calcic bicarbonate may be
                    removed in a variety of ways, viz., by heating the water, which causes the
                    decomposition of the bicarbonate and the precipi tation of the carbonate, and it
                    is in this way that the fur is produced in our kettles and boilers; by adding
                    washing soda or sodic carbonate, a common practice in all households where hard
                    water is used; and lastly, by adding lime water. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. e.
