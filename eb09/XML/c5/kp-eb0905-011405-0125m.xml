                    rend="smallcaps">Carmarthenshire</hi></label> (Welsh <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caerfyrddin),</hi> a county in South Wales, bounded on the N. by Cardigan, on
                    the E. by Brecon and Glamorgan, on the S. by Carmarthen Bay, an inlet of the
                    Bristol Channel, and on the W. by Pembroke. Its greatest length is, from S.W. to
                    N.E., about 40 miles; its greatest breadth, S.E. to N.W., about 24 miles. It
                    possesses an area of 947 square miles, or 606,172 acres (of which about 95,600
                    are occupied by commons and waste land), and is thus the largest of all the
                    Welsh counties. It contains 5 hundreds and 97 parishes, and is in the diocese of
                    St David’s.</p>
                <p>The whole of the northern, and by far the largest, portion of Carmarthenshire is
                    chiefly occupied by the Silurian geological formation. To the south of this, and
                    crossing the county in a direction fromS.W. to N.E., there stretches a belt of
                    the Old Red Sandstone, varying in width from 1 ½ to 4 or 5 miles. This is
                    succeeded on its southern edge by narrow belts of the carboniferous limestone,
                    and the millstone grit; south of which the whole remaining portion of the county
                    is occupied by the coal measures, forming part of the great South Wales
                    coalfield.</p>
                <p>In the south-east adjoining the border of Breconshire, there is a range of bleak
                    and somewhat lofty mountains, called the Mynydd Dû or Black Mountains, where the
                    Carmarthenshire Van rears its lofty summit about 2600 feet high. The rest of the
                    county is thickly studded with rounded green hills, few of which exceed 1000
                    feet in height, and is intersected by valleys and glens, many of them presenting
                    scenes of great beauty and interest.</p>
                <p>The principal river is the Towy, with its tributaries the Gwili and Cothi, which
                    drains the central basin of the county, and enters the sea in Carmarthen Bay
                    immediately to the east of the river Taf. The latter stream, with its numerous
                    affluents, drains the western portion of the county; while in the north, the
                    Teifi separates Cardigan from Carmarthenshire. The Llwchwr, springing from the
                    Black Mountains, separates in its lower course Glamorgan from this county.</p>
                <p>The climate is mild, except in the very elevated parts of the county; but the
                    annual fall of rain is very great, amounting at Carmarthen in 1875 to nc less
                    than 60 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 87 inches. Agriculture is generally not
                    in a very forward <pb break="no"

                    efficient drainage under the provisions of the Drainage Acts, and better modes
                    of agricultural practice are coming into use. The soil varies very much; but in
                    the southern parts of the county, and in the larger valleys, it is exceedingly
                    fertile.</p>
                <p>In the south-east there are extensive and valuable coal and iron mines. There are
                    also some important lead mines, and limestone is abundant in the south.</p>
                <p>Railways intersect the county; the through line from Bristol to Milford Haven,
                    traversing the southern district, affords expeditious communication with London
                    on the east and Ireland on the west.</p>
                <p>The principal industry is that of agriculture, more particularly that of
                    stock-raising. In 1873 the number of holdings in the county of less than one
                    acre in extent amounted to 5168, and of an acre and upwards to 2898. There were
                    only 11 above 5000 acres, and none exceeded 35,000. The average size of each
                    holding at that date was 63∣ acres, that of all Wales amounting to 74½. The
                    average rental of those containing one acre and upwards amounted to 14s. 9d. per
                    acre.</p>
                <p>The following tables will show the state of agriculture in the two years 1872 and
                    1875, and from them it will be observed, that while the acreage under crop has
                    slightly decreased, an increase has taken place in the numbers of live stock

                <p>The other industries of any importance are coal-working, iron-founding, and the
                    smelting of tin and copper, principally of imported ores.</p>
                <p>The population, which numbered 110,632 persons in 1851, increased in 1871 by 4½
                    per cent., amounting to 115,710, of whom 54,921 were males, and 60,789 females.
                    There are only two towns of any considerable size,—Carmarthen, population
                    10,488, and Llanelly, 13,958. Two members are returned to Parliament by the
                    county and one by the group of Carmarthen boroughs. A court of quarter-sessions
                    is held in the county.</p>
                <p>Welsh is the language commonly spoken by the lower orders, and in the northern
                    parts of the county the manners and customs of the people are as purely Welsh as
                    in any part of the principality. Of the history of Carmarthenshire it will be
                    sufficient to say that it was occupied at the time of the Roman invasion by the
                    Demetae, a tribe which, after the expulsion of the conquerors, soon relapsed
                    into semi-barbarism. Owing to its natural advantages, it preserved its
                    independance long after the northern and eastern portions of Wales had become
                    absorbed into the English states, and the fealty paid by Howel Ddâ, its most
                    eminent prince, to the English sovereign was more nominal than real. But the
                    tide of Norman conquest swept over it, and was scarcely interrupted until in the
                    12th and 13th centuries the two Llewelyns made a gallant resistance to it. It
                    was, however, at Carmarthen that Edward I., checked for a moment in his course,
                    raised a new army, before which Llewelyn fled, and the independence of the
                    county ultimately fell It was in this county that the remarkable “Rebecca”
                    insurrection originated in 1843-4. The multiplicity of toll-gates seemed to be
                    the original cause of this singular conspiracy. Parties of five or six hundred
                    men, mostly mounted, armed with pickaxes, sledges, hatchets, and guns, used
                    nightly to traverse the counties of Carmarthen, Pembroke, Cardigan, and Brecon,
                    headed by a tall man dressed in woman’s clothes, throwing down the toll-gates,
                    and committing other excesses; and so well did the rioters keep counsel, and so
                    secretly did they manage their forays, that despite the exertions of the
                    magistrates, assisted by large bodies of military sent into the districts, no
                    effectual check could be put upon their proceedings for many months.</p>
                <p>Carmarthenshire is rich in antiquities, and possesses the traces of three
                    important Roman roads, besides encampments and several early British remains.
                    The two most interesting mediaeval ruins are those of Carreg Cennin and Dynevor
                    castles, <hi rend="smallcaps">Carmarthen,</hi> the capital of Carmarthenshire,
                    is a parliamentary and municipal borough, and forms a county of itself with an
                    area of 4996 acres. It is beautifully situated on the right bank of the Towy,
                    about 5 miles from the sea. The river is navigable for small vessels; but, owing
                    to the better access to the neighbouring borough of Llanelly, and to the
                    increased facilities of railway communication, the Towy is not used so much for
                    the transit of goods as formerly. The streets of the town are for the most part
                    narrow and steep, although many of the houses are well built and of a
                    respectable class. Part of the town stands on elevated ground, and viewed from a
                    distance it has an imposing appearance.</p>
                <p>The principal church is that of St Peter’s, a large plain building with a lofty
                    square tower, containing some interesting monuments, among which is that of the
                    celebrated Sir Rhys ap Thomas and his lady. Sir Richard Steele is buried here,
                    but no monument marks his resting-place. There is another church belonging to
                    the Establishment, and several dissenting chapels. There is a large and
                    well-conducted training college here for Welsh teachers; and there are two
                    grammar-schools on public foundations. There are also two infirmaries, and a
                    literary and scientific institution, the lectures at which are well attended.
                    The town also possesses a guild-hall,—a respectable stone edifice adorned with
                    Tuscan columns, and having a covered market underneath. The county gaol is built
                    on the site of the ancient castle. There is a granite obelisk erected to the
                    memory of Sir Thomas Picton, and a bronze statue to General Nott, who were both
                    natives of the town; and also a monument to the officers and men of the 23d
                    Regiment (Welsh Fusiliers) who fell in the Crimean War.</p>
                <p>A considerable trade is carried on by river and rail in slates, lead-ore, and tin
                    plates, besides domestic produce. The salmon and sewin (bull-trout) fishing is
                    also productive of some trade. The corporation consists of a mayor, 6 aldermen,
                    and 18 councillors. It returned a member to Parliament from 1536 to the period
                    of the Reform Act. Since that time it has been associated with Llanelly in
                    returning one member. There are markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and several
                    fairs in the course of the year. The quarter sessions and assizes are held here.
                    Population in 1851, 10,524, andin 1871,10,488, (males4820, females 5668),
                    inhabited houses, 1984.</p>
                <p>Carmarthen, as its name denotes, was a fortified place at an early period. It is
                    generaUy believed to be the <hi rend="italic">Mari-dunum</hi> of the Romans near
                    which two branches of the great road, the <hi rend="italic">Via Julia,</hi>
                    diverged. Upon the erection of Wales into a principality, the chancery and
                    exchequer of the southern division were fixed here. The last time when the
                    castle was put to use was in the Parliamentary wars, when it was garrisoned and
                    held for Charles I. After being reduced by the Parliamentary forces it was
                    dismantled, and both it and the old walls were allowed to go to decay. The town
                    gives the title of marquis to the duke of Leeds.</p>
