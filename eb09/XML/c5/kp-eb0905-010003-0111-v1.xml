                    (1787-1861), a learned divine and ecclesiastical historian, was born at
                    Blackburn in Lancashire in 1787. He was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford,
                    where, in 1809. he took his degree of B.A. as first class in classics and second
                    class in mathematics, and became a fellow of his college. He took his master’s
                    degree in 1812. After being for several years engaged as tutor and lecturer he
                    was appointed, in 1814, one of the examiners to the university. In 1826 he was
                    chosen Camden Professor of Ancient History; and during his five years’
                    professorship he published an edition of the <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi> of
                    Aristotle with selected notes for the use of students, and a course of his
                    lectures on <hi rend="italic">The Coinage of the Greeks and Romans.</hi> In 1831
                    he took his degree of D.D., and was called to the post of principal of St
                    Alban’s Hall, which he held till his death. He published in 1837 a student’s
                    edition of the Greek Testament, with the text divided into paragraphs, and
                    furnished with various readings and notes, and accompanied page for page by the
                    English authorized version. In the same year appeared his edition of the Greek
                    and Latin texts of the <hi rend="italic">History of the Jewish War,</hi> by
                    Josephus, with illustrative notes. But his most important labours were in the
                    field of English Church History. He projected an extensive work, which was to
                    embrace the entire synodical history of the church in England, and was to be
                    founded on Wilkins’s <hi rend="italic">Concilia.</hi> Of this work he executed
                    some portions only. ' The first published of these was <hi rend="italic"
