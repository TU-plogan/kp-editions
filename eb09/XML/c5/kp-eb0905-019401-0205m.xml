                    Mauvissière</hi></label> (c. 1520-1592), a French soldier and diplomatist,
                    ambassador to Queen Elizabeth, was born in Touraine about 1520. He was one of a
                    large family of children, and his grandfather, Pierre de Castelnau, was equerry
                    to Louis XII. Endowed with a clear and penetrating intellect and remarkable
                    strength of memory, he received a careful education, and made rapid progress in
                    his studies. To complete his education he travelled in Italy and made a long
                    stay at Rome. He then spent some time in the Island of Malta, afterwards entered
                    the army, and made his first acquaintance with the art of war in the chequered
                    compaigns of the French in Italy. His abilities and his courage won for him the
                    friendship and protection of the cardinal of Lorraine, who took him into his
                    service. In 1557 a command in the navy was given to him, and the cardinal
                    proposed to get him knighted. This, however, he declined, and then rejoined the
                    French army in Picardy. Various delicate missions requiring tact and discretion
                    were entrusted to him by the constable de Montmorency, and these he discharged
                    so satisfactorily that he was sent by the king, Henry IL, to Scotland, with
                    despatches for Mary Stuart, then betrothed to the Dauphin (afterwards Francis
                    II). From Scotland he passed into England, and treated with Queen Elizabeth
                    respecting her claims on Calais (1559), a settlement of which was effected at
                    the congress of Cambray. Castelnau was next sent, with the title of ambassador,
                    to the princes of Germany, for the purpose of prevailing upon them to withdraw
                    their favour from the Protestants. This embassy was followed by missions to
                    Margaret of Parma, governess of the Netherlands, to Savoy, and then to Rome, to
                    ascertain the views of Pope Paul IV. with regard to France. Paul having died
                    just before his arrival, Castelnau used his influence in favour of the election
                    of Pius IV. Returning to France he once more entered the navy, and served under
                    his former patron. It was his good fortune, at Nantes, to discover the earliest
                    symptoms of the conspiracy of Amboise, which he immediately reported to the
                    Government, After the death of Francis II. (December 1560), he accompanied the
                    queen, Mary Stuart, to Scotland, and remained with her a year, during which time
                    he made several journeys into England, and attempted to bring about a
                    reconciliation between Mary and Queen Elizabeth. The wise and moderate counsels
                    which he offered to the former were unheeded. In 1562, in consequence of the
                    civil war in France, he returned there. He was employed against the Protestants
                    in Brittany, was taken prisoner in an engagement with them and sent to Havre,
                    but was soon after exchanged. In the midst of the excited passions of his
                    countrymen, Castelnau, who was a sincere Catholic, maintained a wise
                    self-control and moderation, and by his counsels rendered valuable service to
                    the Government. He served at the siege of Rouen, distinguished himself at the
                    battle of Dreux, took Tancarville, and contributed in 1563 to the recapture of
                    Havre from the English. During the next ten years Castelnau was employed in
                    various important missions;—first to Queen Elizabeth, to negotiate a peace; next
                    to the duke of Alba, the new governor of the Netherlands. On this occasion he
                    discovered the project formed by Condé and Coligny to seize and carry off the
                    royal family at Monceaux (1567). After the battle of St Denis he was again sent
                    to Germany to solicit aid against the Protestants; and on his return he was
                    rewarded for his services with the post of governor of Saint-Dizier, and a
                    company of orderlies. At the head of his company he took part in the battles of
                    Jarnac and Moncontour. In 1572 .he was sent to England by Charles IX,, to allay
                    the excitement created by the massacre of St Bartholomew; and the same year he
                    was sent to Germany and Switzerland. Two years later he was reappointed by Henry
                    HI. ambassador to Queen Elizabeth, and he remained at her court for ten years.
                    During this period he used his influence to promote the marriage of the queen
                    with the duke of Alençon, with a view especially to strengthen and maintain the
                    alliance of the two countries. But Elizabeth made so many promises only to break
                    them that at last he refused to accept them or communicate them to his
                    Government. On his return to France he found that his château of La Mauvissière
                    had been destroyed in the civil war; and as he refused to recognize the
                    authority of the League, the duke of Guise deprived him of the governorship of
                    Saint-Dizier. He was thus brought almost to a state of destitution. But on the
                    accession of Henry IV., the king, who knew his worth, and was confident that
                    although he was a Catholic he might rely on his fidelity, gave him a command in
                    the army, and entrusted him with various confidential missions. Castelnau died
                    at Joinville in 1592. The <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> left by this great
                    diplomatist rank very high among the original authorities for the period they
                    cover, the eleven years between 1559 and 1570. They were-written during his last
                    embassy in England for the benefit of his son; and they possess the merits of
                    clearness, veracity, and impartiality. They were first printed in 1621; again,
                    with additions by Le Laboureur, in 2 vols, folio, in 1659; and a third time,
                    still further enlarged by Jean Godefroy, 3 vols, folio, in 1731. Castelnau
                    translated into French the Latin work of Ramus <hi rend="italic">On the Manners
                    and Customs of the Ancient Gauls.</hi> Various letters of his are preserved in
                    the Cottonian and Harleian collections in the British Museum.</p>
