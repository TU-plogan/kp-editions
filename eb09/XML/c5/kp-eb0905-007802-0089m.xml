                    of Hatfield &lt;fc Co.’s patent wroughtiron capstans as used in the Royal Navy.
                    It has a vertical spindle D, passing through sockets firmly secured in the deck,
                    a drumhead E being keyed on to the spindle, and the capstan is turned round by
                    means of bars inserted in holes made to receive them all round the edge of the
                    drumhead. A capstan of the kind shown would have about twenty holes for bars,
                    and each bar would be about 15 feet in length. The capstan bars are made of
                    tough wood, such as American ash or rock elm. Three or four men can stand to
                    each bar, so that when the capstan is fully manned at least sixty men are
                    employed. When a hempen cable or a hawser is brought to the capstan, three turns
                    are taken round the barrel GG, and men are stationed to haul on the end of the
                    rope to prevent it from slipping, and to coil it up as it comes in. When a chain
                    cable is brought to the capstan it is passed round the “whelps” at H, and is
                    kept upon them by the rollers <hi rend="italic">a, a, a, a,</hi> as shown in the
                    plan (fig. 2), so that the cable assumes the position shown at ABC, A being
                    towards its outer and C towards its inner end.</p>
                <p>Capstans in their primitive form were merely blocks of wood wrought to the
                    required shape and made to traverse ' on an iron spindle, and improvements have
                    been gradually effected in them, some important ones being introduced by Captain
                    Phillips, R.N. In all these capstans the cable was brought in by means of a
                    “messenger” (see article <hi rend="smallcaps">Cable)</hi>; but in 1857 Mr Thomas
                    Brown took out a patent for dispensing with the messenger, and working the cable
                    itself on the capstan by fitting a grooved pulley with guide rollers for
                    securing the requisite amount of turn of the chain, as before described, at ABC.
                    Subsequently important improvements were introduced into the details of this
                    invention, particularly in making the stops or whelps δ, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> which hold the links movable, so that they may be adjusted to fit the
                    links of the cable exactly, and also admitting of their renewal when worn.</p>
                <p>The capstan shown in figs. 1, 2, and 3 is constructed of wrought iron, no
                    cast-iron or wood being used. It is fitted with treble purchase gear, which is a
                    simplification of Captain Phillips’s original power capstan, and has the
                    advantage of the toothed gearing remaining at rest with respect to the capstan,
                    when the single purchase only is required. The treble power is obtained by
                    withdrawing the connecting bolts <hi rend="italic">c,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> from the capstan barrel, and locking the plate <hi rend="italic">d,</hi>
                    which carries the intermediate pinions <hi rend="italic">e,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> to a fixed point in the deck, by sliding the horizontal
                    paul ∕ into one of the recesses <hi rend="italic">g, g</hi> provided for the
                    purpose. The action then is as follows :—The drumhead E, which is keyed to the
                    spindle D, drives the centre pinion <hi rend="italic">k</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> this drives the intermediate pinions <hi rend="italic">e, e,</hi> which
                    rotate around their centres, as the pinion plate <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is
                    fixed to the deck by the paul <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    these pinions in their turn drive the annular wheel <hi rend="italic">I,</hi>
                    which forms part of the capstan proper.</p>
                <p>In large ships the spindle D is frequently continued down to the deck below, and
                    another capstan is worked on it. In such cases the two capstans are so arranged
                    that they may be worked either separately or together; thus, if required, the
                    power applied by the men on both capstans may be brought to bear on a chain or
                    hawser attached to either. In large ships of the navy and in many merchant
                    vessels steam power is employed to drive the forward capstan, which is the one
                    most used. Small engines specially constructed for this purpose, and secured to
                    the under side of the deck beams at K are generally used. All capstans are
                    provided with pauls to prevent them from running back.</p>
                <p>Figs.1 and 4 show a new form of “cable-holder,” which has been recently
                    introduced by Mr W. H. Harfield of Lon <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n90/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0090-0079"/> don, and is in use in a few ships of British and
                    foreign navies. The cable-holder is placed on the fore side of the deck pipe,
                    and is fitted with a grooved pulley Μ for the cable to pass over, similar to the
                    whelps of the capstan shown in fig. 1. It revolves on a horizontal spindle fixed
                    to the deck by brackets. The interior is made hollow, and contains a double
                    series of disks, which can be screwed together by means of a hand-lever L,
                    thereby causing sufficient friction to let the cable run out slowly, or to stop
                    it entirely, and also to hold the ship when riding at anchor. Means have been
                    devised, and are now being fitted in one of the ships of the British navy for
                    connecting these “cable-holders” with the capstan, so that the cable may be hove
                    up by them without taking it to the capstan. (τ. Μ.)</p>
