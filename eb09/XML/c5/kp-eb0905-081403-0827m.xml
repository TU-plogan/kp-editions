                    rend="smallcaps">Claude</hi></label><hi rend="smallcaps">Gelée</hi> (1600-1682),
                    the celebrated landscape-painter, was born of very poor parents at the village
                    of Chamagne in Lorraine. When it was discovered that he'made no progress at
                    school, he was apprenticed, it is commonly said, to a pastry-cook, but this is
                    extremely dubious. At the age of twelve, being left an orphan, he went to live
                    at Freiburg with an elder brother, Jean Gelée, a wood-carver of moderate merit,
                    and under him he designed arabesques and foliage. He afterwards rambled to Rome
                    to seek a livelihood; but from his clownishness and ignorance of the language,
                    he failed to obtain permanent employment. He next went to Naples, to study
                    landscape painting under Godfrey Waals, a painter of much repute. With him he
                    remained two years; then he returned to Rome, and was domesticated until April
                    1625 with another landscape-painter, Augustin Tassi, who hired him to grind his
                    colours and to do all the household drudgery. His master, hoping to make Claude
                    serviceable in some of his greatest works, advanced him in the rules of
                    perspective and the elements of design. Under his tuition the mind of Claude
                    began to expand, and he devoted himself to artistic study with great eagerness.
                    He exerted his utmost industry to explore the true principles of painting by an
                    incessant examination of nature; and for this purpose he made his studies in the
                    open fields, where he very frequently remained from sunrise till sunset,
                    watching the effect of the shifting light upon the landscape. He generally
                    sketched whatever he thought beautiful or striking, marking every tinge of light
                    with a similar colour; from these sketches he perfected his landscapes. Leaving
                    Tassi, he made a tour in Italy, France, and a part of Germany, including his
                    native Lorraine, suffering numerous misadventures by the way. Karl Dervent,
                    painter to the duke of Lorraine, kept him as assistant for a year; and he
                    painted at Nancy the architectural subjects on the ceiling of the Carmelite
                    church. He did not, however, relish this employment, and in 1627 returned to
                    Rome. Here, painting two landscapes for Cardinal Bentivoglio, he earned the
                    protection of Pope Urban VIII. and rapidly rose into celebrity.</p>
                <p>Claude was not only acquainted with the facts, but also with the laws, of nature;
                    and Sandrart relates that he used to explain, as they walked together through
                    the fields, the causes of the different appearances of the same landscape at
                    different hours of the day, from the reflections or refractions of light, or
                    from the morning and evening dews or vapours, with all the precision of a
                    natural philosopher. He elaborated his pictures with great care; and if any
                    performance fell short of his ideal, he altered, erased, and repainted it
                    several times over.</p>
                <p>His skies are aerial and full of lustre, and every object harmoniously illumined.
                    His distances and colouring are delicate, and his tints have a sweetness and
                    variety till then unexampled. He frequently gave an uncommmon tenderness to his
                    finished trees by glazing. His figures, however, are very indifferent; but he
                    was so conscious of his deficiency in this respect, that he usually engaged
                    other artists to paint them for him, among whom were Curtois and Filippo Lauri.
                    Indeed, he was wont to say that he sold his landscapes and gave away his
                    figures. In order to avoid a repetition of the same subject, and also to detect
                    the very numerous spurious copies of his works, he made tinted outline drawings
                    (in six paper-books prepared for this purpose) of all those pictures which were
                    transmitted to different countries; and on the back of each drawing he wrote the
                    name of the purchaser. These books he named <hi rend="italic">Libri</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">di Verità.</hi> This valuable work has been engraved and
                    published, and has always been highly esteemed by students of the art of
                    landscape. Claude died at Rome at the age of eighty-two, on the 21st of November
                    1682, leaving his wealth, which was considerable, between his only surviving
                    relatives, a nephew and niece. Many choice specimens of his genius may be seen
                    in the National Gallery, and in the Louvre; the landscapes in the Altieri and
                    Colonna Palaces in Rome are also of especial celebrity. He himself regarded a
                    landscape which he painted in the Villa Madama, being a cento of various views
                    with great abundance and variety of leafage, and a composition of Esther and <pb

                    refused to sell, although Clement IX. offered to cover its surface with gold
                    pieces. He etched a series of twenty-eight landscapes, fine impressions of which
                    are greatly prized. Full of amenity, and deeply sensitive to the graces of
                    nature, Claude has long been deemed the prince of landscape painters, and indeed
                    he must always be accounted a prime leader in that form of art, and in his day a
                    great enlarger and refiner of its province. Within the last century, however, he
                    has been vastly exceeded—in grasp, power, knowledge, subtlety, variety, and
                    general mastery of all kinds—by many painters, one in one quality and another in
                    another; in proof we need only name Turner, whose range, in comparison with
                    Claude’s, was as that of a continent to a canton, or a mountain to a
                    hillock.</p>
                <p>Claude was a man of amiable and simple character, very kind to his pupils, a
                    patient and unwearied worker; in his own sphere of study, his mind was stored
                    (as we have seen) with observation and knowledge, but he continued an unlettered
                    man till his death. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ. r.)</hi></p>
