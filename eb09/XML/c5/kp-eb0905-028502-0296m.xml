                <p><label type="entry">CEDAR</label>, a name applied to several members of the
                    Natural Order <hi rend="italic">Coniferoe.</hi> The word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cedar</hi> (the Greek <hi rend="italic">κέδρος)</hi> is probably derived from
                    the Arabic <hi rend="italic">Kedr,</hi> worth or value, or from <hi
                    rend="italic">Kedrat,</hi> strong. The name has been supposed by some to have
                    taken its origin from the brook Cedron, in Judaea.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Abies</hi><hi rend="italic">Cedrus</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Cedrus Libani,</hi> the far-famed Cedar of Lebanon, is a tree
                    which, on account of its beauty, stateliness, and strength, has always been a
                    favourite with poets and painters; and which, in the figurative language of
                    prophecy, is frequently employed in the Scriptures as a symbol of power,
                    prosperity, and longevity. It grows to a vertical height of from 50 to 80
                    feet—“exalted above all trees of the field,” and at an elevation of about 6000
                    feet above sea-level. In the young tree, the bole is straight and upright, and
                    one or two leading branches rise above the rest. As the tree increases in size,
                    however, the upper branches become mingled together, and the tree is then
                    clump-headed. Numerous lateral ramifying branches spread out from the main trunk
                    in a horizontal direction, tier upon tier, covering a compass of ground the
                    diameter of which is often greater than the height of the tree. Gilpin, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Forest Scenery,</hi> describes a cedar which, at an age of
                    about 118 years, had attained to a height of 53 feet, and had a horizontal
                    expanse of 96 feet. The branchlets of the cedar take the same direction as the
                    branches, and the foliage is very dense and close-woven. The tree, as with the
                    rest of the fir-tribe, except the larch, is evergreen; the leaves are renewed
                    every spring, but their fall is gradual. In shape the leaves are straight,
                    tapering, cylindrical, and pointed; they are about an inch long, and of a dark
                    green colour, and grow in alternate tufts of about thirty in number. The male
                    and female flowers grow on the same tree, but are separate. The cones, which are
                    on the upper side of the branches, are flattened at the ends, and are 4 or 5
                    inches in length, and 2 inches wide; they take two years to come to perfection,
                    and while growing exude much resin. The scales are close pressed to one another,
                    and are reddish in colour. The seeds are provided with a long membranous wing.
                    The root of the tree is very strong, and ramifying. The cedar flourishes best on
                    sandy loamy soils. It still grows on Lebanon, eleven groves having been
                    described by the American missionary Jessup; and probably is to be found over
                    the whole group of mountains lying between Damascus and Tripoli in Syria, which
                    comprehends, besides Lebanon, the Mounts Taurus and Amanus of the ancients.
                    Lamartine tells us that the Arabs regard the trees as endowed with the
                    principles of continual existence, and with reasoning and prescient powers,
                    which enable them to prepare for the changes of the seasons. The best known
                    group in the Lebanon range consists of twelve very ancient trees amidst a grove
                    of about 400 younger ones—apparently the yellow cedars spoken of by Lamartine.
                    They occupy little knolls in the Jebel-el Arz, a recess or hollow near the
                    highest point of the mountains, about 15 miles from the sea. One tree on the
                    southern side has a circumference of 42 feet at its base. Lord Lindsay mentions
                    two other cedars on the northern edge of the grove, one 63, and another 49 feet
                    in girth. The number of the trees has been slowly decreasing since 1550, when
                    Belon counted twenty-eight of them; nearly 200 years later, when Dr Pococke
                    visited Syria, only 15 were to be seen. The wood of the cedar of Lebanon is
                    fragrant, though not so strongly scented as that of the juniper or red-cedar of
                    America. It appears that the wood may be hard in portions, and sufficiently
                    close-grained and compact to be carved,—the fibre in mountain-cedars being finer
                    than in those grown on plains. The wood is, however, generally described as a
                    reddish-white light material, of a coarse grain and spongy texture, easy to
                    work, but liable to shrink and warp. Dr Pococke affirms that it does not differ
                    in appearance from white deal, nor does it seem to be harder. As a firewood, it
                    is said to be inferior, burning quickly and evolving but little heat.</p>
                <p>The cedar of Lebanon is cultivated in Europe for ornament only. It can be grown
                    in parks and gardens, and thrives well; but the young plants are unable to bear
                    great variations of temperature. According to Gilpin, the English cedar in its
                    maturer age becomes shrivelled and deformed, the body increasing, whilst the
                    limbs shrink. In the Botanic Gardens at Chelsea are two cedars, planted there in
                    1683, which have probably lived upwards of 200 years. At Caen Wood, Hampshire,
                    are four trees which have been growing since 1756, and are as much as 100 feet
                    in height. The first cedars in Scotland were planted at Hopetoun House in 1740;
                    and the first one said to have been introduced into France was brought from
                    England by Bernard de Jussieu in 1734, and placed in the Jardin des Plantes.
                    Cedar-wood is earliest noticed in Leviticus xiv. 4, 6, where it is prescribed
                    among the materials to be used for the cleansing of leprosy; but the wood there
                    spoken of was probably that of the juniper. The term <hi rend="italic">Eres</hi>
                    (cedar) of Scripture does not apply strictly to one kind of plant, but was used
                    indefinitely in ancient times, as is the word cedar at present The term <hi
                    rend="italic">arz</hi> is applied by the Arabs to the cedar of Lebanon, to the
                    common pine-tree, and to the juniper; and certainly the “cedars” for masts,
                    mentioned in Ezek. xxvii. 5, must have been pine-trees. It seems very probable
                    that the fourscore thousand hewers employed by Solomon for cutting timber did
                    not confine their operations simply to what would now be termed cedars and
                    fir-trees. Dr Lindley considers that some of the cedar-trees sent by Hiram, king
                    of Tyre, to Jerusalem may have been procured from Mount Atlas, and have been
                    identical with the <hi rend="italic">Callitris quadrù vαlυis,</hi> or arar-tree,
                    the wood of which is hard and durable, and was much in request in former times
                    for the building <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n297/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0297-0286"/> of temples. The timber-work of the roof of
                    Cordova Cathedral, built eleven centuries ago, is composed of it. In the time of
                    Vitruvius “cedars” were growing in Crete, Africa, and Syria. Pliny says that
                    their wood was everlasting, and therefore images of the gods were made of it; he
                    makes mention also of the oil of cedar, or <hi rend="italic">cedrium.,</hi>
                    distilled from the wood, and used by the ancients for preserving their books
                    from moths and damp: papyri anointed or rubbed with cedrium were on this account
                    called <hi rend="italic">cedrati</hi><hi rend="italic">libri.</hi> Drawers of
                    cedar or chips of the wood are now employed to protect furs and woollen stuffs
                    from injury by moths. Cedar-wood, however, is said by Dr Fleming to be injurious
                    to natural history objects and to instruments placed in cabinets made of it, as
                    the resinous matter of the wood becomes deposited upon them. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cedria,</hi> or cedar resin, is a substance similar to mastic, that flows from
                    incisions in the tree; and cedar manna is a sweet exudation from its
                    branches.</p>
                <p>There are two sub-species or varieties of <hi rend="italic">Abies</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cedrus</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">Α.
                    Deodara,</hi> the deodar, or “god tree” of the Himalayas, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Α.</hi><hi rend="italic">atlantica,</hi> of the Atlas range, North Africa. The
                    deodar flourishes in all the higher mountains from Nepal up to Kashmir, at an
                    elevation of from 5500 to 12,000 feet; on the peaks to the northern side of the
                    Boorung Pass, it grows to a height of 60 to 70 feet before branching. The wood
                    is close-grained, long-fibred, perfumed, and highly resinous, and resists the
                    action of water. The foliage is of a grey-green, the leaves are slender, and the
                    twigs are thinner than those of <hi rend="italic">A. Cedrus.</hi> The tree is
                    employed for a variety of useful purposes, especially in building. It is now
                    much cultivated in England as an ornamental plant. <hi rend="italic">A.
                    atlantica</hi> has shorter and denser leaves than <hi rend="italic">A.
                    Cedrus;</hi> its wood also is hard, and more rapid in growth than is that of the
                    ordinary cedar. It is found at an altitude above the sea of from 7000 to 9000
                    feet.</p>
                <p>The name cedar is applied to a variety of trees. The Bermuda cedar <hi
                    rend="italic">(Juniperus</hi><hi rend="italic">bermudianà)</hi> and the red or
                    American cedar <hi rend="italic">(J. υirgiηiaηa)</hi> are both much used in
                    joinery and in the manufacture of pencils; though other woods are now
                    superseding them for pencil-making. The Japanese cedar <hi rend="italic"
                    >(CryptomeriajaponicP)</hi> is a kind of cypress, the wood of which is very
                    durable. Another species of cypress <hi rend="italic">(Cupressus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">thyoiχles),</hi> found in swamps in the south of Ohio and
                    Massachusetts, is known as the American white cedar. It has small leaves and
                    fibrous bark, and is much used for making fences and coopers’ staves. The
                    Spanish cedar is a name applied to the <hi rend="italic">Juniperus
                    thurifera,</hi> and also to another species, <hi rend="italic">J.
                    oxycedrus.</hi> The latter was much used by the Greeks for making images; and
                    its empyreumatic oil, Huile de Cade, is used medicinally for skin-diseases. A
                    species of cypress which has been naturalized in the neighbourhood of Cintra is
                    known as the cedar of Goa. The order <hi rend="italic">Cedrelaceoe</hi> (which
                    is entirely distinct from the Conifers) includes, along with the mahoganies and
                    other valuable timber trees, the Jamaica and the Australian red cedars. The
                    cedar-wood of Guiana, used for making canoes, is a species of the Natural Order
                    <hi rend="italic">Amyridoeeoe, Idea altissima.</hi></p>
                <p>The importation of woods classed as cedars into Great Britain has been free from
                    duty since 1866, when the imports were 5647 tons, valued at £59,224.</p>
