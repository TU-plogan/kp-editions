                    the time of the plague which ravaged Genoa in 1497 and 1501, died in that city
                    in 1510, was canonized by Clement XII. in 1737, and had her name placed in the

                    Florence, born of that noble family in 1522, who became a nun in the convent of
                    the Dominicans at Prato, died in 1589, and was canonized by Benedict XIV. in
                    1746, who fixed her festal day on the 13th February.</p>
                <p>AU these women are recorded by the chroniclers of the Roman Church to have worked
                    miracles. Indeed without this essential qualification they could not have been
                    canonized. The lives of all, save that of Catherine of Genoa, whose career was a
                    more active one, having been spent mainly in the hospitals of her native city,
                    were passed in the practice of the ordinary monastic virtues. St Catherine de’
                    Ricci was subject to long trances and visions. And of St Catherine of Genoa it
                    is recorded, that that miracle of levitation (or being raised from the ground),
                    which is asserted with such curious frequency to have happened to various
                    saints, frequently happened to her, when she was in the act of receiving the
                    Holy Communion.</p>
                <p>Of aU these saints, however, it wül only be necessary here to say a few words of
                    the earliest of the name, who is the person intended when the Roman Church
                    speaks of St Catherine without any additional designation, and then to give a
                    somewhat more detailed account of the far most celebrated and historicaUy
                    important of them aU, St Catherine of Siena.</p>
                <p>History has exceedingly little to tell of this saint; history, more properly so
                    called, indeed, has nothing at aU. She is said to have been of royal parentage,
                    and her life is referred to the early part of the 4th century. She was martyred
                    at Alexandria. She was especially celebrated for her learning and philosophical
                    culture, and has always been considered the especial patron of philosophical
                    schools. But in proportion to the scantiness of authenticated fact, legendary
                    fable has been abundant in furnishing forth lives of the saint. And it is to one
                    of these legends that the well-known presentiment of the saint, which alone is
                    likely to cause modern readers to feel any interest in her name, is due. It is
                    said that in revenge for the discomfiture of a company of heathen philosophers,
                    with whom she had been compelled to dispute, the holy and learned lady was bound
                    to a wheel armed with spikes, in such sort that every turn of the machine would
                    cause the spikes to pierce her body. But the cords were miraculously broken, and
                    the malice of her enemies foiled. Hence St Catherine, virgin and martyr, is
                    always represented with a wheel, and the extreme popularity of this saint, and
                    consequent commonness of the pictures of her, is indicated by the fact that a
                    wheel of a certain construction and appearance is to the present day called a
                    Catherine wheel. The lover of mediaeval painting may be warned against mistaking
                    the pictures, which he so constantly meets with, of St Catherine with her wheel,
                    for representations of St Catherine of Siena, or of any of the other saints
                    Catherine, who all of them lived a thousand years or more later than the first
                    and original saint of the name.</p>
                <p>St Catherine of Siena, born in that city in tne year 1347, was a daughter of
                    Giacomo Benincasa, said by the hagiographers to have been a descendant of the
                    noble family of Borghese, also of Sienese origin,—a connection, however, which
                    has been repudiated by the nobles of that subsequently Papal family. It seems
                    certain, however, that the two families were sprung from the same stock. The
                    researches of Signor Grottanelli, the present librarian of the municipal library
                    at Siena, have enabled him to construct a pedigree of the saint, which may be
                    considered as perfectly authentic, from which it appears that she was one of
                    thirteen children; and that her father Giacomo, who died when she was
                    one-and-twenty, in 1368, had been one of ten. Her mother Lapa, who was the
                    grand-daughter of a “poeta volgare,”—that is to say, a poet who wrote in the
                    then nascent Italian tongue,—lived to be eighty-nine.</p>

                <p>To her and to one of her brothers, and to two of her nieces, sundry of the
                    saint’s letters are addressed</p>
                <p>As is usual in the Roman hagiography, the first and contemporary biographer of St
                    Catherine, her confessor, the Dominican friar Raimondo (he was great-grandson of
                    the celebrated Pietro delie Vigne, the chancellor of the Emperor Frederick II.,
                    and became the 24th general of the Dominican order), insists largely on the
                    tendency towards sanctity which marked Catherine in her earliest years. The
                    austerities and self-inflictions by which she prepared herself for her career,
                    and gave proof of her vocation to those around her, began at an incredibly early
                    age, and went on increasing in intensity till they pass from the probable to the
                    highly improbable, and thence to the manifestly miraculous. At five years old it
                    was her practice in going up stairs to kneel at each step to the Virgin. She
                    habitually flogged herself and induced other children to do the same, at six
                    years of age. At seven she deprived herself of a great portion of her food,
                    secretly giving it to her brother, or throwing it to the cats. At the same age
                    she would watch from the window to see when a Dominican monk passed, and as soon
                    as he had moved on, would run down and kiss the spot of the pavement on which he
                    had placed his feet. At twelve years old her mother begged her to comb her hair
                    and wash her face offener. But this she steadily refused to do, till her mother
                    requested a married sister to use her influence with Catherine, to which for a
                    time she yielded to a certain degree. This yielding, however, she often in
                    after-life, as her confessor testified, bewailed with bitter tears of penitence,
                    always mentioning it, when she made, as she was in the habit of doing
                    frequently, a general confession of her sins.</p>
                <p>About the same period of Catherine’s life, her twelfth year, she wholly abandoned
                    the use of animal food. At fifteen she left off wine. At twenty she gave up
                    bread, living only on uncooked vegetables. She used to sleep but one quarter of
                    an hour in the four and twenty. She always flogged herself till the blood
                    streamed from her three times a day. She lived three years without speaking. She
                    wore a chain of iron round her body, which gradually ate its way into her flesh.
                    And, finally, she remained wholly without food for many years. Catherine began,
                    we ate told, to have visions at six years old. Returning home one day, about
                    that time, through the streets of Siena, she saw in the sky, immediately over
                    the Dominican Church, a throne with Christ sitting on it, dressed in Papal
                    robes, accompanied by St PauI, St Peter, and St John.</p>
                <p>But these practices of her infancy, and these early visions were but preparatory
                    to the wonders of a later period. Christ appeared to her daily as soon as she
                    retired to her cell, as she informed Father Raimondo, for the purpose of
                    teaching her the doctrines of religion, which, as she said to her confessor, “no
                    man or woman ever taught me, but only Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, sometimes
                    by means of inspiration, and sometimes by means of a clear bodily appearance,
                    manifest to the bodily senses, and talking with me, as I now talk with you.” A
                    detailed account of these manifestations will be found in the pages of Father
                    Raimondo.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to give some account of one miraculous occurrence, which was
                    deemed the great and culminating glory of the saint, and has occupied the most
                    prominent position in her estimation by the church, and in the imaginations of
                    her admirers. This is the supernatural impression on her hands and feet of the
                    scars of wounds corresponding with those made in the hands and feet of the
                    Saviour by the nails which fixed Him to the cross. This is stated to have
                    occurred at Pisa, and is asserted by Father Raimondo to have happened in his
                    presence. Catherine had received the sacrament, and fell, as usual with her at
                    such times, into a trance. Her confessor and some others were awaiting her
                    recovery from it, when they saw her suddenly rise with a start to a kneeling
                    posture, with her arms stretched out horizontally, and in a minute or two more
                    fall prostrate. Soon afterwards she came out of her trance, and immediately
                    calling aside her confessor said, “Be it known to you, my father, that I now
                    bear on my body the marks of the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ.” “And I,”
                    continues Father Raimondo, “having told her that I had observed as much from the
                    movements of her body, while she was in her trance, asked her in what manner the
                    Lord had performed that miracle ì And she said, ‘ I saw the crucified Lord
                    descending towards me with a great light, which caused me, from the impetus of
                    my soul to meet its Creator, to raise up my body. Then I saw five bloody rays
                    descending from the scars of his most holy wounds, and directing themselves to
                    the hands and feet and heart of my body. Upon which, knowing what the mystery
                    was, I exclaimed, 0, Lord, my God, let not, I pray you, the scars appear
                    externally on my body, it is enough for me to have them internally. Then, while
                    I was yet speaking, the rays, before they reached me, turned from blood-colour
                    to a pure and splendid light, and touched the five parts of my body—that is my
                    hands, my feet, and my heart.’ I asked her further, Do you now feel in those
                    spots any sensible painî To which, with a deep sigh, she replied, ‘ So great is
                    the pain I feel in all those five places, but especially in my heart, that it
                    appears impossible to me to live many days, unless the Lord perform some further
                    miracle.’”</p>
                <p>In order to appreciate the importance and bearing of this celebrated miracle, the
                    fierce and bitter rivalry which existed between the Dominicans and Franciscans
                    must be borne in mind. St Francis had, some half century previously, received
                    these five wounds in the same way. The marks are familiarly known among
                    hagiographers and their readers as the <hi rend="italic">Stigmata</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and the having received them was considered the crowning
                    glory of St Francis, and was the exclusive boast of his Franciscans. But now the
                    Dominicans were even with them. The Sienese Pope, who canonized his townswoman
                    Catharine, Pius IL, gave his approbation to a service, in which this reception
                    of the <hi rend="italic">stigmata</hi> was prominently asserted. And so severely
                    was the blow felt by the indignant Franciscans that they obtained from the next
                    Pope but one, Sixtus IV., himself a Franciscan, a decree to the effect that St
                    Francis had an exclusive right to and monopoly of that especial miracle, and
                    that it was accordingly forbidden to represent St Catherine receiving the <hi
                    rend="italic">stigmata</hi> under pain of ecclesiastical censures. The tendency
                    observable in many of the austerities and miracles said to have been suffered
                    and done by St Catherine, to outdo the austerities and miracles of other saints,
                    especially St Francis, is particularly remarkable in this of the <hi
                    rend="italic">stigmata.</hi> The degree in which it served the purpose of the
                    Dominicans is the measure of the suspicion attaching to it. But there is nothing
                    incredible in the supposition that Catherine may have imagined in her trance all
                    that she had related; and still less is it unlikely that such diseased dreamings
                    may have been the natural product of a waking fancy, filled with, and dwelling
                    on, this much envied manifestation. Perhaps the condition, so providently
                    introduced, as it would seem, that the scars were not to be visible, may be
                    suggestive of a fraudulent intention. But on the other hand, it may be observed
                    that if such a fraud had been planned, it would have been easy for one, who
                    habitually subjected her body to so much suffering, to submit to the required
                    wounds beforehand. It will, however, probably be felt by most readers of the
                    above quoted narrative of Father Raimondo that it bears on the face of it many
                    of the marks of untruth <pb break="no"

                    what was taking place from the movements of her body would seem to be very
                    suggestive of a foregone purpose and plan. On the other hand it may be argued
                    that this is so obvious, that the monk would never have committed himself to
                    such a statement had not it been the simple truth.</p>
                <p>The celebrated and learned Tomasseo, whose literary reputation probably stands
                    higher with his countrymen than that of any other living writer, and who is the
                    latest writer on St Catherine, accepting her works and character in the spirit
                    of an enthusiastic devotee, writes in the essay on St Catherine, which he has
                    prefixed to the latest edition of her works (4* vols., Florence, 1860), as
                    follows: “If by the mere play of the imagination a person, who has had a limb
                    cut off, feels, nevertheless, pain in the part which has been removed; if the
                    force of thought often creates bodily ills and cures them, it would be in
                    contradiction to all philosophy and all the laws of criticism to deny that a
                    woman rendered by love profoundly apprehensive of the sufferings of another, may
                    feel pain in her own person, in that same spot of the body where the loved
                    person feels or felt it. It would be to deny to Catherine that privilege of
                    sympathizing piety and tender humanity, which we grant to the French mother, who
                    exclaims, <hi rend="italic">Pai</hi><hi rend="italic">mal à la poitrine de ma
                    fille</hi><hi rend="italic">1</hi> And for Catherine Jesus was alive, was
                    present in her heart, in her eyes. All her being, as all the world, was full of
                    him.” The recognized phenomenon, however, to which the eloquent philologist
                    refers is a purely physiological one; and it is for physiologists to determine
                    what amount of analogy may be discoverable between that known fact and the
                    sensation of bodily pain from which Catherine declared herself to be suffering,
                    when she had recovered from her trance <hi rend="italic">;—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">or</hi> rather that respecting which Catherine is said to have
                    made such a declaration by the Dominican her confessor and biographer. For in
                    weighing the extremely curious question of the amount of conscious imposture
                    which may probably be supposed to have been mingled with other elements in the
                    extraordinary narrative, it is very necessary to remember that we have the
                    testimony and statements of Catherine only through the medium of the general of
                    the order, to the fame and glory of which Catherine’s saintly fame and glory was
                    so all-important.</p>
                <p>It is important to observe in this connection that various statements of her
                    confessor will leave little doubt On the minds of t <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> mse who have made that form of malady called catalepsy their study, or
                    even of those who have witnessed the phenomena attending it, that Catherine was
                    subject to constantly-recurring attacks of catalepsy. And physicians will
                    probably deem the hint above thrown out, to the effect that the saint was in the
                    habit of throwing herself into this state “as much as she could,” not
                    unimportant. It is unnecessary in this place to do more than call attention by a
                    passing word to the very remarkable similarity between some of the phenomena
                    described by Father Raimondo and those attending many very well-known cases of
                    animal magnetism.</p>
                <p>But if doubts and difficulties crowd thickly about the whole of that portion of
                    Saint Catherine’s story which has obtained for her the pre-eminence of
                    saintship, it may be said that the public events of her life, which make part of
                    the undoubted history of her time, are hardly less extraordinary and surprising.
                    In the year 1376, the 29th of Catherine’s life, Gregory XI. was living and
                    holding the Papal court at Avignon. He was the last of seven French Popes in
                    succession who had done so, and had perpetuated for seventy-three years what
                    ecclesiastical writers are fond of terming “the Babylonian captivity of the
                    church.” To put an end to this absenteeism, and to bring back the Papacy to
                    Italy was the cherished and anxious wish of all good Italians, and especially of
                    all Italian churchmen. Petrarch had urgently pressed Urban V., Gregory’s
                    immediate predecessor, to accomplish the desired change; and Dante had at an
                    earlier date laboured to bring about the same object. But both had failed in
                    front of the great difficulties which attended the step. The French cardinals,
                    who surrounded the Pope, were anxious, of course, to detain him in France. The
                    king of France threw all his influence into the same scale. The French Pope’s
                    own prejudices and wishes were, of course, enlisted on the same side. Rome
                    itself and the dominions of the church, which the violences and usurpations of
                    the Roman barons kept in a chronic state of rebellion, made the Eternal City
                    anything but an inviting residence. There was also considerable truth in the
                    representations insisted on by several of the French Popes, that the rising
                    importance of the northern churches bad in a great degree changed the central
                    point of the ecclesiastical world, and that the church could more advantageously
                    be governed from a French than from an Italian city. Thus all the influences
                    which Italy had for many years past striven to bring to bear upon the popes, to
                    induce them to return to their own city had failed. And it was under these
                    circumstances that Catherine, the illiterate daughter of an obscure Sienese
                    dyer, determined to try her powers of persuasion and argument for the
                    accomplishment of that which the princes of the church and the greatest men of
                    Italy bad in vain attempted. For this purpose Catherine proceeded to Avignon in
                    the summer of 1376. And in the September of that year the Pope set out on his
                    return to Rome. It is true that he did this, intending after a sojourn in the
                    Eternal City to return to France, and he would almost certainly have done so,
                    had he not been prevented by death. But the dyer’s daughter did, as things fell
                    out, succeed in her enterprise, and moved the centre of Europe back again once
                    more to its old place in Rome! Of course it may be said that to attribute the
                    Pope’s return to Rome to Catherine’s intervention is a notable instance of a <hi
                    rend="italic">post hoc ergo propter hoc</hi> inference. But many proofs might be
                    given from various writers to show that it was unquestionably believed in her
                    own day that Catherine had been the real moving cause of the restoration of the
                    Papacy to Rome. (See especially Ammirato, <hi rend="italic">Istorie
                    Florentine,</hi> vol. v. p. 130, ed. Flor., 1824.) After many other journeyings
                    she arrived in Rome on the 28th of November 1378, in obedience to the commands
                    of the Pope; and there she died on the 29th of April 1380, at the age of
                    thirty-three. Father Raimondo was then at Genoa, and declares that in that city,
                    at the hour of her death, he heard a voice communicating to him a last message
                    from Catherine, which he afterwards found she had uttered on her deathbed word
                    for word as he heard it, “and of this,” he adds solemnly, “let that Eternal
                    Truth, which can neither deceive nor be deceived, be witness.”</p>
                <p>Catherine’s works consist of a treatise occupying a closely-printed quarto
                    volume, which Father Raimondo describes as “a dialogue between a soul, which
                    asked four questions of the Lord, and the same Lord, who made answer and gave
                    instruction in many most useful truths,”—of her letters, 373 in number, and of
                    26 prayers. The dialogue is entitled, <hi rend="italic">The Book of Divine
                    Doctrine, given in person by God the Father, speaking to the mind of the most
                    glorious and holy virgin Catherine of Siena, and written down as she dictated it
                    in the vulgar tongue, she being the while entranced, and actually hearing what
                    God spoke in her.</hi> The work is declared to have been dictated by the saint
                    in her father’s house in Siena, a little before she went to Rome, and to have
                    been completed on the 13th of October 1378. This dialogue has been divided into
                    five parts, though no such division existed in it as it fell from her lips. The
                    first four parts exist in manuscript, as taken down from the lips of the
                    entranced saint; but the fifth treatise is not extant in the original, but only
                    in the Latin version of Father Raimondo, from which the published Italian
                    version has been re-translated. The French oratorian, Father Casimir Oudin, in
                    his supplement of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n243/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0243-0232"/> ecclesiastical writers, omitted by Bellarιnine,
                    says very quietly, “She wrote, or Raimondo de Vincis wrote in her name, a work
                    inscribed,” &amp;c., &amp;c. And it is very possible that the suspicion
                    indicated may be a just one; but there is nothing in the matter of the work
                    itself to belie the origin attributed to it. It may be remarked, however, that
                    the context, as it stands, does not even pretend to give the unbroken utterances
                    of the saint. It is intermingled, without any advertisement to the reader,
                    typographical or other, that he is about to enter on matter of a different
                    authorship, with long passages descriptive of the saint’s mode of receiving the
                    revelation, written in the person of the secretary. But the saint’s own
                    utterances are exactly such as might have been expected from such a patient.
                    They resemble the worst and emptiest style of the pulpit eloquence of her time
                    and country, and consist entirely of mere verbose and repetitive inanities and
                    platitudes. It is impossible to read them without being strongly reminded of the
                    productions, which have been given forth in these latter days as spiritual
                    communications made to persons in trance or otherwise constituting themselves
                    “mediums,”—a similarity which suggests sundry curious considerations. The most
                    probable supposition seems to be that these “dialogues” were composed by Father
                    Raimondo, from notes taken down from Catherine’s trance ramblings. The 26
                    prayers might have been expected to throw more light on the character and mental
                    calibre of the saint, whose communings with the Infinite they represent. But
                    nothing of the kind is to be gathered from them. The impression they are
                    calculated to produce is either that the saint λvas a self-conscious actor and
                    pretender, or that they are not her compositions,—the latter perhaps being the
                    more probable hypothesis. Though addressed in form to the Deity, there is little
                    in these effusions that can with accuracy be called prayer. The speaker, or
                    rather writer, seems continually to forget his avowed object, and runs off into
                    long statements of the nature and attributes of the Deity, and ecclesiastical
                    positions based thereon, evidently prompted rather by didactic views as to
                    mortal hearers, than by effort to hold communion with the Almighty. It is all
                    dry, cold, repetitive, verbose theology, instead of the warm utterances of
                    either a contrite or a thankful heart. It remains to say a few words of the
                    saint’s letters, by far the most interesting and valuable of her reputed works.
                    They are 373 in number, and form two stout quarto volumes of the Lucca edition.
                    In the four octavo volumes of the recent cheap Milan reprint, only the first 198
                    are given, though no word appears to indicate that the collection is imperfect.
                    On the contrary, the fourth volume is entitled “4th and last.” Still more
                    recently the letters have been reprinted by Barbèra at Florence, 1860, in 4
                    vols, small octavo, with a preliminary notice of the saint prefixed by the
                    celebrated Niccolò Tommaseo, consisting of 210 pages. The 373 letters of the
                    entire collection have among them many addressed to kings, popes, cardinals,
                    bishops, conventual bodies, and political corporations, as well as a great
                    number written to private individuals. And it seems very strange that among so
                    many correspondents of classes whose papers are likely to be preserved, and.
                    many of whom, especially the monastic communities, would assuredly have attached
                    a high value to such documents, no one original of any of these documents should
                    have been preserved. Girolamo Gigli, the editor of the quarto edition of the
                    saint’s works, printed at Lucca and Siena, 1707-13, an enthusiastic investigator
                    and collector of every description of information regarding her, gives, in his
                    preface to the letters, a careful account of the manuscript collections from
                    which they have at different times been printed, but has not a word to say of
                    any scrap of original document. The epistles were first printed by Aldus in
                    1500, just 120 years after Catherine’s death. The difficulties connected with
                    the subject of the true authorship of these letters are much complicated by
                    questions respecting Catherine’s capability of writing, and her own statements
                    of the miraculous manner in which she acquired that accomplishment. The
                    discussion of these difficulties would require a larger space than can here be
                    allotted to the subject. And the reader curious on the subject may be referred
                    to a life of the saint by Mr Trollope, from which much of the present notice has
                    been taken. It is admitted on all hands, however, that a large portion of the
                    letters were written by the hands of secretaries. The very high reputation, and
                    that not wholly of a pietistic or ecclesiastical nature, which this large mass
                    of writings has enjoyed for several centuries will probably appear to most
                    English readers an extremely singular fact. A great deal of the praise bestowed
                    on St Catherine’s writings by Italian critics has reference to their style and
                    diction. Written at a time when the language, fresh from the hands of Dante, of
                    Petrarch, and of Boccaccio, was still in its infancy, and in a city at all times
                    celebrated for the purity of its vernacular, they have by the common consent of
                    Italian scholars taken rank as one of the acknowledged classics of the
                    language,—as a <hi rend="italic">testa di lingua,</hi> as the Tuscan purists
                    say. The Della Cruscans have placed them on the jealously-watched list of their
                    authorities, and an enthusiastic Sienese compatriot, the before-mentioned
                    Girolamo Gigli, has completed a <hi rend="italic">vocabulario Caterini-ano,</hi>
                    after the fashion of those consecrated to the study of the works of Homer and
                    Cicero. Of course no one from the “barbarous” side of the Alps can permit
                    himself any word of observation on this point, especially when the judgment is
                    in the main confirmed by the authority of the greatest of living Italian
                    critics, Niccolò Tommaseo. Had no such decisive opinion been extant to guide his
                    ignorance, it might perhaps have seemed to a foreigner that the saint’s style
                    was loose in its syntax, intricate in its construction, and terribly overloaded
                    with the merest verbosity. But the philological excellencies of her writings
                    are, after all, the least part of the praise that has been lavished on Catherine
                    as an author. Her admirers enlarge on the moving eloquence, the exalted piety,
                    the noble sentiments, the sound argumentation of her compositions, especially
                    the letters.</p>
                <p>So large a number of devout writers have occupied their pens on “legends” and
                    biographies of Saint Catherine that it would be far too lengthy a task to
                    attempt to give even a list of them. The public library of Siena contains no
                    less than 79 works of which the popular saint of the city is the subject. Almost
                    all of them, however, seem to be based more or less directly and avowedly on the
                    work of Father Raimondo. And enough has been said to give the reader a
                    sufficient idea of the nature of that book. Of Girolamo Gigli’s <hi
                    rend="italic">V^ocabulario Caieriniano</hi> mention has also been made. Of
                    course it will readily be understood that this work regards the saint’s writings
                    in a purely philological point of view. But the curious fate which attended this
                    work may be noticed. It wαβ burned by the hangman at Florence, not because it
                    was supposed to contain any heterodoxy in matter of religion, but merely because
                    the Della Crusca, which is occasionally somewhat slily satirized in it, was
                    enraged at the position taken up by the author, to the effect that the Sienese
                    is a purer dialect of I talian than the Florentine I The notice of Saint
                    Catherine by Niccolò T&lt;&gt;mmaseo, prefixed to the most recent edition of St
                    Catherine’s works, has also been mentioned. It cannot be called “a life” in any
                    sense. For the author makes no attempt to relate the story of her career, or to
                    examine the evidence for any of the anecdotes which he does relate. It is
                    written in a strain of enthusiastic pietistic admiration, which is certainly
                    curious in the case of a highly-cultured 19th century layman; and its principal
                    value consists in the judgment on the purely literary merits of the writer, by
                    one who must be admitted to be the greatest living critic of Italy. (T. A.
