                    vol. iv. pp. 476-485. CARPET is the name applied in modern times to a woven or
                    felted fabric, made generally of wool, which is used for covering the floors of
                    chambers or for spreading on the ground. The term is probably connected with the
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">tapetes,</hi> whence also comes the word tapestry,
                    which, though now distinctively applied to hangings, was in early times not
                    clearly distinguished from carpeting. Carpets and rugs were originally employed
                    by Oriental nations for sitting, reclining, or devotionally kneeling upon; and
                    when first introduced among Western communities they were also used as covers
                    for tables and couches, or for laying before altars or chairs of state as <hi
                    rend="italic">pedalia</hi> or foot cloths. The processes for making tapestry
                    hangings and carpets being the same, and the distinction of their application
                    being vague, it was chiefly by the nature of the design that any line was, in
                    mediaeval times, drawn between the two classes.</p>
                <p>The mention of carpets dates from a very remote period of antiquity. In Egypt
                    they were first applied to religious purposes by the priests of Heliopolis, and
                    were used to garnish the palaces of the Pharaohs. It was also a custom of
                    antiquity to place them under the couches of guests at banquets. Regarding a
                    carpet rug, which he considers to be of ancient Egyptian manufacture, Sir J.
                    Gardner Wilkinson says,—“This rug is made like many cloths of the present day,
                    with woollen threads, on linen strings. In the centre is the figure of a boy in
                    white, with a goose above, the hieroglyphic of ‘ a child,’ upon a green ground,
                    around which is a border composed of red and blue lines,” &amp;c. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians,</hi> vol. iii. pp.
                    141-2). The carpets of the Homeric age were generally white or plain cloths; but
                    they were also sometimes produced with various colours and embroidered designs.
                    At the supper of Iphicrates, purple carpets were spread on the floor; and at the
                    magnificent banquet of Ptolemy Philadelphus (an account of which is given by
                    Callixenus of Rhodes) we learn that underneath 200 golden couches “were strewed
                    purple <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n139/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0139-0128"/> carpets of the finest wool, with the carpet
                    pattern on both sides; and there were handsomely embroidered rugs, very
                    beautifully elaborated with figures. Besides this,” he adds, “thin Persian
                    cloths covered all the centre space where the guests walked, having most
                    accurate representations of animals embroidered on them” (Athenaeus, v. 26). The
                    Babylonians, who were very skilful in weaving cloths of divers colours (Pliny,
                    viii. 48), delineated upon their carpets entire groups of human figures,
                    together with such fabulous animals as the dragon, the sphynx, and the griffin.
                    These were numbered among the luxuries of Elagabalus. On the tomb of Cyrus was
                    spread a purple Babylonian carpet, and another covered the bed whereon his body
                    was placed (Arrian, vi. 29). These carpets were exported in considerable
                    quantities to Greece and Rome, where they were highly esteemed. The pre-eminence
                    of the ancient Babylonian carpet weavers does not appear ever to have been lost
                    by their successors, and at the present time the carpets of Persia are as much
                    prized and as eagerly sought by European nations as they were when ancient
                    Babylon was in its glory.</p>
                <p>Oriental carpets were first introduced into Spain by the Moors; and at a later
                    date the Venetians imported them into Italy, and supplied Western Europe with
                    this luxurious manufacture. We have frequent mention of them during the Middle
                    Ages, and their costliness and magnificence are celebrated in the illuminated
                    pages of fabliaux and romances. They were spread in the presence-chambers of
                    royalty, before the high altars of chapels and cathedrals, in the bowers of
                    “ladyes faire,” and on the summer grass. Many articles of furniture were also
                    covered with them — beds, couches, tables, and regal faldistories; but here it
                    becomes difficult to distinguish between carpet and tapestry, both being used
                    promiscuously. Tapestry of Baldekine or Baldachine (from Bal dak, an ancient
                    name of Baghdad) was a carpet inwrought with gold and silver threads. Such
                    carpets were carried on poles, and uplifted as a canopy over the host, and over
                    great personages in procession. The troubadours had carpets of gold embroidery
                    which they laid upon the grass beneath them. Hearthrugs and throne carpets,
                    gorgeously emblazoned with heraldic centre pieces, were the handiwork of
                    high-born dames during the romance period. To some of them were attached
                    fringes, but these were more usually composed of the fag ends of the warp, like
                    those of Persia, India, and Turkey. A black velvet carpet, “fringed with silver
                    and gold, and lined with taffeta,” is enumerated in the inventory of Archbishop
                    Parker’s household furniture in 1577. Rushes were strewn on the floor of Queen
                    Mary’s presencechamber, and that of Elizabeth had the additional covering of a
                    Turkey carpet. Long prior to this, however, Eastern carpets had been introduced.
                    In the reign of Edward VI. we read that before communion tables were placed—</p>
                <p>“Carpets full gay, That wrought were in the Orient.”</p>
                <p>Chequered matting appears to have been very generally used about the 15th
                    century. In Lydgate’s metrical life of St Edmund (MS. Harl., No. 2278), is a
                    representation of the room wherein that saint was born, the floor is covered
                    with chequered matting, and a fringed hearth-rug of Gothic design is before the
                    fire-place. Carpets composed entirely of leather strips interlaced together may
                    be seen in our antiquarian museums.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Henry IV. the carpet manufacture appears to have been introduced
                    from Persia into France. Colbert, the minister of Louis XIV., established the
                    manufactory at Beauvais in 1664, which is now in the hands of the French
                    Government, and produces very artistic specimens. A variety of these, “in
                    Turkish, Peruvian, and Chinese styles,” was exhibited at London in 1851. The
                    national manufactory of Gobelins, which likewise sent its beautiful carpets and
                    tapestry to the Great Exhibition, was established shortly after that of
                    Beauvais. It was purchased in 1677 by Colbert from the Gobelin family, whose
                    progenitors, two centuries earlier (Gilles and Jehan Gobelin), brought their
                    art, as was supposed, from Flanders. An attempt was made, in the time of Henry
                    VIII., by William Sheldon, to start this manufacture in England; and under the
                    patronage of James I. it was more successfully established, with the
                    superintendence of Sir Francis Crane, at Mortlake in Surrey, where both carpets
                    and tapestry were produced. Toward this object the sum of £2676 sterling was
                    contributed by its royal patron, and French weavers were brought over to assist.
                    But it does not appear that anything considerable was effected, until after the
                    revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, when artizans of every trade fled to
                    England, and among them tapestry and carpet weavers, who settled in various
                    parts. About the year 1750, Mr Moore was awarded a premium by the Society of
                    Arts for the best imitation Turkey carpets; and Parisot conducted an
                    establishment for their manufacture at Paddington, under the patronage of the
                    duke of Cumberland. Subsequently carpets were wrought on the same principle at
                    Axminster, in Devonshire, whence the name; and afterwards at Wilton, where the
                    manufacture is still continued. The Board of Trustees for the Encouragement of
                    Arts and Manufactures in Scotland offered prizes for the best Persian and Turkey
                    carpets, which were carried off by Gregory, Thomsons, &amp; Co. of Kilmarnock,
                    and Whytock &amp;. Co. of Edinburgh. About ninety years previously they had been
                    made in the vicinity of Holyrood Palace.</p>
                <p>Carpets, as manufactured at the present day, range themselves under two classes.
                    The first and ancient class being such as are made by knotting into the warp,
                    tuft after tuft, the materials of the pattem; and the second consisting of those
                    in which the pattern is woven up in the loom. To the first class belong Oriental
                    carpets generally, as well as such as are woven at many places throughout Europe
                    under the name of Turkish carpets. Persia is now, as it has been from the most
                    remote times, the recognized source of what is most truly artistic, durable, and
                    valuable in this manufacture; and after the products of that country, those of
                    various parts of India and Turkey are most esteemed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Persian Carpets.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The carpet
                    weaving of Persia is similar in its process to the tapestry manufacture of
                    Gobelins, Beauvais, or Aubusson. The tapestry, as is well known, consists of
                    tufts of wool (French <hi rend="italic">moquettes)</hi> or other fibre sewed on
                    the strings of the warp, by means of small shuttle needles. The Persian carpet
                    is formed by knotting into the warp tuft after tuft of woollen yarn, over each
                    row of which a woof shot is passed, the fingers being here employed instead of
                    the shuttle-needles, as the fabric is of a coarser description. In both methods
                    the principle is the same. Both are formed in looms of very simple construction,
                    the warp threads are arranged in parallel order, whether upright or horizontal,
                    and the fabric and pattern are produced by coloured threads, hand-wrought upon
                    the warp.</p>
                <p>In Persia there are entire tribes and families whose only occupation is that of
                    carpet weaving. These dispose of their productions at the bazaars to native
                    merchants, who remove them to Smyrna or Constantinople, where they meet with
                    European purchasers. The finest carpets both as to design and texture come from
                    Kerman, Feraghan, and Kurdistan. The Kerman products resemble in appearance the
                    finest velvet pile carpets, but with the nap cut much shorter. The carpets of
                    Feraghan are in external appearance somewhat like Brussels carpets, while those
                    of Kurdistan have their pattern on both sides and are woven <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n140/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0140-0129"/> quite smooth. The trade in real Persian carpets
                    was formerly limited, owing to their small size, as they were seldom larger than
                    hearth-rugs, long and narrow in shape; but with the extension of the European
                    demand larger carpets are now made, and they are woven in pieces with separate
                    borders, so that they can be sewed together. The introduction of aniline dyes
                    into Persian designs is likely, it is feared, to be detrimental to the mellow
                    effect of native colours. Very many of the imported carpets are considerably
                    tarnished by exposure in bazaars, if they have not indeed been already used. To
                    render these more saleable they are cleaned by cropping the surface, which in
                    some cases is shaved quite close to the knot; hence a proportion of those
                    brought to England have not their original richness and depth of pile. Carpets
                    of silk were at one period extensively made in the country, but this manufacture
                    has been entirely abandoned for more than a century. Felted carpets or <hi
                    rend="italic">mirmuls</hi> are also very largely made in Persia, but do not
                    constitute an export commodity. Very beautiful patterns are produced in this
                    felt carpeting, by means of coloured tufts of worsted inlaid or inserted during
                    the process of manufacture, producing a regular pattern when finished.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Turkey Carpets.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The greater part
                    of the real Turkey carpets imported into England are manufactured at Ushak or
                    Ouchak, in the province of Aïdin, about six days’ journey from Smyrna, and rugs
                    are principally made at Kulah, an adjacent village. In the provinces of
                    Khodavendikiar, Adana, and Nish numerous households are employed in their
                    production, as also in the districts of Bozrah, the city of Aleppo, and the
                    villages of Trebizond. Here and there, throughout Caramania, such carpets are
                    also made. The Turcomans of Tripoli, the women of Candia, and the peasantry of
                    Tunis and Algiers are likewise engaged in the fabrication of a similar kind of
                    carpet. In none of these places, however, does any large manufactory exist; the
                    carpets are the work of families and households. These carpets are woven in one
                    piece, and there is this notable peculiarity in their manufacture, that the same
                    pattern is never again exactly reproduced; no two carpets are quite alike. The
                    patterns are very remarkable, being rude and simple in design, and coming down
                    from a very remote period. The colours are rich and harmonious, red or green
                    being the usual ground colours with blues, yellows, and black, but very rarely
                    is any white permitted to appear. The design is usually made up of a large
                    central more or less diamonded pattern with smaller diamonds filling up the
                    corners and sides, the whole surrounded with a border of lines of the different
                    colours. No representation of any living form, nearer than what might be taken
                    as the rude outline of leaves, is introduced into the designs. The peculiarities
                    of the patterns have been accounted for on the theory that the Turkey carpet
                    represents inlaid jewelled work, which accords with the Oriental delight in
                    jewels and works in precious stones.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Indian Carpets.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The manufacture of
                    carpets, which have a very wide range of texture, quality, and material, is
                    widely distributed throughout the East Indies. The weaving is carried on
                    entirely by natives, who combine this as a domestic industry with agricultural
                    labour according to the season. It has also been very widely adopted as a proper
                    and profitable species of prison labour. The chief centres of the manufacture of
                    woollen carpets, both for native use and export, are Mirzapore and Benares in
                    the north-west provinces, and Masulipatam in the Madras Presidency, from which
                    latter place the carpets most highly prized in Great Britain are imported.</p>
                <p>At Benares and Moorshedabad are produced velvet carpets with gold embroidery. A
                    very elaborate carpet, sent from Kashmir to the Exhibition of 1851 by Maharajah
                    Goolab Singh, was composed entirely of silk, with a pile nearly an inch thick,
                    in every square foot of which, we are informed, there were at least 10,000 ties
                    or knots. Ornamental hookah carpets and rugs with a silken pile are made in
                    Mooltan, Amritsar, Peshawar, and Kashmir, those of Mooltan being the most
                    famous. Woollen rugs are made very cheaply throughout Bengal and are in great
                    demand; but for texture, workmanship, and colouring the rugs of Ellore, Tanjore.
                    and Mysore are unsurpassed. Cotton carpets or <hi rend="italic">Suttringees</hi>
                    are a cheap substitute for woollen fabrics in almost universal use throughout
                    India. They are woven in stripes of either blue and white or red and white,—the
                    principal centres of the manufacture being Agra, Bareilly, Patna, Birbhum, and
                    Bardwan. The price of these articles is generally determined by their weight,
                    but those of Agra are accounted the best. There is considerable variety in the
                    designs of Indian carpets, but it is allowed they exhibit perfection of
                    harmonious colouring. The prevailing colour is a full deep red, broken with
                    leaves, &lt;fcc., of an orange hue, and interspersed with soft-toned blues or
                    greens. A creamy white is also introduced with excellent effect; but of late
                    years the introduction of bleached whites has robbed the patterns of that mellow
                    subdued effect which constituted one of their leading charms.</p>
                <p>Carpets made in this hand or needle-work style to which we have hitherto been
                    alluding have long been made at various places throughout Europe, and the
                    manufacture is still continued. The most celebrated and artistic textures of
                    this class are the Aubusson, Savonnerie, and Beauvais carpets of France, and the
                    similar products of Manufacture Royale de Tapis of Tournai in Belgium. The
                    manufacture of what are called Turkey carpets is also wide spread, and the
                    common Axminster rugs of England are made on the same principle. But the
                    characteristic carpet weaving of Europe is entirely the product of machine or
                    loom work, and of such there are several distinct varieties. Of these the first
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Kidderminster,</hi><hi rend="italic">or Scotch,
                    Carpet.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This is called also the ingrain carpet, and
                    is made in many parts of Scotland and the north of England, and in the United
                    States of America. It consists of worsted warp traversed by woollen weft, and is
                    woven in pieces about a yard wide. It is composed of two distinct webs
                    interlaced together at one operation and is therefore a double or two-ply
                    carpet, similar on its two sides. In this article only two colours can with
                    propriety be introduced, as otherwise it has a striped or mixed appearance. A
                    pure or plain colour can only be obtained where the weft traverses the warp of
                    the same colour. Suppose a crimson figure on a maroon ground; the one web is
                    maroon, the other is crimson, and the pattern is produced by these intersecting
                    each other at fixed points; what is crimson on one side being maroon on the
                    other and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> One beam contains the warp of both
                    plies, arranged in two tiers, which is passed through the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mads</hi> or metallic eyes of the harness—two threads through each eye— and
                    thence through the reed. The harness draws up certain warp threads, to admit of
                    the passage of the shuttle with the weft, the pattern depending upon the warp
                    threads which are so drawn up. This was formerly effected by means of a
                    revolving barrel, whose surface was studded with pins, which by rotation acted
                    upon the warp threads. These studs being arranged so as to produce one pattern,
                    a separate barrel or a new arrangement of the studs was requisite for every
                    other pattern. But this machine is now superseded by the more efficient Jacquard
                    apparatus, which produces the pattern by means of an endless chain of perforated
                    cards working against parallel rows of needles. The successful introduction of
                    the power-loom for the use of the carpet weaver, which was accomplished by the
                    ingenious perseverance of Mr William Wood, about a <pb break="no"

                    influence in cheapening carpets and extending the limits of the industry. An
                    improvement upon the Kidderminster carpet is the triple or three-ply fabric, the
                    invention of Mr Thomas Morton of Kilmarnock. This is composed of three distinct
                    webs, which, by interchanging their threads, produce the pattern on both sides,
                    permitting at the same time much greater variety of colour, with a corresponding
                    increase of thickness and durability in the texture.</p>
                <p>Figured Venetian carpeting is of similar description; but in it the woof is
                    completely covered by a heavy body of warp. Dutch carpeting is much inferior in
                    quality, and was originally made of cow-hair, but now of the coarsest wook
                    Neither fabric has great capabilities of design; simple diced patterns are
                    wrought in the Venetian, stripes and chequers in the Dutch.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Brussels Carpet</hi> is a very superior texture composed of
                    worsted and linen, and has a rich corded appearance. The figures are raised
                    entirely from the warp, by inserting a series of wires between the linen
                    foundation and the superficial yarn. These wires are afterwards withdrawn,
                    leaving a looped surface. In this manufacture there is a great waste of
                    material, and the colours are usually limited to five, although in carpets of
                    the best quality six colours are introduced. Each colour has its continuous
                    layer of thread, running from end to end of the web, which rises to the surface
                    at intervals indicated by the design, and then sinks into the body of the
                    fabric. Thus, in a five-colour Brussels there are five layers or covers, only
                    one of which is visible at any given point; and owing to .the irregularity of
                    their ascent to the surface, the colours cannot be placed upon one beam, but
                    each thread is wound on a separate bobbin, with a weight attached to give a
                    proper tension. These bobbins are arranged in five frames jutting out behind the
                    loom—260 bobbins in each frame for the ordinary width. Additional frames are
                    requisite for additional colours introduced; but where more than five are
                    engaged the pattern is rather indistinct. The threads of all the bobbins are
                    then drawn through the harness, heddles, and reed, to unite with the linen yarn
                    in the compound fabric, the Jacquard machine being employed to produce the
                    pattern. The manufacture of Brussels carpets was first introduced into Wilton
                    upwards of a century ago, from Tournai in Belgium Kidderminster is now the chief
                    seat of this manufacture; but it is also extensively prosecuted in many other
                    localities <hi rend="italic">Moquette</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Wilton
                    Carpets</hi> are woven in the same manner as Brussels carpets, differing only in
                    this, that the loops are cut open into an elastic velvet pile. To effect this
                    the wires are not circular as in the Brussels fabric but flat, and furnished
                    with a knife edge at the upper extremity, the sharp point of which, drawn across
                    the yarn, cuts the pile These carpets, which have a rich soft appearance,
                    besides being manufactured in many parts of England and Scotland, are also made
                    in France.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tapestry Carpets</hi> are manufactured by a very ingenious
                    process which was invented and patented by Mr Richard Whytock of Edinburgh in
                    1832. In Mr Whytock’s invention, by a combination of printing and weaving, a
                    pile similar to Brussels carpeting is produced, in which any desired range of
                    colours is available to the designer, while only a single thread is used in the
                    texture instead of the five or six which run through the Brussels texture. In
                    tapestry carpet weaving the ordinary process of printing is reversed; for
                    instead of the fabric being first woven and afterwards printed, the threads are
                    printed before even the <hi rend="italic">warp</hi> is formed. One thread, or
                    two treated as one, in some cases miles in length, are coloured, by steps of
                    half an inch, faster than a swift runner would make the distance. When these
                    threads have been all parti-coloured in this manner, they form tht&gt; elements,
                    as it were, of the intended design or fabric. Singly, they exhibit no regular
                    figure or pattern; but when arranged in their proper order, ready for the
                    weaver’s beam, the figure comes into view, much elongated of course, inasmuch as
                    18 feet of the warp will sometimes be gathered into 4 feet of cloth, in order to
                    secure the due proportions of the intended object. The two combined arts of
                    printing and weaving are simplified by this contrivance. With regard to the
                    weaving—lsí, The loom occupies only one-third of the space in length that the
                    Brussels loom requires; 2√, The latter must have 1300 little beams or bobbins,
                    from which the worsted pile has to be gathered, whereas this loom requires only
                    one beam for the whole of the worsted threads; 3cZ, While the Brussels or
                    Wilton, on a web of 27 inches, requires for the best fabric 2860 threads, only
                    780 are here requisite—one layer instead of five—to produce as good or a better
                    surface; and <hi rend="italic">ith,</hi> While the number of colours in
                    succession lengthwise, on the Brussels principle, must not exceed six or seven,
                    any desired number can be introduced in a tapestry carpet. Again, as regards the
                    printing, whereas formerly a change of blocks was required for every change of
                    pattern, in this new process the same blocks serve for all patterns—as the pen
                    serves for every form of type. If an object, say a rosebud, recurs a thousand
                    times in the length of a web, at intervals of 4 feet, the block printer must
                    apply his block a thousand times to point the opening bud; but here the buds are
                    congregated, so that one stroke may dye them all. If it be desired to have a
                    thousand buds in the length of the web, let a thread be wound round a hollow
                    cylinder a thousand times, and a traversing wheel charged with colour be passed
                    across the coil The thread, when uncoiled, will be found to be marked in a
                    thousand places, exactly where it is wanted to tip the opening bud with red from
                    end to end of the web. Design-paper, whereon the pattern is indicated in small
                    squares, serves as a guide to the printer,—each square being one stroke of the
                    colour-pulley. After the threads are thus streaked across with colour, they are
                    removed from the cylinder or drum, and the dyes are fixed by the action of
                    steam. The threads are then arranged in setting frames, according to the squares
                    of the design-paper, to constitute the warp of the projected web. The Jacquard
                    is thus superseded, and the loom restored to nearly the same simplicity as of
                    old, when</p>
                <p>“Between two trees the web was hung.”</p>
                <p>Not only can the pile of Brussels carpets be readily imitated by the process of
                    Mr Whytock, but a velvet pile can also be produced by simply cutting the loops
                    as practised for Wilton or Moquette carpets.</p>
                <p>Like every other improvement, this invention on its first introduction met with
                    considerable opposition, particularly on the part of manufacturers and dealers.
                    During the first fourteen years, the number of looms employed gradually
                    increased from one to fifty-six, the greatest number in operation at Lasswade in
                    1847. The great success which has attended the manufacture of tapestry carpets
                    was chiefly owing to the energetic manner in which Mr Whytock’s brilliant idea
                    was taken up and developed by the eminent firm of Messrs John Crossley &amp;
                    Sons of Halifax. The manufacture was entered on by many other carpet-weavers,
                    and now, as tapestry and velvet pile carpeting, it is one of the most extensive
                    and best established departments of the industry; and the invention has been the
                    means of bringing articles fit for the use of the most refined and fastidious
                    within the reach of all classes of the community. Rugs, table -covers, velvets,
                    and tapestry-hangings are printed and woven on the same principle.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Paient</hi><hi rend="italic">Ax minster Carpets</hi> awe their
                    origin to Mr James Templeton of Glasgow, who obtained a patent for his invention
                    in 1839. With a loom as simple as that required for Mr Whytock’s patent
                    tapestry, Mr Templeton succeeded in weaving patterns which embrace an unlimited
                    variety of colours, and that with wool not printed, but dyed in the yarn.
                    Further, these carpets are pile fabrics, and can be woven of a depth equal to
                    any Oriental production; while for density, smoothness, and firmness of texture
                    they cannot be surpassed. The manufacture involves two distinct weaving
                    operations,— <hi rend="italic">1st,</hi> the preparation of the chenille the
                    strips of which form the weft, and <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> the carpet-weaving
                    proper. A design for the carpet to be woven is first prepared and accurately
                    laid down in its proper colours on paper ruled into small squares. This design
                    is then cut into small longitudinal strips and given to the chenille weaver to
                    guide him as to the colours he is to use, and attaching these to the side of his
                    web, he proceeds in regular order with length after length till the whole
                    pattern is woven up <hi rend="italic">(a,</hi> in wood-cut). The depth or
                    thickness of the pile to be made is regulated by the spaces missed in passing
                    warp threads through the reed. In the breadth of this web there may be ten, a
                    dozen, or more separate chenilles, and consequently there is that number of
                    separate repeats of the pattern available for the weaving which follows. This
                    first web is cut into shreds cr strips (&amp;) along its whole length according
                    to the number of separate chenilles it contains, and the loose edges fold
                    together by a peculiarity in the weaving (c), so that a double pile projects
                    upwards from a firmly woven centre or back. The chenille strips now form the
                    weft thread for the second weaving, and being woven into a strong hnen or hempen
                    backing in the same order that the strips were cut off from the original
                    pattern, the colours combine as in the pattern, and the elements of the complete
                    design come out as the weaving proceeds. Each length of the chenille strips thus
                    makes up a complete section of the design, and if twelve strips were woven in
                    the breadth of the chenille web, they give the material necessary for twelve
                    repeats. The difficulties which opposed the successful issue of his invention Mr
                    Templeton set himself to combat and overcome with unusual perseverance and
                    determination, and his exertions have been rewarded by his products attaining
                    the highest place in public estimation, and by the establishment of a most
                    extensive trade in his carpets. At a much earlier period than most other
                    manufacturers he perceived the high importance of obtaining the co-operation of
                    the best artists and designers to supply him with appropriate and artistic
                    patterns. In 1851 Mr Templeton obtained designs from Mr E. T. Parris, and later
                    he was fortunate enough to secure the aid of such eminent decorative artists as
                    Mr Digby Wyatt and Mr Owen J ones.</p>
                <p>Carpeting of felted-wool upon which coloured patterns are printed are in large
                    demand for crumb-cloths, and as a cheap covering for the floors of bed-rooms,
                    &amp;c. A very large trade, chiefly export, is now carried on in carpets made
                    from jute fibre. The chief centre of this trade is Dundee, and there the goods
                    are chiefly woven in plain strips or chequered patterns, imitations of
                    Kidderminster or Scotch carpeting being rarely attempted in this inferior fibre.
                    The printing of jute carpets has been accomplished in a manner very pleasing to
                    the eye, but it is feared that such goods would not satisfactorily meet the
                    rougher test of human feet. Matting of coir (from the husk of the cocoa-nut),

                    True and the False in the Decorative Arts we</hi> extract the following on
                    carpet-design :—</p>
                <p>“Carpets should be darker in tone and more broken in hue than any portion of a
                    room, both because they present the largest mass of colour, and because they
                    serve as a background to the furniture placed upon them.</p>
                <p>“As a general rule, lighter carpets may be used in rooms thinly furnished than
                    the contrary, as we should otherwise have too overpowering a mass of shade.
                    Turkey carpets are by universal consent adopted for dining-rooms, but not all
                    Turkey carpets (and indeed very few) are fitted for such a purpose. The
                    generality of Turkey carpets consist of a border with the whole middle of the
                    carpet forming one large pattem converging to the centre. All-over patterns are
                    much more rare. In the East, Turkey carpets are placed on a raised platform or
                    dais at one end of a saloon, and all round the edge of it are cushions on which
                    the Easterns recline, so that the whole middle of the carpet is perfectly free,
                    and the complete pattern is seen at a glance. This is not the case when they are
                    transferred to our dining-rooms, where the dining table alone cuts off the best
                    half of it. . . . The principle of design in a Turkey carpet .is perfect, and
                    our manufacturers would do well, instead of copying them in Axminster, as is
                    their wont, to apply the principles to be leamt from them in producing carpets
                    more in harmony with their requirements. ∙</p>
                <p>“I will say no more on the floral style, but to express a regret that the more
                    perfect the manufacturing process in carpets becomes the more do they (the
                    carpets) appear to lend themselves to eviL The modest Kidderminster carpet
                    rarely goes wrong, because it cannot; it has to deal with but two colours, and
                    consequently much mischief is beyond its reach. The Brussels carpet, which deals
                    with five colours, is more mischievous. The tapestry carpets, where the colours
