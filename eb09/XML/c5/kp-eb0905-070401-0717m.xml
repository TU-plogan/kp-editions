                    >Geol),</hi> a festival of the Christian church, observed on the 25th of
                    December, in memory of the birth of Jesus Christ. There is, however, a
                    difficulty in accepting this as the date of the Nativity, December being the
                    height of the rainy season in Judea, when neither flocks nor shepherds could
                    have been at night in the fields of Bethlehem.</p>
                <p>The Christian communities which keep Christmas (as the Roman Catholic, Greek,
                    Armenian, and indeed all Episcopalian churches, and the Lutherans) would
                    probably agree in laying more stress on keeping a day in memory of the Nativity,
                    than on success in selection of the actual and precise date of the event. Indeed
                    in the parallel case it does not appear that Good Friday and Easter lose
                    anything of their respective associations from their variableness in different
                    years. Although as regards Christmas an ingenious case on behalf of the month of
                    October has been made out from what is known concerning the course of Abia,
                    (Luke i. 5.) it does not seem possible to arrive at any certain conclusion. By
                    the 5th century, however, whether from the influence of some tradition, or from
                    the desire to supplant heathen festivals of that period of the year, such as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Saturnalia,</hi> the 25th of December had been generally
                    agreed upon. Augustine expressly mentions this date <hi rend="italic">(De
                    Tri,n.</hi> iv. 5); and Chrysostom seems to speak of it as a custom imported
                    from the West within ten years. Before that time it appears to have been kept
                    conjointly with the feast of the Epiphany on the 6th of January. It is generally
                    considered to rank third among the festivals of the church (Easter and
                    Whitsuntide alone being placed above it) and to have a joy peculiarly its
                    own.</p>
                <p>In all civilized countries the annual recurrence of Christmas has been celebrated
                    with festivities of various kinds. In none, however, was it more joyfully
                    welcomed than in England, where even still the “old honour” has not altogether
                    fled. In that country it was the custom on Christmas eve, after the usual
                    devotions were over, to light large candles and throw on the hearth a huge log,
                    called the Yule Log or Christmas Block. At court, and in the houses of the
                    wealthy, an officer, named the Lord of Misrule, was appointed to superintend the
                    revels; and in Scotland a similar functionary used to be appointed under the
                    title of the Abbot of Unreason, till the year 1555, when the office was
                    abolished by Act of Parliament. The reign of the Lord of Misrule began on
                    All-Hallow eve, and lasted till Candlemas day. The favourite pastimes over which
                    he presided were gaming, music, conjuring, dipping for nuts and apples, dancing,
                    fool plough, hot cockles, blind-man’s buff, &amp;c.; and various Christian
                    preachers (as, for instance, St Bernard) have taken occasion to remonstrate with
                    their flocks for paying too great attention to the festive character of the
                    season, and too little to its more solemn aspects. The favourite dishes for
                    breakfast and supper at this season were the boar’s head with an apple or orange
                    in the mouth, and set off with rosemary, plum-pudding, and mince pies. The
                    houses and churches were decked with evergreens, especially with mistleto, to
                    which a traditionary sacredness has attached since the days of the Druids.</p>
                <p>As might be ∙∙xpected, this festival has been illustrated by many fine and
                    admirable outpourings of devotion in the way of services, and of Christian
                    oratory, hymnology, and art. The services must be sought in the liturgies and
                    office-books of different communities. Among preachers who have dwelt with
                    striking impressiveness on the ideas and associations of this sacred season may
                    be specially named St Leo, St Chrysostom, St Bernard, Matthias Faber,
                    Bourdaloue, Bishop Andrewes, Dr Mill, Dr Newman. Mediaeval Latin hymns may be
                    found in Archbishop Trench’s <hi rend="italic">Sacred Latin Poetry</hi> (London,
                    1849) and in Daniel’s <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Hymnologicus.</hi> Many of
                    these have been paraphrased with great effect by German Lutherans, and of late
                    years, with considerable success, by English compilers of hymn-books. Among the
                    most popular original contributions to the English hymns of the season must be
                    mentioned those of Charles Wesley, Tate, Byrom, Heber, and Keble. The Nativity
                    has been represented by a host of great painters; and it is the inspiring theme
                    of a large part of Handel’s greatest triumph, the <hi rend="italic"
