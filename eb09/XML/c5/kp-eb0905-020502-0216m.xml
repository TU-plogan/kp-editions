                <p><label type="entry">CAT</label>, a name applied in its widest sense to all feline
                    animals, but generally restricted to a few of the smaller species which
                    approximate more or less closely to the domestic form. Of undomesticated species
                    the best known is the wild cat <hi rend="italic">(Felis catus),</hi> inhabiting
                    the most inaccessible mountain fastnesses, and the deepest recesses of the
                    forests of Central and Northern Europe and Asia. It attains a length of 3 feet
                    including the tail, is of a yellowish grey colour above and whitish beneath,
                    with a dark streak extending along the back to the origin of the tail, and with
                    indistinct transverse bands on the sides Its tail is bushy and of equal
                    thickness throughout, annulated and tipped with black. The wild cat was formerly
                    abundant throughout the wooded districts of Britain, but is now confined to
                    Wales, the mountainous parts of the north west of England, and the Highlands of
                    Scotland, where, owing to the increased attention now paid to the preservation
                    of game, it is being rapidly exterminated by trap and gun. It forms its nest in
                    rocky crevices, or in the hollows of trees, and has been known to make use, for
                    this purpose, of the nests of the larger birds. It is nocturnal in its habits,
                    prowling by night in search of the mammals and birds which form its food, and
                    thus doing immense damage in districts well stocked with game. The fierceness of
                    its disposition, its strength, and its agility are well known; and although it
                    does not seek to attack man, yet when disturbed in its lair, or when hemmed in,
                    it will spring with tiger-like ferocity on its opponent, every hair on its body
                    bristling with rage, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">I</hi> never saw
                    an animal fight so desperately,” says Mr Charles St John <hi rend="italic">(Wild
                    Sports of the Highlands),</hi> “or one which was so difficult to kill.” In
                    country districts specimens of the domestic cat run wild are by no means
                    uncommon, for, having once tasted wild animal food, hares and rabbits are ever
                    afterwards preferred to rats and mice, and when the house cat thus takes to
                    hunting there are few animals more destructive to poultry and game. In some
                    instances they have been known to hunt regularly in the woods and yet retain
                    sufficient domesticity to carry home their prey before devouring it; and
                    notwithstanding the Latin proverb—</p>
                <p>“Catus amat pisces sed. aquas intrare recusat, they have been known to overcome
                    their aversion to water in order to gratify their taste for fish. The offspring
                    of such semi-wild forms gradually assume a uniform colouring not unlike that of
                    the wild cat,—a similarity which led to the supposition that the house cat was
                    but a domesticated form of <hi rend="italic">Felis catus.</hi> The greater size,
                    however, of the latter, the uniform thickness of its tail—a peculiarity which
                    never reappears in any of the domestic varieties, nor in those which have
                    returned to the wild state—along with the fact of the great scarcity of house
                    cats and the high value set upon them throughout Europe during the Middle Ages,
                    when the wild form was everywhere abundant, may be <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0217-0206"/> held to prove that the domestic cat is
                    specifically distinct from the wild form of our woods. Its origin, like that of
                    many other domestic animals, is sufficiently obscure to have become a matter of
                    more or less probable conjecture. Reference is made to it in Sanskrit writings
                    2000 years old, and still more ancient records of it are to be found in the
                    monumental figures and cat mummies of Egypt. The latter, according to De
                    Blainville, belong to three distinct species, two of which are said to be still
                    found, both wild and domesticated, in parts of Egypt. The Gloved Cat of Nubia
                    <hi rend="italic">{Felis maniadata),</hi> which also occurs as a mummy,
                    approaches most nearly in size, and in the tapering form of the tail, to the
                    domestic cat, but Professor Owen has shown that there are peculiarities in the
                    dentition of this species, sufficient to invalidate its claim to be considered
                    the ancestor of the domestic form. The difficulty of recognizing this ancestor
                    in any single wild species has led many naturalists, including Temminck, Pallas,
                    and Blyth, to the conclusion that <hi rend="italic">Felis domestica</hi> is the
                    product of many species commingled; and whatever weight may be attached to this
                    view, there is sufficient evidence to show that domestic cats in different parts
                    of the world have been greatly modified by frequent crossings with such wild
                    species as occur in those parts. In the north of Scotland at the present day,
                    the native species is believed occasionally to cross with the house cat, the
                    product living in the houses. Such crosses would, no doubt, be much more
                    frequent in ages when the wild cat was superabundant throughout Europe, and it
                    is evidently owing to this, that, as Mr Blyth states, the affinity of the
                    ordinary British cat to <hi rend="italic">Felis catus,</hi> as compared with any
                    Indian tame cat, is manifest. The latter, according to the same authority, has
                    crossed with no fewer than four Indian wild species, and a tame specimen lately
                    added to the British Museum, agreed, in Dr Gray’s opinion, in almost every
                    character with the Indian wild species <hi rend="italic">Felis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">chaus.</hi> Similar instances of the crossing of native species
                    with the domestic form have been noted in Algeria, South Africa, and Paraguay.
                    Although the cat has probably been domesticated quite as long as the dog, the
                    number of distinct breeds inhabiting the same country, to which it has given
                    rise, is strikingly small in comparison with those of the latter,—a fact owing,
                    probably, to the nocturnal habits of the cat and the consequent difficulty in
                    preventing indiscriminate crossing. That it is not owing to any inherent want of
                    variability is proved by the very distinct breeds that have been developed in
                    insular and other isolated situations, such as the tailless cats of the Isle of
                    Man, which differ in size of head and length of limbs, as well as in absence of
                    tail from the ordinary form, and the domestic cate of the Malayan Archipelago,
                    in which the tail is short and truncated. The best known and most distinct
                    varieties are the Tabby; the Tortoise-shell or Spanish, with its pleasing
                    mixture of black, white, and yellow; the Chartreuse, of a bluish-grey colour;
                    and the Angora, with long silky hair of a dusky white, a favourite drawing-room
                    pet, and the gentlest of all the varieties. Among less known breeds are the
                    Chinese, with pendulous ears, the red-coloured breed of Tobolsk, and the
                    twistedtailed cats of Madagascar.</p>
                <p>The disposition and habits of the domestic cat are familiar to all, and need not
                    be dwelt upon here. It has never evinced that devotion to man which
                    characterizes the dog, though many individual cases of feline attachment might
                    be quoted. It becomes, however, strongly attached to particular localities, and
                    will find its way back frcm the most distant places although conveyed thither
                    under cover. How it performs such feats has long puzzled naturalists, and no
                    theory that has yet been advanced seems adequately to meet the case. It has been
                    contended recently by Mr A. R. Wallace that a cat which is being conveyed to a
                    distance blindfold will have its sense of smell in full exercise, and will by
                    this means take note of the successive odours it encounters on the way; that
                    these will leave on its mind “a series of images as distinct as those we should
                    receive by the sense of sight;” and that “the recurrence of these odours in
                    their proper inverse order—every house, ditch, field, and village having its own
                    well-marked individuality would make it an easy matter for the animal in
                    question to follow the identical route back, however many turnings and cross
                    roads it may have followed” <hi rend="italic">(Nature,</hi> February 20,
                    1873).</p>
                <p>Among the ancient Egyptians.the cat was sacred to Isis or the moon; temples were
                    raised, and sacrifices offered in its honour, and its body was embalmed at
                    death. Nor is this feeling quite extinct among modem Egyptians, for in Cairo at
                    the present time there is an endowment in operation for the lodging and feeding
                    of homeless cats.</p>
                <p>In the folk-lore of European nations the cat is regarded with suspicion as the
                    favourite agent of witchcraft, and seems often to have shared in the cruelties
                    inflicted on those who were supposed to practise the “black art.” In Germany at
                    the present day black cats are kept away from the cradles of children as omens
                    of evil, while the appearance of a black cat on the bed of a sick person used to
                    be taken as an announcement of approaching death.</p>
