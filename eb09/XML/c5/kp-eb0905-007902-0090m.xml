                <p><label type="entry">CAPUCHIN’S</label>. The Capuchin friars are one branch of the
                    great Franciscan order, and their rule is in all essentials the same as that of
                    the other friars minor, or Minorites. It was in the first decade of the 13th
                    century that St Francis established his order; but it was not till 1528 that a
                    bull of Clement VII. erected into a separate order the disciples of a certain
                    minorité friar, who had conceived that he was inspired to reform the practices
                    of his order in some respects. This man’s name was Mathew da Bassi, a Franciscan
                    of the March of Ancona. The legend of the order states that, having seen a
                    representation of St Francis wearing a square-cut pyramidal hood, he made a
                    similar one for himself, sewed it on to his monastic habit and began to wear it.
                    This was in 1525. This audacious innovation drew down on the author of it much
                    blame, and some persecution on the part of his superiors; but as usual in
                    similar cases, that did not prevent others from following his example. Specially
                    two brothers Ludovico and Raffaelle of Fossombrone, the first a priest and the
                    second a lay brother of the Franciscan order, joined themselves to Mathew, and
                    underwent punishment from their superiors for so doing. They, however, obtained
                    the countenance and patronage of the Duchess Cibo, a connection of the then
                    reigning Pope Clement VII. (Giulio de’ Medici), and the wife of Giorgio Varano,
                    duke of Camerino. That lady gave her protégés a letter of recommendation to the
                    pope, armed with which they went to Rome, and, despite the fact that they were
                    disobedient to their superiors and therefore had broken their monastic vows,
                    obtained from the pope the bull known as <hi rend="italic">Religioni*</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Zelus,</hi> by which they were permitted to impart their hooded
                    habit to any disciples who might be willing to join them, to live as hermits in
                    wild and desolate places, to go barefoot, to wear beards, and to call themselves
                    “Hermit Friars Minor.” The populace, however, gave them a nickname which has
                    supplanted the more formal one. “Cappuccio” is a hood in Italian; and the
                    diminutive “Cappuccino,” formed half affectionately, half contemptuously, as is
                    the Italian wont, means “little hooded fellow.” When this bull had been
                    obtained, a place for the first congregation of the new order was soon found in
                    an abandoned convent at Colmenzone, near Camerino, given to them by the duchess.
                    Disciples thronged to the “new religion,” and three other convents were shortly
                    built. Mathew, the disobedient monk who had rebelled against his superiors and
                    abandoned his con <pb break="no"

                    his ambition had prompted him. He had been made, of course, superior of the
                    first convent, and, subsequently, when the “families” of his new congregation
                    had multiplied, he became vicar-general, subject only to the general of all the
                    Franciscans.</p>
                <p>In 1538, in a chapter of the new congregation convoked at Florence—so rapidly had
                    the order of Capuchins spread itself—the celebrated Bernardino Ochino of Siena
                    was elected vicar general, and a second time in 1541. But having shortly
                    afterwards fallen into heresy, and taken refuge in Switzerland, the society to
                    which he had belonged, and on which his celebrity had thrown a lustre which has
                    never since belonged to it, fell under grave suspicions of heterodoxy. The
                    recently established congregation ran great risk of being dissolved, and its
                    leading members were cited by Paul III. to Rome to give an account of their
                    opinions. The Capuchins were forbidden to preach, and would have been abolished,
                    but for a warm and eloquent defence pronounced in Consistory by the Neapolitan
                    Cardinal Antonio Sanseverino, which warned the Pope of the danger of “plucking
                    up tares and wheat together!” This privilege was restored to the society in
                    1545; and the congregation multiplied itself largely in Italy. Paul III. had
                    forbidden them to extend themselves beyond the Alps; but Gregory XII 1., at the
                    request of King Charles IX., revoked this decree, and permitted them to
                    establish convents in any part of the world. Gregory XI <hi rend="italic"
                    >V.</hi> in 1591 forbade the Capuchins by bull to hear confessions and grant
                    absolution; but these functions were restored to them by Clement VIII. in 1602.
                    Paul V. in 1619 gave the congregation the rank and status of a distinct order,
                    gave their vicar the title of Minister General, relieved him from the necessity
                    (which heretofore had marked the <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> subjection of the
                    society to that of the parent Franciscan <hi rend="italic">observantive</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">conventual</hi> friars) of asking the confirmation of his
                    election from the general of the Conventuals, exempted the Capuchin convents
                    from the right of visitation previously exercised by the superiors of the elder
                    branch, and conferred on them the muchvalued privilege of carrying a cross of
                    their own in all processions, instead of being obliged to walk after that of the
                    elder branch. It is stated that at this time the Capuchins numbered 15,000
                    members. Urban VIII. was a notable protector of the order, and created his
                    brother, who was a member of it, cardinal. It was mainly by him that the convent
                    in the Piazza Barberini,—which has been from that day to the recent one when the
                    generals of all the orders were removed from their convents, the residence of
                    the Capuchin generals,—was founded. Benedict XIV. gave the order the privilege
                    that the preacher of the Sacred Apostolic Palace should always be a member of
                    their society.</p>
                <p>The Capuchins have from a very early period of their separate existence had the
                    reputation of being great converters of heretics and infidels. It is related
                    that they converted a thousand Calvinists in Poitou alone to the orthodox faith.
                    From an early period they specially dedicated themselves to the work of
                    missionaries. Up to the year 1641 the Capuchins, though sending missionaries to
                    all parts of the world, had never had a missionary college. In that year their
                    general, Eugenio di Rumilly of Savoy, founded a college in Rome for the express
                    education of their members for the work of missions. In the first eighteen
                    months after the foundation of this college thirty-six Italian Capuchins were
                    sent to Hindustan and Brazil, and eighty Spaniards of the order to
                    Venezuela.</p>
                <p>The order at present maintains eighty-two missions, served (according to the
                    latest accounts) by a few more than two hundred missionaries. They have
                    twenty-three stations in Switzerland; in the north of Italy, nine; in the
                    Levant, eleven. In Asia also they have stations at Beyrout, Gazir, Saida,
                    Damascus, Mount Lebanon, and Aleppo In Georgia there are five stations, and four
                    in Mesopotamia In the East Indies they have fourteen missions, seven in Africa,
                    and four in South America. It is a result which might be expected from such a
                    field of labour, that the Capuchin Martyrology is a specially extensive one.</p>
                <p>The saints and martyrs of the order have been recorded by Father Charles of
                    Brussels in two volumes, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Flores Seraphicae.
                    A Biblioteca degli scrittori Cappuñni</hi> was printed in Venice in 1747. The
                    history of the order has been written by Zachariah Boverius in Latin, Lyons,
                    1632-39, 2 vols, folio. A decree of the Congregation of the Index in 1651
                    ordered the suppression of this work on account of the absurd tales with which
                    it abounds. A subsequent decree of the following year, however, permitted the
                    publication of it on condition of certain emendations. The work has been
                    translated into French, Italian, and Spanish. A continuation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">History</hi> of Boverius, by Father Marco of Pisa, was published
                    in folio at Lyons, 1676. The curious reader may also consult the work of
