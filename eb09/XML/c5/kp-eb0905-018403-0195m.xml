                    professor of astronomy in the University of Bologna. Here he made the
                    observations on the comet of 1652 which formed the subject of his first book; in
                    this he denied that comets are free from subjection to law, and explained them
                    as the result of a mixture of exhalations from the earth and from the stars.
                    About this time he gave a good deal of attention to experiments on the
                    transfusion of blood, and on the habits and structure of insects. Five years
                    later he had an opportunity of displaying his ability, as a man of business, on
                    the occasion of a dispute between Bologna and Ferrara caused by the inundations
                    of the Po; and his success was such that he was asked to continue to act as the
                    representative of the Bolognese. He was also, soon after, appointed to take
                    charge of the repairing of Fort Urban; and already he had gained the patronage
                    of the Pope, Alexander VII. Clement IX., too, valued him so highly that it was
                    only on condition that he should return to Italy after two or three years that
                    he would consent to his accepting Colbert’s offer of the directorship of the
                    Observatory at Paris. Cassini, however, became attached to his new situation,
                    was naturalized, and married a French lady. On 14tb September 1671, he commenced
                    his observations; and his discoveries soon made him the best known astronomer in
                    Europe, and gained him a reputation of an extravagant character. See <hi

                    that of an observer, and he does not appear to have had any adequate knowledge
                    of the state of philosophic thought in his own science. Though he had some
                    personal acquaintance with Newton he does not seem to have understood his
                    theories, and he was quite ignorant of the discoveries of nutation and the
                    aberration of light. Nevertheless, largely on account of his father’s fame, he
                    enjoyed a high reputation throughout Europe.</p>

                    twenty-two years filled the post of director of the Observatory at Paris. He
                    appears to have held more philosophical views than his predecessors; but his
                    plans to improve the Observatory, by obtaining larger instruments, and by other
                    means, were cut short in 1793. In that year the National Assembly decreed that
                    three of his pupils should be united with him in his office, an arrangement to
                    which he refused to submit. Next year he was in consequence imprisoned for seven
                    months; and after this he abandoned astronomy, and spent the rest of his life in
                    retirement. The chief events of his life as an astronomer were the voyage which
                    he undertook to test the chronometers of Le Roy (1769), and his association with
                    Mechain aud Legendre in the work of connecting the observatories of Paris and
                    Greenwich by means of a chain of triangles (1779).</p>
