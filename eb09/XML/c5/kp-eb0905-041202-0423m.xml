                    1789 he left France, and visited several of the European courts, in order to
                    procure assistance for the royalist cause On the execution of Louis XVI., he
                    assumed the title of Monsieur, and in the campaign of 1792 he commanded a
                    regiment of French gentlemen; but in February 1793 he retired to Russia, where
                    he was warmly welcomed by Catherine. In August 1795 he led an expedition, fitted
                    out by the English, to assist the revolt in La Vendée but he displayed no
                    energy, and effected nothing. Retiring after this to England, he resided for a
                    time at Holyrood Palace, and afterwards with his brother Louis at Hartwell. In
                    April 1814 he was cordially welcomed back to Paris by the Provisional
                    Government. During the reign of his brother, Louis XVIII., he was the leader of
                    the extreme royalist party, who aimed at bringing back the state of affairs
                    which had existed before the Revolution; and on succeeding to the throne in
                    September 1824 he continued to follow the same policy. His frequent appearances
                    in public, and the dignity of his address, at first awoke considerable
                    enthusiasm; but his popularity was brief. Μ. Villèle, who had already directed
                    the government for some time, continued to be chief minister. A bill was passed
                    by which a thousand millions of francs were devoted to recompense the losses of
                    the émigrés (March 1825). The Jesuits were, it was believed, encouraged to
                    return to France. Severe laws were made against sacrilege, death being assigned
                    as the penalty for theft from consecrated ground, and profanation of the
                    consecrated elements being regarded as a crime equal to parricide; and the
                    censorship of the press, which he had abolished at his accession, was
                    re-imposed. At length, in January 1828, Charles made a compromise by replacing
                    the unpopular ministry of Villèle by a ministry headed by the Marquis of
                    Martignac. But the change was temporary; soon after he called to the head of
                    affairs Prince Pυlignac, a personal friend, whose views exactly coincided with
                    his own, and the choice of whom consequently aroused the deepest
                    dissatisfaction. But Charles refused to give way, and the address of the
                    Chambers requesting the dismissal of the prince was answered with a dissolution.
                    His foreign policy, meanwhile, was popular, for his troops gave assistance to
                    Greece and conquered Algiers. But this could not save a king who so little
                    understood the temper of his people. On the 25th June 1830 he issued ordinances,
                    of which one forbade the publication of any periodical without Government
                    permission, another dissolved the new House of Deputies which had not yet met,
                    and a third placed the elections under the power of the prefects. This excited a
                    spirit of resistance which spread rapidly through Paris; barricades were thrown
                    up; the troops were repulsed; and in three days the revolution was completed,
                    Charles meantime doing absolutely nothing. At length he recalled his edicts; and
                    he afterwards resigned in favour of his grandson, the duke of Bordeaux. But all
                    was now in vain. Louis Philippe was elected king; and Charles retreated from St
                    Cloud to Trianon, from Trianon to Rambouillet, and finally returned to Holyrood,
                    where he lived four years. He died at Görtz in 1836. The close of his life was
                    spent in religious austerities, which were intended to atone for his former
                    dissoluteness.</p>
