                    serpentine, pyrope, and the emerald. The properties of chromium vary much
                    according to the method of its preparation. By Wohler’s process of reducing the
                    sesquioxide with zinc, it is obtained as a shining green powder, of specific
                    gravity 6 ’ 81, which tarnishes in the air, and dissolves in hydrochloric and
                    warm dilute sulphuric acid, but is not acted on by strong nitric acid. Deville,
                    by intensely igniting chromic oxide with sugar-charcoal in a lime crucible,
                    procured chromium of a bright steel-grey colour, very hard, capable of a high
                    polish, less fusible than platinum, and of specific gravity 6. Crystallized
                    chromium obtained by Frémy was unaffected by the strongest acids.</p>
                <p>Chromium forms three series of compounds :—the <hi rend="italic">chromous,</hi>
                    typified by the chloride CrCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, in which chromium is
                    a dyad; the <hi rend="italic">chrοrnw</hi> or se.sçwí-compounds, such as the
                    oxide, Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and
                    chromic chloride, Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript">
                    6</hi>, in which the metal plays the part of a tetrad, or pseudo-triad; and <hi
                    rend="italic">chromate</hi> compounds, in which it is a hexad, exemplified by
                    the hexafluoride, CrF <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, the oxychloride, CrO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, the anhydride, CrO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and potassium chromate, K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    CrO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. In the hypothetical perchromic anhydride, Cr
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi>, chromium may be
                    regarded as an octad.</p>
                <p>Chromous salts resemble the ferrous, in forming a darkbrown compound when nitric
                    oxide is added to their solutions. The anhydrous protoxide, CrO, has not been
                    obtained; and the hydrate 2CrO.H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, precipitated of
                    a brown colour from solutions by potassium hydrate, is a very unstable body. The
                    dichloride CrCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is a powerful deoxidizer; it forms
                    with water a blue solution, which turns green on exposure to the air.</p>
                <p>The salts of the sesquioxide, or chromic salts, have an acid reaction. They are
                    green, or from red to violet in colour. Ammonia precipitates from solutions of
                    the violet salts a grey-blue hydrate, and from solutions of the green salts, a
                    grey-green hydrate,—the former precipitate giving a red, the latter a green
                    solution with acids. Potash or soda throws down from solutions of the violet or
                    green salts a bluish-green hydrate, soluble in excess of the precipitant, but
                    reprecipitated on boiling. According to Löwel there are four modifications of
                    the hydrate of chrome, two green, one violet-carmine, and a violetblue. The
                    hydrate can be economically made by boiling two parts by weight of potassium
                    chromate with one of sulphur; the presence of a little potash assists the
                    operation. Sesquioxide of chromium, Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, occurs native in argillaceous deposits. It may be
                    obtained in the amorphous state by the ignition of the hydrate, and crystallized
                    by decomposing potassium chromate with chlorine at a red heat. It can be melted
                    at a high temperature into a greenish-black mass, and is with difficulty reduced
                    by charcoal at an intense heat. A mixture of nitric acid and potassium chlorate
                    converts it into chromic acid. The <hi rend="italic">chromites</hi> are a class
                    of bodies in which chromic oxide Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> is united with protoxides, as in the compound Cr <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, and in chrome
                    ironstone, Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> FeO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. The
                    latter, the most abundant ore of chromium, contains besides iron and chromium
                    variableproportions of magnesium andaluminium, and is isomorphous with magnetic
                    iron ore, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, and
                    spinel, MgAl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. It is
                    a massive and compact, granular, rarely crystallized, black-coloured mineral, of
                    specific gravity about 4 ’ 4, and hardness 5 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5.
                    It occurs usually in serpentine, and is found in the Shetland Isles, the
                    department of Var in France, Volterra in Tuscany, Silesia, Bohemia, Röraas in
                    Norway, the Urals, near Baltimore in the United States, and in many other
                    localities. In 1869 the exports of chrome ore from Norway amounted to 210 tons.
                    Chrome ironstone can be decomposed in the. dry way for analysis by fusion with
                    potassium bisulphate, to which sodium carbonate and then a little nitre are
                    subsequently added. Chromic chloride, Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, can be obtained either in the anhydrous insoluble
                    condition, or as the green hydrated salt, soluble in water. Similar compounds
                    are the fluoride, Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> F <hi rend="subscript">

                    the sesquioxide and trioxide have been termed <hi rend="italic">chromates of
                    chromium.</hi></p>
                <p>The tri oxi de or anhydride of chromium, CrO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,
                    comparable with sulphuric anhydride, SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, can be
                    prepared by the action of strong sulphuric acid upon potassium bichromate; as
                    the liquid cools, the anhydride separates from it in crimson acicular crystals.
                    It can also be obtained by decomposing barium chromate with nitric acid. Chromic
                    anhydride deliquesces in air, and dissolves in water, forming a solution which
                    contains chromic acid; it is a powerful oxidizer, and acts violently on organic
                    substances, such as alcohol and ether, becoming reduced to the sesquioxide. Dry
                    ammonia gas is converted by it into nitrogen and aqueous vapour. When peroxide
                    of hydrogen, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is
                    added to a solution of chromium trioxide, an unstable blue compound of probable
                    constitution H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">perchromic acid,</hi> is
                    formed, which dissolves in ether, and is decomposed by potash and soda, but
                    forms stable compounds with ammonia, quinine, and other bodies. Chromic acid, H
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CrO,, has not been isolated, and hydrated salts of
                    the type HM <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> CrO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> are
                    unknown. The <hi rend="italic">chromates</hi> are a large class of bodies,
                    isomorphous with the sulphates. They are bitter and poisonous salts, mostly of a
                    yellow or red colour, and except those of the alkali metals, and of calcium,
                    strontium, and magnesium, are more or less insoluble in water. Most of the
                    insoluble chromates are basic. The chromates of the alkali metals are the
                    neutral or normal yellow salts, M' <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CrO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, or M' <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O.CrO <hi

                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O.2CrO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. Potassium
                    trichromate, K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O.3CrO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,
                    represents a third series of chromates. With salts of lead, bismuth, and barium,
                    the alkaline chromates give yellow precipitates; with silver salts, a purplish
                    red; and with mercurous salts, a brick-red precipitate. Boiled with hydrochloric
                    acid they give a green solution of sesqui chloride of chromium; and with
                    sulphurous acid, or with sulphuric acid and alcohol, sugar, and other reducing
                    agents, they yield chrome alum. When a chromate is heated with sulphuric acid
                    and common salt, vapours of oxychloride of chromium, or chlorochromic acid, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n719/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0719-0706"/> are produced. Insoluble chromates fused with
                    nitre yield soluble yellow potassium chromate, K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    CrO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. This salt is prepared on a large scale by
                    oxidizing chrome-iron ore in a furnace, in the presence of carbonate, sulphate,
                    or chloride of potassium, and chalk or lime. The red bichromate or acid chromate
                    of potassium, K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi>, is made by acidifying a solution of the neutral
                    salt, or by Jacquelin’s process, in which chrome-iron ore is ignited with chalk
                    to obtain the neutral chromate of calcium; this is then converted by sulphuric
                    acid into calcium bichromate, which by double decomposition with potassium
                    carbonate yields the potassium bichromate. It melts at a red heat, and at a
                    white heat evolves oxygen, as also when warmed with sulphuric acid. Heated with
                    sulphur or charcoal it deflagrates. The solution gives with sulphydric acid a
                    precipitate of mixed chromic oxide and sulphur. Ammonium bichromate is
                    decomposed on the application of heat into nitrogen, water, and chromic oxide.
                    The oxides and salts of chromium give, in both the inner and outer blowpipe
                    flames, a green bead with borax. Chromium unites with iron and aluminium; and
                    can be obtained combined with mercury by treating a solution of a chromic salt
                    with sodium amalgam. Chromium is estimated gravimetrically in the form of the
                    sesquioxide, or of a lead or barium salt; volumetrically, by the oxidizing
                    effect of a chromate on oxalic acid, hydriodic acid, or potassium
                    ferrocyanide.</p>
                <p>The alloy termed <hi rend="italic">chromeisen,</hi> containing about three parts
                    by weight of chromium to one of iron, is hard enough to serve for cutting glass.

                    >spiegeleisen</hi> in Siemens’s steel process. Chromium compounds are in request
                    for a great diversity of purposes. Free chromic acid and potassium bichromate
                    are used in calico-printing, and in bleaching tallow and palm oil. The
                    bichromate is also employed for the volumetric estimation of ferrous salts, in
                    the printing of photographs, and in galvanic batteries; it has even been used
                    with lead chromate for the adulteration of snuff. It is itself sometimes
                    adulterated with a mixture of sulphate and chloride of sodium, coloured with a
                    strong solution of bichromate. Potassium bichromate in contact with the skin
                    produces dangerous ulcers, and internally it acts as a violent poison. Fused
                    lead chromate is of value in organic chemistry as an oxidizer, and the unfused
                    salt is the well-known pigment <hi rend="italic">chrome-yellow. Chrome-red</hi>

                    recommends for the preparation of an intense green pigment to calcine an
                    intimate mixture of 1 part of potassium bichromate and 3 parts of baked gypsum;
                    the mass obtained is boiled with water, or treated with hydrochloric acid. The
                    pigment used to produce a pink colour on earthenware is made by heating to
                    redness a mixture of 30 parts of peroxide of tin, 10 of chalk, and 1 of
                    potassium chromate,—the product being powdered and washed with hydrochloric
