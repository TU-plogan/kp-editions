                <p><label type="entry">CARDINAL</label>, the name of the highest dignity in the
                    Roman Catholic hierarchy. Very varying statements are found in the
                    ecclesiastical historians respecting the origin of the name, the period at which
                    it was first used, and the persons to whom it was applied in the earliest time
                    of its use. This uncertainty is easily explained by the fact that both the thing
                    and the name were at no time appointed and created, but grew up by successive
                    and mainly abusive encroachments legitimatized by usance, and from time to time
                    more formally by Papal briefs and bulls. There can be little doubt that the word
                    was originally applied to priests in the same sense in which it was and is
                    applied to other things, as synonymous with “principal,” that on which a thing
                    hinges <hi rend="italic">(cardo,</hi> a hinge).<note anchored="true"

                            Universal Apostolical Church rests and is supported on this
                            institution.” Cave, in his article on Anastasius, the Roman librarian

                    forward,—as that the priests so termed attended the pontiff when celebrating
                    mass, standing at the corners <hi rend="italic">(cardines)</hi> of the altar,
                    that cardinal priests were those refugees from persecution <hi

                    clerical body of churches more happily circumstanced, and some others—maybe
                    deemed the fanciful inventions of later writers in search of originality. What
                    priests those were, who in fact or by privilege used this title in the earliest
                    ages of the church, is a much larger and more debatable question, on which
                    scores of volumes have been written. If, however, a guide is to be chosen, no
                    safer can be found than Bingham,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            sec. 18.</p></note> who says, when pointing out that archpresbyters were
                    by no means the same thing as cardinal presbyters, that the use of the term
                    cardinal cannot be found in any genuine writer before the time of Gregory the
                    Great (+ 604). For, says he, the Roman Council, on which alone Bellarmine relies
                    to prove the word to have had a greater antiquity, is a mere figment. For the
                    authorities for an earlier use of the term, such as they are, the reader may
                    consult Gaetano Moroni’s <hi rend="italic">Dizιonario</hi> at the word Cardinal.
                    As regards the term “genuine” in Bingham’s statement, it may be mentioned that
                    both Baronins and Bellarmine regard the council said to have been held at Rome
                    by Sylvester I. in 324 as genuine. Van Espen, on the other hand, considers it to
                    be apocryphal. Further, in alluding to the origin of the name, Bingham notices
                    the opinion of Bellarmine that the word was first applied to certain principal
                    churches, and remarks that others have supposed that those among the priests in
                    populous cities who were chosen from among the rest to be a council for the
                    bishop were first called cardinals. And Stillingfleet<note anchored="true"

                            incumbencies which from the earliest ages of the Church of Rome had been

                            in the common phrase “a title to holy orders.”</p></note> were much
                    increased, those presbyters that were placed in the ancient titles, which were
                    the chief among them, were called Cardinales Presbyteri, which were looked on as
                    the chief of the clergy, and therefore were the chief members of the council of
                    presbyters to the bishop.” Stillingfleet appears, however, to have been think
                    ing exclusively of Rome. Various other churches in France, Italy, Germany, and
                    Spain—as Bourges, Metz, Ravenna, Fermo, Salerno, Naples, Cologne, Compostella,
                    &amp;c.,—claimed the title of cardinal for their canons as by privilege, in most
                    cases probably usurped and not granted. But the name appears gradually to have
                    been understood to appertain only to those whom the pope specially created
                    cardinals. And at last, in 1567, Pope Pius V. definitively decreed that none
                    should assume the title of cardinal save those created such by the Roman
                    pontiff, and the word from that time to this has been exclusively so
                    applied.</p>
                <p>If the origin and early use of the term cardinal is obscure, the institution of a
                    collegiate body consisting of cardinals and of none other is yet more so. There
                    seem to be traces of such a conception in the life of Leo III. (+ 816) written
                    by Anastasius the librarian. And Moroni cites many passages from various authors
                    and documents between the above date and 1100, with a view of showing that, at
                    all events, by the end of that time the body of cardinals was recognized as a
                    collegiate corporation. But his citations seem to prove rather the reverse. Nor
                    do wo reach solid ground in this respect till we come to the bull
                        “Postquam”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See,
                            however, Cave, <hi rend="italic">Script. Eccl. Hist. Lit.,</hi> vol. ii.
                            p. 124, who says that about the middle of the 11th century they were
                            enrolled <hi rend="italic">(asciti</hi><hi rend="italic">sunt),</hi> in
                            an Apostolic College.</p></note> of Sixtus V. (3d December 1585) which
                    finally regulates the composition of the <hi rend="italic">Sagro</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Collegio.</hi> By this instrument seventy is fixed as the
                    maximum number of the sacred college “after the example of tho seventy elders
                    appointed by God as counsellors of Moses.” Nor has the number ever been exceeded
                    since that time, though it is expressly laid down by the authorities on the
                    subject, that no canonical disability exists to prevent the pope from exceeding
                    that number should he see fit to do so. By the same bull “Postquam,” it is also
                    provided that the seventy of the Sacred College should consist of six cardinal
                    bishops, fifty cardinal priests, and fourteen cardinal deacons. The six cardinal
                    bishops are the bishops of the sees lying immediately around Rome. The fifty
                    cardinal priests take their “titles” from the principal churches in Rome, but
                    are many of them bishops or archbishops of distant sees, and four must be by
                    regulation members (usually the “generals ”) of the monastic orders. The
                    fourteen deacons take their titles from the “deaconries” established in the
                    earliest ages of the Church for the assistance and protection of the widows and
                    orphans of the faithful. It may be added here that Sixtus V., by the
                    above-mentioned bull, decrees that if any person created a cardinal be not in
                    deacon’s orders, he must receive them within the year. But “dispensations,” by
                    virtue of which the dignity has been held for many years by men not even in
                    deacons’ orders, have been common. If any cardinal should be in such a position
                    at the time of the Pope’s death, he cannot enter conclave or participate in the
                    election, unless by immediately qualifying himself by taking orders.</p>
                <p>As the institution of cardinals was entirely arbitrary and an abuse, so, despite
                    the shadow of an attempt to find or make a <hi rend="italic">raison d'etre</hi>
                    for their existence in the assignment of such dignities to certain special sees

                    churches very soon became purely nominal and formal; and everything connected
                    with the selection of them depended wholly on the will of the pontiff. Not so,
                    as will be seen presently, their prerogatives when they had been created. And
                    the limits, which might be supposed to have bounded the field from which the
                    Pope could select the objects of his favour, became constantly enlarged. A few
                    only of the many instances of creations illustrating this fact which are on
                    record can be here mentioned. Clement VI., in 1348, created his nephew Peter
                    Roger cardinal when he was seventeen. Sixtus IV., in 1477, created John of
                    Aragon cardinal at the age of fourteen, and at the same time his nephew
                    Raffaelle Riario who was seventeen. Innocent VIII. (f 1492) created Giovanni de’
                    Medici, afterwards Leo X., cardinal at fourteen, his eminence having been
                    Apostolic Protonotary ever since he was seven! Ippolite d’Este had been an
                    archbishop for the last nine years, when Alexander VL created him cardinal in
                    his seventeenth year. Alfred of Portugal was made cardinal by Leo X. when he was
                    seven years old, on condition, however, that he should not assume the outward
                    insignia of the dignity till he should be fourteen. The same pontiff made John
                    of Lorraine cardinal at twenty, Alexander VL having previously made him
                    coadjutor of the bishop of Metz at four years old. Clement VII. made Odet di
                    Cohgny cardinal at twelve. Paul IIL Farnese (t 1549), created his nephew
                    Alexander Farnese cardinal at fourteen; his grandson Guido Ascanio Sforza, the
                    son of his daughter Costanza, at sixteen; his cousin Niccolò Gaetani at twelve;
                    his relative Giulio Feltre della Rovere, at eleven; and a second grandson,
                    Ranuccio Farnese, at fifteen, having made him archbishop of Naples the year
                    before. Paul also created Charles of Lorraine, brother of Mary Queen of Scots,
                    cardinal at twenty-two, although he had a brother in the Sacred College at the
                    time, which is contrary to the constitutions and the decree of one of the Pope s
                    predecessors. But this is only one out of a hundred facts which demonstrate the
                    futility of the attempt to bind the hands of one infallible autocrat by the
                    rules enacted by his predecessors. Sixtus V. (t 1590), a great reformer of
                    abuses, made his nephew Alexander Peretti cardinal at fourteen. Paul V. (+ 1621)
                    created Maurice of Savoy cardinal at fourteen, Carlo de’ Medici at nineteen, and
                    Ferdinand of Austria at ten. Clement XII. (+ 1740) made Luigi di Borbone
                    archbishop of Toledo and cardinal at the age of eight. And, lastly, Pius VII. (+
                    1823) created a second Luigi di Borbone, the son of the above-mentioned
                    archbishop of Toledo, cardinal at twenty-three. The list of such creations might
                    be much extended. Previously to the publication of the bull “Postquam” by Sixtus
                    V. the number of the Sacred College was extremely variable. John XXII.,
                    requested in 1331 to make two French cardinals, replied that there were only
                    twenty cardinals’ hats, that seventeen of these were already French, and that he
                    could, therefore, only make one more. At the death of Clement VI. (1352) the
                    cardinals determined that their number should not exceed twenty. Urban VI. (+
                    1389) created a great number; and we find the college making representations to
                    Pius II. (t 1464) to the effect that the dignity of the purple was diminished by
                    such excess. Sixtus IV. (+ 1484), however, multiplied the number of his
                    creations to an unexampled extent; and Alexander VL (+ 1503) exceeded him. Leo
                    X. created thirty-one cardinals at one batch, leaving at his death sixty-five, a
                    number unprecedented up to that time. Paul III., however, created seventy-one.
                    But Paul IV. (+ 1559) issued the bull called “Compactum,” by which it was
                    decreed that the number of cardinals should never exceed forty. His immediate
                    successor, however, Pius IV. (+ 1565) raised the number to forty-six In 1590
                    came the final settlement at seventy by Sixtus V., as has been said.</p>
                <p>Many volumes have been written on the different forms used by the popes in the
                    creation of cardinals in different ages, and many more still larger treatises
                        <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">professo</hi> on the strictly
                    ecclesiastical, as well as what may be more properly called the social, portions
                    of the accustomed ceremonial. But it must suffice here to characterize very
                    generally the differences which have prevailed from age to age in the first
                    respect, and to say but a few words on the second head.</p>
                <p>The general tendency of the changes which have taken place in the methods used
                    for the creation of cardinals may be very shortly stated. They have been such as
                    indicate the steadily increasing absolutism of the pontiffs. A proclamation to
                    the congregation including an invitation to any person to state any ground of
                    objection known to him soon gave place to a real consultation of the college by
                    the Pope, and a real assent on the part of the cardinals to the proposed new
                    nominations, which in its turn dwindled off at a very early period to a mere
                    form of asking and receiving consent. In the earlier centuries the creations
                    almost always took place on the first Wednesday of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Quattro</hi><hi rend="italic">Tempora,</hi><note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The <hi rend="italic">Quattro</hi><hi

                            the year commenced.</p></note> and generally in the Basilica of Santa
                    Maria Maggiore. There, after the <hi rend="italic">Introit</hi> and collect of
                    the Mass had been said, a reader ascended the pulpit and proclaimed the intended
                    creation of such and such persons, ending with an invitation precisely similar
                    to that used in our churches in the publication of banns of marriage, and a real
                    inquiry followed the statement of any objector. At a later period the Pope asked
                    of the cardinals assembled in secret consistory whether in their opinion there
                    should be a creation of cardinals, and of how many? And a deputation was sent to
                    the residence of any cardinals who might be ill to bring back their replies to
                    the same questions. Then, satisfactory answers having been obtained from at
                    least the majority, the Pope said <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Portetur nuda</hi><hi rend="italic">cathedra.”</hi> The chair was brought,
                    and placed at his right hand. Thereupon all the cardinals rose, and stood ranged
                    against the wall at a distance out of earshot of the Papal throne. The dean of
                    the Sacred College placed himself in the empty chair, and the Pope told him in a
                    low voice whom he purposed to create, adding <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Quid</hi><hi rend="italic">vobis videtur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >ì”</hi> One by one all present were similarly interrogated, and then the
                    Pope said aloud, “<hi rend="italic">Deo</hi><hi rend="italic">gratias
                        habemus</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">personis creandis

                        <hi rend="italic">“majoris partis,”</hi> as the case might be. And then the
                    pontiff at once proclaimed the new dignitaries :—“<hi rend="italic"
                        >Auctoritate</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei</hi><hi rend="italic"

                        rend="italic">”</hi> so and so, the act of conferring the dignity with its
                    insignia on the new recipients was performed at the Papal palace, and was
                    accompanied by a mass of minutely ordered ceremonial which rendered it one of
                    the most pompous and gorgeous scenic performances of the Roman Church and court.
                    It would need many pages to describe the form and order of the ceremony, the
                    intricacies of which no one was ever expected to remember or understand save the
                    professional masters of the ceremonies, whose business it is to have mastered
                    the science. And a description of it <pb break="no"

                    amazement at the overgrown mass of frivolity which the constant tendency to
                    extinguish significance under heaps of material forms and show, has led the old
                    men who compose the Roman court to accumulate.</p>
                <p>The social portion, as it may be called, of the ceremonial attendant on the
                    creation of a cardinal, in which the city and all the inhabitants are concerned,
                    is as pompous, and as much regulated by a whole code of traditional uses and
                    customs, as the more pu rely ecclesiastical part of the business. The making of
                    presents and payment of fees to persons of all sorts of conditions, from the
                    high and reverend officials of the Curia to the cardinal’s lackeys, makes a
                    great part of it. And the amount of all these payments is minutely regulated.

                            herself to be under eclipse, and all exterior pomp and magnificence are

                    specially stationed before the residences of the foreign ministers. The new
                    cardinal opens his palace for a great full-dress reception, where all who have a
                    decent coat, and specially all strangers, are welcomed. These are great and
                    noted occasions for the display of the diamonds and toilettes of the Roman
                    patrician ladies.</p>
                <p>Before quitting the subject of the method of creating cardinals, the custom of
                    reserving cardinals “<hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">Pector</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">e”</hi> must be briefly noticed. Various causes occasionally
                    arose to lead a pontiff to deem it undesirable to declare to the world the
                    person whom it was his purpose to create a cardinal. Martin V. (+ 1431) was the
                    first who thus secretly created cardinals. But the practice then and
                    subsequently differed essentially from that which the ever-increasing despotism
                    of the popes brought it to under Paul III. and thenceforward. Martin and his
                    successors, till Paul III. took the members of the college into their
                    confidence, only strictly enjoining them not to divulge the fact that such and
                    such persons were in fact cardinals. He died leaving four cardinals thus
                    unpublished, having taken the oaths of the other cardinals that they would in
                    case of his death recognize them. Notwithstanding their oaths, however, they
                    refused when the Pope died to do so. And the popes have never been able to
                    secure the admission to the college of those whose creation has been left by
                    their deaths in this inchoate state. Sometimes the college has recognized them,
                    and admitted them to the conclave; sometimes the succeeding Pope has re-created
                    them out of respect for the wishes of his predecessor. Sometimes they have
                    altogether lost the promotion intended for them. The change which Paul III.
                    introduced consisted in confining the secret of the unpublished nominations to
                    his own breast, keeping it “<hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >pectore.”</hi> His practice was, and that of his successors has been, to
                    add to the form of proclamation in consistory, <hi rend="italic">“Alios
                        duos</hi> (or more or less) <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >pectore reservamus arbitrio</hi><hi rend="italic">nostro
                        quandοcumgue</hi><hi rend="italic">declarandosP</hi></p>
                <p>Before quitting the subject of ceremonial, a word or two may be said of the
                    singular practice of closing and subsequently opening the mouth of a newly
                    created cardinal. Like almost everything else connected with the subject this
                    form had once a real significance, but has become a mere meaningless formality.
                    Some reasonable time was originaUy allowed to elapse before the pontiff in one
                    consistory formally pronounced the mouth to be opened which he had declared to
                    be closed in a previous consistory. Now the form of opening is pronounced within
                    a few minutes of the form of closing. As may be readily understood the cardinal
                    whose mouth was closed could not speak or vote in any assembly of the cardinals,
                    but on!y hear. When it has occurred that a cardinal has been left at the death
                    of a Pope with closed mouth, the college have usually empowered one of their
                    number to open the mouth of the cardinal so circumstanced. But it is a great
                    mistake to suppose, as many have imagined, that a cardinal, whose mouth remained
                    closed, was ineligible to the Papal throne. For not only any such cardinal, but
                    any person whatever, clerk or lay, not being an avowed heretic, and not
                    labouring under any canonical impediment to holy orders, is perfectly eligible
                    as pope.</p>
                <p>The chief of the insignia of a cardinal’s dignity is the scarlet hat,—the
                    original significance of which was, we are told, to remind the wearer that he
                    was to be at all times ready to shed his blood in martyrdom for the faith. At an
                    early period it became, and has since continued to be, a huge unwearable
                    construction of silk and hanging tassels, such as may be seen suspended from the
                    roofs of cathedrals over the tombs of cardinals. So much is the hat the main
                    mark of a cardinal’s dignity, that “to receive the hat” is in common parlance
                    equivalent to being made a cardinal. The canonical vestments of a cardinal are
                        scarlet,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Save in the
                            case of memhers of the monastic orders, whose dress, similar in form to
                            the others, is in colour that enjoined by their special rule.</p></note>
                    and in the cityand in their homes the hems and such like of their coats, and
                    also their stockings, are of the same colour,—in Italian parlance “purple.”
                    Hence, “to aspire to'the purple,” “to receive the purple,” is also equivalent to
                    being a candidate for or being made a cardinal. Their Eminences also wear a
                    scarlet “beretta,” a four-cornered cap of the shape well known in pictures and
                    engravings, and a scarlet “berettina,” or skull-cap. Until the time of Urban
                    VIII. the cardinals were styled “Illustrissimi ;” but that pope decreed that
                    they should for the future be called “Emi-nentissimi,” and addressed as “your
                    Eminence.”</p>
                <p>It remains to add a few words on the privilege of a cardinal as an elector of the
                    pontiff; and though the subject is a large one, a very few words will suffice,
                    because the treatment of it falls more properly and conveniently under other
                    headings. In perfect consistency with every other portion of the history of the
                    institution, the right and privilege of the cardinals to elect the Pope is an
                    abuse, and has been attained by a long series of encroachments which have
                    gradually eliminated the originally democratic constitution of the Church. The
                    popes were at first chosen by the whole body of the faithful; then by the whole
                    body of the clergy; then by the cardinals with the consent of the clergy, and,
                    ultimately, absolutely and exclusively by the cardinals. That the mode of
                    election has passed through these phases is certain; but the chronological
                    details of the changes are extremely obscure. The methods pursued in the
                    election belong to another place. And this article may be concluded by a
                    statement of the fact, often misapprehended, that the right of a cardinal to
                    enter conclave with his brethren and vote for the new Pope is indefeasible; and
                    he is not to be deprived of it by any declaration of the late Pope or deposition
                    by him, or by any amount of unworthiness, however patent. Cases are on record in
                    which popes have sought by every means in their power to prevent certain
                    cardinals from taking part in the election that would follow their death, and
                    some in which monstrous crimes have rendered such exclusion reasonable and right
                    in every point of view. But in every such case the college has overruled the
                    provisions of the deceased pontiff, and admitted the acknowledged member of
                    their body to take part in the election. (τ. <hi rend="smallcaps">a.
