                    by the Strait of Molucca. It stretches from 118° 30' to 125° 40' E. long., and
                    from 5° 45' S. to 1° 45' N. lat., and its area is approximately estimated at
                    about 70,000 square miles. Its general outline is extremely irregular, and has
                    been compared to that of a starfish with the rays torn off from the west side.
                    It consists of four great peninsulas, extending from a comparatively small
                    nucleus towards the N.E., E., S.E. and S., and separated by the three large bays
                    of Gorontalo orTomini, Tolo or Tomaiki, and Boni. Of these bays the first is by
                    far the largest, the other two having much wider entrances and not extending so
                    far inwards. Most important among the smaller inlets are the bays of Amurang,
                    Kwansang, and Tontoli on the north coast, Palos and Parre-Parre on the west, and
                    Kendari or Vosmaer on the east. A large part of the island is but partially
                    explored, but the general character of the whole seems to be more or less
                    mountainous. Well-defined ranges prolong themselves through each of the
                    peninsulas, rising in many places to a considerable elevation. Naturally there
                    are no great river basins or extensive plains, but one of the features of the
                    island is the frequent occurrence, not only along the coasts, but at various
                    heights inland, of beautiful stretches of level ground often covered with the
                    richest pastures. The substructural rocks are mainly of igneous origin, the most
                    frequent being basalt in a state of decomposition; but in many districts the
                    Carboniferous strata are well developed, and give a character to the landscape.
                    The northern peninsula differs from the others in being still highly volcanic
                    and subject to not unfrequent earthquakes. Within the province of Minahassa
                    alone as many as eleven distinct volcanoes have been counted; and hot springs,
                    mud fountains, and similar phenomena occur ïh several other districts. Few of
                    the rivers are navigable for any distance, and the entrance to almost all of
                    them is obstructed by bars. Lakes, on the other hand, are both numerous and
                    extensive. Of these the most important is the Tamp-arang-Labaya or Tempe,
                    situated in the south-eastern peninsula in 3° 37' S. lat. It has a depth of
                    about 30 feet, and is richly stocked with wild-fowl and fish. The scenery
                    throughout the island is of the most varied and picturesque description.
                    “Nowhere in the archipelago,” says Mr Wallace, “have I seen such gorges, chasms,
                    and precipices as abound in the district of Maros; in many parts there are
                    vertical or even overhanging precipices five or six hundred feet high, yet
                    completely clothed with a tapestry of vegetation.” Much of the country,
                    especially round the Bay of Tolo, is still covered with primeval forest and
                    thickets, traversed here and there by scarcely perceptible paths, or broken with
                    a few clearings and villages.</p>
                <p>In spite of its situation in the centre of the archipelago, Celebes possesses a
                    fauna of a very distinctive kind. The number of species is small; but in many
                    cases they are peculiar to the island. Of the birds, for example, about 200
                    species are known; and of these no fewer than 80 are peculiar. The mammalian
                    species number only 14, and of these 11 belong almost entirely to the Celebesian
                    area. Most remarkable are the <hi rend="italic">Macacus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >niger,</hi> an ape found nowhere else but in Batchian; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anoa depressicornis,</hi> a small ox-like quadruped, which inhabits the
                    mountainous districts; and the babirusa or pig-deer of the Malays. There are no
                    large beasts of prey, and neither the elephant, the rhinoceros, nor the tapir is
                    represented. Wildbuffaloes, swine, and goats are pretty common; and most of the
                    usual domestic animals are kept in greater or smaller numbers. Though they
                    receive but little attention, the cattle are good. The horses are in high repute
                    in the archipelago; formerly about 700 were yearly exported to Java, but the
                    supply has considerably diminished.</p>
                <p>The same peculiarity of species holds in regard to the insects of Celebes as to
                    the mammals and birds. Out of 118 species of butterflies, belonging to four
                    important classes, no fewer than 86 are peculiar; while among the rosechafers or
                    <hi rend="italic">Cetoniadoe</hi> the same is the case in 19 out of 30. Equally
                    remarkable with this presence of peculiar species is the absence of many kinds
                    that are common in the rest of the archipelago; and the fact that similarities
                    are often to be traced with species belonging to Africa and other remote regions
                    is highly suggestive.</p>
                <p>Vegetation is, it need hardly be said, extremely rich; but there are fewer large
                    trees than in the other islands of the archipelago. Of plants that furnish food
                    for man the most important are rice, maize, and millet, coffee, the cocoa-nut
                    tree, the sago-palm, the obi or native potato, the breadfruit, and the tamarind;
                    with lemons, oranges, mangosteens, wild-plums, Spanish pepper, beans, melons,
                    and sugar-cane. The shaddock is to be found only in the lower plains. Indigo,
                    cotton, and tobacco are grown; the bamboo and the ratan-palm are common in the
                    woods; and among the larger trees are sandal-wood, ebony, sapan, and teak. The
                    gemuti palm furnishes fibres for ropes; the juice of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arenga scwcharifera</hi> is manufactured into sugar and a beverage called
                    sagueir; and intoxicating drinks are prepared from several other palms.</p>
                <p>Except where Dutch influence has made itself felt, very little attention has been
                    paid by the native races to any agricultural pursuit; and their manufacturing
                    industries are few and limited. The weaving of cotton cloth is principally
                    carried on by women; and the process, at least for the finer description, is
                    tedious in the extreme. The cheap introduction of European goods is gradually
                    lessening the amount of native stuffs. The houses are built of wood and bamboo;
                    and as the use of diagonal struts has not been introduced, the walls soon lean
                    over from the force of the winds. The most imnortant of the mineral nro-ducts<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n299/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0299-0288"/> oí the island are gold and salt; excellent iron
                    is also found, which is utilized by the natives; and coal of rather poor quality
                    has been met with in various places, as in the district of Maros. The gold-mines
                    are mainly in the northern peninsula; but even there the amount actually
                    obtained is not so great as it was formerly. The various chiefs, bound by
                    contract to bring yearly a fixed quantity of the metal to the Dutch authorities,
                    frequently fail in their engagements, and many of them have been of necessity
                    exempted. The gold is usually found at a depth of from 12 to 75 feet; but there
                    are some mines in Bwool and Tontoli that reach 90 feet. In many, such as those
                    of Ankahulu, Pagiama, and Popasatu, it is very cold, and the miners have to sit
                    all day in nitrous water.</p>
                <p>The whole island is practically in the hands of the Dutch Government, though a
                    comparatively small portion is under their direct administration, and a large
                    number of petty princes are still permitted to do very much as they please in
                    the internal management of their territories. For administrative purposes it is
                    distributed among the residencies of Celebes, Manado, and Ternate, of which the
                    two former belong solely to the island, while the third includes a large part of
                    the Moluccas.</p>
                <p>The residency of Celebes, formerly known as the Government of Macassar, comprises
                    all the various states that surround the Gulf of Boni, and is divided into the
                    following departments:—(1) Macassar, (2) the Northern Districts, (3) the
                    Southern Districts, (4) Bulecomba and Bonthain, and (5) Saleyer and the
                    subordinate islands, Buton, Sumbawa, and Bima.</p>
                <p>The department of Macassar, or Mangkasara as it is called in the native language,
                    is one of the oldest parts of the Dutch possessions. It contains Macassar, the
                    capital of the residency, which is situated on the west coast of the southern
                    peninsula in 5° 7' 45" S. lat., forms one of the principal ports in the
                    archipelago, and has a population of from 15,000 to 20,000. The inhabitants of
                    the department consist mainly of Macassars and Malays proper, Endinese from the
                    Island of Flores, and immigrants from the neighbouring kingdom of Wadjo. The
                    foreign colonies are each under the management of a separate captain, and the
                    Malays are also under the care of a head priest. The Macassars proper are one of
                    the most important peoples in the island. They belong to the Malay race, are
                    well built and muscular, and have in general a “dark-brown complexion, a broad
                    and expressive face, black and sparkling eyes, a high forehead, a flattish nose
                    with large alae, a large mouth, and black soft hair, which they let fall over
                    their shoulders.” The women are sprightly, clever, and amiable, and in former
                    times were bought for large prices. The men are brave and not treacherous, but
                    ambitious, jealous, and extremely revengeful. Drunkenness is rare, but to
                    gambling and cock-fighting they are passionately addicted; and so frequent among
                    them is the running amuck that the Dutch authorities had to dismiss the Macassar
                    soldiers from their service. In all sorts of bodily exercises, as swinging,
                    wrestling, dancing, riding, and hunting, they take great pleasure. Though they
                    call themselves Mahometans, their religion is largely mingled with pagan
                    superstitions; they worship animals, and a certain divinity called Karaeng Lové,
                    who has power over their fortune and health. Their language, which belongs to
                    the Malayo-Javanese group, is spoken by about 300,000 persons, in Macassar
                    proper, Goa, Tello, Sanraboni, Turateya, Bulecomba, Tanralili, and a great many
                    parts of the southern peninsula; but it has a much smaller area than the
                    Buginese, which is the language of Boni. It is very deficient in
                    generalizations; thus, for example, it has words for the idea of carrying in the
                    hand, carrying on the head, carrying on the shoulder, and so on, but has no word
                    for the notion of simply carrying. It has adopted a certain number of vocables
                    from Sanskrit, Malay, Javanese, and Portuguese, but on the whole is remarkably
                    pure, and has undergone comparatively few changes in the course of the last two
                    or three centuries. It is written in a peculiar character, which has displaced,
                    and probably been corrupted from, an old form employed as late as the 17th
                    century. Neither bears any trace of derivation from the Sanskrit alphabet. The
                    priests affect the use of the Arabic letters. The literature is very poor, and
                    consists largely of romantic stories from the Malay, and religious treatises
                    from the Arabic. Of the few original pieces the most important are the early
                    histories of Goa, Tello, and some other states of Celebes, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rapang</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or collection of
                    the decrees and maxims of the old princes and sages. The more modern productions
                    are letters, laws, and poems, many of the last having very considerable beauty.
                    For his knowledge of the Macassar the European scholar is mainly indebted to the
                    labours of B. F. Malthes of the Dutch Bible Society, who was sentout in 1846,
                    and has published <hi rend="italic">Makassaarsche Spraakkunst</hi> (1858), <hi

                <p>The department of the Northern Districts, called also Maros (properly Marusa),
                    from the chief town, lies to the north of Macassar, and is divided into
                    twenty-six districts. It is watered by the River Maros, which has a channel of
                    great picturesqueness broken by waterfalls and bordered by caves. The mineral
                    products comprise gold, marble, porcelain-clay, and anthracite; but the
                    extensive rice-fields are the principal source of wealth. The river is commanded
                    by the fort of Valkenburg; and a great road, constructed in 1859, leads through
                    the department. About five miles from the town are the warm mineral springs of
                    Amarang and Magemba. The population is estimated at 120,000. The prevailing
                    language is Buginese, but Macassar is also spoken by a considerable number.</p>
                <p>The department of the Southern Districts, or Takalla, lies to the south-west of
                    Macassar, and is divided into two parts by the interposition of the little
                    independent state of Sanraboni. The population is estimated at 70,000, and the
                    language is Macassar. The people of the district of Glissong or Galesong are
                    remarkable for their attachment to a seafaring life. In 1863 the department was
                    increased by the annexation of Turateya, which included the three small states
                    of Bintamo, Bangkala, and Laikan, previously troublesome by their piracies and
                    raids. The Turateyans speak a mixture of Macassar and Buginese.</p>
                <p>Separated from Turateya by the River Tino is the department of Bonthain and
                    Bulecomba, a thinly-peopled and mountainous country, chiefly remarkable for the
                    lofty summit of Lompobattang or Dikbuik, more familiarly known as the Peak of
                    Bonthain, which has a height of about 11,000 feet. The soil is specially adapted
                    for the culture of coffee. The inhabitants are peaceful and well-behaved, but in
                    education and civilization they are less advanced than those of the departments
                    already described. They were formerly subordinate to the Macassar kingdom.</p>
                <p>To the north of these two states lies the important kingdom of Boni, of which an
                    account will be found in a separate article (vol. iv. p. 32), and to the north
                    of Boni, and separated from it by the River Chinrana, is the rival kingdom of
                    Wajo or Wadjo, with a coast line of about 50 miles along the Gulf of Boni. It is
                    governed by about forty chiefs or nobles, who are almost independent in their
                    respective districts and maintain their individual bands of followers, but at
                    the same time recognize the overlordship of the prince. The different offices of
                    the state are not unfrequently held by women; and the greatest importance is
                    attached to purity of descent. The inhabitants rather <pb break="no"

                    numbers of them resort to the neighbouring states as traders. The capital, was
                    formerly Tesora or Tossora, a large straggling city near the River Chinrana,
                    embracing within its fortifications a space of several miles in circuit. For
                    numerous details on this district the reader may consult Mundy’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Narrative of Events in Borneo and Celebes,</hi> vol. i.</p>
                <p>To the south-west of Wadjo is the kingdom of Sopeng, which was long connected by
                    intermarriages with Boni. The ground is very fruitful, and large quantities of
                    rice are exported. The capital was formerly a place of the same name on the
                    coast; but the rajah removed his residence to Sengkang on Lake Tempe. Sopeng
                    recognized the Dutch supremacy in 1825. The population is estimated at
                    18,000.</p>
                <p>To the north of Sopeng lies the territory of Adja Tam-karang, under the
                    government of the prince of Lidenring, who takes his title from a small
                    principality of that name. It is traversed by the Sadang River, one of the most
                    important of those that flow into the Strait of Macassar.</p>
                <p>Round the head of the Bay of Boni stretches the kingdom of Luvu (Loewoe), a
                    well-peopled district, productive of gold and excellent iron, but greatly
                    depressed by an unsatisfactory government. To the south-west of Luvu lie the
                    districts of Ussu and Lellevau. and south of these the state of Baikonka or
                    Minkoko, with its capital Pansulai on the Gulf of Boni; but the whole of this
                    region is comparatively unexplored. The Minkokos have a considerable resemblance
                    to the Dyaks of Borneo, and maintain a similar custom of head-hunting. Their
                    language is akin to Buginese.</p>
                <p>At the very end of the eastern peninsula is situated the district of Polean
                    Rumbia, conterminous on its north-east boundary with the more important
                    territory of Lavui, which stretches along the coast of the Bay of Tolo, and is
                    tributary to the king of Boni. The latter district possesses in Kendarior
                    Vosmaer’s Bay one of the finest harbours in the archipelago, and it carries on a
                    certain amount of traffic. The coast is frequented by numbers of the Bajows.</p>
                <p>The rest of the lands that lie round the Bay of Tolo belong to the residency of
                    Ternate. Conterminous with Lavui is the principality of Tombuku, a
                    densely-wooded, and partially-explored territory, governed by an hereditary
                    chief under the sultan of Ternate. The population is mainly settled in the
                    interior, and their numbers were estimated in 1852 at 15,000. They have no
                    regular coin, and strips of cotton cloth are used in exchange. Their language
                    seems to have almost no connection with any other in the archipelago. Among the
                    people along the coast excellent workers in metal are found, and earthenware is
                    also manufactured. The capital was formerly Lanona; but since 1856 this honour
                    belongs to Sabita. At the very head of the bay is the district of Tomore or
                    Tomaiki, with a river of the same name; while along the northern side are
                    situated the territories of Bangay and Balante. From the latter iron and timber
                    are exported.</p>
                <p>The country that lies round the Gulf of Gorontalo belongs to the residency of
                    Manado, and is divided into the Minahassa or Confederation of Mauado, the
                    department of Gorontalo, and various states, such as Parigi, Bwool, and others
                    that will be mentioned in the course of the article.</p>
                <p>Of these the most important is the Minahassa, or properly Ni-mahassa, of Manado,
                    which derives its name from the union of thirty-six states under the Dutch
                    supremacy to resist the claims of the king of Bolang, who had made himself at
                    one time master of the district. It occupies the most eastern part of the
                    northern peninsula, and is divided into the five departments of Manado, Kema,
                    Tondano, Amurang, and Bolang. Of the whole island it is the most distinctly
                    volcanic portion, and contains several mountains that have been in active
                    eruption within modern times. The most important summits are those of K labat
                    (6560 feet high), Saρutan (5960), Engerong (4050), Lokon (5240), Prumangan or
                    Mahabu (4300), Kimavang, and Papelampungan. In 1806 the Mountain Tonkoko threw·
                    forth a quantity of ashes and pumice-stone that darkened the air for two days
                    and covered the ground for many miles, with a layer an inch thick. There are
                    numerous boiling springs and geysers, the most interesting being Lahendang,
                    where the Count Charles de Vidua de Conzano met with his death in 1830. An
                    interesting account of a visit to several of these volcanic phenomena is given
                    by Μ <hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bickmore in his <hi rend="italic">East Indian
                    Archipelago.</hi> Perhaps in no part of their possessions have greater and
                    happier transformations been effected by the Dutch than in this district. In the
                    beginning of this century the inhabitants were still savages, broken up into
                    numerous tribes that were almost never at peace with each other, and speaking
                    such a variety of dialects that hardly any village was quite intelligible to its
                    neighbours. About 1822 it was discovered that the soil of the mountain sides was
                    fitted for the growth of coffee; the cultivation was introduced and a system
                    established which stimulated the native chiefs to undertake the management of
                    the plantations. The result has been not only to make the Minahassa one of the
                    best coffee districts in the archipelago, but to advance the civilization of the
                    inhabitants in a wonderful manner. Missions have been established by the Dutch
                    Missionary Society, and have met with the most encouraging success. In 1859 the
                    mission schools numbered 102, and were attended by 8996 pupils; while at the
                    same time 12 Government schools had 1049 pupils and 28 village schools had 1610.
                    The various local dialects are rapidly being replaced by Malay, which is the
                    language adopted for educational purposes. The villages, which have grown up in
                    considerable numbers, are neat and tidy, and most of the houses are well built;
                    the country is traversed by good roads, finely-shaded with trees and in many
                    cases fit for carriages; and bridges have been erected over the rivers. The
                    trade of the district is in a flourishing condition and promises to become more
                    important. The principal articles are the coffee, cocoa, rice, and trepang. In
                    1858 the number of households employed in the coffee-culture was 12,909; the
                    number oï trees in regular gardens was 3.449,518; and their produce for the year
                    amounted to 22,866 piculs. Since that date the plantations both of the
                    Government and private speculators have very largely increased. The plant
                    succeeds admirably at a height of from 1500 up to 4000 feet a <hi
                    rend="superscript"> κ</hi> ove the sea, and produces a fine kernel of a
                    translucent greenish blue colour, which is known in the market as Manado coffee,
                    and brings a much higher price than the Java growth. Cocoa was probably
                    introduced by the early Spanish navigators, but it received little attention
                    till about 1822, when some Dutch and Chinese settlers undertook its cultivation.
                    Since that time it has become a pretty important article, and has been
                    introduced into· Gorontalo and the Sangir Islands; but the crop is unfortunately
                    a somewhat precarious one. The koffo or Manilla-hemp. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Musa</hi><hi rend="italic">textilis)</hi> is largely grown, more especially in
                    the neighbourhood of Amurang, where the Government has established a rope
                    factory. The nutmeg, though only introduced in 1853, is now cultivated pretty
                    extensively. Tobacco is also grown, but mainly for home consumption. The best is
                    obtained from the district of Bantek. The population of the Minahassa was, in
                    1868, 105,514.</p>
                <p>The department of Gorontalo comprises the various districts of Gorontalo,
                    Limbotto, Bone, Bintauna, Suvava, Bolango, Attingola, Bualemo, Muton, Parigi,
                    Saussu, Posso, Tongko, Todjo, and the Togian Islands. .Gorontalo proper lies on
                    the north of the Tomini Bay. The inhabitants are mainly Mahometan Malays, and
                    they possess <pb break="no"

                    neither read nor write. The capital is a large and flourishing town with
                    considerable trade; it has a Dutch garrison and fort, and a Christian school.
                    The rivers and lake furnish abundance of fish, and almost every house has a pond
                    attached for keeping those captured alive. Limbotto, a small state of about 6000
                    inhabitants, since 1865 under Dutch direction, is chiefly noticeable for the Bay
                    of Kwandang and the gold-mines of Limbotto, Bulatu, and Sulametta. Muton
                    possesses several gold-mines. The village of that name lies in 0° 23' N. lat.
                    and I21° 30 18" E. long. Along the northern coast to the north of Muton lie the
                    states of Palele, Bwool, and Tontoli, of which the second is the most important,
                    being traversed by one of the largest rivers in the island, and possessing
                    valuable gold-mines and great numbers of sago-palms. The composition of its
                    population in 1870 was (according to J. G. K Riedel in the <hi rend="italic"

                    1874) 4229 natives, 726 from Gorontalo and Limbotto, 466 from Kayeli, 230
                    Buginese, 84 Tontoli, 38 Mandharese, and 22 Arabs. Tontoli was formerly the
                    resort of pirates, but in 1822 it was cleared by Captain De Man.</p>
                <p>Along the south side of the Bay of Gorontalo stretches the country of Parigi from
                    Amphibabu to the River Dulagu. It has a very fertile territory, and a
                    considerable trade is carried on with Palos and Dongala, the districts on Tomini
                    Bay, and Singapore. The exports are gold, horses, cocoa-nuts, bananas, and a
                    kind of resin called damar. Parigi recognized the Dutch supremacy in 1850, but
                    has preserved its autonomy, and is governed by a prince and several chiefs. The
                    principal village is Parigi di Atas.</p>
                <p>On the west coast of the island, and forming as it were the nucleus from which
                    the peninsulas spring, lie the districts of Dongala, Palos, and Kayeli. Dongala
                    is situated on the Bay of Palos, and is governed by a rajah who recognized Dutch
                    supremacy in 1824. Palos is governed by an independent chief, and is in a
                    flourishing condition. The town is situated in 0° 57' S. lat. and 119° 34'E.
                    long., and is connected by road with Parigi and Boni. Its inhabitants carry on
                    an active trade both by sea and land. The kingdom of Kayeli was at one time
                    under the sultan of Ternate, passed by conquest to the people of Macassar, was
                    restored to the sultan by the treaty of Bonga, and was by him presented to the
                    Dutch, whose authority was only recognized in 1854. The soil is well fitted for
                    cultivation, and yields coffee and cocoa-nuts for export. The kingdom of Mandhar
                    lies further south, and is governed by seven chiefs, who take their titles from
                    the seven principal rivers, and till 1854 recognized the supremacy of Boni. The
                    inhabitants speak a distinct language. Those on the coast are nominal
                    Mahometans, those inland are still pagan. They are active traders, and take
                    voyages to Java, Bencoolen, Malacca, Singapore, and Manilla. Toradja, which lies
                    further inland, is possessed by a wild pagan race, who keep themselves apart
                    from all intercourse, and are generally regarded as the original inhabitants of
                    the island.</p>
                <p>Celebes was first discovered by the Portuguese in the early part of the 16th
                    century, the exact date assigned by some authorities being 1512. The name does
                    not appear to be of native origin, and the plural form is probably due to the
                    belief that the different peninsulas were so many separate islands. At the time
                    of the Portuguese discovery, the Macassars were the most powerful people in the
                    island, having successfully defended themselves against the king of the Moluccas
                    and the sultan of Ternate. In 1609 the English attempted to gain a footing. At
                    what time the Dutch first arrived is not certainly known, but it was very
                    probably in the end of the 16th or beginning of the 17th century, since in 1607
                    they formed a connection with Macassar. In the year 1611 the Dutch East Indian
                    Company obtained the monopoly of trade on the Island of Buton; and in 1618 an
                    insurrection in Macassar gave them an opportunity of obtaining a definite
                    establishment there. In 1660 the kingdom was finally subjugated by Van Dam and
                    Truit-man, with a fleet of 33 ships and a force of 2700 men. In 1666 the war
                    broke out anew; but it was brought to an end by Speelman in the following year,
                    and the treaty of Bonga or Banga was signed, by which the Dutch were recognized
                    as the protectors and mediators of the different states who were parties to the
                    treaty. In 1683 the northeastern part of the island was conquered by Robert
                    Paddenburg, and placed under the command of the governor of the Moluccas. In
                    1703 a fort was erected at Manado. The kingdom of Boni was successfully attacked
                    by Van Geen in 1824, and in August of that year the Bonga treaty was renewed in
                    a greatly modified form. Since then the principal military event is the Boni
                    insurrection, which was quelled in 1859. With the exception of Manado, the Dutch
                    settlements in Celebes have not been financially successful; but as the
                    resources of the country are developed it will, doubtless, become a very
                    valuable possession.</p>
