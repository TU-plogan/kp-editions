                <p><label type="entry">CATTLE</label>, a term applied to the various races of
                    domesticated animals belonging to the genus <hi rend="italic">Bos,</hi> known
                    also as Oxen. They have been divided into two primary groups, the humped cattle
                    or zebus <hi rend="italic">(Bos</hi><hi rend="italic">indiens)</hi> of India and
                    Africa, and the straight-backed cattle <hi rend="italic">(Bos</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">taurus),</hi> which are common everywhere. By many naturalists
                    these groups have been regarded as mere races of the same species, and it is a
                    well-ascertained fact that the offspring arising from the crossing of the humped
                    and unhumped cattle are completely fertile; but the differences in their
                    osteology, configuration, voice, and habits are such as to leave little doubt of
                    their specific distinctness. Oxen appear to have been among the earliest of
                    domesticated animals, as they undoubtedly were among the most important agents
                    in the growth of early civilization. They are mentioned in the oldest written
                    records of the Hebrew and Hindu peoples, and are figured on Egyptian monuments
                    raised 2000 years before the Christian era; while the remains of domesticated
                    specimens have been found in the Swiss lake-dwellings along with the stone
                    implements and other records of Neolithic man. In infant communities an
                    individual’s wealth was measured by the number and size of his herds—Abram, it
                    is said, was rich in cattle;—and oxen for a long period formed, as they still do
                    among many Central African tribes, the favourite medium of exchange between
                    nations. After the introduction of a metal coinage into ancient Greece, the
                    former method of exchange was commemorated by stamping the image of an ox on the
                    new money; while the same custom has left its mark on the languages of Europe,
                    as is seen in the Latin word “pecunia” and the English “pecuniary,” derived from
                    “pecus,” cattle. The value attached to cattle in ancient times is further shown
                    by the Bull figuring among the signs of the zodiac; in its worship by the
                    ancient Egyptians under the title of Apis; in the veneration which has always
                    been paid to it by the Hindus, according to whose sacred legends it was the
                    first animal created by the three divinities who were directed by the supreme
                    Deity to furnish the earth with animated beings; and in the important part it
                    was made to play in Greek and Roman ^mythology. The Hindus were not allowed to
                    shed the blood of the ox, and the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0256-0245"/> Egyptians could only do so in sacrificing to
                    their gods. Both Hindus and Jews were forbidden, in their sacred writings, to
                    muzzle it when treading out the corn; and to destroy it wantonly was considered
                    a public crime among the Romans, punishable with exile.</p>
                <p>The domestic cattle of Europe, of which there are at least fifteen British, and a
                    considerably larger number of Continental breeds, have been, according to
                    Professors Nilsson and Rütimeyer, who have specially studied this subject,
                    derived from at least three distinct species or races— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bos</hi><hi rend="italic">primigenius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Bos
                    longifrons,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bos</hi><hi rend="italic">frontosus.</hi>
                    The first of these, the Urus, would seem, from its remains, to have been
                    domesticated among the Swiss lake-dwellers,— abounding then, and down to
                    historic times, in the wild state, throughout the forests of Europe. Caesar
                    describes it as existing, in his time, in the Hercynian Forest, in size almost
                    as large as an elephant, but with the form and colour of a bull; and it is
                    mentioned by Heberstein so late as the 16th century as still a favourite beast
                    of chase. The name Urus, applied to it by the Romans, is derived from Ur, a root
                    common to the Indo-European languages, and signifying original, primitive; and
                    may be traced in the Thur of Poland, Stier of the Germans, and the Latin Taurus,
                    as also in various names of places, as the Canton of Uri, Thuringian Forest,
                    Turin, and Tours. The Urus was characterized by its flat or slightly concave
                    forehead, its straight occipital ridge, and the peculiar curvature of its horns.
                    Its immense size may be gathered from the fact that a skull in the British
                    Museum, found near Atholl in Perthshire, measures 1 yard in length, while the
                    span of the horn cores is 3 feet 6 inches. Several breeds of cattle, as the
                    Friesland of the'Continent, and the Pembroke of England, are supposed to have
                    sprung from this source; while the so-called wild cattle of Britain <hi
                    rend="italic">(Bos taunts,</hi> var. <hi rend="italic">Scoticus)</hi> make the
                    nearest approach, according to Rütimeyer, of living forms to the Urus. This
                    breed is of a white colour, except the tips of the horns, which are dark, and
                    the ears and muzzle, which are either black or brownish red. Uniformity in
                    colour, however, is secured by the slaughter of all calves which differ from the
                    pure type. British wild cattle now exist only in Cadzow Forest, Chillingham
                    Park, Lyme Park, and Chartley, in all of which they are strictly preserved. The
                    purest bred are those of Chillingham—a park which was in existence in the 13th
                    century. These have red ears with brownish muzzle, and show all the
                    characteristics of wild animals. According to Mr Hindmarsh, who obtained his
                    information from the proprietor, “they hide their young, feed in the night,
                    basking or sleeping during the day; they are fierce when pressed, but, generally
                    speaking, very timorous, moving off on the appearance of any one ©ven at a great
                    distance.” The bulls engage in fierce contest for the leadership of the herd,
                    and the wounded are set upon by the others and killed; thus few bulls attain a
                    great age, and even those, when they grow feeble, are gored to death by their
                    fellows. The white cattle of Cadzow are very similar to those of Chillingham in
                    their habits, but being confined to a narrow area are less wild. They still form
                    a considerable herd, but of late years, it has been stated, they have all become
                    polled It is probable, as Sir Walter Scott used to maintain, that Cadzow and
                    Chillingham are but the extremities of what, in ruder times, was a continuous
                    forest, and that the white cattle are the remnants of those herds of “tauri
                    sylvestres” described by early Scottish writers as abounding in the forests of
                    Caledonia, and to which Scott evidently refers in the following lines :—</p>
                <p>“Mightiest of all the beasts of chase That roam in woody Caledon, Crashing the
                    forest in his race, The mountain bull comes thundering on.”</p>
                <p>It is still a matter of controversy whether these wild cattle are the unsubdued,
                    although degenerate, descendants of the mighty Urus, or merely the offspring of
                    a domestic breed run wild, which have reverted somewhat to the ancient type.
                    Their comparatively small size, and their evident tendency to vary in colour,
                    seem to point out the latter as the more probable view. A breed similar to the
                    Chülingham cattle existed in Wales in the 1Oth century, being white, with red
                    ears; and Welsh chroniclers relate how on one occasion a Prince of Wales
                    demanded, as compensation for certain injuries, 100 white or 150 black cattle,
                    and how also the anger of King John was at one time appeased by a gift of 1400
                    of the white variety,— showing that the latter were numerous, and sufficiently
                    under control to be collected and conveyed from one part of the country to
                    another, also that they were more highly valued than the black cattle,—in short,
                    that they existed at that time as a domesticated breed. According to Professor
                    <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> 1m</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">∖∖</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript smallcaps"> υ</hi><hi rend="italic">(Domesticated Animals of the
                    British Islands),</hi> this Welsh breed existed under domestication, in a
                    comparatively pure state, in Pembrokeshire at the beginning of the present
                    century. As the wild cattle of Britain, are prevented, by rigorous selection,
                    from deviating from their present colour, it is impossible to assert that the
                    ancient Urus was mainly white, although Darwin <hi rend="italic">(Animals and
                    Plants under Domestication)</hi> has brought forward some facts to show that
                    domestic cattle run wild seem to have a slight tendency to revert in that
                    direction. Immense herds of wild oxen in the Ladrone Islands are described in
                    <hi rend="italic">Anson’s Voyages</hi> as “being milk-white, except the ears,
                    which are generally black;” and in the southern districts of the Falkland
                    Islands, where cattle, introduced from La Plata, have run wild for at least a
                    century, they are “white, with their feet, or whole head, or only their ears,
                    black.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bos longifrons,</hi> according to Nilsson, existed in the wild
                    state in Sweden; but Rütimeyer holds that there is not sufficient evidence to
                    prove that it ever existed otherwise than domesticated in Central Europe. It
                    seems to have been the most common race of domestic cattle among the ancient
                    lake-dwellers, and several of the existing Swiss breeds are believed to be
                    derived from it. Remains of the same race are found in Britain associated with
                    those of the elephant and rhinoceros, and there is little doubt that Caesar
                    found large domestic herds of this kind on his arrival in Britain, and that
                    these supplied food to the Roman legions. Professor Owen regards it as the
                    original of our Welsh and Highland cattle. <hi rend="italic">Bos longifrons</hi>
                    was smaller than the ordinary breeds now existing, and had short horns. Whether
                    it is to be regarded as originally a wild European species, which Neolithic man
                    succeeded in domesticating, or merely as a domestic race introduced by settlers
                    from the East, as many on philological grounds suppose, it has undoubtedly had a
                    very considerable influence in the formation of our existing breeds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bos</hi><hi rend="italic">frontosus</hi> was somewhat larger
                    than <hi rend="italic">B. longifrons,</hi> with which it coexisted in certain
                    districts of Scandinavia. Its remains are found chiefly in the lake-dwellings of
                    the Bronze period, although occurring sparingly in those of earlier date. They
                    have also been found in Irish crannoges; and Nilsson regards it as the
                    progenitor of the present mountain cattle of Norway.</p>
                <p>The breeds and sub-breeds produced from those ancient races are exceedingly
                    numerous. “In Britain,” says Youatt, “they are almost as various as the soil of
                    the different districts, or the fancies of the breeders.” This variety may in
                    some degree be attributable to their being the descendants, in all probability,
                    of more than one species, to slight differences in the climate and pasturage of
                    different districts, or to the sudden appearance of w hat Darwin has <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n257/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0257-0246"/> termed “spontaneous variations;” but it is beyond
                    doubt mainly due to the long-continued and careful selection of the breeder. The
                    British forms, a detailed account of which will be found under the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Agriculture,</hi> vol. i. p. 387, may be conveniently arranged
                    in three classes :— (1.) <hi rend="italic">Polled Cattle,</hi> an artificial
                    variety which may be produced in any breed by selection; thus the polled cattle
                    of Galloway had small horns so late as the middle of the last century, but by
                    only breeding with bulls of the shortest horns, the grandfather of the present
                    earl of Selkirk succeeded in entirely removing those appendages; (2.) <hi
                    rend="italic">Short-horned Cattle,</hi> the descendants of <hi rend="italic">Bos
                    longifrons,</hi> represented in greatest purity by the Welsh and Highland
                    cattle, and probably differing little from the cattle found in Britain from the
                    Polished Stone age to the end of the Roman period; these were afterwards driven
                    with their masters from the open country to the hilly districts, before the
                    Saxon invaders, who probably brought with them (3.) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Long-homed Cattle,</hi> larger than the preceding, and of a red and white
                    colour, which have given rise to those breeds of cattle that now occupy the less
                    elevated and more fertile tracts of England. Those Saxon cattle may be regarded
                    as representing the <hi rend="italic">primigenius</hi> type. The long and short
                    horned varieties, however, interbreed freely, so that in many of our breeds the
                    two types are inextricably mixed.</p>
                <p>Of Continental forms the Hungarian is conspicuous from its great size, and the
                    extent of its horns, which often measure 5 feet from tip to tip. The cattle of
                    Friesland, Jutland, and Holstein form another large breed, and these, it is
                    said, were introduced by the Goths into Spain, thus becoming the progenitors of
                    the enormous herds of wild cattle which now roam over the Pampas of South
                    America. The latter, it is alleged by Spanish writers, have all sprung from
                    seven cows and a bull brought from Andalusia to the city of Assuncion in
                    Paraguay, about the year 1556. They are widely spread over the plains of that
                    continent, but are most numerous in the temperate districts of Paraguay and La
                    Plata—a fact which bears out the view taken by Darwin, that our oxen are the
                    descendants of species originally inhabiting a temperate climate. Except in
                    greater uniformity of colour, which is dark-reddish brown, the Pampas cattle
                    have deviated but little from the Andalusian type. They roam in great herds in
                    search of pasture, under the leadership of the strongest bulls, and avoid man,
                    who hunts them chiefly for the value of their hides, of which enormous numbers
                    are exported annually from Buenos Ayres. They are, however, readily reclaimed;
                    the wildest herds, according to Professor Low, being often domesticated in a
                    month. These cattle have hitherto been chiefly valued for their hides, and as
                    supplying animal food to the inhabitants, who only use the choicest parts; but
                    lately attempts have been made, and with considerable success, to export the
                    beef in a preserved state to Europe. Although the South American cattle have
                    thus sprung from a single European breed—that continent possessing no indigenous
                    species of taurine <hi rend="italic">Bovidoe,</hi> they have already given rise
                    to many well-marked varieties, as the polled cattle of Paraguay, the hairless
                    breed of Colombia, and that most monstrous of existing breeds, the Natas, two
                    herds of which Darwin saw on the banks of the Plata, and which he describes as
                    “bearing the same relation to other cattle as bull or pug dogs do to other
                    dogs.” Cattle have been introduced by the colonists into Australia and New
                    Zealand, where they are now found in immense herds, leading a sèmi-wild
                    existence on the extensive “runs” of the settlers. The Hottentots and Kaffres
                    possess several valuable breeds, as the Namaqua and Bechwana cattle, the latter
                    with horns which sometimes measure over 13 feet from tip to tip along the
                    curvature. The cattle of those semi-barbarous South Africans appear to be among
                    the most intelligent of their kind,—certain of them, known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >backleys,</hi> having been trained to watch the flocks, preventing them from
                    straying beyond fixed limits, and protecting them from the attacks of wild
                    beasts and from robbers. They are also trained to fight, and are said to rush
                    into battle with the spirit of a war-horse.</p>
                <p>Oxen, especially in Britain, have come to be regarded as dull and stupid animals,
                    but this is only true of such breeds as are reared solely for fattening and
                    killing. The wild cattle of Chillingham, and the semi-wild herds that abound on
                    the plains of South America, show no lack of sagacity in avoiding threatened
                    danger, or in combining to meet a common foe; while the <hi rend="italic"

                    Wherever, indeed, the ox is employed as a beast of burden or of draught, and it
                    is so in most countries, its intelligence is scarcely inferior to that of the
                    horse, while it surpasses the latter in docility and in the patient endurance of
                    toil. In the south-west of England the Devonshire cattle are largely employed in
                    husbandry, and the greater attention which has consequently been bestowed upon
                    them has been amply rewarded in the superior docility and intelligence of the
                    breed. Among the Swiss mountains there are herds of cows, whose leaders are
                    adorned with bells, the ringing of which keeps the cattle together, and guides
                    the herdsman to their pasture grounds. The wearing of the bells has come to be
                    regarded as an honourable distinction by the cows, and no punishment is felt so
                    keenly as the loss of them, the culprit giving expression to her sense of
                    degradation by the most piteous lowings.</p>
                <p>The period of gestation in the cow is nine months, when she usually produces a
                    single calf; occasionally, however, two are born, and when these are of
                    different sexes, the female is almost invariably barren, and is known as a
                    “free-martin,” that is, a cow free for fattening, from the Scotch word “mart,”
                    signifying a fattened ox.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to over-estimate the services rendered by the ox to the human
                    race. Living, it ploughs its owner’s land and reaps his harvest, carries his
                    goods or himself, guards his property, and, as has been seen, even fights his
                    battles, while its udders, which under domestication have been enormously
                    enlarged, yield him at all seasons a copious supply of milk. When dead, its
                    flesh forms a chief source of animal food; its bones are ground into manure or
                    turned into numerous articles of use or ornament; its skin is made into leather,
                    its ears and hoofs into glue; its hair is mixed with mortar; and its horns are
                    cut and moulded into spoons and other useful articles.</p>
                <p>Humped cattle are found in greatest perfection in India, but they extend eastward
                    to Japan and westward to the African Niger. They differ from the European forms
                    not only in the fleshy protuberance on the shoulders, but in the number of
                    sacral vertebrae, in the character of their voice, which has been described as
                    “grunt-like,” and also in their habits; “they seldom,” says Mr Blyth, “seek the
                    shade, and never go into the water and there stand knee-deep like the cattle of
                    Europe.” They now exist only in the domesticated state, and appear to have been
                    brought under the dominion of man at a very remote period, all the
                    representations of the ox on such ancient sculptures as those in the caves of
                    Elephanta being of the humped or zebu form. There are several breeds of the
                    zebu, the finest occurring in the northern provinces of India, where they are
                    used for riding,—carrying, it is said, a man at the rate of six miles an hour
                    for fifteen hours. White bulls are held peculiarly sacred by the Hindus, and
                    when they have been dedicated to Siva, by the branding of his image upon them,
                    they are thenceforth relieved from all labour. They go without molestation
                    wherever they choose, and <pb break="no"

                    themselves to whatever dainties they prefer from the stalls of the faithful. See
