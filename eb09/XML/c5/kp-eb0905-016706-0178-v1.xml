                <p><label type="entry">CARVING</label>. To carve (Anglo-Saxon, <hi rend="italic"
                        >ceorfan)</hi> is to cut, whatever the material; in strict language carving
                    is sculpture. The name of sculptor is commonly reserved for the great masters of
                    the art, while that of carvers is given to the artists or workmen who execute
                    subordinate decorations, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> of architecture in marble
                    or stone. The word is also specially applied to sculpture in ivory and its
                    substitutes, and in wood and other soft materials.</p>
                <p>True ivory is the tusk of the elephant, but other inferior kinds are produced by
                    the walrus, narwhal, and hippopotamus. Long before the art of metallurgy was
                    generally known, among the remotest pre-historic races, carvings on ivory and on
                    reindeer horn may be mentioned in evidence of the antiquity of this kind of art.
                    A piece of mammoth ivory with a rude engraving of a mammoth is preserved in the
                    Museum of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. Fragments of ivory and horn, carved
                    with excellent representations of animals, found in caves in the Dordogne in
                    France, may be seen in the British Museum.</p>
                <p>Coming to historic ages we find abundant evidence of the skill of the Egyptians
                    in ivory carving. Two daggers inlaid and ornamented with ivory, in the British
                    Museum, are attributed to the age of Moses. In the same collection are chairs of
                    the 16th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> inlaid with ivory; two boxes in
                    the shape of waterfowl and a small figure may perhaps be attributed to the 11th.
                    A number of carvings in ivory and bone of these and later dates are preserved in
                    the Egyptian galleries of the Louvre in Paris (Labarte, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Arts</hi><hi rend="italic">Industriels,</hi> p. 186).</p>
                <p>Ivory is mentioned among the imports of Solomon (1000 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.)</hi> His throne of ivory overlaid with the purest gold, and the ivory
                    house of King Ahab, are specially recorded; the words “ivory palaces” in the
                    45th psalm are more exactly rendered “wardrobes ”—chests of wood ornamented with
                    ivory. Horns, benches, and beds of ivory are mentioned in the prophetical books.
                    Amongst the Hebrews, as amongst other ancient nations, sceptres, thrones, and
                    other insignia of royalty are often spoken of as made of ivory. These objects
                    were frequently inlaid with precious stones.</p>
                <p>Mr Layard discovered many fragments of carved ivory in Nineveh, so brittle from
                    desiccation that they were boiled in gelatine to enable them to be safely
                    handled. The most interesting (dated by Mr Layard about 950 B.c.) are two small
                    tablets representing seated figures of Egyptian character with a cartouche
                    bearing hieroglyphics. Parts of the decoration were “enamelled with a blue
                    substance let into the ivory” (rather with slices of coloured vitreous pastes,
                    not true enamel), and the whole ground of the tablet was originally gilded,
                    remains of the gold leaf still adhering to it <hi rend="italic">(Nineveh and its
                        Remains,</hi> ii. p. 9).</p>
                <p>The Greeks made many precious objects in ivory even in the earliest times.
                    Phidias and his successors (in the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi>
                    made “chryselephantine” statues, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of ivory and gold,
                    and the practice was continued, probably, down to the Christian era. A great
                    number of such statues <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n179/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0179-0168"/> are described by Pausanias. The most
                    celebrated were the colossal statue of Athene at Athens, nearly 40 feet, and
                    that of Jupiter at Olympia, about 58 feet high. They were the largest and most
                    precious works ever executed in the material under discussion. It has been
                    stated by writers of various dates, from Pliny downwards, that the ancients had
                    methods of flattening and joining ivory so as to make it cover large surfaces,
                    but modern experiments of the recipes given have not verified these
                    statements.</p>
                <p>A few remains of ivory carvings found in Etruscan tombs in Italy are preserved in
                    the British Museum; others have been collected by Signor Castellani. Boman
                    ivories earlier than the 4th century are very rare. There are, however, in
                    various collections in England and on the Continent carved ivory tablets, called
                    consular diptychs, meant to fold up and to contain writing on the inside. They
                    were used by the Roman consuls, and sometimes sent by them as presents to great
                    personages. Half of one of the most beautiful of these works is preserved in the
                    Kensington Museum (No. 212∙65), the other half is in the Hotel de Cluny in
                    Paris—this piece is of the 3d century. The chair of St Maximian, covered with
                    ivory panels elaborately carved (6th century), is still in good preservation at
                    Ravenna.</p>
                <p>Ivory carving was carried on at Constantinople during the early Middle Ages.
                    Charlemagne did much to encourage and establish the arts in Northern Europe.
                    Ivory book-covers carved with Gospel subjects, pyxes, or small boxes for church
                    use, caskets, horns, and other valuable objects were carved in ivory during his
                    reign, and those of his immediate successors. They were set in gold or silver,
                    and sometimes with precious stones. An example of Anglo-Saxon workmanship (10th
                    century; is preserved in the Fitzwilliam Gallery in Cambridge. Combs both of
                    ivory aud bone of the Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods are not unfrequently found
                    in tombs in England. Carved folding trιptychs, shrines, and altar-pieces
                    containing sacred subjects in bas-relief, or figures of saints, with rich and
                    elaborate architectural details according to the style of the day, often
                    decorated with gold and colour, were made in great numbers from the 10th to the
                    IGth century, in most countries of Europe. Crucifixes and images of the Virgin
                    and the saints, made during these ages, are often graceful and beautiful
                    examples of small sculpture. To these should be added the pastoral staves
                    carried by bishops and abbots, and numbers of objects for secular use, such as
                    horns, combs, caskets, hilts of arms, and the like, carved in ivory for persons
                    of wealth, throughout the Middle Ages. They reached their highest perfection
                    during the 13th and 14th centuries. The religious subjects carved in ivory by
                    Spanish artists were of great excellence before the 16th century.</p>
                <p>The great sculptors of the Renaissance are credited, though often without
                    sufficient authority, with many works in ivory still preserved in public
                    galleries. The scholars of Cellini and Raphael certainly carved with great skill
                    in this material. Examples attributed to the masters themselves are shown in the
                    galleries of Munich and Vienna. Germany, Flanders, Holland, and Spain were
                    distinguished for ivory carvers during the 16th century. Augsburg and Nuremberg
                    were especially renowned in this respect. The carved drums of vases and
                    tankards, bas-relief plaques or panels set in silver gilt and gold are to be
                    seen in the galleries of Munich, Vienna, and Berlin. Dagger and knife hilts and
                    sheaths, powder-flasks, and statuettes of admirable execution, continued to be
                    made in ivory down to the middle of the 17th century. There are good examples in
                    the Green Vaults in Dresden and in many other collections. Several German
                    princes, as well as Peter the Great, carved and turned ivory in the lathe, and
                    remarkable specimens of their work may be seen in the Green Vaults.</p>
                <p>Among the best Italian ivory carvers of the 16th century may be reckoned the
                    pupils of Valerio Vicentino and Bernardo of Caste! Bolognese. A fine bas-relief
                    by Alessandro Algardi, of the 17th century, is preserved in the Basilica of St
                    Peter in Rome. Other well-known artists were Cope and François Du Quesno∕,
                    called the Fleming (1594-1644), the latter of great eminence; Jacob Zeller, a
                    Dutchman; Leo Pronner of Nuremberg; Van Obstal of Antwerp, settled in France;
                    Leonard Kern and Angermann of Nuremberg ( 17th century); Barthel (died at
                    Dresden 1694), who excelled in carving animals; Leonard Zick of Nuremberg ( 17th
                    and 18th centuries), who carved puzzle balls, like those of the Chinese; Stephan
                    Zick, who carved eyes and ears, examples of which may be seen in the Green
                    Vaults; Belthasar Permoser, a Bavarian settled in Dresden (1650-1732); and Simon
                    Troger (18th century), a carver of great skill in ivory who added fanciful
                    details in brown wood; examples of his compositions are preserved in the
                    Kensington Museum, the Royal Museum of Turin, and the Green Vaults of
                    Dresden.</p>
                <p>Ivory carving has long been cultivated in the East. In many parts of India,
                    Bombay especially, ivory is carved, pierced, and inlaid with great skill. The
                    Bombay carvers borrowed this art from the Persians. The Chinese carve slabs of
                    ivory and entire tusks with elaborate compositions of figures and landscape.
                    They carve and pierce puzzle balls, cut one inside another out of single pieces
                    of ivory. The skill of the Japanese is still greater. Their groups of small
                    figures, animals, shells, insects &lt;fcc., show a power of representing animal
                    life, and a dexterity in inlaying ivory with metals and other substances
                    probably never surpassed. If the art of both nations is somewhat grotesque,
                    their power of hand has had but few equals in ancient or in modern times.</p>
                <p>A modern school of ivory carving, that has become a small trade, is established
                    at Dieppe in France. Many crucifixes and religious images are produced there of
                    considerable merit.</p>
                <p>Implements and furniture have been carved in wood from very ancient times. The
                    perishable nature of the material forbids the hope of finding remains of such
                    remote antiquity as we have in ivory, bone, and horn. It cannot be doubted,
                    however, that the weapons and utensils of the stone age were fitted to handles
                    of wood and bound on with thongs of hide or animal sinews. Most ethnographical
                    collections possess paddles and weapons made by more recent races in a primitive
                    state of knowledge and cultivation. Often these utensils are diapered over in
                    patterns of* much elegance,—those, for instance, of Mexico, New Zealand, and
                    Polynesia. The figure-head of a New Zealand canoe of brown wood carved in
                    graceful convolutions, resembling the designs of the Scandinavian artists, was
                    exhibited amongst the collections of the duke of Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>Pausanias states that all the most ancient races carved statues out of wood, and
                    mentions specially those of Egypt, z∖ccording to Sir G. Wilkinson wooden statues
                    continued to be erected in Egyptian temples till the times of the later
                    Pharaohs. Sycamore was the wood in general use for furniture, and cedar for
                    mummy cases, which are carved into the shape of the mummy, painted and gilt.
                    Timber was imported into Egypt, and rare woods were inlaid both in furniture and
                    statues (see Birch, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Roy. Sοc.,</hi> iii. p. 172). A
                    bas-relief in hard wood, attributed to the 6th, 7th, or 8th dynasty (above 2000
                    years B.c.), is preserved in the Louvre.</p>
                <p>The Hebrews of the age of Moses seem to have been more skilful as metallurgists
                    than as wood carvers, but <pb break="no"

                    was lined with cedar, and the walls elaborately carved with figures of
                    cherubims, palm trees, and open flowers all gilt. Two cherubims, 10 cubits high
                    were carved in olive, a very durable wood. Solomon imported ebony and other rare
                    woods for his musical instruments and furniture.</p>
                <p>Wood was used by the Greek sculptors before the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.,</hi> and Pausanias enumerates many statues made of different woods,
                    some of several kinds of wood extant in Greece in his time (bk. ii. and
                    vii.)</p>
                <p>The Romans, who used bronze and marble for their furniture in later times, were
                    still curious in woods, which were carved or polished and reserved for many
                    purposes, and when of fine grain were extravagantly valued. Tacitus speaks of
                    the rude wooden idols of the Germans.</p>
                <p>The fact that a great part of Europe was covered with oak, pine, and other
                    forests made the use of timber universal during the Middle Ages; many memorials
                    remain of the skill both of constructors and carvers in oak and other woods.
                    Churches, houses, even entire cities were of timber; many of these remain in
                    Northern Germany, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>
                    in Hanover, Hildesheim, and Brunswick, in towns of Brittany and Perigord, and in
                    Blois, Coventry, Chester, and other cities of France and England. Beam ends,
                    brackets, door heads and gables were often effectively carved. Two doors,
                    remains of churches in Norway (of the 11th or 12th century), entirely
                    constructed of timber, carved in a large-grained pine wood into a complicated
                    but graceful composition of dragons and serpents, were exhibited at South
                    Kensington in 1868. The most elaborate and artistic carved work of the Middle
                    Ages is to be found in the shrines or “retables” placed on altars, some of small
                    chamber size, others 20 to 30 feet in height. They were made in countless
                    numbers in Germany, Spain, France, Flanders, and England. The principal space of
                    the shrine was filled by figures standing or seated under elaborate carved
                    tabernacle work,—sometimes with complete pictorial compositions representing
                    well-known legends of the saints. Generally these figures were gilded and
                    painted. Often the shutters on the sides were painted with illustrative
                    subjects, frequently painted on both sides, so as to be seen whether the shrine
                    was open or shut. Many Lutheran churches in Nuremberg retain these ornaments
                    exactly as they stood in Catholic times. The 15th and 16th centuries were
                    prolific in these rich structures. A famous triptych by Hans Bruggemann (1515)
                    is preserved in the cathedral of Schleswig, an earlier one by Michel Pacher of
                    Brauneck at Wolfgang-sur-le-Lac near Ichel. To the triptychs should be added the
                    stall work of the 14th, 15th, 16th centuries, as in the cathedrals of Cologne,
                    Amiens, and Ulm, and in many English churches. Another class of carvings may be
                    studied in the vast roofs, such as that of Westminster Hall; the roofs of many
                    churches in Norfolk, and many halls in the old colleges and Tudor mansions are
                    decorated with carved figures and heraldry.</p>
                <p>In the 16th century the great cities of Italy—Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan,
                    Ferrara, Urbino, and others— abounded in richly carved gilt and inlaid
                    furniture, chairs, wardrobes, chests — such as contained bridal
                    trousseaux—mirror frames, caskets, even bellows. They were of walnut, cypress,
                    cedar, ebony, and other woods,— inlaid with ivory, agates, and ornaments of
                    hammered silver. Rich and beautiful examples of such work are preserved in the
                    museum at South Kensington, the Hotel de Cluny, the Kunst Kammer of Berlin, and
                    other collections. The 16th century stall-work of many Venetian churches, the
                    panel-work of the old rooms in the Louvre iu Paris, the fire-places seen in many
                    old 16th century palaces, specially that of the Palace of Justice in Bruges, are
                    examples of admirable decorative carving on a large scale.</p>
                <p>The Spanish wood-carvers during this period had a just celebrity. Their religious
                    imagery is admirably designed, true to nature, and devotional, pathetic, and
                    tender in expression. They coloured the figures up to nature, but nothing was
                    lost in this process. The great Renaissance painters and masters of Germany
                    practised wood-carving of great excellence. Wohlgemuth of Nuremberg, Albert
                    Durer, Veit Stoss, Ludwig Krug, Peter Flotner, &lt;fcc., carved classical
                    subjects, portraits in medallions, delicate basreliefs on draught men made of
                    box and other hard woods, which are to be seen in many collections. They carved
                    as often in hone stone, and modelled medallions, statuettes, and minute busts in
                    wax, sometimes coloured up to life.</p>
                <p>A rilievo on hone stone by Albert Durer is preserved in the British Museum;
                    others on wood in the united collections in Munich, on wood and hone stone by
                    Lucas Kranach the painter in the Kunst Kammer, Berlin, on wood with the monogram
                    of Hans Schauffin in the same collection, one attributed to Lucas Van Leyden the
                    painter in the National Library, Paris. The Augsburg artists worked more
                    generally in wood only. Rosary beads of box, ∣ to ∣ of an inch in diameter, some
                    made to open, carved with minute figure subjects of great excellence, may be
                    seen in South Kensington and in other collections. During the same period minute
                    Scripture subjects were carved in box on crosses and small triptychs by the
                    monks of Mount Athos, the inheritors of the old Byzantine art.</p>
                <p>In the 16th century curious minute works, entire compositions, were carved by
                    Properzia de’ Rossi in peach stones. One is preserved in the Museum of Turin. A
                    cherry stone on which a “gloria” of saints is carved is preserved among the
                    Florentine gems. Leo Pronner, already named, also carved microscopic work on
                    cherry stones.</p>
                <p>A carver of great skill, Grinling Gibbons (1650-1721), founded a school of
                    decorative carving in England which survived till near the end of the last
                    century. The facility of execution in carving soft woods for gilding, to make
                    frames, carriages, and furniture was very great during the earlier years of the
                    last century. The taste was best in Italy and most extravagant in France. A
                    revival of classic taste began with the reign of Louis XVI., and at about the
                    same time in England, influenced by the brothers Adam and by many excellent
                    carvers of furniture and decorative wood-work.</p>
                <p>The carvings of the mountain villagers in Switzerland and the Tyrol are spirited,
                    and are well executed, with simple tools, generally in pine wood. What has been
                    said of the Indians, Persians, Chinese, and Japanese regarding ivory-carving,
                    applies equally to their skill in carving and inlaying wood.</p>
                <p>In most countries of Europe the art has been much displaced in recent times by
                    moulded work in various materials and by metal-casting.</p>
