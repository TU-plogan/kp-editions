                    knight by Duarte de Menezes the governor, and where he remained several years.
                    In 1535 he accompanied Dorn Luis to the siege of Tunis, where he had the honour
                    of refusing knighthood and reward at the hands of the great emperor Charles V.
                    Returning to Lisbon, he received from the king the small commandership of São
                    Pablo de Salvaterra in 1538. He was exceedingly poor, but his wife Lenor de
                    Coutinho, a noble Portuguese lady, the exact date of whose marriage with him is
                    not known, admired and appreciated her husband sufficiently to make light of
                    their poverty. Soon after this he left for the Indies in company with his uncle
                    Garcia de Noronha, and on his arrival at Goa enlisted among the <hi
                    rend="italic">aventureiros,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> the bravest of the
                    brave,” told off for the relief of Diu. In 1540 he served on an expedition under
                    Estabão de Gama, by whom his son, Alvaro de Castro, a child of thirteen, was
                    knighted, out of compliment to him. Returning to Portugal, João de Castro was
                    named commander of a fleet, in 1543, to clear the European seas of pirates; and
                    in 1545 he was sent, with six sail, to the Indies, in the room of Martin de
                    Souza, who had been dismissed the viceroyalty. The next three years were the
                    hardest and most brilliant, as they were the last, of this great man’s
                    life,—years of battle and struggle, of glory and sorrow, of suffering and
                    triumph. Valiantly seconded by his sons (one of whom, Fernão, was killed before
                    Diu) and by João Mascarenhas, João de Castro achieved such popularity by the
                    overthrow of Mahmoud, king of Cambodia, by the relief of Diu, and by the defeat
                    of the great army of Adhel Khan, that he could contract a very large loan with
                    the Goa merchants on the simple security of his moustache. These great deeds
                    were followed by the capture of Broach, by the complete subjugation of Malacca,
                    and by the passage of Antonio Moniz into Ceylon; and in 1547 the great captain
                    was appointed viceroy by João III., who had at last accepted him without
                    mistrust. He did not live long to fill this charge, expiring in the arms of his
                    friend, St Francis Xavier, 6th June of the following year. He was buried at Goa,
                    but his remains were afterwards exhumed and conveyed to Portugal, to be
                    reinterred under a splendid monument in the convent of Bemfica.</p>
