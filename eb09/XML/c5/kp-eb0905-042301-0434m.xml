                <p><label type="entry">CHARLES</label> 11. (1332-1387), king of Navarre and count of
                    Evreux, was a grandson of Louis Hutin, and possessed a title to the French
                    throne inferior to that of John II. only on account of the Salic law, and
                    superior to that of Edward III. of England. Handsome, clever, eloquent, and
                    bold, he yet thoroughly deserved the title of “the Bad” with which he mounted
                    the throne in 1349, at the age of sixteen. The commencement of his notorious
                    career was the assassination of Le Cerda, the favourite of John, who had been
                    appointed to the duchy of Angoulême, which the king had bought from Charles’s
                    mother, but of which the price was not yet paid. For this deed,—which Charles
                    openly avowed, declaring it to be a punishment richly deserved,— John was at
                    first unable to retaliate, being indeed obliged to make good his debts; but not
                    long after (1356) Charles was seized and thrown into prison. During the king’s
                    exile in England, Charles, aided by the States-General, obtained his release,
                    and by his eloquence and the suavity of his manners gained the hearts of the
                    Parisians, who made him their captain-general. Suspecting him, however, of too
                    great favour for the aristocracy, they deprived him of the office; but he
                    maintained his alliance with Stephen Marcel, and, at the head of companies of
                    banditti he continued to lay waste the country till 1360, when he made peace
                    with the king. This peace was not final, for Charles V. was resolved to crush
                    him. He was accused of various unscrupulous plots, and extravagant stories were
                    circulated against him, as, for example, that the king’s weakness was due to
                    poison administered by his contrivance. On the charge of being concerned in
                    these intrigues, two of his ministers were executed, and his two sons were
                    seized as hostages. The duke of Anjou was persuaded to attack Montpellier, the
                    king of Castile to invade Navarre, and Duguesclin was sent to seize his fiefs in
                    Normandy, and Charles was obliged to yield twenty places as security before he
                    regained his territory. According to the popular story, he expired by a divine
                    judgment, through the burning of the clothes steeped in sulphur and spirits in
                    which he had been wrapped as a cure for a loathsome disease caused by his
                    debauchery; but the bishop who attended him affirms that he died placidly and in
                    the odour of sanctity (1387). See Secousse, <hi rend="italic">Histoire
