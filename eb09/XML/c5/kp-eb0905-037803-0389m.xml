                    buildings may be mentioned the cathedral of St Etienne, originally founded in
                    the 12 th century on the site of an earlier church, but in several portions
                    dating only from the 17th; the churches of Nôtre Dame, St Alpin, St Jean, and St
                    Louis, belonging respectively to the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries; the
                    town-house, which was erected in 1771; the prefecture, formerly the palace of
                    the count of Artois; the barracks of St Pierre, on the site of the Benedictine
                    abbey; the public library; and the industrial school. The town is the seat of a
                    bishopric, and has tribunals of primary instance and commerce, a communal
                    college, two theological seminaries, a normal school, a theatre, a museum, a
                    botanical garden, and societies of agriculture, commerce, arts, and sciences. To
                    the east of the town lies a large public park of 19 acres, known as the Jard,
                    which was stripped of its trees during the war of 1870-1; and beyond the river
                    is the Church of St Prudentienne, annually in the month of May the rendezvous of
                    about 50,000 pilgrims. Châlons has long been an important industrial centre. As
                    early as the 14th century, it was famous for its woollen cloth, which was known
                    by the name of the town, afterwards corrupted into “shalloon and in the 18th it
                    maintained an extensive manufacture of linen goods of various kinds. Besides
                    these industries, it now carries on tanning and shoemaking, and the manufacture
                    of cotton cloth and hosiery, while at the same time it is one of the principal
                    seats of the champagne wine trade. The annual export amounts on an average to
                    1,000,000 bottles, and the cellars of Jacquesson et Fils have storage room for
                    3,000,000. About six miles east of the town is the beautiful church of Nôtre
                    Dame de ΓEpine, which was built in the 15th century, and restored in 1860.
                    Population in 1872, 16,436.</p>
                <p>Ch âlons-sur-Marne occupies the site of the chief town of the Catalauni, which
                    became signalized by the defeat of Attila in the terrible conflict of 451. In
                    643 it was laid waste by Herbert of Vermandois, in 931 by Ralph of Burgundy, and
                    in 947 by Robert of Vermandois; but in the four following centuries it attained
                    great prosperity as a kind of independent state under the supremacy of its
                    bishops, who held a most influential position in the kingdom, and obtained the
                    title of grand-vassals of the crown. In 1214 the men of Châlons appeared in the
                    first rank in the battle of Bouvines; and in the 15th century their descendants
                    maintained their honour by twice (in 1430 and 1434) repulsing the English from
                    their walls. In the 16th century the town sided with Henry IV., who in 1589
                    transferred thither the parliament of Paris, which shortly afterward was bold
                    enough to burn the bulls of Gregory XIV. and Clement VIII. In 1814 the Prussians
                    took possession of the town <pb break="no"

                    was captured by Chernicheff. In 1856 Napoleon established a large camp, known as
                    the Camp of Chalons, about 16 miles north of the town by the railway to Rheims.
                    It was situated in the immediate neighbourhood of Grand Mourmelon and Petit
                    Mourmelon, and occupied an area of 12,000 hectares or 29,650 acres. The troops
                    were principally accommodated in tents, but also partly in wooden barracks. At
                    the outbreak of the Franco-German war, the camp was occupied by the sixth army
                    corps, under Canrobert, and it was afterwards held by MacMahon. On 22d August
                    1870, the town of Chalons was occupied by the Prussians, and in the course of
                    the war it formed an important point of communication.</p>
