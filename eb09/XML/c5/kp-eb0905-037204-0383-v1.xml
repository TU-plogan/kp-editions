                    (1691-1781), an eminent Roman Catholic prelate, born at Lewes, Sussex, 29th
                    September 1691. After the death of his father, who was a rigid Dissenter, his
                    mother sought refuge with some Roman Catholic families, the consequence being
                    that the son was brought up in their religion, chiefly at the seat of Mr Holman
                    at Warkworth, Northamptonshire, where the Rev. John Gother, a celebrated
                    controversialist, officiated as chaplain. In 1704 he was sent to the English
                    College at Douay, where he was ordained a priest, took his degrees in divinity,
                    and was appointed professor in that faculty. In 1730 he was sent on the English
                    mission and stationed in London. The controversial treatises that he now
                    published in rapid succession attracted much attention, particularly his <hi
                        rend="italic">Catholic Christian Instructed,</hi> which was prefaced by a
                    witty reply to Dr Conyers Middleton’s <hi rend="italic">Letter from Rome,
                        showing an exact conformity between Popery and Paganism.</hi> Middleton is
                    said to have been so irritated that he endeavoured to put the penal laws in
                    force against his antagonist, who prudently withdrew from London until the
                    commotion subsided. On 29th January 1741, Challoner was raised to the episcopal
                    dignity at Hammersmith, by the title of bishop of Debra, <hi rend="italic"
                        >in</hi><hi rend="italic">partibus infidelium,</hi> and nominated coadjutor,
                        <hi rend="italic">cum jure</hi><hi rend="italic">successionis,</hi> to
                    Bishop Petre, Vicar-Apostolic of the London district. Accordingly, on the
                    decease of that prelate in 1758, Challυner succeeded to the Vicariate-Apostolic.
                    He resided principally in London, but was obliged to retire into the country
                    during the “No Popery” riots of 1780. Soon afterwards he died, on January 12,
                    1781, and was buried at Milton, Berkshire. Bishop Chailoner was the author of
                    numerous controversial and devotional works, which have been frequently
                    reprinted and translated into various languages. He compiled the <hi
                        rend="italic">Garden of the Soul,</hi> which continues to this day to be the
                    most popular manual of devotion among English-speaking Roman Catholics; and he
                    revised an edition of the Douay version of the Scriptures <pb break="no"

                    orthography, which in many places had become obsolete. Of his historical works
                    the most valuable is one which was intended to be a Roman Catholic antidote to
                    Foxe’s well-known martyrology. īt is entitled <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of

                    the lives of English, Scotch, and Irish saints, under the title of <hi
