                    rend="smallcaps">Crassus,</hi> was, according to Livy, a patrician notorious for
                    his pride and cruelty and his bitter hatred of the plebeians. Twice they refused
                    to fight under him, and, fleeing before their enemies, brought upon him defeat
                    and disgrace. He retaliated by decimating the army. At length they effected his
                    banishment, but he quickly returned, and again became consul. In the same year
                    (451 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.)</hi> he was made one of the decemviri who had
                    been appointed to draw up a code of written laws, and so carefully did he act
                    during his first year of office that he was the only one of the ten who was
                    re-elected. With Claudius at their head, the new decemviri appear to have
                    resolved on retaining permanent authority, but an outburst of popular feeling
                    suddenly crushed their power. Enamoured of the beautiful daughter of the
                    plebeian centurion Virginius, Claudius attempted to seize her by an abuse of
                    justice. One of his clients, Marcus Claudius, swore that she was the child of a
                    slave belonging to him, and that she had been stolen by the childless wife of
                    the centurion. Virginius was summoned from the army, but a private message was
                    sent at the same time instructing the general to detain him. The first messenger
                    was more speedy than the second, and on the day of trial Virginius was present
                    to expose the conspiracy. Still judgment was given according to the evidence of
                    Marcus, and Claudius commanded Virginia to be given up to him. There was but one
                    way of escape, and in despair, her father seized a knife from a neighbouring
                    stall and plunged it in her side. The popular passion was deeply stirred.
                    Virginius, with Icilius, the betrothed lover of his daughter, and Nαmitorius,
                    her uncle, hurried to arouse the army; Horatius and Valerius put themselves at
                    the head of the people. The decemviri were overthrown; and Appius Claudius died
                    in prison, either by his own hand or by that of the executioner. Mommsen rejects
                    the view given as above by Livy, and is inclined to hold that Claudius, as
                    decemvir, was the pretended champion of the plebs, and that the revolution which
                    ruined him was a return of the people to the rule of the patricians, who are
                    represented by Horatius and Valerius. See appendix to vol. i. of his <hi
