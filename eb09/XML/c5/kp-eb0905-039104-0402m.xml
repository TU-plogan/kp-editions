                    being situated in the great bay of St Michael, which is bounded by the coasts of
                    the departments of Manche, Ille-et-Vilaine, and Côtes du Nord. They are
                    naturally divided into four principal groups—the northern, which includes
                    Alderney, Burhou, and the Casquets, lying off the Cape de la Hogue; the
                    north-central, comprising Guernsey, Herrn, and Sark, about eighteen miles to the
                    south-west; the south-central, or Jersey and its adjacencies, more towards the
                    centre of the bay; and the southern, or the Minquiers and Chausseys, with their
                    multitudinous islets. The total area is about 75 square miles, or 48,000
                    acres.</p>
                <p>The geological character of all the groups is in their principal features the
                    same, for the islands consist almost exclusively of igneous rocks in various
                    stages of decomposition. They have been denuded of nearly all the fossili ferons
                    and stratified rocks with which at an earlier period they <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n403/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0403-0392"/> would seem to have been covered. The process
                    which has thus stript the islands is still going on around the coasts, wearing
                    the cliffs into caves and gullies, and grinding the rocks into shingle and sand.
                    The tide in St Michael’s bay is of very considerable force, and rises to a
                    height of about forty feet at Jersey, and to about thirty at Guernsey, while the
                    difference of high water at spring and neap tides is seventeen feet at the
                    former island and eleven at the latter.</p>
                <p>The minerals belonging to granitic rocks are very abundant, such as crystals of
                    felspar and hornblende, and many kinds of quartz and felspar, is everywhere
                    abundant.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">flora</hi> of the islands is remarkably rich considering
                    their extent nearly 2000 different species of plants having been counted
                    throughout the group. Of timber properly speaking there is hardly any, but the
                    evergreen oak, the elm, and the beech grow well and are abundant. Wheat is the
                    principal grain in cultivation; but far more ground is taken up with turnips and
                    potatoes, mangold, parsnip, and carrot. The tomato ripens as in France, and the
                    Chinese yam has been successfully grown. There is a curious cabbage, chiefly
                    cultivated in Jersey, which shoots up into a long woody stalk from 10 to 15 feet
                    in height, fit for walking-sticks or palisades. Grapes and peaches come to
                    perfection in green-houses without artificial heat; and not only apples and
                    pears but oranges and figs can be reared in the open air. The arbutus ripens its
                    fruit, and the camellia clothes itself with blossom, as in more southern
                    climates; the fuchsia reaches a height of 15 or 20 feet, and the magnolia
                    attains the dimensions of a tree. Of the flowers, both indigenous and exotic,
                    that abound throughout the islands, it is sufficient to mention the Guernsey
                    lily with its rich red petals, which is supposed to have been brought from
                    Japan.</p>
                <p>The number of the species of the mammalia is little over twenty, and several of
                    these have been introduced by man. There is a special breed of horned cattle,
                    and each island has its own variety, which is carefully kept from all
                    intermixture. The animals are small and delicate, and marked by a peculiar
                    yellow colour round the eyes and within the ears. The red deer was once
                    indigenous, and the black rat is still common in Alderney and Herrn. Nearly 300
                    species of birds have been found, or more than half the whole British list.
                    There are few localities in the northern seas which are visited by a greater
                    variety of fish, and the coasts abound in Crustacea, shell-fish, and
                    zoophytes.</p>
                <p>Owing to the Norman system of land-tenure being still in force, the land is
                    parcelled out among a great number of small proprietors, and in Alderney, for
                    example, five or eight acres of arable land is accounted a fair estate. The
                    results of this arrangement seem to be favourable in the extreme. Every corner
                    of ground is carefully and intelligently cultivated, and a considerable
                    proportion is allotted to market-gardening. The cottages are neat and
                    comfortable, the hedges well trimmed, and the roads kept in excellent repair.
                    Wealth is for the most part pretty equally distributed, and poverty or pauperism
                    is comparatively unknown. There is a very considerable export and import trade,
                    the value of the produce and manufactures of the islands dispatched to England
                    in 1874 amounting to £459,639, or between £9 and £10 for every acre of land;
                    while the total importation of British and foreign articles reached the sum of
                    £982,656. The population of the whole group has largely increased during the
                    present century, though, on account of exceptional causes, the numbers in
                    Alderney, Sark, and a few of the smaller islands are not so great as they were a
                    few years ago. In 1821 Jersey had 28,600 inhabitants, as compared with 56,627 in
                    1871; and Guernsey and the dependent islands, inclusive of Alderney, Sark,
                    &lt;fcc., had 20,827, as compared with 33,699. For further details on the
                    economical condition of the islands the reader may consult the separate articles
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Alderney, Jersey,</hi> &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>The language spoken in ordinary life by the inhabitants of the islands is in
                    great measure the same as the Old Norman French, though modern French is used in
                    the law courts, and English is taught in all the parochial schools, and is
                    familiar to a gradually increasing proportion of the population, especially in
                    Jersey and Alderney. The several islands have each its own dialect, differing
                    from that of the others at once in vocabulary and idiom; and a very marked di
                    fference is observable between the pronunciation in the north and the south of
                    Guernsey. It has even been asserted that every parish in that island has some
                    recognizable peculiarity of speech; but if this is the case, it is probably only
                    in the same way in which it could be asserted of neighbouring parishes
                    throughout the country. None of the dialects have received much literary
                    cultivation, though Jersey is proud of being the birthplace of one of the
                    principal Norman poets, R. Wace, and has given a number of writers to English
                    literature. The Guernsey patois is rendered pretty well known to the philologist
                    by the <hi rend="italic">Himes Guern¢· siaises</hi> of George Métivier, who has
                    since published a <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Franco-Normand, ou Recueil des
                    mots particuliers au dialecte</hi><hi rend="italic">de Guernesey,</hi> 1870; and
                    a fair idea of that of Jersey is obtainable from the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The original ethnology and pre-Christian history of the Channel Islands are
                    largely matters of conjecture and debate. Of early inhabitants abundant proof is
                    afforded by the numerous megalithic monuments—cromlechs, kistvaens, and
                    maenhirs—still extant in various quarters, and it is well known that the number
                    of these memorials was much greater in recent centuries. One of the most
                    important, indeed—a cromlech near St Helier’s—was only removed in 1788. But
                    little trace has been left of Roman occupation, and such remains as have been
                    discovered are mainly of the portable description that affords little proof of
                    actual settlement. According to tradition St Marcou or Marculfus visited the
                    islands as a Christian missionary in 540, and in 568 he was followed by St
                    Magloire (a friend and fellow-evangelist of St Samson of Doi), who founded
                    monasteries at Sark and at Jersey. In 933 the islands were made over by Rodolph
                    of Brittany to William of Normandy, the son of Rollo; and after the Norman
                    conquest of England, their allegiance shifted between the English crown and the
                    N orman coronet according· to the vicissitudes of war and policy. During the
                    purely Norman period, they had been enriched with numerous ecclesiastical
                    buildings, some of which are still extant, in a more or less perfect condition.
                    In the reign of John of England, the future of the islands was decided by their
                    attachment to the English crown, in spite of the separation of the duchy of
                    Normandy. To John it has been usual to ascribe a document, at one time regarded
                    by the islanders as their Magna Charta; but modern criticism leaves little doubt
                    that it is not genuine. An unauthenticated “copy” of uncertain origin alone has
                    been discovered, and there is little proof of there ever having been ∙an
                    original; while it is plain that the islands were in possession of several of
                    the privileges which it professes to accord previous to the supposed date. The
                    reign of Edward I. was full of disturbance and trouble; and in 1279 Jersey and
                    Guernsey received from the king, by letters patent, a public seal as a remedy
                    for the dangers and losses which they had incurred by lack of such a
                    certificate. Edward II. found it necessary to instruct his collectors not to
                    treat the islanders a? foreigners; his successor, Edward III., fully confirmed
                    their privileges, immunities, and customs in 1341; and his charter was
                    recognized by Richard II. in 1378. In 1343 there was a descent of the French in
                    Guernsey; the governor was beaten, and Castle Cornet besieged. In 1380 Pius IV.
                    issued a bull of anathema against all who molested the islands; it was formally
                    registered in Brittany in 1384, and in France in 1386; and in this way they <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n404/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0404-0393"/> acquired the right of neutrality, which they
                    retained till 1689. Henry V. confiscated the alien priories which had kept up
                    the same connection with Normandy as before the Conquest, and conferred them
                    along with the regalities of the islands on the duke of Bedford. During the Wars
                    of the Roses, Queen Margaret, the consort of Henry VI. made an agreement with
                    Maulevrier, the seneschal of Normandy, that if he afforded assistance to the
                    king he should hold the islands independently of the Crown. A force was
                    accordingly sent to take possession of Jersey Castle. Orgueil was captured and a
                    small part of the island subjugated, but the rest held out under Philip de
                    Carteret, and in 1467 the vice-admiral of England, Sir Richard Horbiston,
                    recaptured the castle and brought the foreign occupation to an end. By a charter
                    of 1494, the duties of the governors of Jersey were defined and their power
                    restricted; and the educational interests of the island were furthered in the
                    same reign, by the foundation of two grammar schools by John Neal. The
                    Reformation was heartily welcomed in the islands; and under the influence of
                    French pastors, the form of worship adopted was the Presbyterian. The greatest
                    severity was exercised in the maintenance of the new ecclesiastical discipline.
                    In 1554 one Richard Girard was flogged through the town of St Helier’s for
                    defending the doctrine of the mass; in 1576 several persons were thrown into
                    prison by the royal court for not having taken the communion, and they were not
                    to be liberated till they could repeat the commandments and the Lord’s prayer;
                    and in 1592 it was enacted that all persons should attend divine service morning
                    and evening under the penalty of a fine.</p>
                <p>The Presbyterian form of church government was formally sanctioned in Jersey and
                    Guernsey by Queen Elizabeth; and in 1603 King James enacted that “they should
                    quietly enjoy their said liberty.” During the governorship of Sir John Poyton,
                    however, disputes arose between him and the Presbyterian “colloquy” or synod
                    about nomination to benefices, and both parties appealed to the king. A
                    commission was appointed in 1609, but peace was not established. An Episcopal
                    party had been formed in Jersey, and in 1619 David Bandinal was declared Dean of
                    the island. A body of canons which he drew up agreeable to the discipline of the
                    Church of England was accepted after considerable modification by the people of
                    his charge; but the inhabitants of Guernsey maintained their Presbyterian
                    practices. Of the hold which this form of Protestantism had got on the minds of
                    the people even in Jersey abundant proof is afforded by the general character of
                    the worship at the present day. Having taken different courses in religion the
                    two islands naturally attached themselves to different sides in the great
                    struggle between king and parliament Jersey was for Charles and Guernsey for the
                    Commons. The former island maintained its loyalty till 1651, when the royal
                    cause became hopeless, and even Sir George Carteret, who had been its principal
                    support, was obliged to surrender. Both islands had suffered severely from the
                    struggle, and the people of Guernsey complained that two-thirds of the land was
                    out of cultivation, and that they had lost “their ships, their traffic, and
                    their trading.” After the Restoration there was considerable improvement, and in
                    the reign of James the islanders got a grant of wool for the manufacture of
                    stockings—4000 tods of wool being annually allowed to Jersey, and 2000 to
                    Alderney. By William of Orange the neutrality was abolished in 1689, and during
                    the first American War there were two unsuccessful attacks on Jersey. In 1767 an
                    attempt was made to introduce the English custom-house system; but it proved
                    practically a failure, and the islands throve on smuggling and privateering down
                    to 1800. Since then their history has been one of quiet progress, with no more
                    serious disturbance that can arise from local rivalries.</p>
