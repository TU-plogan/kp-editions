                    Pepper, Chilly</hi></label>, a preparation from the dried fruit of various
                    species of Capsicum, a genus of the Natural Order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Solanaceoe,</hi> to which belong also the potato, tomato, and bittersweet. The
                    true peppers are members of a totally distinct order, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Piperaceoe.</hi> The fruits of plants of the genus Capsicum have all a strong
                    pungent flavour. The capsicums bear a greenish-white or violaceous flower, with
                    a wheel-shaped corolla, five anthers (connivent and dehiscing lengthwise), and
                    an obtuse stigma. The ovary becomes a pod, consisting of an envelope at first
                    fleshy and afterwards leathery, within which are the spongy pulp and several
                    seeds. The leaves are entire, and alternate, or in pairs near one another; the
                    peduncles are extra-axillary. There are many kinds of capsicums, ranked by
                    botanists either as distinct species or as varieties. Don, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">General System of Gardening and Botany,</hi> gives a list of
                    thirty-three species. They are chiefly natives of Brazil, the West and East
                    Indies, and China. They are now grown in various parts of the world, both for
                    the sake of the fruit and for ornament. In England the annual sorts are sown
                    from March to the middle of April, under a frame. They can be planted out when 2
                    or 3 inches high, and in June may be transferred to a light rich soil in the
                    open garden. They flower in July or August, and produce pods from August till
                    the end of September. The perennial and shrubby kinds may be wintered in a
                    conservatory. Several species or varieties are used to make Cayenne pepper. The
                    annual or common capsicum <hi rend="italic">(C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >annuum),</hi> the Guinea Pepper plant, was brought to Europe by the Spaniards,
                    and was grown in England in 1548. It is indigenous to South America, but is now
                    cultivated in India, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and Turkey, with the other species
                    of capsicum. It is a hardy herbaceous plant, which attains a height of 2 or 3
                    feet, and bears a pod usually of an ovate shape, and yellow, red, or black in
                    colour. The Spur or Goat Pepper <hi rend="italic">(C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >frutescens)</hi> has been an inmate of English gardens since 1656. It is a
                    dwarf shrub, a native of the East Indies, which produces a small pod, having
                    very pungent properties. <hi rend="italic">C. tetragonurn,</hi> or Bonnet
                    Pepper, is a species much esteemed in Jamaica; it bears very fleshy fruits.
                    Other well-known kinds of capsicum are the Cherry Pepper (C. <hi rend="italic"
                    >cerasiforme)</hi>; Bell Pepper <hi rend="italic">(C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >grossum),</hi> which has thick and pulpy fruit, well adapted for pickling; and
                    Berry or Bird Pepper (C <hi rend="superscript"> γ</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                    >baccatum).</hi> The last mentioned has been grown in England since 1731; its
                    fruit is globular, and about the size of a cherry. The West Indian stomachic <hi
                    rend="italic">Man-dram</hi> is prepared by mashing a few pods of bird pepper and
                    mixing them with sliced cucumber and shallots, to which have been added a little
                    lime-juice and Madeira wine. Chillies, the dried ripe or unripe fruit of
                    capsicums, are used to make chilly-vinegar, as well as for pickles. Cayenne
                    pepper is manufactured from the ripe fruits, which are dried, ground, mixed with
                    wheat flour, and made into cakes with yeast; the cakes are baked till hard like
                    biscuit, and then ground and sifted. The pepper is sometimes prepared by simply
                    drying the pods and pounding them fine in a mortar. Cayenne pepper is
                    occasionally adulterated with red lead, vermilion, ochre, salt, ground-rice, and
                    turmeric. The taste of the pepper is impaired by exposure to damp and the heat
                    of the sun. Chillies have been in use from time immemorial; they are eaten in
                    great quantity by the people of Guiana and other warm countries, and in Europe
                    are largely consumed both as a spice and as medicine. Their hot and biting taste
                    is due to the presence of the alkaloid <hi rend="italic">Capsicine,</hi> a
                    reddish body, having a balsamic and extremely acrid and irritating odour. The
                    Cayenne pepper plants, with the rest of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n292/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0292-0281"/> Solanaceae, have not the narcotic properties of
                    the genera of the most nearly allied order Atropaceae, unless, as has been
                    affirmed, these are resident in the pulp of certain species of capsicums.
                    Medicinally, Cayenne pepper is used with cinchona in lethargic affections, also
                    in atonic gout accompanied by flatulence, and in tympanites and paralysis. It is
                    employed as a stimulant in those forms of dyspepsia which are due to faulty
                    chymification and defective secretion of gastric juice. In malignant scarlatina
                    it is used either in the form of a tincture or as a gargle. To make the
                    tincture, a pint of vinegar is boiled with two tablespoonfuls of powdered
                    chillies and a teaspoonful of salt, and then strained. Cayenne pepper taken in
                    large quantities acts as an irritant poison. A dose of powdered capsicum is from
                    1 to 5 grs., and of the tincture from 5 to 15 drops.</p>
