                    out for Rome, where he intended to prosecute his studies. Being utterly
                    destitute of funds he joined a troop of Bohemians, and arrived in their company
                    at Florence. In this city he had the good fortune to attract the notice of a
                    gentleman of the court, who supplied him with the means of study; but he
                    removedin a short time to Rome, where, however, he was recognized by some
                    relatives, who immediately compelled him to return home. Two years after this,
                    and when only fourteen years old, he again left France contrary to the wishes of
                    his friends, and reached Turin before he was overtaken by his elder brother, who
                    had been despatched in quest of him. As his enthusiasm for art remained
                    undiminished after these disappointments, he was at last allowed to accompany
                    the duke of Lorraine’s envoy to the Papal court. His first care was to study the
                    art of design, of which in a short time he became a perfect master. Philip
                    Thomasin instructed him in the use of the graver, which, however, he ultimately
                    abandoned, substituting the point as better adapted for his purposes. From Rome
                    he went to Florence, where he remained till the death ol Cosmo IL, the Maecenas
                    of these times. On returning to his native country he was warmly received by the
                    then duke of Lorraine, who admired and encouraged him. As his fame was now
                    spread abroad in various countries of Europe, many distinguished persons gave
                    him commissions to execute. By the Infanta Isabella, sovereign of the Low
                    Countries, he was commissioned to engrave a design of the siege of Breda; and at
                    the request of Louis XIII. he designed the siege of Rochelle, and the attack on
                    the Isle of Ré. When, however, in 1631, he was desired by that monarch to
                    execute an engraving of the siege of Nancy, which he had just taken, Callot
                    refused, saying, “I wouhl rather cut off my thumb than do anything against the
                    honour of my prince and of my country;” to which Louis replied—that the duke of
                    Lorraine was happy in possessing such subjects as Callot. Shortly after this he
                    returned to his native place, from which the king failed to allure him with the
                    offer of a handsome pension. He died in 1635 at the age of forty-two. He
                    engraved in all about 1600 pieces, <pb break="no"

                    aquafortis. No one ever possessed in a higher degree the talent for grouping a
                    large number of figures in a small space, and of representing with two or three
                    bold strokes the expression, action, and peculiar features of each individual.
                    Freedom, variety, and <hi rend="italic">naivete</hi> characterize all his
                    pieces. His Fairs, his Miseries of War, his Sieges, his Temptation of St
                    Anthony, and his Conversion of St Paul will be sought after and admired as long
                    as there are artists to learn and a public to appreciate.</p>
