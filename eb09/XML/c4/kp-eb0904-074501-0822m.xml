                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Camoes),</hi>.Luiz <hi rend="smallcaps">de</hi>
                    (1524-1579), the son of Simão Vaz de Camoens and Ana de Sá e Miranda, was
                    descended in the female line from the Gamas of Algarve, with which family Vasco
                    de Gama claimed kinship; on the male side also the Camoens were of gentle birth
                    and high social position. Lisbon, Coimbra, Alemquer, and Santarem have claimed
                    to be the cradle of this “prince of poets of his time;” the balance of evidence,
                    however, is now generally considered to be in favour of Lisbon. Manoel Correia,
                    who was on terms of intimacy with the poet, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentâmes</hi><hi rend="italic">on the Lusiad,</hi> states: “The author of
                    this book is Luiz de Camoens, Portuguese by nationality, born and bred in the
                    city of Lisbon, of noble and accredited parentage.” Correia states in his notes
                    to canto 10 of the <hi rend="italic">Lusiad,</hi> that Camoens was more than
                    forty years of age when he wrote it; and, further on, that the canto was written
                    in 1570 The evidence of Faria e Sousa, extracted in 1643 from the registers of
                    the “India House at Lisbon,” proves Camoens to have been twenty-five years of
                    age in 1550; and 1524 is now generally accepted as approximately the year of his
                    birth.</p>

                <p>Alarmed by the shock of an earthquake as early as 1526, the court removed to
                    Coimbra, where it remained until the pestilence, which devastated Lisbon and the
                    border lauds of the Tagus, had moderated; the nobles and “fidalguia” followed
                    the king and court. Simão Vaz de Camoens having house and possessions at
                    Coimbra, would naturally follow the court there with his family; the more so as
                    his brother Bento had, prior to 1527, taken “the habit in the monastery of Santa
                    Cruz,” where he was often visited by the king. Evidently a man of culture, he
                    was chosen, on the reformation of the university in 1529, “being then prior of
                    his order,” the first chancellor. The popularity of the training at the
                    newly-reformed university drew within its walls most of the sons of the nobility
                    and “fidalguia.” Here Camoens was entered as one of “the honourable poor
                    students” in 1537, remaining there until he had completed his eighteenth year.
                    Of his manner of life during the period which intervened between his removal to
                    Coimbra and the commencement of his university career, something may be gathered
                    from his minor writings, from which it appears that he wandered by Mondego’s
                    banks, “careless and unfettered in the free licence of boyhood.”</p>
                <p>The position of the poet’s uncle, Dorn Bento de Camoens, as prior of Santa Cruz,
                    in addition to his status as chancellor of the university, naturally suggested
                    the church as a career for Camoens. This seems to have found no favour with him,
                    as he writes, “I felt the pulse of many states of life. The clergy, I see, take
                    stronger hold of life than of the salvation of souls; and the monks, although
                    shrouded in hood and habit, expose some small tokens inconsistent with the
                    profession that he who turns his back upon the world for God should desire
                    nothing that the world can give.” Freely and injudiciously expressed at an
                    inopportune moment in the ardour of youth, such home truths would tend to mar
                    his advancement in church or state; while his honesty, culture, wit, poetic
                    genius, and comely appearance would induce much jealous enmity at a court where
                    he was the idol of the women.</p>
                <p>During his studentship, and possibly at a vacation revel, or when some degree was
                    conferred, the students acted his <hi rend="italic">Amplιitrides</hi> in
                    imitation of Plautus. The dramatic representations at the university had usually
                    been of the tragedies of Seneca, or of original Latin compositions. This work of
                    Camoens, in popular “redondilhos,” and in the vernacular, was considered an
                    attempt to popularize a poetic reaction which satirized the mode in which the
                    grave doctors of the university desired that all instruction should be imparted.
                    In a satire of Resende’s, “to Luiz Camoens, reprehending those who, despising
                    the learned, waste their own time with jesters,” he indicates Camoens “as a
                    pitiful poet, an unlucky monster, boasting to be a Latin bachelor.”</p>
                <p>With reference to the precise period when Camoens removed entirely from his <hi
                    rend="italic">alma mater</hi> and became again resident in Lisbon, some
                    speculations have been hazarded by his biographers. The one carrying the most
                    weight is cited by the Visconde de Juromenha, who founds it upon the statement
                    made by the poet in his first letter from India: “Because, when I reflect that
                    without sin, which would sentence me to thirteen days of purgatory, I have
                    passed thirteen thousand caused by evil tongues.” Upon this Juromenha observes:
                    “These thirteen thousand days are equal to eight years and eight days, and
                    deducting the two years Camoens passed in Ceuta, and the one year of banishment
                    on the upper Tagus, this leaves 1542 as the year of his departure from Coimbra.”
                    Thus we find Camoens quitting college to return to the court at Lisbon in his
                    eighteenth year. A French biographer has assumed, with some force, that “Corte”
                    simply means Lisbon, and not the court; for as Camoens was not of the titular
                    nobility, he would not be received at court. Contemporary evidence, on the other
                    hand, rather favours the assumption that being of the “fidalguia,” gentle born,
                    and well cultured, he would be chosen as companion by many of the young nobles
                    who were his fellow-students at Coimbra.</p>
                <p>Gentleness of birth, classical attainments of no mean order, a cultivated
                    intellect, and poetic genius, united to a pleasing personal appearance and witty
                    manner, must have been good passports to the court of John III., in which
                    resided at that time the Infante Dorn Luiz, a man of considerable attainments
                    and a fair poet; also the Infanta Donna Maria, patroness of the Belles Lettres,
                    surrounded by a bevy of fair damsels who could compose song, dirge, epigram, and
                    roundelay, or jest with the quick wit of a Beatrice, and who, like her, knew
                    many “merry tales” by heart. Statesmen, such as the Conde de Sortelha and the
                    Conde de Vimioso, courtly poets, and fellow-students of Camoens at Coimbra, both
                    in the full blaze of court favour, would gladly welcome to Lisbon so polished a
                    youth as Camoens must at that time have been. Of this same court of John III.
                    Gil Vicente writes, “It is a sea in which many fished, but found the pastime
                    dangerous.” Sá de Miranda also blamed “the economic error of herding together
                    all the young nobility in Lisbon.”</p>
                <p>Here, no doubt, Camoens formed acquaintanceships if not friendships, and became
                    quickly initiated into the mysteries of court life and manners. Precocious and
                    born a poet, his facility in every style of versification, a mind stored with
                    romances of chivalry as well as popular fiction, and the poetic lore then
                    available in his own, the Spanish, Italian, and classical idioms, would, added
                    to his youth and sprightly manner, render him popular with the gentler, and
                    unpopular with the sterner sex. Abandoning in some degree the antiquated forms
                    of composition in vogue, he introduced eclogues, songs, and sonnets, full of
                    tenderness and beauty, after the manner of the Italian school. Montemayor and Sá
                    de Miranda, both Portuguese, residing in Italy, had already adopted and
                    naturalized to some extent the Italian form of pastoral poetry.</p>
                <p>Here we must speak of Camoens’s romantic passion for a certain high-born lady of
                    the court. “The sweet unwitting cause” of so much detriment to his court
                    advancement, and, if we are to credit his muse, of anguish to his heart, was a
                    certain Donna Caterina de Ataide in attendance upon the queen of John IIL The
                    anagram of Natercia for Caterina clearly indicates the lady’s name, in addition
                    to which an acrostic coupling the names of Luiz with Caterina de Ataide, said to
                    be by Camoens, puts the matter beyond all doubt. The tradition is that, on a
                    certain Good Friday, Camoens for the first time encountered the lady’s eyes at
                    her devotions in the Church of the Chagas, Lisbon. That the wound proved deep
                    and permanent there is abundant evidence in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rimas.</hi></p>
                <p>The lady’s father, Dorn Antonio de Lima, held the office of chamberlain in the
                    royal household, a certain Pero de Andrade de Caminha serving in a similar
                    capacity the Infante Dorn Duarte. Caminha was a poet of fair ability, and was
                    probably jealous of the success of Camoens; in addition to which tradition
                    asserts that Caminha himself, favoured by her father, aspired to the hand, if
                    not the heart, of the Donna Caterina. We may infer that the lady was not
                    ignorant of the effect her eyes wrought upon the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lusιαd</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> at any rate Caminha was jealous, and
                    revenged himself in weak splenetic rather than satirical verse, while the lady’s
                    father employed his interest to mar the poet’s prospects.</p>
                <p>The precise cause which led to Camoens’s banishment from Lisbon is not clear. The
                    principal reason, no doubt, was his passion for the golden-tressed Caterina, but
                    there <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n824/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0824-0747"/> may have been in addition to this some
                    unintentional contempt of the rigid court etiquette which hedged the royalty of
                    that day; for it was the custom that lyric offerings intended for the ladies of
                    the queen’s court should first be submitted to the chamberlain, and then by him
                    transferred to the chief lady in waiting, who handed the effusion to the
                    queen,—she, in her turn, after perusal, passing the “burning lines of passion”
                    into the hands of the damsel to whom they were addressed. Camoens, doubtless,
                    would essay some safer and more secret mode of conveying his offerings to the
                    lovely Caterina. The dislike of De Lima, and the jealousy of Camιnha, aided by
                    the indiscretion and free-lance life of Camoens, may have led to this mark of
                    the royal severity. Whether such or other causes intervened, the fact remains
                    that he was banished from the court. The precise locality to which he retired,
                    however, still remains conjectural only. Adding the year of his banishment to
                    the two years he was absent with the army of Africa at Ceuta, where, in a naval
                    engagement with the Moors, a chance splinter destroyed the sight of his right
                    eye, we find him again in Lisbon in 1550.</p>
                <p>During the three years which intervened between Camoens’s return from Ceuta and
                    his embarkation for India in 1553, he seems to have led a careless and
                    discreditable kind of life, consorting with the least reputable court gallants,
                    and a certain dissolute ex-Franciscan friar, who had abandoned the cowl to adopt
                    the <hi rend="italic">role</hi> of a low comedian. Since he inherited the
                    traditions of “fidalguia,”—candid, brave, impetuous, and crossed in love,—much
                    of the free and careless life credited by tradition at this period to Camoens is
                    reasonably accounted for, if it may not be condoned. At this period occurred the
                    fracas which led to his imprisonment and subsequent embarkation for India. On
                    the occasion of a grand procession at the festival of Corpus Christi, one of the
                    king’s equerries appears to have had a dispute with two masquerading companions
                    of Camoens. The latter, unhappily intervening to defend one of these friends
                    hardly pressed, wounded the equerry in the neck, his two friends escaping in the
                    confusion. For this Camoens lay some time in prison, and was only pardoned upon
                    the understanding that he should embark forthwith for India. Juromenha gives the
                    full text of this pardon.</p>
                <p>With reference to the poet’s departure for India in March 1553, the indefatigable
                    Faria e Sousa discovered the following entry on the books of the registry of the
                    Lisbon India House:—“Fernando Casado, inhabitant of Lisbon, went in his stead
                    Luiz de Camoens, son of Simon and Ana de Sá.” His father did ∆ot offer himself
                    as the customary surety, while it is seen from a document, dated the 7th of
                    March that year, that he was still alive, and an inhabitant of Lisbon.</p>
                <p>Camoens, in his first letter from India, alludes to his departure from his native
                    city; and as he sailed out of the “golden-sanded Tagus” in the twilight,
                    exclaimed in the bitterness of his heart, using the words of Scipio
                    Africanus,—“Ungrateful country, thou shalt not possess my bones !”</p>
                <p>The ship in which he sailed, the “San Bento,” parted company with her consorts
                    during a storm,' and reached her destination in the same year, while her missing
                    consorts did not anchor at Goa until the following spring. On landing at Goa,
                    Camoens found the Viceroy Noronha preparing an expedition to act against the
                    king of Pimenta, who had invaded the territories of the allies of Portugal. With
                    this expedition sailed Camoens; and “after chastising the enemy,” he says, “with
                    little trouble, we destroyed the people trained to the use of the curved bow,
                    punishing them with death and fire.” He returned to Goa early in the following
                    year, 1554.</p>
                <p>The friendly terms upon which Camoens remained with the governor, and probably
                    his disgust at the vice and venality rampant around him, induced him to join the
                    expedition organized with a view to check the depredations of the Moorish rovers
                    on the coast of Arabia. The commander, Menezes, received instructions to cruise
                    on that coast where he expected to intercept the galleys sailing from Bassorah.
                    The fleet cleared from Goa early in the year 1555; and, after seeking the
                    Moorish galleys in vain, wintered at Ormuz. Returning in the following spring to
                    Goa, Camoens, in canção 10, describes his unpleasant impressions of this voyage:
                    “Here fate’s most cruel chances led me; here in this lonely, sterile,
                    sun-scorched land did Fortune will that part of my brief life be passed, and
                    thus in fragments scattered lie throughout the world.” Some of Camoens’s
                    biographers allude to the governor Barreto as one of his relentless persecutors.
                    Juromenha, however, demurs to this, alleging that two intimate friends of
                    Camoens then at Goa, in the most frank and decided language, laud Barreto as “a
                    liberal obliging comrade, and one ever ready to overlook offences received.”
                    That Camoens was unpopular with the venal many, his expression “This land is the
                    mother of great villains and the stepmother of honourable men” leaves little
                    doubt. He came to uphold the honour of Portugal, and not to intrigue, brawl, and
                    barter his soul for gold. His satirical exposure of the abuses so rife then in
                    the Eastern dominions of Portugal will readily account for his numerous enemies,
                    official and lay. Festivals, banquets, and dramatic representations inaugurated
                    the governorship of Barreto. Camoens’s pen was not idle. He wrote a comedy for
                    the occasion, entitled <hi rend="italic">Filodemo.</hi> Correia, who describes
                    himself as “companion in the state of India, and a great friend of Camoens,”
                    happily secured either the original MS. or a copy, which is, or was, in the
                    national library at Lisbon. It is entitled, <hi rend="italic">Ä Comedy made by
                    Luis de Camoens, and represented in India during the governorship of Barreto,
                    and in which the following characters figure, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>Camoens’s unpropitious star still dominated his fate. The vices rampant in
                    Goa&gt; the drunkenness, dicing, brawling, and cowardice, were notorious; and
                    during these festivities, which lasted some weeks, were more pronounced than
                    ever.</p>
                <p>A certain satire, said to be from the pen of Camoens, passed from hand to hand,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">A Jest which was made upon some men who did not think
                    ill of wine, feigning that in Goa, at the feasts which were made on the
                    governor’s succession, these gallants went to sport with canes bearing devices
                    on their banners, and verses conforming to their designs and inclinations.</hi>
                    It is written chiefly in prose, having verses introduced. No names of the
                    “gallants” appear. After introducing a few of these revellers, the author
                    concludes by stating “that several other illustrious personages desired to be
                    admitted to the feasts'and sports, and to have an account of their
                    qualifications chronicled;” but, he observes, “the writing would be infinite,
                    because all the men in India are so distinguished, and therefore let these
                    suffice as examples.” This jest, intended to satirize the corruption and
                    immorality of the daily life of the Portuguese in India, caused intense
                    amusement to those who did not recognize their own portraits on the canvas;
                    while, on the other hand, those who did, or imagined they did, were furious,—so
                    much so, that “the innocent author remained ready to hang himself.”</p>
                <p>The tradition is that this <hi rend="italic">Jest</hi> was appended to Camoens’s
                    second letter from India, and that the author desired its source should remain
                    unknown; “because I do not wish that of my little so many should eat.” Be that
                    as it may, Camoens was banished from Goa, and this <hi rend="italic">Jest</hi>

                    is surmised that Barreto was of the number, but it is difficult to imagine that
                    if Barreto intended punishment he should have made of this banishment a
                    stepping-stone to a lucrative appointment, which must have been one of
                    considerable importance, embracing as it did the custody of the property of
                    absentees, and of those Portuguese who had died in India. In a letter from
                    Francisco de Souza to John III. the importance of this office is recognized,
                    grave complaints of embezzlement and misappropriation of the property of
                    deceased merchants and others having reached Lisbon, so that, “early in 1556, a
                    commission was despatched from the mother country to take charge of the effects
                    of deceased subjects,” and, in 1557, “full instructions as to the management of
                    this state department followed.” Barreto, with a laudable desire to abate these
                    scandals, may well have appointed a bold energetic man, upon whose integrity he
                    could rely, and Camoens was selected.</p>
                <p>During the absence of Camoens from Goa his friend Luiz Franco Correia collected
                    the verses he had scattered amongst his friends, shrewdly observing, “that they
                    who knew not the poetic art failed to estimate its value.”</p>
                <p>Apart from the vices and intrigues of Goa, and in the quietude of the Grotto
                    still shown at Macao as the spot where much of the <hi rend="italic">Lusiad</hi>
                    was penned, we may imagine halcyon days for the persecuted poet. Here Antonio,
                    the Javanese slave, is first introduced to history,—he who tended Camoens so
                    affectionately and with such solicitude through those latter years of misery and
                    neglect, which were the lot of this unhappy “prince of poets of his time.” It is
                    surmised that the first six cantos of the <hi rend="italic">Lusiad</hi> were
                    composed during Camoens’s stay at Macao; for in the seventh, allusion is made to
                    the shipwreck he suffered on his return to Goa.</p>
                <p>During his absence slanderous tongues were not silent, and we hear of his return
                    to Goa by order of the governor, to make answer to charges brought against him
                    in his capacity as commissary. Wrecked near the mouth of the River Mekong,
                    Camoens and his faithful Javanese escaped only with their lives. Camoens,
                    rescuing nothing but the manuscript of his epic, at length landed at Goa in the
                    last days of Barreto’s governorship, and was cast into prison. Here he received
                    the only news which could aggravate his pain—the sad tidings of the death of
                    Donna Caterina de Ataide, the Natercia of his impassioned youth. We can estimate
                    the depth and tenderness of his grief touchingly expressed in many of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rimas.</hi></p>
                <p>The arrival in the autumn of the following year of Dorn Constantinho de Bragança
                    as governor to replace Barreto led to the liberation of Camoens, the charges
                    against him having been proved to be unfounded. Under the protection of Dorn
                    Constantinho the poet enjoyed some respite from his persecutors. It was during
                    this period of “cultured calm” that he invited several “versifying friends” to a
                    banquet, where each, on uncovering his plate, discovered, in place of the first
                    course, an appropriate stanza. The surprise gave occasion to considerable mirth
                    and amusement. Three years later Dom Constantinho was replaced by the Conde de
                    Redondo, an early friend and companion of the poet’s. Towards the close of 1562
                    Camoens suffered a new reverse. Miguel Rodriguez Coutinho, a rich braggart,
                    nick-named Fios Seccos (dry threads), detained him in custody for a trifling
                    debt. On this occasion Camoens sent a request to the Conde to release him, in
                    epigrammatic verse, which well revenges Coutinho’s meanness, commencing—“What
                    devil so completely damned but fears the edge of Fios Seccos’ sword.” Camoens
                    was released, but does not appear to have accompanied the viceroy and his
                    splendid retinue to Zamorin, Being desirous to return to his native land, a
                    certain Captain Barreto, nephew of the old governor of Goa, charmed with the
                    society of the poet, agreed to carry him to Sofala; once there he hoped to
                    detain him, and claimed a small sum he was unable to discharge. Here the
                    expedition under Noronha, exgovernor of Goa, found him; and of Camoens’s
                    condition Diogo de Couto wrote: “Here we encountered that ‘ prince of poets of
                    his time,’ my fellow-sailor and friend, Luiz de Camoens, so poor that he lived
                    upon his acquaintance, who found him necessary clothing and gladly gave him to
                    eat. During that winter he prepared his <hi rend="italic">Lnsiad</hi> for the
                    press, and wrote much in a book he called the <hi rend="italic">Parnaso</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of Luiz de Camo ens.”</hi></p>
                <p>The fleet, including the “Santa Clara,” with Camoens on board, sailed from Sofala
                    in November 1569, and on the 7th April 1570 the good ship cast anchor in the
                    broad waters of the “golden-sanded Tagus.”</p>
                <p>After seventeen years of weary exile we may imagine the thrill of joy that warmed
                    the heart of Camoens at the first sight of the headland which bares its base to
                    the wash of the Atlantic, and marks the entrance to the Tagus. “From the
                    round-top of the loftiest mast a sailor shouts, ‘ The land, the land! ’ This is
                    my native land so fondly loved, which heaven grant, all perils past, my task
                    accomplished, these eyes behold once more before their light be dimmed for
                    ever.” While others from the far Indies brought rich merchandize and gold, he
                    who had suffered banishments and imprisonments, had encountered tempests and
                    shipwreck, came freighted only with a single manuscript, on the pages of which
                    were traced in immortal verse the glorious historic deeds of the Portuguese
                    nation, and the touching episode of Ignez de Castro. Here Fortune still
                    continued to persecute Camoens. He and his companions were not permitted to
                    land, Lisbon having recently suffered from the effects of a pestilence which had
                    destroyed 50,000 souls.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Late in the month of April, the great plague having abated, a procession of our
                    Lady of Health was decreed; and it is supposed that Camoens had already landed
                    and embraced his mother, then “very old and very poor.” The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lusiad,</hi> being now completed and .ready for the press, after much delay and
                    many impediments, was, through the influence of Dorn Manoel, ambassador to
                    Castile, presented in manuscript to the young king in the following year, 1571;
                    the royal permission to print the work was accorded, the Alvará bearing date the
                    23d September of that year. Later the “censura” of the holy office was obtained,
                    bearing date 12th March 1572. It carries the signature of Father Ferreira, a man
                    of singular ability and evidently liberal views, and is as follows :—“I saw, by
                    order of the Holy Inquisition, these ten cantos of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lusiad</hi> of Luiz de Camoens, relating the valorous deeds in arms of the
                    Portuguese in Asia and Europe, and I did not find in them a single offensive
                    thing, nor aught contrary to the faith and good manners; only it seemed to me
                    necessary to warn the reader that the author, in order to exaggerate the perils
                    of the navigation and entrance into India of the Portuguese, makes use of a
                    fiction of the heathen gods; and although San Agostinho in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Retractaζoes</hi> corrects the having called the muses goddesses, nevertheless,
                    as this is poetry and fiction, and the author does not pretend more than to
                    adorn his poetic style, I have not considered it inconvenient this fable of the
                    gods in this work, knowing it for such, and while is always preserved the truth
                    of our Holy Faith, that all the gods of the heathen are devils, and therefore it
                    appeared to me that the book is worthy of being printed, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0826-0749"/> aud the author displays in it much talent and
                    erudition in the human sciences.” The Lisbon upon which Camoens turned his back
                    in 1553 had sadly changed; the times were out of joint. A dreadful pestilence
                    had decimated the population; the intrigues inseparable from a regency, aud a
                    young king, the sport of youthful favourites, ruled by the Jesuits, brave and
                    impetuous, already meditating the luckless expedition to Africa, overshadowed
                    both court and kingdom. Remarking this, in his address to the young king Camoens
                    wrote,—“The humility of the anchorite should not be the only virtue of your
                    ministers.”</p>
                <p>At length the epic, dreamed of at Coimbra, commenced in banishment, continued at
                    Ceuta, resumed at Goa and Macao, revised at Mozambique and Sofala, and perfected
                    in a humble room in the Rua de Santa Ana, Lisbon, was issued from the press of
                    Antonio Goçalvez.</p>
                <p>The first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Lusiad</hi> bears date Lisbon, 1572.
                    Its success was immense, and the despair and malice of the mediocre poets of the
                    court intense. A second edition was issued from the press of Goçalvez in the
                    same year.</p>
                <p>Isolated amid this literary strife, Camoens lived retired, and was very poor. He
                    lived in the knowledge of many, and in the companionship of few, inhabiting an
                    apartment in a house adjoining the convent Santa Ana, at the bottom of a small
                    street which led to the college of the Jesuits, where the sole consolation of
                    his later years was his intimacy with some of the fathers. By the death of the
                    Princess Donna Maria, who expired in 1578, Camoens lost the last of his
                    protectors, and was reduced to extreme poverty; then came the heaviest blow of
                    all, the death of his faithful Javanese Antonio.</p>
                <p>Early in the year 1578, after the grand ceremony of the Benediction of the
                    Standards, Dorn Sebastião, the boy king, departed on his ill-starred expedition
                    to Africa,— Beruardes, a court poet and a courtier, being selected in preference
                    to Camoens to accompany the expedition and sing its triumphs. In August occurred
                    the fatal rout of Alcazar-quivir, and the death of the young king, after which,
                    according to the testimony of Bernardo Rodriguez, “Camoens went as one
                    dreaming.”</p>
                <p>Three months prior to the poet’s death, Benito Caldera’s Castilian version of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lusiad</hi> was printed at Alcalá de Henares, and we may
                    reasonably infer that Camoens saw a copy.”</p>
                <p>The disaster of Alcazar-quivir shook Portuguese nationality to its base. In the
                    last letter Camoens penned he alludes to this event. “I have so loved my country
                    that not only do I deem myself happy to die in her bosom but happy to die with
                    her.</p>
                <p>The sad sickness unto death came at last, on the 1Oth of June, 1580. In a small,
                    cheerless room of a shabby house in the Rua de Santa Ana (No. 52 or 54) Luiz de
                    Çamoens died, and he was buried in the neighbouring convent of Santa Ana. On the
                    fly-leaf of a copy of the first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Lusiad</hi>
                    (said to be in the library of Holland House), and in the handwriting of Fray
                    José Indio, a Carmelite monk of Guadalajara, is found the following statement
                    :—</p>
                <p>“What thing more grievous than to see so great genius lacking success! I saw him
                    die in a hospital in Lisbon, without a sheet to cover him, after having
                    triumphed in the Indies, an'd having sailed five thousand five hundred leagues
                    by sea. What warning so great for those, who, by night and day, weary themselves
                    in study without profit, like the spider weaving a web to catch small
                    flies.”</p>
                <p>Some picturesque and touching, but probably apocryphal narratives are chronicled
                    by Camoens’s biographers. One tells of the faithful Javanese Antonio sallying
                    forth at eventide to beg from passers-by the means to procure a modest meal for
                    himself and his master; another, of Barbara, a mulatto woman, who, from the
                    scanty store upon her stall and the still scantier treasury of her pocket,
                    spared a daily ration and an occasional silver coin iu pity for one she might
                    have known prosperous at Macao; and a third of a “fidalgo,” named Ruy Diaz de
                    Camara, who came to his poor dwelling to complain of the non-fulfilment of a
                    promise of a translation of the penitential psalms, and to whom Camoens
                    replied—“When I wrote verses I was young, had ample food, was a lover, and
                    beloved by many friends and by the ladies; therefore, I felt poetic ardour. Now
                    I have no spirit, no peace of mind; behold there my Javanese who asks me for two
                    coins to purchase fuel, aud I have none to give him.” On his deathbed he is said
                    to have exclaimed, “Who ever heard that on so small a stage as a poor bed,
                    Fortune should care to represent so great misfortune, and I, as if such were not
                    sufficient, place myself on her side, because to dare to resist such ills would
                    appear effrontery.”</p>
                <p>Camoens was spared the pain and humiliation of seeing a Castilian king upon the
                    throne of Portugal. It is, however, related of Philip II. that, soon after his
                    occupation of Lisbon, he inquired for Camoens, and finding him already dead,
                    gave (as documentary evidence shows) instructions that a pension be granted to
                    the poet’s mother, still “very old and very poor.” She survived the poet some
                    years.</p>
                <p>Of Camoens’s personal appearance Manoel Severim de Faria, one of his biographers,
                    writes thus: “He was of middle stature, his face full, and his countenance
                    slightly lowering; his nose long, raised in the middle, and large at the end. He
                    was much disfigured by the loss of his right eye. Whilst young his hair (like
                    Tasso’s) was so yellow as to resemble saffron. Although his appearance was not
                    perhaps prepossessing, his manners and conversation were pleasing and cheerful.
                    He was afterwards a prey to melancholy, was never married, and left no child.”
                    On a marble slab fixed in the wall of the church of Santa Ana, Dorn Gonçalo de
                    Coutinho had au inscription placed; but as both church and inscription perished
                    in the earthquake of 1755, there is some doubt as to its precise wording, and
                    whether “he lived poor and neglected and so died” formed part of it or not.</p>
                <p>Amid many tributes to Camoens’s memory, those of Manoel de Sousa, Diogo
                    Bernardes, Tasso, and Lope-de-Vega are well known. The last alludes to him as
                    “the divine Camoens,” and adds, “Strange fortune that to so much wit and
                    learning gave a life of poverty and a rich sepulchre.”</p>
                <p>A Spanish biographer of Cervantes has shown “that the most remarkable coincidence
                    of fortune may be traced in the events which marked the lives of Camoens and the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote.”</hi></p>
                <p>Estimating the popularity of Camoens great epic <hi rend="italic">Os
                    Lusiadas</hi> by the number of editions printed in Portugal, it was without
                    question considerable, no less than thirty-eight having been published at Lisbon
                    prior to the year 1700, and in addition four in Spain,—three in Castilian and
                    one in Portuguese. There exist translations in English, French, German, Italian,
                    Dutch, Polish, Bohemian, Danish, Swedish, Russian, Latin, Greek, and even
                    Hebrew. The earliest in English is by Sir Richard Fanshaw (London, 1655), and
                    was composed during his banishment at Tankersley Park, Yorkshire, in 1652. Had
                    he lived to prepare a second edition, many errors and imperfections arising from
                    an incomplete knowledge of the Portuguese idiom would, no doubt, have been
                    rectified. He was appointed ambassador to Portugal in 1661, where he remained
                    three years, being then transferred to Madrid, where he died in 1666. Mickle’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Lusiad</hi> was first published in 1776, and hardly merits
                    Southey’s condemnation (he preferring that of Fanshaw) of “most unfaithful.” It
                    is fairly close in places, but much of the force of the original is sacrificed
                    for the sake of smooth versification. Another translation by Musgrave in blank
                    verse appeared in 1826, the latter cantos of which are closer and more effective
                    than the earlier. A version of the first five cantos by Quillinan followed in
                    1853, rendered with considerable grace and with greater accuracy than Mickle’s.
                    In 1854 appeared a version by Sir Thomas Mitchell.</p>
                <p>In estimating the genius of Camoens, it must be remembered that “we build with
                    ready materials, but he dug the quarry, rough <pb break="no"

                    material for his edifice.” He strengthened and polished the Portuguese language,
                    and his influence preserved it from destruction as an idiom during the Spanish
                    occupation, when the language of the court was Castilian. The circumstances
                    under which his great epic was penned were peculiarly unfavourable to the
                    production and elaboration of such a work; still he triumphed over every
                    difficulty, and produced the epic master-piece of his age. Theophilo Braga, his
                    latest Portuguese biographer, observes, “In Camoens we find exemplified that
                    tradition which insures moral unity to a people, and is the bond which
                    constitutes their nationality, as in the Homeric poems are centered the Hellenic
                    traditions. This same spirit animated Camoens, for in <hi rend="italic">Os
                    Lusiadas</hi> are gathered together many beautiful and exciting traditions of
                    Portuguese history.” Extended and elaborate notices of the <hi rend="italic"
