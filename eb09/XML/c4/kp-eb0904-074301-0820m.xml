                    Vaudois), Vagabonds, Assemblers <hi rend="italic">(assemblée</hi> was the name
                    given to the meeting or conventicle of Huguenots), Fanatics, and the Children of
                    God. They belonged to that romance-speaking people of Gothic descent who took
                    part in the earliest movements towards religious reform. It was in Languedoc
                    that the Peace of God and the Truce of God were formed in the 11th century
                    against the miseries of private war (Rudolph Glaber, iv. 5). There were
                    preserved the forms of municipal freedom which nearly all Europe had lost; and
                    there commerce flourished without spoiling the thrift, the patience, the
                    simplicity of the national character Not even the voluptuous court of Arles,
                    with its trouvères, its courts of love, and its extravagant applications of the
                    rules of chivalry, could corrupt the free and honest intelligence of these
                    southern communities. Before the tragedy of the Albigenses began, it was a
                    proverb in Languedoc against the stupid and sensual priesthood, “J’aimerais
                    mieux être prêtre que d’avoir fait une telle chose.” Although the rage of the
                    Crusaders and the cold hate of the Dominicans were successful in blasting the
                    commercial development of the district, they could not wholly eradicate those
                    ideas which, whether called Paulician, Catharist, Bulgarian, Hussite, or
                    Protestant, really represent religious sincerity and mental freedom. Calvin was
                    warmly welcomed when he preached at Nîmes, Montpellier became the chief centre
                    for the instruction of the Huguenot youth. But it was in the great triangular
                    plateau of mountain called the Cévennes that, among the small farmers, the cloth
                    and silk weavers, and vine dressers, Protestantism was most intense and
                    universal. These people were and still are very poor, but they are intelligent
                    and pious, and they add to the deep fervour of the Provençal character a gravity
                    which is probably the result of their recorded history. From the lists of
                    Huguenots sent from Languedoc to the galleys (1684 to 1762), we gather that the
                    common type of <hi rend="italic">physique</hi> is “belle taille, cheveux bruns,
                    visage ovale.” The diocese of Meude consists of 173 parishes, and contains the
                    Bas Gévaudan and the Haut Gévaudan. The Haut Gévaudan consists of the Mountains
                    la Marguerite and Aulrac; the Bas Gévaudan embraces the Hautes Cévennes and the
                    Lozère. In the midst of these mountains are three great plains or plateaux,
                    called respectively L’Hôpital, L’Hos-pitalet, and La Cause, and a forest named
                    Le Faux des Armes. Barley and chestnuts are the chief products of Gévaudan. The
                    Basses Cévennes are in the richer diocese of Alais, which has 93 parishes. The
                    chief mountains are Aigoal and Esperon, the latter enclosing a beautiful plateau
                    named Hort-Dieu (God’s Garden). The Vivarais lies in the diocese of Viviers,
                    which has 314 parishes and 3 cantons; Boutières,. Montagne, and Bas-Vivarais.
                    Farther south are the well-cultivated dioceses of Uzes, Nîmes (called Little
                    Canaan), and Montpellier, the last of which is connected with La Serrane, the
                    southern branch of the Cévennes. The whole district of the war is thus contained

                <p>To understand the war of these Camisards requires a glance at the preceding
                    history of France. The system of toleration which was established under the
                    Edict of Nantes, 13th April 1598, and the Edict of Grace (Nîmes), July 1629, was
                    essentially a political compromise, and not a recognition of the principle of
                    religious equality. The right of having a private chapel was given to all <hi
                    rend="italic">seigneurs</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fief</hi><hi rend="italic">haut justicier,</hi> but in the case of a <hi
                    rend="italic">seigneur sans haute justice</hi> only thirty persons might attend
                    the service. New public churches were to be authorized at a certain rate in
                    certain places. On the other hand, Calvinists were admitted to all public posts
                    and to all professions; they could publish books in towns where they had
                    churches. The Chamber of the Edict was formed in the parliament of Paris for the
                    impartial judgment of cases brought by Huguenots; and the “mi-partie,”
                    half-Catholic half-Protestant constitution, was adopted in the town-consulates
                    and the local parliaments of the south. After the short-lived struggle between
                    Louis XIII. and the Due de Rohan, the Huguenots settled down into contented
                    industry; the army and navy of France were led by two Huguenots, Turenne and
                    Duquesne, and Cardinal Bentivoglio wrote to Pope Paul IV. that he no longer
                    found in France “quell’ insano fervor di coscienza si radicato primo negli
                    ugonotti.” But the court in which Mme. de Maintenon had succeeded to Mme. de
                    Montespan, where Louvois and the Jesuit Père la Chaise were as supreme as
                    Bossuet and Fléchier in the church, could not long be satisfied with tolerated
                    heresy, which they chose to consider as veiled rebellion.</p>
                <p>On the death of Mazarin a commissioner had perambulated the kingdom to inquire
                    into the titles, or rather to suppress as many as possible, of the Huguenot
                    churches, schools, and cemeteries. The extirpation of heresy had, in fact, been
                    provided for by a clause in the marriage-contract between Louis and Maria
                    Theresa (1660), and in spite of the protection of Colbert, a policy was begun of
                    destroying piece-meal the privileges of the dissenters. The chancellor Le
                    Tellier, by a series of arbitrary council edicts, shut against them the public
                    offices and the trade corporations, forbade them to marry with Catholics, and
                    encouraged, almost enforced, the conversion of children who had reached the age
                    of seven. The wholesale briberies of Pélisson, the destruction of churches by
                    Foucault in Montauban, Béarn, and Poitiers, the billeting of soldiers on the
                    unconverted in Languedoc by the intendant Bâville, led up the Edict of
                    Revocation (18th October 1685). This edict directed all the churches to be
                    destroyed, forbade religious meetings under pain of imprisonment and
                    confiscation of goods, ordered all ministers or pastors (who would not change
                    their faith) to be banished within fifteen days, and to stop preaching at once
                    under pain of the galleys, promised several exemptions from taxes and increased
                    salaries to converted ministers, suppressed all Huguenot schools, and directed
                    all children to be baptized and brought up in the Catholic faith, prohibited all
                    Huguenots, except ministers, from going abroad, and declared the property of
                    those who had already gone to be forfeited unless they returned within four
                    months, Such was the formal scheme. In carrying it into effect, Huguenot Bibles,
                    Testaments, Psalters, and books of religious instruction were burned, and
                    Huguenots were forbidden to hire themselves as artisans or as domestic servants.
                    Torture, hanging, insults worse than death to women, the galleys for life,
                    imprisonment for life in the Tour de la Constance, near Aiguesmortes, were the
                    ordinary occurrences of the next sixty years. Many escaped to Geneva, Lausanne,
                    Amsterdam, and London. It is calculated that 600,000 French Protestants left
                    their country in the twenty years following the revocation, and 400,000 in the
                    twenty years preceding it (Smiles, <hi rend="italic">The Huguenots in

                    were too poor to escape, and aR over Languedoc began the secret meetings of the
                    Church of the Desert. At last Louvois proposed that this rebellious district
                    should be turned into an actual desert. The intendant Bâville and the Due de

                    Alais, and Auduze. The peace of Ryswick (1697) facilitated these operations. The
                    religious hysteria which now descended on the Cévennes has been traced <hi

                    communicated his enthusiasm to the shepherdess La Belle Isabeau, and 500 or 600
                    other so-called prophets.</p>
                <p>In 1700 this sacred fire again broke out in the person of a travelling dressmaker
                    in Ardèche, and spread from the summits of the Lozère to the sea (Peyrat, <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire des</hi><hi rend="italic">Pasteurs</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >du Désert,</hi> i. 261). A woman (Isabel Vincent) was again the most exalted of
                    the prophets. The Abbé du Chaila, a veteran Catholic missionary from Siam, had
                    been appointed inspector of missions in the Cévennes. There he introduced the
                    “squeezers” (which resembled the Scotch “boot”), and his systematic and refined
                    cruelty at last broke the patience of his victims. His murder, on 23d July 1702,
                    at Pont de Mont Vert, was the first blow in the war. It was planned by Esprit
                    Séguier, the “Danton of the Cévennes,” who at once began to carry out his idea
                    of a general massacre of the Catholic priests. He soon fell, and was succeeded
                    by Laporte, an old soldier, who, as his troop increased, assumed the title of
                    the Colonel of the Children of God, and named his camp the “Camp of the
                    Eternal.” He used to lead his followers to the fight, singing Clement Marot’s
                    grand version of the 68th Psalm, “Que Dieu se montre seulement,” to the music of
                    Goudimal. Besides La Porte, the forest-ranger Castanet, the wool-carders Condere
                    and Mazel, the soldiers Catinat, Joany, and Ravenel were selected as
                    captains,—all men whom the <hi rend="italic">théomanie</hi> or prophetic malady
                    had visited. Bat the most important figures are those of Roland, who afterwards
                    issued the following extraordinary despatch to the inhabitants of St André
                    :—“Nous, comte et seigneur Roland, généralissime des Protestants de France, nous
                    ordonnons que vous ayez à congédier dans trois jours tous les prêtres et
                    missionaires qui sont chez vous, sous peine d’être brûlés tout vifs, vous et
                    eux” (Court, i. p. 219); and Jean Cavalier, the baker’s boy, who, at the age of
                    seventeen, commanded the southern army of the Camisards, and who, after
                    defeating successively Count de Broglie and three French marshals, Montrevel,
                    Berwick, and Villars, made an honourable peace.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Cavalier for nearly three years continued to direct the war. Regular taxes were
                    raised, arsenals were formed in the great limestone caves of the district, the
                    Catholic churches and their decorations were burned, and the clergy driven away
                    Occasionally routed in regular engagements, the Camisards, through their
                    desperate valour, and the rapidity of their movements in a country without good
                    roads, were constantly successful in skirmishes, night attacks, and ambuscades.
                    A force of 60,000 was now in the field against them; among others, the Irish
                    Brigade which had just returned from the persecutions of the</p>
                <p>Vaudois. Montrevel adopted a policy of extermination, and 466 villages were
                    burned in the Upper Cévennes alone, the population being for the most part put
                    to the sword. The Pope, Clement XI., assisted in this glorious work by issuing a
                    Bull against the “execrable race of the ancient Albigenses,” and promising
                    remission of sins to the holy militia which was now formed among the Catholic
                    population, and was called the Florentines, Cadets of the Cross, or White
                    Camisards. Villars, the victor of Hochstadt and Friedlingen, saw that
                    conciliation was necessary; he took advantage of the feeling of horror with
                    which the quiet Protestants of Nîmes and other towns now regarded the war, and
                    published an amnesty. In May 1704 a formal meeting between Cavalier and Villars
                    took place at Nîmes. The result of the interview was that a document entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Très</hi><hi rend="italic">humble</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    of those sentenced to prison or the galleys under the revocation, and for the
                    restitution to the emigrants of their property and civil rights, were all
                    granted,—the first on condition of no churches being built, and the third on
                    condition of an oath of allegiance being taken. The greater part of the Camisard
                    army under Roland, Ravenel, and Joany would not accept the terms which Cavalier
                    had arranged. They insisted that the Edict of Nantes must be restored,— <hi

                    leaders were either killed or dispersed.</p>
                <p>In 1709 Mazel and Claris, with the aid of two preaching women, Marie Desubas and
                    Elisabeth Catalon, made a serious effort to rekindle revolt in the Vivarais. In
                    1711 all opposition and all signs of the Reformed religion had disappeared. On
                    8th March 1715, by medals and a proclamation, Louis XIV. announced the entire
                    extinction of heresy. Fourteen years afterwards, in spite of the strictest
                    surveillance, aided by military occupation whenever the exigencies of foreign
                    war permitted, the heroic missionary Antoine Court had organized 120 churches in
                    Languedoc, which were attended by 200,000 Protestants, and governed secretly by
                    the old discipline of “pasteur, anciens, consistoire, synode;” the Society of
                    Help for the Afflicted Faithful (to which George I. subscribed 500 guineas a
                    year) had established their training college at Lausanne; and during the next
                    thirty years Paul Rabaut, minister at Nîmes, fostered and developed this
                    religion, the child of intolerance. Voltaire’s intervention in the affair of

                <p>What we know of the spiritual manifestations in the Cévennes (which much
                    resembled, those of the Swedish Raestars of Smaland in 1844) is chiefly derived

                    publications Marion, Durand Fage, and Cavalier were in London. They tried to
                    propagate their “mystical phalanx” there, but the consistory of the French
                    church in the Savoy pronounced the “ecstasy” to be an assumed and voluntary
                    habit. Voltaire relates <hi rend="italic">(Siècle</hi><hi rend="italic">de Louis
                    XIV.,</hi> c. 36) that Marion wished to prove his inspiration by attempting to
                    raise a dead body from St Paul’s churchyard. He was at last compelled to leave
                    England. The inspiration (of which there were four degrees, <hi rend="italic"
                    >avertissement,</hi><hi rend="italic">souffle,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >prophétie,</hi><hi rend="italic">dons)</hi> was sometimes communicated by a
                    kiss at the assembly. The patient, who had gone through several fasts three days
                    in length, became pale and fell insensible to the ground. Then came violent
                    agitations of the limbs and head, as Voltaire remarks, “quite according to the
                    ancient custom of all nations, and the rules of madness transmitted from age to
                    age” Finally the patient (who might be a little child, a woman, a half-witted
                    person) began to speak in the good French of the Huguenot Bible words such as
                    these: “Mes frères, amendez-vous, faites pénitence, la fin du monde approche; le
                    jugement général sera dans trois mois; répentez-vous du grand péché que vous
                    avez commis d’aller à la messe; c’est le Saint-Esprit qui parle par ma bouche”
                    <hi rend="italic">(Histoire du fanatisme de notre temps,</hi> par Brueys,
                    Utrecht, 1737, vol. i. p. 153). The discourse might go on for two hours; after
                    which the patient could only express himself in his native patois,— <hi
                    rend="italic">-a</hi> Romance idiom,—and had no recollection of his “ecstasy.”
                    All kinds of miracles attended on the Camisards. Lights in the sky guided them
                    to places of safety, voices sang encouragement to them, shots and wounds were
                    often harmless. Those entranced fell from trees without hurting themselves; they
                    shed tears of blood; and they subsisted without food or speech for nine days.
                    The supernatural was part of their life. Much literature has been devoted to the
                    discussion of these marvels. The Catholics Fléchier (in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lettres Choisies)</hi> and Brueys consider them the product of fasting and
                    vanity, nourished on apocalyptic literature. The doctors Bertrand (in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Du Magnétisme</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal,</hi> Paris, 1826) and
                    Calmeil (in his <hi rend="italic">De la Folie,</hi> Paris, 1845) speak of
                    magnetism, hysteria, and epilepsy, a prophetic monomania based on belief in
                    divine possession. The Protestants Peyrat and Court are content with the phrase
                    “ecstasy,” and do not invoke the supernatural. The Catholic Tories, such as Μ.
                    Hippolyte Blanc, regard the whole thing as the work of the devil. Since the
                    publication of Hecker’s work on <hi rend="italic">Epidemics of the Middle
                    Ages,</hi> it has been possible to consider the subject in its true
                    relations.</p>
                <p>Although the Camisards were guilty of great cruelties in the prosecution of the
                    war, there does not seem to be sufficient ground for the charge made by Marshal
                    de Villars: “Le plupart de leurs chefs ont leurs demoiselles” (letter of 9th
                    August 1704, in the <hi rend="italic">War Archives,</hi> vol. 1797). There
                    probably were many cases in which a vicious use was made of the opportunities
                    afforded by war and religious excitement; but the charges of sexual immorality
                    rest chiefly on the worthless statements of Louvreleuil. The standard works
                    relating to the Camisards are,—Elie Béuoît, <hi rend="italic">Historie</hi><hi

                    to the Elector of Brandenburg, 6th September 1666, that the king admitted that
                    the Huguenots were loyal subjects, and had even given remarkable proofs of
                    loyalty. He contrasts the passivity of his friends with the political intrigues
                    of the Polish Socιnians, and with the turbulence of the Swiss Anabaptists.
                    Claude, in his <hi rend="italic">Plainte des Protestant cruellement opprimés
                    dans le Royaume de France,</hi> Cologne, Chez Marteau, 1686, gives a vivid
                    picture of the persecution from the beginning. He mentions the “Explications,”
                    or official glosses on the edicts, of which the Jesuit Meynier was the most
                    prolific author, one of which maintained that the Edict of Nantes (contrary to
                    its express terms) was confined to Huguenots in life at its date; another, that
                    the phrase <hi rend="italic">Petite</hi><hi rend="italic">École</hi> did not
                    include any school in which Latin was taught. He inveighs against the duplicity
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Conseil,</hi> who professed sometimes to blame,
                    sometimes to encourage their intendants, and of the king, who in his circulars
                    to the clergy declared (down to the moment of revocation) that he did not wish
                    to interfere with the edicts. Soulier in his <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    Edicts of Pacification,</hi> and Nicole in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protestants</hi><hi rend="italic">convicted of Schism,</hi> justified the royal
                    policy from Scripture, history, and reason. Maimbourg in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Pope Gregory,</hi> and Varillas in his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Religious Revolutions in Europe,</hi> praise Louis for using only the weapons of
                    charity and persuasion. Translations of the narratives of John Bion, and of the
                    anonymous friend of the martyr Louis de Marolles, were published together at
                    London in 1712. The latter is dedicated to Heinsius, Pensionary of Holland and
                    West Friesland, who had assisted the refugee Camisards; it is preceded by a
                    violent preface, in which the author, an English clergyman, points out how the
                    position of France has altered since the Peace of Ryswick, and urges the English
                    intervention to restore the Edict of Nantes. For the politics of the subject he

                    ÏVar,</hi> London, 1712. Bion’s narrative contains all the details about the
                    galleys. <hi rend="italic">The Complete History of the Cevennes by a Doctor of
                    the Civil Law,</hi> London, 1703, consists of an account of the people and
                    country by an Englishman who had lately travelled there, and of a separate
                    historical survey, description of the edicts, and political argument. The doctor

                    Benoit, Brueys, Guiscard, and Boyer, and several original letters from
                    Camisards. The same desire to protect the refugees from the attacks of the
                    French Savoy Church in London, led to the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
