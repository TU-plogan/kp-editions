                <p><label type="entry">CAMELLIA</label>, the name of a genus of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Temstrorniaceoe,</hi> remarkable for its evergreen laurel-like foliage, and its
                    handsome rose-like flowers, whence the common species, <hi rend="italic">C.
                    japοnica,</hi> is sometimes called the Japan rose. This is an evergreen shrub of
                    remarkably hardy constitution, so that in our climate it flourishes perfectly in
                    a cold greenhouse; indeed, in the south and west of England, and in other
                    favourable situations, the plant itself is hardy, and only suffers from frost in
                    regard to the damage done to its flowers, which are naturally developed very
                    early in the spring, and are therefore liable to suffer injury from spring
                    frosts. The plant had been cultivated by the Japanese and Chinese long previous
                    to its introduction to our gardens from China in 1739, and, in consequence,
                    numerous doubleflowered varieties were at that time known, of which about two
                    dozen sorts were introduced from China, chiefly between 1806 and 1824, some two
                    or three others having been obtained so early as 1792-4. This number of
                    varieties has now been very considerably increased by the production of European
                    seedlings, so that several hundreds are figured in a publication called <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouvelle Iconographie des</hi><hi rend="italic">Camellias,</hi>
                    specially devoted to their illustration. The plant seeds freely in the climate
                    of Italy and the south of Europe, and thence many first-rate sorts have been
                    obtained.</p>
                <p>The original type of <hi rend="italic">C. japonica</hi> forms a dense bushy
                    evergreen, abundantly clothed with ovate acuminate glossy leaves, and decorated
                    with sessile single red flowers composed of from five to seven (nominally five)
                    broadly obovate rosy carmine petals, which expand into a cup-shaped flower, and
                    surround a circlet of numerous monadelphous stamens, within which a few free
                    stamens, two to each petal, are produced. These stamens afford a fine contrast
                    to the broad spreading petals. This form, or one but slightly removed from it,
                    is still cultivated in gardens, as a stock on which to graft the double-flowered
                    sorts, these only, in a general way, being now prized. There are, however, some
                    few exceptions, as, for example, the single white, whose large flowers, with
                    their conspicuous stamens, are extremely handsome when associated with the
                    rich-looking dark green foliage.</p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="italic">Camellia</hi> was given to these plants by Linnaeus in
                    honour of George Joseph Camellus or Kamel, a Moravian Jesuit, who travelled in
                    Asia, and wrote a history of the plants of the island of Luzon. In Japan, its
                    native country, the <hi rend="italic">Camellia</hi> attains to the size of a
                    large tree, and it is held in high estimation by the Japanese on account of the
                    extreme beauty of its large, showy, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n813/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0813-0738"/> various-coloured flowers, which, however, have
                    this drawback, that they have no scent. It appears to have been cultivated by
                    the Chinese from time immemorial, and all our earlier introductions were
                    obtained from that country. According to the <hi rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Kewensis,</hi> it was introduced into England by Robert James,
                    Lord Petre, before the year 1739; and the Waratah, or anemone-flowered variety,
                    which has broad outer petals and a crowd of smaller central ones, is said to
                    have been introduced at the same time. The double white, a variety as yet
                    unsurpassed in beauty, its flowers being so pure in colour, and so full and
                    symmetrically imbricated in form, was introduced in 1792; as also was the double
                    striped, a free blooming hardy kind, with rosy red flowers irregularly blotched
                    with white, which though surpassed in size and richness of colouring by more
                    modern European varieties, is still too useful to be altogether discarded. The
                    latest direct importations are probably the hexangular-flowered Camellia <hi
                    rend="italic">(hexangularis),</hi> introduced from China by Mr Fortune in 1846,
                    a variety which, like that called Lady Hume’s Blush <hi rend="italic"
                    >(incarnata),</hi> has the pointed petals laid directly over each other, so that
                    the face of the flower becomes six-angled; and the fish-tailed Camellia,
                    introduced in 1861, a variety in which the leaves are sharply serrated at the
                    margin and forked at the apex, so that they resemble in form the tail of a
                    fish.</p>
                <p>To be seen in their full perfection Camellias should be planted out in borders of
                    properly prepared soil under glass; but these borders should be very effectually
                    drained, and of such a mechanical composition as never to become soddened, for
                    the plants require to be almost deluged with water when making their growth, and
                    when developing their blossoms. The borders, moreover, when the plants have
                    become well established, and the soil is full of roots, will require to be
                    assisted by top-dressings, such as sheep or deer dung, and by applications of
                    liquid manure. They by no means require a heated structure, nor too much
                    sunlight, but when well established in a cool and somewhat shaded conservatory,
                    may become a source of infinite delight to those who have a love for flowers. As
                    instances of the great esteem in which the <hi rend="italic">Camellia</hi> is
                    held, it is only necessary to refer to the immense number of cut blooms sold
                    during the season in Covent Garden market, and the high prices which they
                    realize while yet comparatively scarce.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Camellia</hi> is limited to some six or seven
                    species, natives of India and Japan. Of these, besides <hi rend="italic">C.
                    japonica,</hi> another named <hi rend="italic">C. reticulata,</hi> a native of
                    the island of Hong-Kong, is highly prized in gardens for its very handsome
                    blossoms. It differs from <hi rend="italic">C. iaponica</hi> in its downy
                    branches, and reticulated, not glossy leaves, and also in its much larger
                    flowers. The double-flowered variety of this plant has a most gorgeous
                    appearance, specimens of the flowers having been measured which were as much as
                    twenty inches in circumference.</p>
                <p>Both <hi rend="italic">C. Sasanqua ( = oleifera),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C.
                    drupifera (=Kissii),</hi> the former inhabiting Japan and China, the latter
                    Cochin-China and the mountains of India, are oil-yielding plants. The oil of <hi
                    rend="italic">C. Sasanqua</hi> (of which Sasankwa is the native Japanese name)
                    has an agreeable odour, and is used for many domestic purposes; it is obtained
                    from the seeds by subjecting them to pressure sufficient to reduce them to a
                    coarse powder, and then boiling and again pressing the crushed material. The
                    leaves are also used in the form of a decoction by the Japanese women, for
                    washing their hair; and in a dried state they are mixed λvith tea on account of
                    their pleasant flavour. The oil of <hi rend="italic">C. drupifera,</hi> which is
                    closely allied to <hi rend="italic">C. Sasanqτιa,</hi> is used medicinally in
                    Cochin-China, its flowers also are odoriferous, all the other known species,
                    except the Indian <hi rend="italic">0.</hi><hi rend="italic">lutescens,</hi>
                    being inodorous.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Camellia</hi> is very closely allied to that of the
                    tea-plant <hi rend="italic">(Thea)</hi>; indeed so close is the affinity that
                    some botanistshave proposed to unite them. Dr Seemann, however, in a memoir
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Transactioìis of the Linnean Society</hi>
                    (xxii. 337), points out their distinctions, from which it appears that while in
                    <hi rend="italic">Camellia</hi> the flowers are erect and sessile, the calyx
                    many-leaved with deciduous sepals, the interior stamens (those within the
                    monadelphous ring) twice the number of petals, and the styles five in number,
                    the flowers of <hi rend="italic">Thea</hi> are pedunculate and nodding, the
                    calyx five-sepaled with persistent sepals, the interior stamens equalling the
                    petals in number, and the styles three. So close, however, is the agreement
                    between them that the red-flowered <hi rend="italic">Camellia Sasanqtιa,</hi> as
                    it was for a long time called in gardens, has, as a result of more intimate
                    acquaintance with its structure, to be referred to <hi rend="italic">Thea,</hi>
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">Thea maUflora.</hi> Bentham and Hooker, in
                    their new <hi rend="italic">Genera Plantarum,</hi> have again united <hi
                    rend="italic">Thea</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Camellia</hi> under the
                    latter-name, preferring to regard the teas as forming a section of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Camellia,</hi> which conclusion has been adopted by Professor Dyer
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Flora of British India</hi> (i. 292), where the <hi
                    rend="italic">Thea assamica</hi> of authors is referred to as the possible wild
                    stock of the tea-plant, and the name of <hi rend="italic">Camellia theifera</hi>
                    adopted for the combined form called <hi rend="italic">T. chinensis</hi> by
                    Linnaeus and Scernarrn. (T. MO.)</p>
