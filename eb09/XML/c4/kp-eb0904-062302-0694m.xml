                    into the gorges from which the streams issue. The city stands in 34° 30½' N.
                    lat., 69° 6' E. long., at an altitude of 6396 feet above the sea.</p>
                <p>Cabul is about 3 miles in circuit; it was formerly walled, but now is not so. The
                    mountains surround it pretty closely except where the plain opens to the N.E. It
                    is triangular in form, the Bâlâ-Hissâr or Acropolis, in which the Amir resides,
                    forming the S.E. angle, and rising about 150 feet above the plain. The old wall
                    had seven gates, of which two alone remain, viz., the Lahori and the Sirdar.</p>
                <p>The city is divided into six <hi rend="italic">mahalas</hi> or quarters, and
                    these again into <hi rend="italic">kuchαs</hi> or sections, which are enclosed
                    and have gates. In tumult these enclosures form small separate fortresses. The
                    streets hardly merit the name, and nowhere could admit wheel carriages; they are
                    narrow passages, frightfully dirty after rain. The houses are of sun-dried brick
                    and wood, seldom more than two stories in height. There are no public buildings
                    of any moment; some mosques are spacious, but none have any magnificence. There
                    are thirteen or fourteen sarais for foreign traders, but they bear no comparison
                    with those of Persia. The public baths lack cleanliness, and the odour of the
                    filth which is used as fuel is most offensive. The greatest ornament of the city
                    was the arcaded and roofed bazaar called <hi rend="italic">Chihâr Châtâ,</hi>
                    ascribed to Ali Mardân Khân, a noble of the 17th century, who has left behind
                    him many monuments of his munificent public spirit both in Cabul and in
                    Hindustan. Its four arms had an aggregate length of about 600 feet, with a
                    breadth of 30. The display of goods was remarkable, and in the evening it was
                    illuminated. This edifice was destroyed by Sir G. Pollock on evacuating Cabul,
                    as a memento of the treachery of the city. The several crafts, such as saddlers,
                    drapers, braziers, armourers, congregate together, as is usual in the East and
                    to some extent in the south of Europe. Itinerant traders also parade the
                    bazaars, each with his peculiar cry. The old-clothesman of London is represented
                    by the Moghul of Cabul, with his cry of “Old bullion, old clothes!”</p>
                <p>Including the Bala Hissar, Cabul contains about 9000 houses, giving a probable
                    population of 50,000 to 60,000. In summer the population is more dense. Without
                    the limits of the old city to the westward is the fortified quarter of Chandol,
                    once a detached village, now a large suburb occupied by the Kizilbashes (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Afghanistan),</hi> and containing 1500 to 2000 houses. It has
                    independent bazaars, baths, mosques, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The river of Cabul is traditionally said to have several times flooded or swept
                    away the city. There is but one bridge within the city limits, but there are
                    others above and below in the vicinity. The city is well supplied with water,
                    chiefly by canals drawn from the two rivers, and the streets are frequently
                    intersected by covered aqueducts. There are also many wells, water being found
                    at moderate depth throughout the valley.</p>
                <p>Though there is some malarious influence in autumn from the marshy ground north
                    of ths city, Cabul is on the whole healthy. In addition, to good water it has at
                    most seasons a fine atmosphere, and an excellent supply of food. The children
                    are chubby and ruddy. Vast supplies of fruit of fine quality are brought into
                    the markets from the gardens of the Koh-daman and adjoining valleys. And the
                    shops for the sale of fruit, fresh and dried, are a notable feature in the
                    bazaars.</p>
                <p>Cemeteries are numerous in the vicinity, including places of Jewish and common
                    burial. One of the graveyards near <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n695/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0695-0624"/> the shrine called Shâh Shahid contains a tomb
                    bearing in Roman characters the following inscription :—“<hi rend="italic">Here
                    lyes the body of</hi> Joseph Hicks, <hi rend="italic">the son</hi> of Thomas
                    Hicks <hi rend="italic">and</hi> Edith, <hi rend="italic">who departed this lyfe
                    the eleventh of October</hi> 1666.” An annual day in spring is appropriated to
                    visiting the tombs, as in continental Europe. The graves are sprinkled, garlands
                    placed, and small repairs executed.</p>
                <p>Many sacred shrines are interspersed among the cemeteries and gardens. The
                    gardens are often on acclivities, formed into terraces, supplied with springs,
                    and abounding in song-birds. Both shrines and gardens are greatly resorted to by
                    the Cabulis, who are passionately fond of this kind of recreation. Most of the
                    roads are bordered by running waters, and shadowed by mulberry, willow, or
                    poplar trees. The tomb of the illustrious Sultan Baber stands about a mile to
                    the west of the city in a singularly charming spot, on a slope spreading before
                    the sun. The grave is marked by two erect slabs of white marble. Near him lie
                    several of his wives and children; the garden has been formerly enclosed by a
                    marble wall; a clear stream waters the flower-beds. From the hill that rises
                    behind the tomb there is a noble prospect of his beloved city, and of the
                    all-fruitful plain stretching to the north of it.</p>
                <p>The geographical position of Cabul, in a tolerably open country intervening
                    between the passes which lead to India on the one side, and those which lead to
                    Turkestan on the other, is highly favourable to trade. Baber exalts the
                    importance of its traffic in his day, saying that the products of Khorasan, Rûm
                    (Turkey), Babylonia, and China were all to be found there. People in easy
                    circumstances are numerous. The presence of a court and a considerable military
                    force contributes to the bustle of the place, and imparts animation to many
                    trades. But the people do not excel in any handicraft or manufacture.</p>
                <p>Cabul is believed to be the <hi rend="italic">Ortospanum</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Ortospana</hi> of the geographies of Alexander’s march, a name
                    conjectured to be a corruption of <hi rend="italic">Urddhasthâna,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi> high place.” But the actual name is perhaps also found as
                    that of a people in this position (Ptolemy’s <hi rend="italic">Kabolitoe),</hi>
                    if not in the name of a city apparently identical with Ortospana, <hi
                    rend="italic">Carura</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> in some copies read
                    <hi rend="italic">Cabura.</hi> It was invaded by the Arabs as early as the
                    thirty-fifth year of the Hegira, but it was long before the Mahometans effected
                    any lasting settlement. In the early Mahometan histories and geographies we find
                    (according to a favourite Arabic love of jingle) <hi rend="italic">Kâbul</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Zâbul</hi> constantly associated. Zâbul appears to have
                    been the country about Ghazni. Cabul first became a capital when Baber made
                    himself master of it in 1504, and here he reigned for fifteen years before his
                    invasion of Hindustan. In modern times it became a capital again, under Timur
                    Shah (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Afghanistan),</hi> and so has continued both to
                    the end of the Durrani dynasty, and under the Barakzais, who now reign. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(h. y.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Cabul</hi> (Kabul), is also
                    the name of the province including the city so called. It may be considered to
                    embrace the whole of the plains called Koh-daman and Beghram, &lt;fcc., to the
                    Hindu Kush northward, with the Kohestan or hill country adjoining so far as it
                    is in actual subjection to the Amir’s authority. Eastward it extends to the
                    border of Jalâlâbâd at Jagdalak ∙ southward it includes the Loghar district, and
                    extends to the border of Ghazni; north-westward it includes the Paghman hills,
                    and the valley of the upper Kabul River, and so to the Koh-i-Baba. Roughly it
                    embraces a territory of about 100 miles square. Wheat and barley are the staple
                    products of the arable tracts. Artificial grasses are also much cultivated, and
                    fruits largely, especially in the Koh-daman. A considerable part of the
                    population spends the summer in tents. The villages are notenclosed by
                    fortifications, but contain small private castles or fortalices. The revenue of
                    Cabul province has been stated at £ 180,000.</p>
