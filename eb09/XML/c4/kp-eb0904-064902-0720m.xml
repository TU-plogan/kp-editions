                    boundaries, situated on the West Coast of Africa, in the Bight of Biafra,
                    between 4° 20' and 6° N. lat., and between 6° 30' and 9° E. long. The name
                    corresponds to no geographical or political unity, but is convenient as
                    provisionally comprehending a stretch of country of considerable commercial
                    importance. The coast line is frequently regarded as extending from the Nun
                    mouth of the Niger, to the neighbourhood of the Cameroon Mountains, and thus
                    includes the estuaries of the Brass River or Tuwon-Toro, the San Nicholas or
                    Kola Toro, the New Calabar, and the Bonny, which are all deltaic branches of the
                    Niger, as well as the San Pedro or Kan Toro, and the important embouchure of the
                    united streams of the Cross River, the Old Calabar, and the Great Qua River. The
                    interior of the country is still unexplored, and the inland boundary is left
                    completely vague. The soil of the whole country, for 150 miles or further from
                    the sea, is purely‘alluvial; and the surface is literally covered with bush
                    except in the very limited areas under cultivation. Further inland, especially
                    in the direction of the Cameroon Mountains, the elevation increases, the soil
                    becomes more varied and decidedly rocky, and the forest grows clearer of
                    underwood. This higher region is rich in natural productions, furnishing—besides
                    the palm-oil which forms the main article of foreign trade on the coast—ebony,
                    bamboos, sugar, pepper, yams, Indian corn, plantains, and a variety of
                    woods.</p>
                <p>Leaving the western portion which belongs to the delta of the Niger for treatment
                    in the article on that river, we will confine our attention here to the district
                    watered by the Old Calabar, the Cross River, and the Qua, which more
                    particularly deserves the name of Calabar. The common estuary of these three
                    rivers enters the ocean about 5° N. lat. and 8° 20' E. long. It is about 10 or
                    12 miles wide at its mouth, and maintains nearly the same width for about thirty
                    miles above the bar. At the junction with the Cross River the Old Calabar forms
                    quite a labyrinth of channels and islands, and it is also united with the Qua by
                    a number of creeks.</p>
                <p>The exact position of the sources of these rivers has never been ascertained,
                    but, according to native report, that of the Old Calabar is situated in the
                    neighbourhood of Iko, which is not very far beyond Uyanga, the furthest point
                    inland reached by Captain Hopkins and the Rev. Samuel Edgerley in their journey
                    of exploration in 1872. The truth of this report is rendered almost certain by
                    the diminished size of the stream in the vicinity of Uyanga; and it is thus
                    probable that the mountains in which both it and its sister streams take their
                    rise are the Rimsby range, forming a western extension of the Cameroons. The Qua
                    River is comparatively small, and navigation is impeded, at no great distance
                    up, by sand-banks and fallen trees. Further inland its course is also broken by
                    rapids and several cataracts.</p>
                <p>The country watered by these rivers is occupied by a great number of separate
                    tribes, such as the Efik, the Ekoi, the Ibami, the Oköyöng, and the Aqua, who
                    are politically independent of each other and speak separate languages. Of these
                    the most important are the Efik, or people of Calabar in the strictest sense of
                    that word, which was originally applied by the Portuguese discoverers to the
                    tribes on the coast at the time of their arrival, when as yet the present
                    inhabitants were unknown in the district. It was not till the early part of the
                    18th century that the Efik, owing to civil war with their kindred the Ibibio,
                    migrated from the neighbourhood of the Niger to the shores of the Old Calabar,
                    and established themselves at Ikoritungko or Creek Town. In order to get a
                    better share in the European trade at the mouth of the river a body of colonists
                    from this city migrated further down and built Obutöng or Old Town, and shortly
                    afterwards a rival colony established itself at Aqua Akpa or Duke Town..</p>
                <p>For a time it seemed as if Creek Town would disappear before its younger
                    competitors, but it was again raised to power by King Eyo Eyo, who defied the
                    interference of his rivals. The only political bond of union between the various
                    towns is the Egbo, a kind of secret society into which admittance is obtained on
                    the payment of a certain fee to each of the existing members. The power of this
                    association is almost unlimited, and is used principally for the benefit of its
                    members. Formerly it was one of the greatest curses of the country, from the
                    barbarous customs mingled with its rites; but it is, under European direction,
                    being turned into a means of promulgating a more civilized code of laws through
                    the various towns, and it forms a kind of constitutional defence against the
                    despotism of individual kings. However unsatisfactory the condition of the
                    country still is, there is no doubt European influence of a beneficial kind is
                    gradually making itself felt. The universal belief in the most terrible kinds of
                    witchcraft is slowly being shaken; the use of the esere or Calabar bean as an
                    ordeal, and for purposes of religious purgation, is becoming much less frequent;
                    the murder of twin children is no longer a national custom; and the massacre of
                    his slaves on the death of a king has been abolished. The present king of Creek
                    Town is at least nominally a Christian: and, according to Consul Livingstone,
                    “hundreds <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n721/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0721-0650"/> of decently-dressed natives of both sexes
                    regularly attend divine service” at the mission stations. These number five or
                    six, and are supported by the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which
                    began its labours here in 1846.</p>
                <p>The predominant language, not only among the people of Calabar proper, but also
                    of the various tribes on both sides of the Cross River, is Efik, which bids fair
                    to be the common commercial speech of the whole district. It is really a
                    modified Ibibio, and presents traces of what is known as alliterative concord,
                    though this is by no means a universal characteristic. It has been reduced to
                    writing by the missionaries, who have employed the ordinary English alphabet.
                    Considerable progress has been made in the formation of an initiatory
                    literature; no fewer than 65 volumes having proceeded from the mission press.
                    Most important of these are the Efik translation of the New Testament by Ξ.
                    Goldie (1862), the translation of the Old Testament by Dr A. Robb (1868), and a
                    Dictionary of the Efik by H. Goldie, published in 1862. Captain James Broom
                    Walker of Duke Town, who has explored various parts of the country, presented
                    several charts to the Royal Geographical Society, which are reproduced in the
