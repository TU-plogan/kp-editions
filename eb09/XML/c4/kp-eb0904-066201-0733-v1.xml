                    the northern portion of Britain during the period of the Roman occupation of the
                    island, had originally a more restricted application. It is proposed in this
                    article to give, from a geographical as well as an historical point of view, a

                    northern boundary of the Roman part of the island. Its next appearance is in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Agricola</hi> of Tacitus (96 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >a.d.)</hi> Here, both in the brief geographical description of Britain,

                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> we fail to meet with the term except as the
                    name of one of the many tribes among which he has parcelled out the “Bretannic
                    Island, Albion.” To explain this it is not necessary to assume that Ptolemy was
                    ignorant of the wider acceptation in which Caledonia had recently come to be
                    employed among the Romans. It is more reasonable to suppose that, as he avowedly
                    drew the materials for his tables from earlier, chiefly from Tyrian sources, he
                    judged it prudent to follow in the main long-recognized authorities. Yet even in
                    Ptolemy we have an indication either of the importance of the Caledonians among
                    their neighbours or of the occasional use of the word as a general name for all
                    the northern tribes. Twice he gives the Deucaledonian Ocean as bounding Britain
                    on the north, that is, after the necessary correction for his mistake in making
                    the whole of the northern part of the island trend to the east instead of to the
                    north, as washing the shores of modern Scotland on the west. Confused and
                    inaccurate in some respects as the Alexandrian geographer’s tables are, they,
                    notwithstanding, contain a surprising amount of information regarding the
                    leading features of the coast-line of Britain, the correctness of much of which
                    can be verified by existing names. His account of the tribes and their towns,
                    especially towards the north, is, as might have been expected, much less
                    definite and trustworthy. In order to be able to give here some notice of the
                    Ptolemaic geography of North Britain, Caledonia may for the moment be regarded
                    as a synonymous term.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy’s error in turning the northern part of the island to the east has
                    already been noticed. How he was led into it there are no means of determining.
                    One effect of it is to exaggerate greatly the length of the Solway Firth and
                    displace the Hebrides from their true position, as may be seen by referring to
                    certain maps appended to several MSS. of the Geography and given with some
                    editions of it. The error can easily be rectified; and when this is done the
                    outline of the coast will be found to be wonderfully correct.<note

                    their towns Loukopibia and Retigonion; east of them the Selgoouai (along the

                <p>Ptolemy’s description is the only detailed one we have till we come down to the
                    16th century. It is matter for regret that the <hi rend="italic">Antonine
                        Itinei'ary,</hi> so useful an aid to the identification of the Ptolemaic
                    towns in the southern part of the island, does not extend to the north, and that
                    the lists of the anonymous geographer of Ravenna are so corrupt as to be almost
                    useless. About the middle of the last century a new element of confusion was
                    introduced into what was tangled enough previously, by the publication of
                    Bertram’s well-known forgery <hi rend="italic">De Situ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Britannice,</hi> falsely ascribed to Richard of Cirencester, which being
                    accepted as genuine by Roy, Chalmers, Stuart, and others, has been the means of
                    giving currency to many unfounded notions regarding the nature and extent of the
                    Roman conquests in North Britain.</p>
                <p>The written history of Caledonia as well as of the rest of what is now Scotland
                    commences with the warlike operations in Britain of Agricola, the lieutenant of
                    the Emperor Domitian. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Britannia,</hi> p. 353.) In the
                    third year of his command this famous general, who was fortunate enough to have
                    his son-in-law Tacitus as his biographer, determined to attempt the annexation
                    of the northern portion of the island. Accordingly, in 80 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >a.d.,</hi> he advanced as far as the estuary of the Taus, or as Wex reads,
                    the Tanaus. Whatever the true reading may be, the supposition that on this
                    occasion Agricola reached the Tay is untenable; though, whether the river
                    referred to be the English Tyne, the Tweed, or the Scotch Tyne, it is impossible
                    to say. The succeeding summer found him as far north as the isthmus formed by
                    the firths of Clota and Bodotria (Clyde and Forth). On it he erected a line of
                    forts, with the intention apparently of making it the northern boundary of the
                    empire in those parts. In the following year he crossed the Clota, and overran
                    additional territory “in that part of Britain which looks towards Ireland.”
                    Information having now reached him that the remoter and still unconquered tribes
                    were forming a combination against the Romans, he resolved to anticipate them,
                    and (83 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> carried the war beyond the Bodotria into
                    the country of the Caledonians. That summer an engagement was fought, which,
                    though it resulted in favour of the invaders, taught the Romans that they had no
                    ordinary foe to cope with. On the approach of winter both sides retired to their
                    quarters to make preparations for renewing the struggle. Next season (84)
                    Agricola, on resuming the offensive, found himself confronted by a grand union
                    of all the tribes of Caledonia, under a leader whom Tacitus names Galgacus. The
                    Roman general had previously despatched a fleet to ravage the coast, and on
                    continuing his march northwards, encountered the enemy, upwards of 30,000
                    strong, near Mount Graupius; for there can be little doubt that this, the
                    reading of Wex and Kritz, ought to be adopted instead of the Grampius of the
                    common editions. The exact locality of the conflict that ensued has been the
                    theme of much profitless controversy; but we shall probably not greatly err in
                    placing it somewhere on the borders of Kincardineshire. General Roy, whose
                    conjecture is usually followed, fixed on Ardoch in Perthshire. A careful study,
                    however, of the whole narrative leads one to look for the field of battle
                    farther north, and nearer the coast. Tacitus, writing on the model of Thucydides
                    and Livy, has put into the mouth of each leader, on the eve of the engagement, a
                    speech of his own composition, in which he describes the feelings that may be
                    supposed to have actuated the hostile armies. That ascribed to Galgacus is a
                    splendid specimen of polished sarcasm, mixed with impassioned appeals to the
                    patriotism of his hearers. Might, however, prevailed over right, and the
                    Caledonians were defeated with a loss of 10,000 men. Agricola, now thinking he
                    had pushed his conquests far enough, made no attempt to pursue his beaten foe,
                    but at once led his army back to the territory of the Boresti <hi rend="italic"
                        >(cd.</hi> Horesti), whose name is probably preserved in the modern Forfar.
                    Here he gave orders to the commander of his fleet to sail round the island, a
                    feat which the latter accomplished. Soon after he himself was recalled to Rome
                    by his jealous master.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding Agricola’s success, the Romans seem to have been quickly obliged
                    to abandon part of their conquests, for in less than forty years (129 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> Hadrian’s wall, which ran from the Tyne to the
                    Solway, became the northern limits of their empire in Britain. About twenty
                    years later a second Agricola appeared in the person of Lollius Urbicus, the
                    lieutenant of Antoninus Pius. Almost nothing is known of his actions, but he
                    seems to have once more carried the arms of Rome to the Clyde and Forth, if not
                    beyond them, and to have erected on the line of Agricola’s forts the more
                    substantial work now known by the name of the emperor he served (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Antoninus, Wall of).</hi> The natives must soon have
                    recovered the lost ground; but scarcely anything is known henceforth of the
                    state of affairs in the north till 208, when, if we may trust the historian Dion
                    Cassius, as abridged by Xiphiline, the Emperor Severus determined to attempt the
                    subjugation of the whole island. At that time the two most powerful tribes of
                    North Britain were the Maeatae, close to Hadrian’s Wall, and the Caledonians
                    beyond them. Protected by their native fastnesses, the latter offered him such a
                    resistance that, without being able to bring them to a decisive engagement, he
                    lost through disease, fatigue, and the sword, no fewer, it is said, than 50,000
                    men. Having reached what is termed the northern extremity of the island, but
                    which was in all likelihood merely the northern coast of Aberdeenshire, Severus
                    retreated southwards in a very feeble state of health, partly induced by the
                    fatigues he had undergone. A league formed the next year between the Caledonians
                    and the Maeatae, both of whom had already cast off his authority, led him to
                    make preparations for a new campaign, with the avowed determination of
                    extirpating the whole race. In the midst of these, however, he died at York in
                    210.</p>
                <p>For a whole century afterwards the ancient writers are almost silent regarding
                    Caledonia. In the year 310 we hear for the first time of the Picts; and in 367
                    Theodosius, an able Roman general, was sent into Britain by Valentinian I. to
                    defend the Britons of the south against the <pb break="no"

                    by Ammianus Marcellinus as being the Picts divided into two tribes (the
                    Dicaledones and the Vecturiones), the Saxons, the Attacotti, and the Scots. He
                    was so far successful that the countries between the walls of Hadrian and
                    Antoninus became yet again a subjected province, named Valentian by Theodosius,
                    in honour of the emperor,—a conquest, however, which can have lasted but a brief
                    period. Henceforth, if we except the effusions of the poet Claudian, the scanty
                    notices of Britain to be met with during several succeeding centuries present
                    the same sad tale of sufferings inflicted on the now effeminate Britons of the
                    south by their warlike neighbours, till at length the settlement of large bodies
                    of Saxons in England changed the aspect of affairs.</p>
                <p>The etymology of the word Caledonia has been variously given. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Celydd</hi> (in Welsh, a woody shelter) is the popular derivation; but
                    Isaac Taylor <hi rend="italic">(Words and Places,</hi> p. 44) thinks the word
                    may possibly contain the root <hi rend="italic">gael,</hi> and if so, the
                    Caledonians would be the Gaels of the duns or hills. Equally obscure are the
                    ethnological relations of the people, the most probable opinion being that which
                    regards them as belonging to the British branch of the great Celtic family. A
                    casual inference, hazarded by Tacitus <hi rend="italic">(Agricola,</hi> chap,
                    xi.), that the red hair and large limbs of the inhabitants of Caledonia point
                    clearly to a German origin, must not be pressed too far. There were probably
                    even in his day Teutonic settlements along our eastern and northern shores, but
                    it seems too much to assume that that race was the dominant one north of the
                    Forth. It is a still more doubtful question to what race the Picts belonged. But
                    the discussion of these and other points belongs to the history of <hi
