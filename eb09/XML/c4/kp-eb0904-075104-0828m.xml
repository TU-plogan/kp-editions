                    before he was thirteen years of age he had mastered nearly all the Latin authors
                    presented to him. In his fifteenth year he entered the order of the Dominicans,

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0829-0752"/> the lives of /Ubertus Magnus and Aquinas, partly
                    by his intense love of learning. He was placed at first in the convent at
                    Morgentia in Abruzzo, and after completing his course of philosophy was
                    transferred to Cosenza, there to study theology. He soon became discontented
                    with his teachers, for he earnestly desired to read, not only the works of
                    Aristotle, but the book of nature, which was the language of God. An accident
                    drew his attention to the work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Rerum
                    Natura</hi> of Telesius, which he read with great eagerness. He was delighted
                    with its freedom of speech and its appeal to nature rather than to authority.
                    His first work in philosophy, for he was already the author of numerous poems,
                    was a defence of Telesius against the attacks of Marta, an Aristotelian. It was
                    styled <hi rend="italic">Piιilo-soplιιa seìisiljus demonstrata,</hi> and
                    appeared in 1591. The freedom and boldness of his attacks upon established
                    authority soon brought him into disfavour with the clergy. He left Naples, where
                    he had been residing, and proceeded to Rome For seven years he led an unsettled
                    life, wandering through Padua, Bologna, Venice and other towns, everywhere
                    attracting attention by the brilliancy of his talents and the boldness of his
                    teaching. Yet Campanella was strictly orthodox, held the established faith, and
                    was an uncompromising advocate of the Pope’s temporal power</p>
                <p>He returned to Stilo in 1598. In the following year he was arrested and committed
                    to prison. What was the immediate cause of this is not clearly known. According
                    to the most common report the motives for his imprisonment were entirely
                    political. He had joined himself to those who desired to free Naples from
                    Spanish tyranny, and had excited them by his fiery eloquence and independence of
                    spirit. His friend Naudée, however, declares that this was a complete mistake,
                    and that the expressions used by Campanella, which were interpreted as
                    revolutionary, had quite a different reference and signification. Whether from
                    error or not, the unfortunate philosopher was committed to prison, and remained
                    there for twenty-seven years, suffering much torture and misery. Yet his spirit
                    was unbroken; he composed sonnets, and prepared a series of works, forming a
                    complete system of philosophy, which were published at a later date. During the
                    latter years of his long confinement he was kept in the castle of St Elmo, and
                    was allowed considerable liberty. There seem, indeed, to have been great doubts
                    even in the minds of those who imprisoned him whether he had done anything
                    deserving such a punishment. Still he was looked upon as dangerous, and it was
                    thought better to restrain his boldness. At last, in 1626, he was set at liberty
                    For some three years he was confined in the chambers of the Inquisition, but in
                    1629 he was fairly free. He was well treated at Rome by the Pope, but he made
                    enemies; and, profiting by the lessons of experience, he thought it well to
                    avoid future danger by taking flight from Rome. He came to Paris in 1634 under
                    the protection of the French ambassador to Italy, and was received with marked
                    favour by Cardinal Richelieu The last few years of his life he spent in
                    preparing a complete edition of his works; but only the first volume appears to
                    have been published. He died on the 26th of May 1639.</p>
                <p>The philosophy of Campanella is in many respects interesting and important, but
                    it has much that is fantastic, and is wanting in unity and completeness. With
                    Telesius he agreed in rejecting the Aristotelian method of inference. According
                    to him truth or certainty is only to be found in immediate intuition. The
                    sciences are not to be constructed from definitions by deduction, but proceed by
                    induction to definition, which in the natural order comes last. The syllogism is
                    only useful for expounding; the universal rule which it involves is always a
                    result of induction, and the particular subsumed under it is itself part of the
                    induction. Our knowledge begins in doubt. We know neither the past nor the
                    future; even in the present we only know things as they appear to be, not as
                    they are. The first proposition in a theory of cognition is that I myself think;
                    the certainty of self-consciousness is the primary truth.</p>
                <p>With all this freedom of philosophizing Campanella preserved a completely
                    orthodox respect for revealed religion; he aimed indeed at a system which should
                    embrace in one comprehensive scheme religious and philosophical principles. His
                    view of God is not far removed from that of Bruno; he lays stress upon the
                    divine unity and omnipresence, and as he is convinced that community of action
                    is only possible where there is identity of being, he is driven to an apparently
                    pantheistic conclusion. God is the ultimate unit; His three manifestations may
                    be called power, wisdom, and love. He alone has pure being; all other things
                    created by or emanating from Him are limited, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> have
                    non-being. All things are of the same nature, otherwise there could be no mutual
                    action; there is a universally diffused life and sensibility.</p>
                <p>In his natural philosophy Campanella mainly follows Telesius, and lays dυwn as
                    fundamental forces heat and cold, in their concrete form, sun and earth. By
                    these all things are formed. The soul of man is in nature corporeal, but is
                    immortal, being endowed with a striving after happiness never attained in this
                    life.</p>
                <p>In practical philosophy Campanella was an extreme reformer. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Civitas</hi><hi rend="italic">Solis</hi> he sketches an ideal
                    state, in which principles of communism are fully carried out. He contends for a
                    community of goods and wives, for state control of population, and for a
                    universal military training. The kingin his ideal state is called Hoh, f.e.,
                    Metaphysics; his ministers have names meaning respectively Power, Wisdom, and
                    Might. The whole work is cold and abstract, utterly wanting in the rich
                    practical detail of its prototype, the <hi rend="italic">Utopia.</hi></p>
