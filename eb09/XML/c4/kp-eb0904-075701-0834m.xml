                    Cupar. For a few years young Campbell studied at the United College, St Andrews,
                    where he met Thomas Chalmers. In 1800 he was entered as a student at Lincoln’s
                    Inn, and became a pupil of the well-known special pleader Mr Warren, the master
                    of Lyndhurst, Denman, and Cottenham. A few days after his entrance, as he
                    records in his <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Chancellors,</hi> he saw and heard
                    Lord Thurlow speak in the House of Lords. After a short connection with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> he was called to the bar in 1826, and at
                    once began to report cases decided at <hi rend="italic">Nisi Prius (i.e,,</hi>
                    on Jury Trial), in the courts of King’s Bench and Common Pleas, and on the home
                    circuit. Of these <hi rend="italic">Reports</hi> he published altogether four
                    volumes, with learned notes; they extend from Michaelmas 1807 to Hilary 1816.
                    Campbell also devoted himself a good deal to criminal business, but in spite of
                    his unceasing industry he failed to attract much attention behind the bar;
                    briefs came in slowly, and it was not till 1827 that he obtained a silk gown and
                    found himself in that “front rank” who are permitted to have political
                    aspirations. When George IV. died (26th June 1830) and Parliament was dissolved
                    (24th July), Campbell, like all the new Whig men of the day, resolved to enter
                    Lord Grey’s Parliament. With the help of his relative Major Scarlett he
                    contested the borough of Stafford, which he represented in 1830 and 1831. In the
                    House he showed an extraordinary, sometimes an excessive zeal for public
                    business, speaking on all subjects with practical sense, but on none with
                    eloquence or spirit. His main object, however, like that of Brougham, was the
                    amelioration of the law, more by the abolition of cumbrous technicalities than
                    by the assertion of new and striking principles. Thus his name is associated
                    with the Fines and Recoveries Abolition Act (3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 74); the Law
                    of Descent Act (3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 106); the Law of Dower Act (3 and 4 Will.
                    IV. c. 105); the Statute of Limitations (3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 27); the Execution
                    of Wills of Real or Personal Property Act (1 Vict. c. 26); one of the Copyhold
                    Tenure Acts (4 and 5 Vict. c. 25); and the Imprisonment for Debt Act (1 and 2
                    Vict. c. 110). All these measures were important and were carefully drawn; but
                    their merits cannot be explained in a biographical notice. The second was called
                    for by the preference which the common law gave to a distant collateral over the
                    brother of the half-blood of the first purchaser; the fourth conferred an
                    indefeasible title on adverse possession for twenty years (a term shortened by
                    Lord Cairns in 1875 to twelve years); the fifth reduced the number of witnesses
                    required by law to attest wills, and removed the vexatious distinction which
                    existed in this respect between freeholds and copyholds; the last freed an
                    innocent debtor from imprisonment only before final judgment (or on what was
                    termed <hi rend="italic">mesne</hi> process), but the principle stated by
                    Campbell that only fraudulent debtors should be imprisoned was ultimately given
                    effect to for England and Wales in 1869.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of Deeds or Titles to Land for England and Wales, which would diminish the
                    number of unmarketable and unsafe titles, and thus simplify and cheapen the
                    transfer of land. As head of the Real Property Commission of 1827, he had ample
                    opportunity of observing the evils caused by the absurd system of outstanding
                    terms,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A terminable

                    was able to quote the example of most European countries, where compulsory
                    publication had been found neither to hurt commercial credit nor to wound family
                    pride. The measure of 1830 was defeated by the country attorneys, led by Sir
                    Chas. Wetherell, but the principle has rapidly gained ground and has been
                    partially embodied in the Land Transfer Bills of subsequent reformers.
                    Campbell’s most important appearance as member for Stafford was in defence of
                    Lord John Russell’s first Reform Bill (1831). In a temperate and learned speech,
                    based on Fox’s declaration against constitution-mongering, he supported both the
                    enfranchising and the disfranchising clauses, and easily disposed of the cries
                    of “corporation robbery,” “nabob representation,” “opening for young men of
                    talent,” &amp;c. The following year (1832) found Campbell solicitor-general, a
                    knight, and member for Dudley, which he represented till 1834. In that year he
                    became attorney-general and was returned by Edinburgh, for which he sat till
                    1841.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>If we may trust

                    immediately violated by claiming the vice-chancellorship on the death of Sir
                    John Leach. Pepys (Lord Cottenham) and Bickersteth (Lord Langdale) were both
                    promoted to the bench in preference to Campbell.</p></note></p>
                <p>His political creed declared upon the hustings there was that of a moderate Whig.
                    He maintained the connection of church and state, opposed triennial parliaments
                    and the ballot, and railed against the dictatorship of the great duke (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Speech</hi> at Edinburgh, 3d January 1835, 8vo, London, 1835),
                    Although in his relations with his constituents in both England and Scotland
                    there was traceable an unpleasant spirit of accommodation and cajolery, in
                    Parliament his position, both political and religious, was always well defined
                    and independent. There he continued to lend the most effective help to the
                    Liberal party. His speech in 1835 in support of the motion for inquiry into the
                    Irish Church Temporalities with a view to their partial appropriation for
                    national purposes (for disestablishment was not then dreamed of as possible)
                    contains much terse argument, and no doubt contributed to the fall of Peel and
                    the formation of the Melbourne cabinet. The next year Campbell had a fierce
                    encounter with Lord Stanley in the debate which followed the motion of Mr Spring
                    Rice on the repair and maintenance of parochial churches and chapels. The legal
                    point in the dispute (which Campbell afterwards made the subject of a separate
                    pamphlet) was whether the churchwardens of the parish, in the absence of the
                    vestry, had any means of enforcing a rate except the antiquated interdict or
                    ecclesiastical censure It was not on legal technicalities, however, but on the
                    broad principle of religious equality, that Campbell supported the abolition of
                    Church Rates, in which he included the Edinburgh Annuity-Tax. In the same year
                    he spoke for Lord Melbourne in the action (thought by some to be a political
                    conspiracy<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“There can be
                    no doubt that old Wynton was at the bottom of it all, and persuaded Lord
                    Grantley to urge it on for mere political purposes.’—Greville, iii.
                    351.</p></note>) which was brought by Mr Norton against the Whig premier for
                    criminal conversation with the beautiful and accomplished grand-daughter of
                    Sheridan. At this time also he exerted himself for the reform of justice in the
                    ecclesiastical courts, for the uniformity of the law of marriage (which he held
                    should be a purely civil contract), and for giving prisoners charged with felony
                    the benefit <hi rend="italic">of</hi> counsel. His defence of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, which had accused Sir John Conroy, equerry
                    to the duchess of Kent, of misappropriation of money (1838), is chiefly
                    remarkable for the confession—“I despair of any definition of libel which shall
                    exclude no publications which ought to be suppressed, and include none which
                    ought to be permitted.” His own definition of blasphemous libel was enforced in
                    the prosecution which, as attorney-general, he raised against the bookseller
                    Hetherington, and which he justified on the singular ground that “the vast bulk
                    of the population believe that morality depends entirely on revelation; and if a
                    doubt could be raised among them that the Tθn Commandments were given by God
                    from Mount Sinai, men would think they were at liberty to steal, and women would
                    consider themselves absolved from the restraints of chastity.” But his most
                    distinguished effort at the bar was undoubtedly the speech for the House of
                    Commons in the famous case of Stockdale <hi rend="italic">υ.</hi> Hansard. The
                    Commons had ordered to be printed, among other papers, a Report of the
                    Inspectors of Prisons on Newgate, which stated that an obscene book, published
                    by Stockdale, was given to the prisoners to read. Stockdale sued the Commons’
                    publisher, and was met by the plea of parliamentary privilege, to which,
                    however, the judges did not give effect, on the ground that they were entitled
                    to define the privileges of the Commons, and that publication of papers was not
                    essential to the functions of Parliament. The matter was settled by the Act 3
                    Vict. c. 9.</p>
                <p>In 1840 Campbell conducted the prosecution against John Frost, one of the three
                    Chartist leaders who attacked the town of Newport, all of whom were found guilty
                    of high treason. We may also mention, as matter of historical interest, the case
                    before the High Steward and the House of Lords which arose out of the duel
                    fought on Wimbledon Common between the earl of Cardigan and Captain Harvey
                    Tuckett. The law of course was clear that the “punctilio which swordsmen falsely
                    do call honour” was no excuse for wilful murder. To the astonishment of
                    everybody Lord Cardigan escaped from a capital charge of felony because the full
                    name of his antagonist (Harvey Garnett Phipps Tuckett) was not legally proved.
                    It is difficult to suppose that such a blunder was not preconcerted. Campbell
                    himself made the extraordinary declaration that to engage in a duel which could
                    not be declined without infamy <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> social disgrace)
                    was “an act free from moral turpitude,” although the law properly held it to be
                    wilful murder. Next year, as the Melbourne administration was near its close,
                    Plunkett, the venerable chancellor of Ireland, was forced by discreditable
                    pressure to resign, and the Whig attorney-general, who had never practised in
                    Equity, became chancellor of Ireland, and was raised to the peerage with the
                    title of Baron Campbell of St Andrews, in the county of Fife. His wife, Mary
                    Elizabeth Campbell, the eldest daughter of the first Baron Abinger by one of the
                    Campbells of Kilmorey, Argyllshire, whom he had married in 1821, had in 1836
                    been created Baroness Stratheden. The post of chancellor Campbell held for only
                    sixteen days, and then resigned it to his successor Sir Edward Sugden (Lord St
                    Leonards). It was during the period 1841-49, when he had no legal duty, except
                    the self-imposed one of occasionally hearing Scotch appeals in the House of
                    Lords, that the unlucky dream of literary fame troubled Lord Campbell’s

                    Intended to evolve a history of jurisprudence from the truthful portraits of
                    England’s greatest lawyers, it merely exhibits the ill-digested results of
                    desultory learning, without a trace of scientific symmetry or literary taste,
                    without a spark of that divine imaginative sympathy which alone can give flesh
                    and spirit to the dead bones of the past, and without which the present becomes
                    an unintelligible maze of mean and selfish ideas. A charming style, a vivid
                    fancy, exhaustive research, were not to be expected from a hard-worked
                    barrister; but he must certainly be held responsible for the frequent
                    plagiarisms, the still more frequent inaccuracies of detail, the colossal vanity
                    which obtrudes on almost every page, the hasty insinuations against the memory
                    of the great departed who were to him as giants, and the petty sneers which he
                    condescends to print against his own contemporaries, with whom he was living
                    from day to day on terms of apparently sincere friendship. These faults are not
                    so glaring in the lives of such men as Somers and Hardwicke, whom distance in
                    time makes safe from personal jealousy; they are painfully apparent in the lives
                    of Eldon, Lyndhurst, and Brougham, and they have been pointed out by the
                    biographers of Eldon and by Lord St Leonards.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was of this book that Sir Charles

                    less than ten protests by Campbell, entered in the years 1842-45. He protests
                    against Peel’s Income Tax Bill of 1842; against the Aberdeen Act (6 and 7 Vict.
                    c. 61) as conferring undue power on church courts; against the perpetuation of
                    diocesan courts for probate and administration; against Lord Stanley’s absurd
                    bill providing compensation for the destruction of fences to dispossessed Irish
                    tenants; and against the Parliamentary Proceedings Bill, which proposed that all
                    "bills, except money bills, having reached a certain stage, or having passed one
                    House, should be continued to next session. The last he opposed because the
                    proper remedy lay in resolutions and orders of the House. He protests in favour
                    of Lord Monteagle’s (Mr Spring Rice) motion for inquiry into the sliding scale
                    of corn duties under 5 Vict. c. 14; of Lord Normanby’s motion on the Queen’s

                    not be convicted of bigamy, because the English law required for the validity of

                <p>On the resignation of Lord Denman in 1850, Campbell was appointed Chief Justice
                    of the Queen’s Bench. For this post he was well fitted by his knowledge of
                    common law, his habitual attention to the pleadings in court, and his power of
                    clear statement. On the other hand, at <hi rend="italic">Nisi Prius</hi> and on
                    the criminal circuit, he was accused of frequently attempting unduly to
                    influence juries in their estimate of the credibility of evidence. It is also
                    certain that he liked to excite applause in the galleries by some platitude
                    about the “glorious Revolution” or the “Protestant succession.”<note

                    reforms of special pleading at Westminster, and had a recognized place with
                    Brougham and Lyndhurst in legal discussions in the House of Lords. But he had
                    neither the generous temperament nor the breadth of view which is required in
                    the composition of even a mediocre statesman. In 1859 he was made Lord
                    Chancellor of Great Britain, probably on the understanding that Bethell should
                    succeed as soon as he could be spared from the House of Commons. His short
                    tenure of this office calls for no remark. In the same year he published in the
                    form of a letter to Mr Payne Collier an amusing and extremely‘inconclusive essay
                    on Shakespeare’s legal acquirements. One passage will show the conjectural
                    process which runs through the book: “If Shakespeare was really articled to a
                    Stratford attorney, in all probability, during the five years of his clerkship,
                    he visited London several times on his master’s business, and he may then have
                    been introduced to the green-room at Blackfriars by one of his countrymen
                    connected with that theatre.” The only positive piece of evidence produced is
                    the passage from Thomas Nash’s “Epistle to the Gentlemen of the Two
                    Universities,” prefixed to Greene’s <hi rend="italic">Arcadia,</hi> 1859, in
                    which he upbraids somebody (not known to be Shakespeare) with having left the
                    “trade of Noverint” and busied himself with “whole Hamlets” and “handfuls of
                    tragical speeches.” The knowledge of law shown in the plays is very much what a
                    universal observer must have picked up. Lawyers always underestimate the legal
                    knowledge of an intelligent layman. Campbell died on the 23d June 1861. It has
                    been well said of him in explanation of his success, that he lived eighty years
                    and preserved his digestion unimpaired. He had a hard head, a splendid
                    constitution, tireless industry, a generally judicious temper. He was a learned,
                    though not a scientific lawyer, a faithful political adherent, thoroughly honest
                    as a judge, dutiful and happy as a husband. But there was nothing admirable or
                    heroic in his nature. On no great subject did his principles rise above the
                    commonplace of party, nor had he the magnanimity which excuses rather than
                    aggravates the faults of others. His life is the triumph of steady determination
                    unaided by a single brilliant or attractive quality. (w. ç. s.)</p>
