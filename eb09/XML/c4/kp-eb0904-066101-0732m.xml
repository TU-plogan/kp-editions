                    resolute opposition to the introduction of Episcopacy. In 1617, while James was
                    in Scotland, a Remonstrance which had been drawn up by the Presbyterian clergy
                    was placed in Calderwood’s hands. He was summoned to St Andrews and examined
                    before the king, but neither threats nor promises could make him yield, and
                    deliver up the roll of signatures to the Remonstrance. He was deprived of his
                    charge, committed to prison at St Andrews, and afterwards removed to Edinburgh.
                    The privy council, which long exercised an undefined and despotic jurisdiction,
                    ordained him to be banished from the kingdom for refusing to <pb break="no"

                    On giving security to banish himself from the kingdom before the ensuing
                    Michaelmas, and not to return without the royal licence, he was released from
                    prison. He accompanied Lord Cranstoun to Carlisle, where that nobleman presented
                    a petition in his favour to the king; but it was followed by no beneficial
                    result. The subsequent application of Lord Cranstouu to the privy-council, and
                    to the bishops, was attended with no better success. He lingered in Scotland,
                    publishing a few tracts, till the 27th of August 1619, when he sailed for
                    Holland. Where he chiefly resided in that country we are not informed, but
                    Bishop Guthry states, that “in the time of his exile he had seen the wild
                    follies of the English Brownists in Arnheim and Amsterdam.” During his residence
                    in Holland he published various works, and, among the rest, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Altare Damascenum.</hi> At one period his enemies supposed him to
                    be dead; and he has recorded a very extraordinary attempt to impose upon the
                    world a recantation fabricated in his name. Calderwood appears to have returned
                    to Scotland in 1624, and he was soon afterwards appointed minister of
                    Pencaitland, in the county of Haddington. During the remainder of his life he
                    continued to take an active part in the affairs of the church, and he introduced
                    in 1649 the practice, now confirmed by long usage, of dissenting from the
                    decision of the Assembly, and requiring the protest to be entered in the record.
                    His last years were devoted to the preparation of a <hi rend="italic">History of
                    the Church of Scotland.</hi> In 1648 the General Assembly urged him to complete
                    the work he had designed, and voted him a yearly pension of £800. He left behind
                    him an historical work of great extent and of great value, not indeed as a
                    masterly composition, but as a storehouse of authentic materials for history. An
                    abridgment, which appears to have been prepared by himself, was published after
                    his death. An excellent edition of the complete work was published by the Wodrow
                    Society, 8 vols. 1842-49. The manuscript, which belonged to General Calderwood
                    Durham, was presented to the British Museum. A copy, transcribed under the
                    inspection of Wodrow, is among the archives of the church; another belongs to
                    the library of the university of Glasgow; and, as Dr M’Crie has stated, “in the
                    Advocates’ Library, besides a complete copy of that work, there is a folio
                    volume of it, reaching to the end of the year 1572. It was written in 1634, and
                    has a number of interlineations and marginal alterations, differing from the
                    other copies, which, if not made by the author’s own hand, were most probably
                    done under his eye.” Calderwood died at Jedburgh on the 29th of October 1650,
                    aged seventy-five. He appears to have been a man of unbending integrity,
                    fearless in maintaining his opinions, and uniformly consistent in his
                    professions; but as human virtues are never perfect, his decision of character
                    had some tendency to deviate into that obstinacy from which good men are not
                    always exempted.</p>
