                    weeks after his birth, the widow and family removed to Glasgow, where young
                    Candlish was brought up and educated. In 1818 he entered the University of
                    Glasgow, and after a curriculum of five sessions, during which he carried off
                    many honours, he duly graduated Μ. A. Entering immediately on his professional
                    studies, he passed during the years 1823-26 through the prescribed course at the
                    divinity hall, then presided over by Dr Stevenson MacGill. While carrying on his
                    studies he had been largely occupied, according to the common Scotch practice,
                    with private teaching, and on leaving the divinity hall he accompanied a pupil
                    as private tutor to Eton. On the termination of this engagement in 1829, he
                    entered upon his own proper work, having been licensed to preach during the
                    summer vacation of the previous year. He was employed for two years as assistant
                    to the minister of the parish of St Andrews, Glasgow, and he subsequently
                    occupied a similar situation for about the same period in the parish of Bonhill,
                    Dumbartonshire. In each case the entire duties of the charge devolved upon him,
                    and he fulfilled them with characteristic energy and zeal. It was not until
                    1834, after he had offered himself for service in Canada, in the belief that he
                    was not to find a sphere of labour at home, that he obtained a settled charge as
                    minister of the important parish of St George’s, Edinburgh. Here he at once took
                    the place he so long held as one of the ablest preachers in Scotland. Destitute
                    of natural oratorical gifts, and somewhat ungainly in his manner, he attracted
                    and even rivetted the attention of his audience by a rare combination of
                    intellectual keenness, emotional fervour, spiritual insight, and power of
                    dramatic representation of character and life. His theology was that of the
                    Scottish Calvinistic school, but he combined with the narrowness that springs
                    from strong conviction the breadth that springs from tender sympathy. With such
                    qualities it was natural that he should gather round him one of the largest and
                    most intelligent congregations in the Scottish metropolis.</p>
                <p>From the very commencement of his ministry in Edinburgh, Candlish took the
                    deepest interest in ecclesiastical<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0888-0805"/> questions, and he soon became involved as one of
                    the chief actors in the struggle which was then agitating the church. His first
                    Assembly speech, delivered in 1839, placed him at once among the leaders of the
                    party that afterwards formed the Free Church, and his influence in bringing
                    about what is known as the Disruption was inferior only to that of Chalmers. As
                    a debater he had powers of the highest order, which would have won for him a
                    foremost place in any deliberative assembly. Great as was his popularity as a
                    preacher, it was in the ecclesiastical arena that his ability chiefly showed
                    itself, and probably no other single man had from first to last so large a share
                    in shaping the constitution and guiding the policy of the Free Church. He was
                    actively engaged at one time or other in ^nearly all the various schemes of the
                    church, but speciaí mention should be made of his services in the Education
                    Committee, of which he was convener from 1846 to 1863, and in the unsuccessful
                    negotiations for union among the non-established Presbyterian denominations of
                    Scotland, which were carried on during the years 1863-73. In the Assembly of
                    1861 he filled the moderator’s chair.</p>
                <p>As a theologian the position of Candlish was perhaps inferior to that which he
                    held as a preacher and ecclesiastic, but it was not inconsiderable. So early as
                    1841 his reputation in this department was sufficient to secure for him the
                    nomination to the newly-founded chair of Biblical Criticism in the University of
                    Edinburgh. The appointment was, however, not ratified by the Home Secretary in
                    consequence of a representation made in the House of Lords, by the earl of
                    Aberdeen, that Candlish had set himself in opposition to the law of the land by
                    preaching in the parish of Huntly in spite of an interdict from the Court of
                    Session. By a somewhat curious coincidence a second appointment to a
                    professorship was also nullified, though in this case by his own act, and after
                    a few months’ tenure of the office. In 1847 Candlish, who had received the
                    degree of D.D. from Princeton, New Jersey, in 1841, was chosen by the Assembly
                    of the Free Church to succeed Chalmers in the chair of divinity iu the New
                    College, Edinburgh. After partially fulfilling the duties of the office for one
                    session, he was led to resume the charge of St George’s, the clergyman who had
                    been chosen by the congregation as his successor having died before entering on
                    his work. In 1862 he was again connected with the New College, being appointed
                    principal in succession to Cunningham, with the understanding that he should
                    still retain his position as minister of St George’s. Some months before this he
                    had obtained the assistance of a colleague in his pastoral work,but he continued
                    to preach, with one or two intervals of somewhat protracted illness, until
                    within a short time of his death, which occurred on the 19th October 1873.</p>
                <p>Though his greatest power was not displayed through the press, Candlish made a
                    number of somewhat important contributions to theological literature. In 1842 he
                    published the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Contributions towards ths
                    Exposition of ihs Book of Genesis,</hi> a work which was completed in three
                    volumes several years later. In 1854 he delivered, in Exeter Hall, London, a
                    lfecture on the <hi rend="italic">Theological Essays</hi> of the Rev. F. D.
                    Maurice, which he afterwards published, along with a fuller examination of the
                    doctrine of the essays. A treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    Atonement</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">its Reality,
                    Completeness, and Extent</hi> (1861) was based upon a smaller work which first
                    appeared in 1845. In 1864 he delivered the first series of Cunningham lectures,
                    taking for his subject <hi rend="italic">The Fatherhood of God.</hi> Published
                    immediately afterwards, the lectures excited considerable discussion on account
                    of the peculiar views they represented. Further illustrations of these views
                    were given in two works published about the same time as the lectures, one a
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">On ths Sonship and Brotherhood of Believers,</hi> and
                    the other an exposition of the first epistle of St John. Among his other works
                    were <hi rend="italic">Life in a Risen Saviour</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Scripture Characters</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Reason and Revelation;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Christian’s Sacrifice and
                    Service of Praise.</hi> A posthumous volume of sermons with a short prefatory
                    biographical sketch appeared in 1874.</p>
