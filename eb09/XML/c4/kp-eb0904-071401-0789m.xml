                <p><label type="entry">CALVIN</label> ’, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi> (1509-1564),
                    was born at Noyon, in Picardy, July 10,1509. His father, Qerard Calvin or
                    Cauvin,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The family name
                    of Calvin seems to have been written indifferently Cauvin, Chaαve, Chauvin,
                    Calvus, Calvinus. In the contemporary notices of Gerard and his family, in the
                    capitular registers of the cathedral at Noyon, the name is always spelt Cauuin.
                    The anagram of Calvin is Alcuin, and this in its Latinized form Alcuinus appears
                    in two editions of his <hi rend="italic">Institutio</hi> as that of the author
                    (Audin, <hi rend="italic">Vie de Calvin,</hi> i. 520). The syndics of Geneva
                    address him in a letter written in 1540, and still preserved, as “Docteur
                    Caulvin.” In his letters written in French he usually signs himself “Jean
                    Calvin.” He affected the title of “Maître,” for what reason is not
                    known.</p></note> was a notary-apostolic and procurator-fiscal for the lordship
                    of Noyon, besides holding certain ecclesiastical offices in connection with that
                    diocese. The name of his mother was Jeanne Lefranc; she was the daughter of an
                    innkeeper at Cambray, who afterwards came to reside at Noyon. Gerard Calvin is
                    described as a man of considerable sagacity and prudence, and on this account
                    held in esteem by the leading men of the district. His wife added to
                    considerable personal attractions the graces of a vivid and earnest piety. Their
                    family consisted of four sons, of whom John was the second, and two
                    daughters.</p>
                <p>Of Calvin’s early years only a few notices remain. His father destined him from
                    the first for theological studies, being moved to this by the evidences afforded
                    in his boyhood of a religious tendency, and perhaps also by a shrewd
                    apprehension of the kind of pursuits in v⅛ich he was most fitted to excel. The
                    esteem in which the father was held opened for the boy a place in the household
                    of the noble family of De Montmor, where he received his elementary education
                    along with the children of the house, though at his father’s expense. In his
                    thirteenth year his father, whose circumstances were not affluent, procured for
                    him from the bishop the office of chaplain in the Chapelle de Nôtre Dame de la
                    Gesine. A few days after his appoint-menthe received the tonsure, and on the
                    29th of May 1521 he was installed in his office. The plague having visited
                    Noyon, the young De Montmors were sent to Paris to pursue their studies there,
                    and thither Calvin accompanied them, being enabled by the income received from
                    his benefice to meet the expense of a residence in the metropolis. His first
                    school was the Collège de la Marche, at that time under the regency of Maturin
                    Cordier, a man of excellent character, of sound learning, and of high repute as
                    a teacher. To him Calvin ever acknowledged himself indebted for the benefits
                    received under his tuition. In dedicating to him his Commentary on the First
                    Epistle to the Thessalonians, as “eximiae pietatis et doctrinae viro,” he
                    declares that so had he been aided by his instruction that whatever subsequent
                    progress he had made he only regarded as received from him, and “this,” he
                    adds,“I wish to testify to posterity that if any utility accrue to any from my
                    writings they may acknowledge it as having in part flowed from thee.” From this
                    institution he removed to the Collège Montaigu, where he had for instructor a
                    Spaniard, who is described as a man of learning, and to whom Calvin was indebted
                    for the culture of his already acute intellect, by the study of dialectics and
                    the scholastic philosophy. Whilst at school the future reformer distinguished
                    himself by his superior abilities, and his indefatigable assiduity. He speedily
                    outstripped all his competitors in grammatical studies, and by his skill and
                    acumen as a student of philosophy, gave fruitful promise of that consummate
                    excellence as a reasoner, in the department of speculative truth, which he
                    afterwards displayed. Intensely devoted to study he cared little for the
                    pastimes in which his fellow scholars indulged; he shunned society, and was more
                    disposed to censure the frivolities of those around him than to seek the solace
                    of theiι∙ companionship; severe to others he was still more so to himself, and
                    his pale face and attenuated frame bore witness at once to the rigour of his
                    abstinence and the ardour with which he prosecuted his studies. In his
                    nineteenth year he, through the influence of his father, obtained the living of
                    Marteville, to which he was presented on the 27th of September 1527. After
                    holding this preferment for nearly two years, he exchanged it in July 1529 for
                    the cure of Pont 1’Evêque, a village near to Noyon, and the place to which his
                    father originally belonged. He appears to have been not a little elated by his
                    early promotion, and although not ordained, he preached several sermons to the
                    people. But though the career of ecclesiastical preferment was thus early opened
                    to him, Calvin was destined not to become a priest of the Church of Rome. A
                    change came over the mind both of his father and himself respecting his future
                    career. Gerard Calvin, looking at things only from a worldly point of view,
                    began to suspect that he had not chosen the most lucrative profession for his
                    son, and that the law offered to a youth of his talents and industry a more
                    promising sphere.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Calv.,
                    <hi rend="italic">Pvoef. ad Comment, in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Psalmos.</hi></p></note> His son, on the other hand, had come under an
                    influence of a very different kind, but which, with still more decisive impulse,
                    inclined him to relinquish the ecclesiastical life, Through the counsels of his
                    relation, Pierre Robert Olivetan, the first translator of the Bible into French,
                    he had been led for the first time to study the sacred volume, and to test his
                    religious opinions and practices by its dictates. The result was that, though
                    not yet detached from the faith of the Romish church, he was very willing to
                    relinquish all thoughts of becoming a priest in that communion. He accordingly
                    readily complied with his father’s suggestion; and having resigned his cure, he
                    removed from Paris to Orleans, in order to study law under Pierre de I’Etoile, a
                    distinguished jurisconsult, and at that time professor there. On this new
                    pursuit Galvin entered with characteristic ardour, and such was his progress in
                    legal knowledge, that he frequently occupied the chair of the professor, while
                    his general reputation for ability and scholarship stood so high that, on
                    leaving Orleans, he received the grade of doctor without payment of the usual
                    fees, as a compliment to his merits. Other studies, however, besides those of
                    law had occupied him whilst in this city, God, who had destined him for a very
                    different career, was in His providence preparing him for the work he had to do.
                    His mind, at first hardened by the influence of early superstition, was, he
                    himself tells us, brought by sudden conversion into a state of docility.<note

                    ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Psalmos.</hi></p></note> An ardent desire to attain
                    proficiency in sacred knowledge took possession of him, and though this did not
                    lead him to renounce other studies, it rendered him frigid in the pursuit of
                    them. At all times, indeed, a diligent student, he seems at this time to have
                    been impelled by his zeal beyond those bounds which a wise regard to health
                    would impose. It was his wont, after a frugal supper, to labour till midnight,
                    and in the morning when he awoke, he would, before he arose, recall and digest
                    what he had read the previous day, so as to make it thoroughly his own. “By
                    these protracted vigils,” says Beza, “he secured indeed a solid erudition, and
                    an excellent memory; but it is probable he at the same time sowed the seeds of
                    that disease which occasioned him various illnesses in after life, and at last
                    brought upon him premature death.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>From Orleans Calvin went to Bourges to prosecute his studies under a learned
                    Italian of the name of Alciati, whom Francis I. had invited into France, and
                    settled as a professor of law in that university. Here he became acquainted with
                    Melchior Volmar, a German, then professor of Greek at Bourges, and a man of
                    sound erudition <pb break="no"

                    taught Greek, and introduced to the study of the New Testament in its original
                    language, a service which he gratefully acknowledges in one of his printed
                    works.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">pτcefix.</hi></p></note> The conversation of Volmar also seems to
                    have been of use to him in deepening his religious convictions, and confirming
                    him in his attachment to the doctrines of the Reformation. These were now
                    beginning to be widely diffused through France. Twelve years had elapsed since
                    Luther had published his theses against indulgences,—twelve years of intense
                    excitement and anxious discussion, not in Germany only, but in almost all the
                    adjacent kingdoms In France there had not been as yet any overt revolt against
                    the Church of Rome, but multitudes were lending a friendly ear to the Reformed
                    doctrines, and a few were in secret rejoicing in having heartily embraced them
                    To such Calvin united himself whilst at Orleans, and after his removal to
                    Bourges he became a teacher, both in private conference with inquirers and by
                    discourses in more public assemblies. “Before a year had elapsed,” says he,
                    speaking of his conversion, “all who were desirous of a purer doctrine were in
                    the habit of coming to me, though a novice and a tyro, for the purpose of
                    learning.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Praef. ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Psalmos.</hi></p></note> And Beza
                    tells us that he not only fortified the few believers who were in the town, but
                    preached often in some of the neighbouring mansions and hamlets, whereby he
                    wonderfully advanced the kingdom of God in many families, among which he
                    specifies that of the lord of Ligniéres, who with his lady heard with approval
                    the new doctrines.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    engaging in such efforts, Calvin appears to have yielded to a constraining sense
                    of duty rather than to have followed the bias of his own inclinations. “By
                    nature,” says he, “somewhat clownish <hi rend="italic">(subrusticus),</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> always preferred the shade and ease, and would have sought
                    some hiding-place;. but this was not permitted, for all my retreats became like
                    public schools.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Preef. ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Psalmos.</hi></p></note> Nor did
                    he infuse any of the enthusiasm which usually mark’s the young reformer into his
                    addresses. “He taught the truth,” says Beza, “not with affected eloquence, but
                    with such depth of knowledge and so much solid gravity of style, that there was
                    not a man who could hear him without being ravished with admiration.”<note

                <p>His residence at Bourges was cut short by the sudden death of his father, which
                    occasioned his return to his native place. Immediately after his father’s
                    decease, he seems to have paid a hasty visit to Paris, and then to have returned
                    to Noyon, where he resided for a couple of years or so. At the close of this
                    period he appears to have returned to Paris, where he apparently resided from
                    1529 to 1532, as letters written by him are dated from Paris in these years.
                    While there he lodged with a tradesman, Etienne de la Forge, who early fell a
                    victim to his zeal for the Reformation, and “whose memory,” Calvin says, “should
                    be blessed among believers as a holy martyr for Christ.”<note anchored="true"

                    house the friends of evangelical truth were wont to meet, and Calvin not only
                    associated with them, but frequently preached in their assemblies. To the great
                    joy of all such, he at length entirely relinquished his legal pursuits and
                    devoted himself afresh to theology, —giving himself up wholly to the work,
                    preaching with great energy, and using all the means in his power to win
                    converts to the truth, as well as to confirm those by whom it had been already
                    embraced. By this time the Reformation had attracted so many adherents in
                    France, that the upholders of the established system became infuriated, and
                    attempted to stay its further progress by the most cruel persecutions. It was
                    whilst these were raging that Calvin issued his first publication, an edition of
                    Seneca’s tract <hi rend="italic">De dementia,</hi> with an elaborate commentary.
                    This book he published at his own cost, and dedicated to Claude Hangest, abbot
                    of St Eloi, a member of the De Montmor family, with whom Calvin had been brought
                    up. The commentary, which is written in that pure and terse Latinity which
                    characterizes all Calvin’s works composed in the language of ancient Rome,
                    displays extensive acquaintance with ancient literature, though the author has
                    fallen into the extraordinary mistake of running the two Senecas, father and
                    son, into one, and making the philosopher die 115 years old. It has been
                    suggested that Calvin published this work with a view to influence the king to
                    put a stop to the persecution of the Protestants, but there is nothing in the
                    treatise itself or in the commentary to favour this opinion.</p>
                <p>This work was published in April 1532, and seems to have brought Calvin more of
                    honour than of profit. It appears, indeed, that he had some difficulty in paying
                    the cost of its publication; and it is probable that it was partly in order to
                    meet this that he sold at this time the slender patrimony which his father had
                    left him. He at this time also relinquished the ecclesiastical preferments which
                    he had hitherto continued to hold, an act which, though demanded by the change
                    that had taken place in his religious views, was entirely voluntary on his part,
                    and, when viewed in connection with his then straitened circumstances, must be
                    put to the credit of his integrity and disinterestedness. He was now in his
                    twenty-fourth year, and was already recognized as at the head of the Reformation
                    movement in France. An occasion soon occurred which brought him into open
                    collision with the dominant party. Nicholas Cop, the newly-elected regent of the
                    Sorbonne, had to deliver an oration according to custom in the Church of the
                    Maturins, on the feast of All Saints. Being intimate with Calvin, he pronounced
                    an oration which the latter had prepared for him, “of a totally different sort,”
                    says Beza, “from what was customary.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Hist. Eccleβ.,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    9,</p></note> It was, in fact, a defence of the Reformed opinions, especially of
                    the doctrine of justification by faith alone. This was more than the Sorbonnists
                    could bear, and Cop, being summoned to appear before the parliament, found it
                    necessary to make his escape from Paris to Basel. An attempt was at the same
                    time made to seize Calvin, but being forewarned of the design by his friends, he
                    also made his escape. His lodgings, however, were searched, and his books and
                    papers seized, to the imminent peril of some of his friends, whose letters were
                    found in his repositories. He himself retired first to the castle of Lord de
                    Hazeville near Mantes, and after that to Saintonge, where he was the guest of
                    Louis du Tillet, a canon of Angoulême, and where at the request of his host he
                    prepared some short discourses, which were circulated in the surrounding
                    parishes, and read in public to the people. He subsequently removed to Nerac,
                    the residence of the queen of Navarre, the only sister of Francis I., who then
                    favoured the Reformers, and through whose intercession the storm that had broken
                    out against them was for the time abated. Here he became acquainted with the
                    venerable Jacques Lefevre d’ Estaples, a scholar and man of science, whom the
                    queen had rescued from the fury of the Sorbonnists, and engaged as tutor to her
                    children. By him Calvin was warmly received, and his future eminence as a
                    reformer of the church predicted.</p>
                <p>It has been asserted that it was whilst resident at Saintonge that Calvin
                    prepared the first sketch of his <hi rend="italic">Institutio</hi><hi

                    first at Noy on, his native place, and soon after again in Paris. Here he was
                    compelled to remain concealed, in consequence of the measures which the enemies
                    of the Reformation were still pursuing against its adherents. At the risk of his
                    life, however, he came forth to meet one whom he was afterwards to encounter
                    under very different circumstances, the Spanish physician, Servede or Servetus,
                    who was even then engaged in propagating his heretical notions concerning the
                    Trinity. Servetus having expressed a desire to have a conference with Calvin, it
                    was arranged that they should meet and discuss their conflicting opinions; but
                    though Calvin waited for him long at the time and place appointed, Servetus
                    failed to make his appearance, “being,” says Beza, “unable to endure the sight
                    of Calvin,” but more probably deterred by the danger to which both were exposed
                    from the hostility of the ruling powers. Calvin’s design in acceding to this
                    colloquy seems to have been a kindly one towards Servetus. “Not without danger
                    to my life,’’he himself says, “I offered to deliver him from his errors.”<note

                    Servetus the onlyerrorist whom Calvin endeavoured at this time to confute. The
                    Anabaptists of Germany had spread into France, and were disseminating many wild
                    and fanatical opinions among those who had seceded from the Church of Rome.
                    Among other notions which they had imbibed, was that of a sleep of the soul
                    after death. To Calvin this notion appeared so pernicious, that he composed and
                    published a treatise in refutation of it, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Psydwpannydιia.</hi> In this work he chiefly dwells upon the evidence from
                    Scripture in favour of the belief that the soul retains its intelligent
                    consciousness after its separation from the body,—passing by questions of
                    philosophical speculation, as tending on such a subject only to minister to an
                    idle curiosity.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Psydιopannydιia</hi> was published in 1534 at Orleans,
                    whither Calvin had been constrained, in oonsequence of the violence of the
                    persecution at Paris, to retreat. On his way thither he stopped for some time at
                    Poitiers. Here many gathered round him desirous of instruction from him; and in
                    a grotto near the town he celebrated for the first time the communion in the
                    Evangelical Church of France, using a piece of the rock as a table. From this
                    time forward his influence became supreme, and all who had imbibed or become
                    tinged with the Reformed doctrines in France turned to him for counsel and
                    instruction, attracted not only by his power as a teacher, but still more,
                    perhaps, because they saw in him so full a development of the Christian life
                    according to the evangelical model. Μ. Renan, no prejudiced judge, pronounces
                    him “the most Christian man of his time,” and attributes to this his success as
                    a reformer. Certain it is that already he had drawn upon him the notice of those
                    who were seeking to extinguish in blood the light which had been kindled, and
                    which he was so prompt to hold up to view; so that he was obliged to seek safety
                    in flight. In company with his friend Louis du Tillet, whom he had again gone to
                    Angoulême to visit, he set out for Basel. On their way they were robbed by one
                    of their servants, who so entirely stripped them of their property, that it was
                    only by borrowing ten crowns from their other servant that they were enabled to
                    get to Strasburg, and thence to Basel. Here Calvin was welcomed by the band of
                    scholars and theologians who had conspired to make that city the Athens of
                    Switzerland, and especially by the learned Simon Grynaeus, and by Wolfgang
                    Capito, the leader of the Reformation at Basel. Under the auspices and guidance
                    of the latter, Calvin applied himself to the study of Hebrew.</p>
                <p>Francis L, desirous to continue the ∙ persecution of the Protestants, but anxious
                    at the same time not to break with the Protestant princes of Germany, resorted
                    to the unworthy expedient of instructing his ambassador to assure the latter
                    that it was only against the Anabaptists, and other parties who called in
                    question all civil magistracy, that his severities were exercised. Calvin,
                    indignant at the calumny which was thus cast upon the Reformed party in France,
                    hastily prepared for the press his <hi rend="italic">Institutes of the Christian
                    Religion,</hi> which he published as a confession of the Reformed faith, and
                    dedicated to the king. This work Calvin says he wrote in Latin that it might
                    find access to the learned in all lands.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    it into French, as he himself attests in a letter dated October 1536. This sets
                    at rest a question, at one time much agitated, whether the book appeared first
                    in French or in Latin. The earliest French edition known is that of 1540, and
                    this was after the work had been much enlarged, and several Latin editions had
                    appeared. In its first form the work consisted of only six chapters, and was
                    intended merely as a brief manual of Christian doctrine. It appeared
                    anonymously, the author having, as he himself says, nothing in view beyond
                    furnishing a statement of the faith of the persecuted Protestants, whom he saw
                    cruelly cut to pieces by impious and perfidious court parasites.<note

                    when the author was only twenty-five years of age, we find a complete outline of
                    that theological system which has since borne his name. In none of the later
                    editions, nor in any of his later works, do we find reason to believe that he
                    ever changed his views on any essential poiut from what they were at the period
                    of its first publication. Such an instance of maturity of mind and of opinion at
                    so early an age, would be remarkable under any circumstances; but in Calvin’s
                    case it is rendered peculiarly so, by the shortness of the time which had
                    elapsed since he gave himself to theological studies. It may be doubted also if
                    the history of literature presents us with another instance of a book written at
                    so early an age, which has exercised such a prodigious influence upon the
                    opinions and practices both of contemporaries and of posterity.</p>
                <p>After a short visit to the court of the duchess of Ferrara, which at that time
                    afforded an asylum to several learned and pious fugitives from persecution,
                    Calvin returned to France to arrange his affairs before finally taking farewell
                    of his native country. His intention was to settle at Basel, and to devote
                    himself to study. But being unable, in consequence of the disturbed state of the
                    country, to reach Basel by the ordinary route, he had to take the route through
                    Geneva. Whilst in this city his further progress was arrested, and his
                    resolution to pursue the quiet path of studious research was dispelled, by what
                    he calls the “formidable obtestation” of Farel.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p></note> After
                    many struggles and no small suffering, this energetic spirit had succeeded in
                    planting the evangelical standard at Geneva; and anxious to secure the aid of
                    such a man as Calvin, he entreated him on his arrival to relinquish his design
                    of going farther, and to devote himself to the work in that city. Calvin at
                    first declined, alleging as an excuse his need of securing more time for
                    personal improvement, whicr. could not be obtained were he engaged in
                    ministerial work. To the ardent Farel this seemed a mere pretext for indolence.
                    “I tell you,” he continued, “in answer to this pretence of your studies, in the
                    name, of Almighty God, that if you will not devote yourself with us to this work
                    of the Lord, the Lord will curse you as one seeking not Christ so much as
                    himself.” Startled by this denunciation, and feeling as if God had laid his hand
                    on him to detain him, Calvin consented to remain at Geneva, where <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n792/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0792-0717"/> he was immediately appointed teacher of theology.
                    He was also elected preacher by the magistrates with the consent of the people,
                    but this office he would not accept until it had been repeatedly pressed upon
                    him. His services seem to have been rendered for some time gratuitously, for in
                    February 1537, there is an entry in the city registers to the effect that six
                    crowns had been voted to him, “since he has as yet hardly received
                    anything.”</p>
                <p>Calvin was in his twenty-eighth year when he was thus constrained to settle at
                    Geneva; and in this city the rest of his life, with the exception of a brief
                    interval, was spent. The post to which he was thus called was not an easy one.
                    Though the people of Geneva had cast off the yoke of Rome, they were still “but
                    very imperfectly enlightened in divine knowledge; they had as yet hardly emerged
                    from the filth of the papacy.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    fanatical teachers, whom the excitement attendant upon the Reformation had
                    called forth, and who hung mischievously upon the rear of the reforming body. To
                    obviate the evils thence resulting, Calvin, in union with Farel, drew up a
                    condensed statement of Christian doctrine consisting of twenty-one articles.
                    This the citizens were summoned, in parties of ten each, to profess and swear to
                    as the confession of their faith—a process which, though not in accordance with
                    modern notions of the best way of establishing men in the faith, was gone
                    through, Calvin tells us, “with much satisfaction.” As the people took this oath
                    in the capacity of <hi rend="italic">citizens,</hi> we may see here the basis
                    laid for that theocratic system which subsequently became peculiarly
                    characteristic of the Genevan Dolity. Deeply convinced of the importance of
                    education <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> or the young, Calvin and his coadjutors
                    were solicitous to establish schools throughout the canton, and to enforce on
                    parents the sending of their children to them; and as he had no faith in
                    education apart from religious training, he drew up an elementary catechism of
                    Christian doctrine which the children had to learn whilst they were receiving
                    secular instruction. Of the troubles which arose from fanatical teachers, the
                    chief proceeded from the efforts of the Anabaptists; but these Calvin and his
                    colleagues so effectually silenced by means of a public disputation held on the
                    18th of March 1537, that they never afterwards appeared at Geneva. In the course
                    of this year also, the peace of Calvin and his friends was much disturbed, and
                    their work interrupted, by a turbulent and unprincipled preacher named Peter
                    Caroli, who, after many changes of religious profession (with none of which,
                    however, had he associated anything of true religion, or even much of ordinary
                    morality), had assumed the character of a stickler for orthodoxy. In this
                    character he accused the Geneva divines of Sabellianism and Arianism, because
                    they would not enforce the Athanasian creed, and had not used the words
                    “Trinity” and “Person” in the confession they had drawn up. In a synod held at
                    Bern the matter was fully discussed, when a verdict was given in favour of the
                    Geneva divines, and Caroli deposed from his office and banished. Thus ended an
                    affair which seems to have occasioned Calvin much more uneasiness than the
                    character of his assailant, and the manifest falsehood of the charge brought
                    against him, would seem to justify. Two brief tracts, intended to expose the
                    evils and warn against the seductions of Popery, one entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Fugienda</hi><hi rend="italic">Idolatria,</hi> the
                    other <hi rend="italic">De Papisticis</hi><hi rend="italic">Sacerdotiis,</hi>
                    must be added to the labours of Calvin this year.</p>
                <p>Hardly was the affair of Caroli settled, when new and severer trials came upon
                    the Genevan Reformers. The severe simplicity of the ritual which Farel had
                    introduced, and to which Calvin had conformed; the strictness with which the
                    ministers sought to enforce not only the laws of morality, but certain sumptuary
                    regulations respecting the dress and mode of living of the citizens; and their
                    determination in spiritual matters not to submit to the least dictation from the
                    civil power, led to such violent dis sensionsthat Calvin and his colleagues
                    refused to administer the sacrament to the people. For this they were banished
                    from the city. They went first to Bern, and soon after to Zurich, where a synod
                    of the Swiss pastors had been convened. Before this assembly they pleaded their
                    cause, and stated what were the points ∩n which they were prepared to insist as
                    needful for the proper discipline of the church. They declared that they would
                    yield in the matter of ceremonies so far as to employ unleavened bread in the
                    eucharist, to use fonts in baptism, and to allow festival days, provided the
                    people might pursue their ordinary avocations after public service. These Calvin
                    regarded as matters of indifference, provided the magistrates did not make them
                    of importance, by seeking to enforce them; and he was the more willing to
                    concede them, because he hoped thereby to meet the wishes of the Bernese
                    brethren, whose ritual was less simple than that established by Farel at Geneva.
                    But he and his colleagues insisted, on the other hand, that for the proper
                    maintenance of discipline, there should be a division of parishes — that
                    excommunications should be permitted, and should be under the power of elders
                    chosen by the council, in conjunction with the clergy—that order should be
                    observed in the admission of preachers—and that only the clergy should officiate
                    in ordination by the laying on of hands. It was proposed also, as conducive to
                    the welfare of the church, that the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper should be
                    administered more frequently, at least once every month, and that congregational
                    singing of psalms should be practised in the churches. On these terms the synod
                    interceded with the Genevese to restore their pastors; but through the
                    opposition of the Bernese this was frustrated, and a second edict of banishment
                    was the only response.</p>
                <p>Calvin and Farel betook themselves, under these circumstances, to Basel, where
                    they soon after separated, Farel to go to Neufchatel, and Calvin to Strasburg.
                    At the latter place Calvin resided till the autumn of 1541, occupying himself
                    partly in literary exertions, partly as a preacher in the French church, and
                    partly as a lecturer on theology. In 1539 he attended the convention at
                    Frankfort as the companion of Bucer, and in the following year he appeared at
                    that at Hagenau and Worms, as the delegate from the city of Strasburg. He was
                    present also at the diet at Ratisbon, where he became personally acquainted with
                    Melanchthon, and formed with him a friendship which lasted through life. It is
                    to this period of his life that we owe the completed form of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutio,</hi> his Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, and
                    his Tract on the Lord’s Supper. Notwithstanding his manifold engagements, he
                    found time to attend to the tenderer affections; for it was during his residence
                    at Strasburg that he married Idelette de Bures or van Buren, the widow of a
                    person named Störder, whom he had converted from Anabaptism. In her Calvin
                    found, to use his own words, “the excellent companion of his life,” a “precious
                    help” to him amid his manifold labours and frequent infirmities. She died, in
                    1549, to the great grief of her husband, who never ceased to mourn her loss.</p>
                <p>During his absence, disorder and irreligion had prevailed in Geneva. An attempt
                    was made by Sadolet, bishop of Carpentras, to take advantage of this so as to
                    restore the papal supremacy in that district; but this design Calvin, watchful
                    over the interests of his ungrateful flock, though exiled from them, completely
                    frustrated by writing such a reply to the letter which the bishop had addressed
                    to the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n793/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0793-0718"/> Genevese, as constrained him to desist from all
                    further efforts. He seems also to have kept up his connection with Geneva by
                    addressing letters of counsel and comfort to the faithful there who continued to
                    regard him with affection. It was whilst he was still at Strasburg that there
                    appeared at Geneva a translation of the Bible into French, bearing Calvin’s
                    name, but in reality only revised and corrected by him from the version of
                    Olivetan. Meanwhile the way had been opened for his return to the post whence he
                    had been driven in that city. In the summer of 1541, the decree of his
                    banishment was revoked, and in the following September he yielded to the earnest
                    entreaties of his now penitent flock, and returned to Geneva, where he was
                    received with the utmost enthusiasm. He entered upon his work with a firm
                    determination to carry out those reforms which he had originally purposed, and
                    to set up in all its integrity that form of church policy which he had carefully
                    matured during his residence at Strasburg. He now became the sole directive
                    spirit in the church at Geneva. Farel was retained by the Neufchatelois, and
                    Viret, soon after Calvin’s return, removed to Lausanne. His duties were thus
                    rendered exceedingly onerous, and his labour became excessive. Besides preaching
                    every day in each alternate week, he taught theology three days in the week,
                    attended weekly meetings of his consistory, read the Scriptures once a week in
                    the congregation, carried on an extensive correspondence on a multiplicity of
                    subjects, prepared commentaries on the books of Scripture, and was engaged
                    repeatedly in controversy with the opponents of his opinions. “I have not time,”
                    he writes to a friend, “to look out of my house at the blessed sun, and if
                    things continue thus, I shall forget what sort of appearance it has. When I have
                    settled my usual business, I have so many letters to write, so many questions to
                    answer, that many a night is spent without any offering of sleep being brought
                    to nature.” We cannot in this sketch follow him through all the details of his
                    brief but busy life after he returned to Geneva; we can only afford to notice
                    slightly the leading events.</p>
                <p>Of the controversies in which Calvin embarked, one of the most important was that
                    in which he defended his doctrine concerning predestination and election. His
                    first antagonist on this head was Pighius, a Romanist, who, resuming the
                    controversy between Erasmus and Luther on the freedom of the will, violently
                    attacked Calvin for the views he had expressed on that subject. Calvin replied
                    to him in a work published in 1543, in which he defends his own opinions at
                    length, as well by general reasonings as by an appeal to both Scripture and the
                    Fathers, especially Augustine. So potent were his reasonings in the esteem of
                    his opponent, that the latter, though owing nothing to the gentleness or
                    courtesy of Calvin, was led to embrace his views. A still more vexatious and
                    protracted controversy on the same subject arose in 1551, in which Calvin was
                    called to defend his views against Bolsec, originally a Carmelite friar, but who
                    having renounced Romanism had fled from France and come to Geneva, where he
                    appeared as a physician. In becoming a physician, however, he had not
                    relinquished theological studies, and being a zealous opponent of predestinarian
                    views, he was tempted on one occasion, after a sermon on the subject by Calvin
                    to attack him in the public assembly. Calvin replied with equal vehemence; and
                    an officer of police, scandalized that such a scene should occur in church, took
                    Bolsec into custody. The pastors resolved to have a conference with him before
                    the council; and for two days the discussion was conducted by him and Calvin
                    with much ability on both sides. The council were at a loss what course to take;
                    not that they doubted which of the disputants was right, for they all held by
                    the views of Calvin, but they were unable to determine to what extent and in
                    which way Bolsec should be punished for his heresy. The question was submitted
                    to the Swiss churches, but they also were divided in their judgment, some
                    counselling severity, others gentle measures. The result was that Bolsec was
                    banished from Geneva. The enemies of Calvin insinuated that he counselled the
                    infliction of a heavier penalty; but this he himself in a letter to Bullinger
                    indignantly denies. In this controversy ultimately several others, including
                    Castellio, Fabri, and even Bullinger and Melanchthon took part against Calvin,
                    and only Beza appeared as a zealous coadjutor. But the most memorable of all the
                    controversies in which Calvin was engaged, was that into which he was brought in
                    1553 with his old antagonist Servetus. After many wanderings, and after having
                    been condemned to death for heresy at Vienne, from which he was fortunate enough
                    to make his escape, Servetus arrived in July 1553 at Geneva. He appears to have
                    remained in quiet here for some time, and was about to leave for Zurich when, at
                    the instigation of Calvin, he was arrested and conveyed to prison on the charge
                    of blasphemy. This charge was founded on certain statements in a book published
                    by him in 1553, entitled <hi rend="italic">Christianismi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Restitutio,</hi> in which he animadverted in terms needlessly offensive on the
                    Catholic doctrine of the Trinity, and advanced sentiments strongly savouring of
                    Pantheism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A digest of

                    followed Calvin appeared as his accuser, and the conflict was conducted between
                    the two with much ability on both sides, and at the same time with no small
                    keenness and bitterness. After a protracted trial, the accused was condemned to
                    be burnt to death, and was accordingly burned at Champel near Geneva, on the
                    27th of October 1553. Farel attended him in his last hours, and accompanied him
                    to the place of execution. He had an interview also with Calvin on the morning
                    of the fatal day, when he asked his forgiveness, but refused to retract any of
                    his expressions. Calvin has been much censured, not to say vituperated, for his
                    share in this unhappy transaction. In order to aggravate the charge against him
                    it has been alleged that it was by his invitation that Servetus came to Geneva,
                    that it was by his urgency that the magistrates, over whom his influence was
                    unbounded, condemned Servetus to death, and that it was to gratify a personal
                    pique and through hatred of Servetus that he thus cruelly and relentlessly
                    pursued him. Of these allegations not one can be proved, and some are
                    undoubtedly false. It is not true that Calvin induced Servetus to come to
                    Geneva; on the contrary, when Servetus intimated a wish to visit that city if it
                    pleased Calvin that he should do so, Calvin intimated very plainly that it did
                    not please him, and refused to pledge himself for his safety should he come, as
                    he was resolved, should he come, to prosecute him to the death.<note

                    1546.</p></note> That Calvin influenced the magistrates to condemn Servetus is
                    true only in the same sense in which any public prosecutor, who pleads before
                    the judge for the condemnation of one against whom he brings a criminal charge,
                    may be said to influence the judge to condemn him. As for the assertion that
                    Calvin’s influence with the magistrates was unbounded, this falls to the ground
                    before the fact that at this time he was in a state of antagonism with the
                    dominant party.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See art.

                    and animosity against Servetus himself there is no evidence; on the contrary we
                    have his own express declaration that, after Servetus was convicted, he used no
                    urgency that he should be put to death, and at their last interview he told
                    Servetus that he never had avenged private injuries, and assured him that if he
                    would repent it would not be his fault if all the pious did not give him their

                    against him with undue severity, and that he approved the sentence which
                    condemned Servetus to death. When, however, it is remembered that the unanimous
                    decision of the Swiss churches and of the Swiss state Governments was that
                    Servetus deserved to die; that the general voice of Christendom was in favour of
                    this; that even such a man as Melanchthon affirmed the justice of the

                <p>The heresy of Servetus was not extirpated by his death, but none of his followers
                    were visited with severer penalties than that of banishment from Geneva. The
                    trials of several of these, with the conferences and controversies connected
                    with them, occupied much of Calvin’s time for several years. He was also
                    involved in a protracted and somewhat vexing dispute with the Lutherans
                    respecting the Lord’s Supper, which ended in the separation of the evangelical
                    party into the two great sections of Lutherans and Reformed,—the former of whom
                    hold that in the eucharist the body and blood of Christ are objectively and
                    consubstantially present, and so are actually partaken of by the communicants,
                    whilst the latter maintain that there is only a virtual presence of the body and
                    blood of Christ, and consequently only a spiritual participation thereof through
                    faith. In connection with these controversies on points of faith, Calvin was for
                    many years greatly disquieted, and sometimes even endangered, by the opposition
                    offered by the libertine party in Geneva to the ecclesiastical, discipline which
                    he had established there. His system of church polity was essentially
                    theocratic; it assumed that every member of the state was also under the
                    discipline of the church; and he asserted that the right of exercising this
                    discipline was vested exclusively in the consistory or body of preachers and
                    elders. His attempts to carry out these views brought him into collision both
                    with the authorities and with the populace,—the latter being enraged at the
                    restraints imposed upon the disorderly by the exercise of church discipline, and
                    the former being inclined to retain in their own hands a portion of that power
                    in things spiritual which Calvin was bent on placing exclusively in the hands of
                    the church rulers. His dauntless courage, his perseverance, and his earnestness
                    at length prevailed, and he had the satisfaction, before he died, of seeing his
                    favourite system of church polity firmly established, not only at Geneva, but in
                    other parts of Switzerland, and of knowing that it had been adopted
                    substantially by the Reformers in France and Scotland. Nor was it only in
                    religious matters that Calvin busied himself; nothing was indifferent to him
                    that concerned the welfare and good order of the state or the advantage of its
                    citizens. His work, as has been justly said, “embraced everything;” he was
                    consulted on every affair, great and small, that came before the council,-—on
                    questions of law, police, economy, trade, and manufactures, no less than on
                    questions of doctrine and church polity. To him Geneva owed her trade in cloths
                    and velvets, from which so much wealth accrued to her citizens; sanitary
                    regulations were introduced by him which made Geneva the admiration of all
                    visitors; and in him she reverences the founder of her college, which still
                    flourishes, and from which so many learned men have gone forth.</p>
                <p>Amidst these multitudinous cares and occupations, Calvin found time to commit to
                    writing a number of works besides those provoked by the various controversies in
                    which he was engaged. The most numerous of these were of an exegetical
                    character. Including discourses taken down from his lips by faithful auditors,
                    we have from him expository comments or homilies on nearly all the books of
                    Scripture, written partly in Latin and partly in French. In the estimation of
                    many, these constitute the most valuable of his works. His candour and sincerity
                    as an inquirer into the meaning of Scripture—his judiciousness, penetration, and
                    tact in eliciting his author’s meaning—his precision, condensation, and
                    concinnity as an expositor—the accuracy of his learning, the closeness of his
                    reasoning, and the elegance of his style, all conspire to confer a high value on
                    his exegetical works, and to make them at once rich sources of biblical
                    knowledge and admirable models of biblical exposition.</p>
                <p>But it is chiefly as a theologian and the head of a theological school that
                    Calvin is now known. This renders it fitting that some account should be here
                    given of his theological system. This is developed in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutio,</hi> which, though produced originally at an early period of his
                    life, was so frequently and carefully revised by him, that in the form in which
                    it has come down to us it presents his most matured views and thoughts. In some
                    of his tracts and polemical writings certain of his doctrines are more fully
                    expounded, illustrated, and defended; but nowhere has he advocated any tenet
                    which is not in substance to be found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutio.</hi></p>
                <p>Much of Calvin’s theology is common to him with all evangelical divines, and in
                    the parts which are more peculiar to him and his school he follows closely in
                    the steps of Augustine. The following may be regarded as his characteristic
                    tenets, though all are not peculiar to him.</p>
                <p>Man as a sinner is guilty and corrupt. The first man was made in the image and
                    likeness of God, which not only implies man’s superiority to all other
                    creatures, but indicates his original purity, integrity, and sanctity. From this
                    state Adam fell, and in his fall involved the whole human race descended from
                    him. Hence depravity and corruption, diffused through all parts of the soul,
                    attach to all men, and this first makes them obnoxious to the anger of God, and
                    then comes forth in works which the Scripture calls works of the flesh (Gal. v.
                    19). Thus all are held vitiated and perverted in all parts of their nature, and
                    on account of such corruption deservedly condemned before God, by whom nothin;'
                    is accepted save righteousness, innocence, and purity. Nor is that a being bound
                    for another’s offence; for when it is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n795/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0795-0720"/> said that we through Adam’s sin have become
                    obnoxious to the divine judgment, it is not to be taken as if we, being
                    ourselves innocent and blameless, bear the fault of his offence, but that, we
                    having been brought under a curse through his transgression, he is said to have
                    bound us. From him, however, not only has punishment overtaken us, but a
                    pestilence instilled from him resides in us, to which punishment is justly due.
                    Thus even infants, whilst they bring their own condemnation with them from their
                    mother’s womb, are bound not by another’s but by their own fault. For though
                    they have not yet brought forth the fruits of their iniquity, they have the seed
                    shut up in them; nay, their whole nature is a sort of seed of sin, therefore it
                    cannot but be hateful and abominable to God <hi rend="italic">(Instit.</hi> bk.
                    ii. ch. i. sect. 8).</p>
                <p>To redeem man from this state of guilt, and to recover him from corruption, the
                    Son of God became incarnate, assuming man’s nature into union with His own, so
                    that in Him were two natures in one person. Thus incarnate He took on Him the
                    offices of Prophet, Priest, and King, and by His humiliation, obedience, and
                    suffering unto death, followed by His resurrection and ascension to heaven, He
                    has perfected His work and fulfilled all that was required in a Redeemer of men,
                    so that it is truly affirmed that He has merited for man the grace of salvation
                    (bk. ii. ch. 13-17). But until a man is in some way really united to Christ so
                    as to partake of Him, the benefits of Christ’s work cannot be attained by him.
                    Now it is by the secret and special operation of the Holy Spirit that men are
                    united to Christ and made members of His body. Through faith, which is a firm
                    and certain cognition of the divine benevolence towards us founded on the truth
                    of the gracious promise in Christ, men are by the operation of the Spirit united
                    to Christ and are made partakers of His death and resurrection, so that the old
                    man is crucified with Him and they are raised to a new life, a life of
                    righteousness and holiness. Thus joined to Christ the believer has life in Him
                    and knows that he is saved, having the witness of the Spirit that he is a child
                    of God, and having the promises, the certitude of which the Spirit had before
                    impressed on the mind, sealed by the same Spirit on the heart (bk. iii. cb.
                    33-36). From faith proceeds repentance, which is the turning of our life to God,
                    proceeding from a sincere and earnest fear of God, and consisting in the
                    mortification of the flesh and the old man within us and a vivification of the
                    Spirit. Through faith also the believer receives justification, his sins are
                    forgiven, he is accepted of God, and is held by Him as righteous, the
                    righteousness of Christ being imputed to him, and faith being the instrument by
                    which the man lays hold on Christ, so that with His righteousness the man
                    appears in God’s sight as righteous. This imputed righteousness, however, is not
                    disjoined from real personal righteousness, for regeneration and sanctification
                    come to the believer from Christ no less than justification; the two blessings
                    are not to be confounded, but neither are they to be disjoined. The assurance
                    which the believer has of salvation he receives from the operation and witness
                    of the Holy Spirit; but this again rests on the divine choice of the man to
                    salvation; and this falls back on God’s eternal sovereign purpose, whereby He
                    has predestinated some to eternal life while the rest of mankind are
                    predestinated to condemnation and eternal death. Those whom God has chosen to
                    life He effectually calls to salvation, and they are kept by Him in progressive
                    faith and holiness unto the end (bk. iii. <hi rend="italic">passim).</hi> The
                    external means or aids by which God unites men into the fellowship of Christ,
                    and sustains and advances those who believe, are the church and its ordinances,
                    especially the sacraments. The church universal is the multitude gathered from
                    diverse nations, which though divided by distance of time and place, agree in
                    one common faith, and it is bound by the tie of the same religion; and wherever
                    the word of God is sincerely preached, and the sacraments are duly administered,
                    according to Christ’s institute, there beyond doubt is a church of the living
                    God (bk. iv. ch. 1, sect. 7-11). The permanent officers in the church are
                    pastors and teachers, to the former of whom it belongs to preside over the
                    discipline of the church, to administer the sacraments, and to admonish and
                    exhort the members; while the latter occupy themselves with the exposition of
                    Scripture, so that pure and wholesome doctrine may be retained. With them are to
                    be joined for the government of the church certain pious, grave, and holy men as
                    a senate in each church; and to others, as deacons, is to be entrusted the care
                    of the poor. The election of the officers in a church is to be with the people,
                    and those duly chosen and called are to be ordained by the laying on of the
                    hands of the pastors (ch. 3, sect. 4-16). The sacraments are two— Baptism and
                    the Lord’s Supper. Baptism is ’ the sign of initiation whereby men are admitted
                    into the society of the church and, being grafted into Christ, are reckoned
                    among the sons of God; it serves both for the confirmation of faith and as a
                    confession before men. The Lord’s Supper is a spiritual feast where Christ
                    attests that He is the life-giving bread, by which our *souls are fed unto true
                    and blessed immortality. That sacred communication of His flesh and blood
                    whereby Christ transfuses into us His life, even as if it penetrated into our
                    bones and marrow, He in the Supper attests and seals; and that not by a vain or
                    empty sign set before us, but there He puts forth the efficacy of His Spirit
                    whereby He fulfils what He promises. In the mystery of the Supper Christ is
                    truly exhibited to us by the symbols of bread and wine; and so his body and
                    blood, in which He fulfilled all obedience for the obtaining of righteousness
                    for us, are presented. There is no such presence of Christ in the Supper as that
                    He is affixed to the bread or included in it or in any way circumscribed; but
                    whatever can express the true and substantial communication of the body and
                    blood of the Lord, which is exhibited to believers under the said symbols of the
                    Supper, is to be received, and that not as perceived by the imagination only or
                    mental intelligence, but as enjoyed for the aliment of the eternal life (bk. iv.
                    ch. 15, 17).</p>
                <p>The incessant and exhausting labours to which Calvin gave himself, could not but
                    tell on the strongest constitution: how much more on one so fragile as his! Amid
                    many sufferings, however, and frequent attacks of sickness, he manfully pursued
                    his course for twenty-eight years; nor was it till his frail body, torn by many
                    and painful diseases—fever, asthma, stone, and gout, the fruits for the most
                    part of his sedentary habits and unpausing activity—had, as it were, fallen to
                    pieces around him, that his indomitable spirit relinquished the conflict. In the
                    early part of the year 1564 his sufferings became so severe that it was manifest
                    his earthly career was rapidly drawing to a ,close. On the 6th of February of
                    that year he preached his last sermon, having with great difficulty found breath
                    enough to carry him through it. He was several times after this carried to
                    church, but never again was able to take any part in the service. With a noble
                    disinterestedness he refused to receive his stipend, now that he was no longer
                    able to discharge the duties of his office. In the midst of his sufferings,
                    however, his zeal and energy kept him in continual occupation; when expostulated
                    with for such unseasonable toil, he replied, “Would you that the Lord should
                    find me idle when He comes <hi rend="italic">1</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi>
                    After he had retired from public labours he lingered for some months, enduring
                    the severest agony without a murmur, and cheerfully attending to all the duties
                    of a private kind which his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n796/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0796-0721"/> diseases left him strength to discharge. A deep
                    impression seems to have been made on all who visited him on his deathbed; they
                    saw in him the noble spectacle of a great spirit that had done its life-work,
                    calmly and trustfully passing through the gate of suffering into the
                    long-desired and firmly-expected repose of heaven. He quietly expired iu the
                    arms of his faithful friend Beza, on the evening of the 27th of May, in the
                    fifty-fifth year of his age.</p>
                <p>Calvin was of middle stature; his complexion was somewhat pallid and dark; his
                    eyes, to the latest clear and lustrous, bespoke the acumen of his genius. He was
                    sparing in his food and simple in his dress; he took but little sleep, and was
                    capable of extraordinary efforts of intellectual toil. His memory was
                    prodigious, but he used it only as the servant of his higher faculties. As a
                    reasoner he has seldom been equalled, and the soundness and penetration of his
                    judgment were such as to give to his conclusions in practical questions almost
                    the appearance of predictions, and inspire in all his friends the utmost
                    confidence in the wisdom of his counsels. As a theologian he stands on an
                    eminence which only Augustine has surpassed; whilst in his skill as an expositor
                    of Scripture, and his terse and elegant style, he possessed advantages to which
                    Augustine was a stranger. His private character was in harmony with his public
                    reputation and position. If somewhat severe and irritable, he was at the same
                    time scrupulously just, truthful, and steadfast; he never deserted a friend or
                    took an unfair advantage of an antagonist; and on befitting occasions he could
                    be cheerful and even facetious among his intimates. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> have been a witness of him for sixteen years,” says Beza,
                    “and I think I am fully entitled to say that in this man there was exhibitĕd to
                    all an example of the life and death of the Christian, such as it will not be
                    easy to depreciate, such as it will be difficult to emulate.”<note

                    Beza’s narrative has been expanded and illustrated from other sources by Dr

                    misrepresentations and blunders. A highly respectable work has appeared on the
                    same subject from the pen of Μ. Dyer, in 1 vol. 8vo. Μ. Bungenerhas also

                    at Geneva, one in 12 vols. fol. in 1578, the other in 7 vols. fol. in 1617. An
                    edition, hitherto reputed the best, was published at Amsterdam in 9 vols. fol.
                    in 1671. A new edition in 4to is at present in course of publication, carefully
                    edited by G. Baum, E. Lunitz, and E. Reuss, at Brunswick. An English translation
