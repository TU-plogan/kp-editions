                    and continental Europe, although Alph. de Candolle considers it to be really
                    descended from the two or three allied species which are yet found growing wild
                    on the Mediterranean coast. In any case the cultivated varieties have departed
                    very widely from the original type, and they present very marked and striking
                    dissimilarities among themselves. The wild cabbage is a comparatively
                    insignificant plant, growing from 1 to 2 feet high, in appearance very similar
                    to the corn mustard or charlock <hi rend="italic">(Sinapis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >αrvensis),</hi> but differing from it in having smooth leaves. The wild plant
                    has fleshy, shining, waved, and lobed leaves (the uppermost being undivided but
                    toothed), large yellow flowers, elongated seed-pod, and seeds with conduplicate
                    cotyledons. Notwithstanding the fact that the cultivated forms differ in habit
                    so widely, it is remarkable that the flower, seed-pods, and seeds of the
                    varieties present no appreciable difference.</p>
                <p>The late Dr Lindley proposed the following classification for the various forms,
                    which includes all yet cultivated :— 1. All the leaf-buds active and open, as in
                    wild cabbage and kale or greens; 2. All the leaf-buds active, but forming heads,
                    as in Brussels sprouts; 3. Terminal leaf-buds alone active, forming a head, as
                    in common cabbage, savoys, &lt;fcc.; 4. Terminal leaf-bud alone active and open,
                    with most of the flowers abortive and succulent, as in cauliflower and broccoli;
                    5. All the leaf-buds active and open, with most of the flowers abortive and
                    succulent, as in sprouting broccoli. The least variety bears the same relation
                    to common broccoli as Brussels sprouts do to the common cabbage. Of all these
                    forms there are numerous gardeners’ varieties, all of which reproduce faithfully
                    enough their parent form by proper and separate cultivation. Under Dr Lindley’s
                    first class, common or Scotch kale is a variety which formerly was in extensive
                    cultivation, and is still found in the cottage “kail-yards” or gardens of the
                    Scottish peasantry. It sends up a stout central stem, growing upright to a
                    height of about 2 feet, with close-set, large thick plain leaves of a light red
                    or purplish hue. The lower leaves are stripped off for use as the plants grow
                    up, and used for the preparation of broth or “Scotch kail,” a dish at one time
                    in great repute in the north-eastern <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n689/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0689-0618"/> districts of Scotland. Tall or German greens,
                    which grow to the height of 4 feet, with bright green very much curled leaves,
                    have largely superseded kale in cultivation. A very remarkable variety of
                    open-leaved cabbage is cultivated in the Channel Islands under the name of the
                    Jersey or branching cabbage, It grows to a height of 8 feet, but has been known
                    to attain double that altitude. It throws out branches from the central stem,
                    which is sufficiently firm and woody to be fashioned into walking-sticks; and
                    the stems are even used by the islanders as rafters for bearing the thatch on
                    their cottage-roofs. Several varieties are cultivated as ornamental plants on
                    account of their beautifully coloured, frizzled, aud laciniated leaves. Brussels
                    sprouts, which represent <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> Dr Lindley’s second class,
                    are miniature cabbage-heads, about an inch in diameter, which form in the axils
                    of the leaves. They form a tender and delicate table vegetable. The third class
                    is chiefly represented by the common or drumhead cabbage, the varieties of which
                    are distinguished by difference in size, form, and colour. In Germany it is
                    converted into a popular article of diet under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sauerkraut</hi> by placing in a tub alternate layers of salt and cabbage. An
                    acid fermentation sets in, which after a few days is complete, when the vessel
                    is tightly covered over and the product kept for use with animal food. Cabbages
                    contain a large percentage of nitrogenous compounds as compared with most other
                    articles of food. Their percentage composition is—water, 93'4; albumen, 1’8;
                    starch and dextrin, 3'3; woody fibre, 0 5; and mineral ash, 0 ’ 8. Red cabbage
                    is chiefly used for pickling, and the Savoy is a hardy green variety,
                    characterized by its very wrinkled leaves. The Portugal cabbage, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Couve</hi><hi rend="italic">Tronchuda,</hi> is a variety, the tops
                    of which form an excellent cabbage, while the midribs of the large leaves are
                    cooked like sea-kale. Cauliflower, which is the chief representative of class
                    four, consists of the inflorescence of the plant modified so as to form a
                    compact succulent white mass or head; this is upon the whole the most highly
                    prized cultivated form of the plant, and has been in use from very remote times.
                    Broccoli is merely a variety of cauliflower differing from the other in the form
                    and colour of its inflorescence and its hardiness. Broccoli sprouts, the
                    representative of the fifth class, is a form of recent introduction, and
                    consists of flowering sprouts springing from the axils of the leaves. Kohl-rabi
                    is a peculiar and exceptional variety of cabbage in which the stem, just above
                    ground, swells into a fleshy turnip-like mass. It is much cultivated in certain
                    districts as a food for cattle. The varieties of cabbage, like many other
                    Cruciferous plants, are possessed of anti-scorbutic properties; but unless eaten
                    when very fresh and tender they are difficult of digestion, and have a very
                    decided tendency to produce flatulence.</p>
                <p>Several species of palm, from the fact of yielding large sapid central buds which
                    are cooked as vegetables, are known as Cabbage Palms. The principal of these is
                    <hi rend="italic">Areca</hi><hi rend="italic">oleracea,</hi> but other .species,
                    such as the Coco Palm, the <hi rend="italic">Maximiliana regia, Arenga
                    saccharifera,</hi> &amp;c., yield similar edible leaf-buds.</p>
