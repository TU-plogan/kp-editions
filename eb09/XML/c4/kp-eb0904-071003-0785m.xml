                    rend="smallcaps">Kalmuiks</hi></label>, a people of Mongolian race who inhabit
                    various parts of the Russian and Chinese empires, as well as other portions of
                    Central Asia. They are of the middle height, fairly proportioned, and of
                    considerable strength; their cheek-bones are prominent, the chin short, the nose
                    turned up, the beard thin, and the hair scrubby. For the most part still in the
                    nomadic stage, they inhabit conical felt tents, which they set up in regular
                    lines like the streets of a town. Their wealth consists entirely in small but
                    high-spirited horses, excellent cattle, and broad-tailed, rough-fleeced sheep.
                    They are so much addicted to gaming that they not unfrequently stake everything
                    they possess. In religion they are adherents of Lamaism, and their conduct is
                    greatly under the control of their priests. Their language is closely connected
                    with Mongolian proper, and is written with a similar alphabet; its grammar and
                    vocabulary have been made known to Europeans more especially by A. H. Zwick
                    about 1853. Of their literature the great proportion is religious, and is
                    derived from Indian originals. The <hi rend="italic">Siddhi Kiir,</hi> a
                    collection of stories, which is one of their most famous productions, was
                    published with a German translation, a glossary, and notes, by B. Jülg, at
                    Leipsic in 1866. As early as the 16th century the Calmucks possessed an
                    extensive district of Central Asia between the Altai mountains and the Thian
                    Shan, and between the desert of Gobi and the Balkash or Tengis Lake; and they
                    were also settled in what is now the southern part of the Yeniseisk government,
                    where indeed they were first met by Russian emigrants. At that time they bore
                    the name of Derben Oirat, or Four Confederates, being divided into the four
                    tribes of Jungars, Turguts, Khoshots, and Durbots. In the 17th century the
                    Calmucks grew extremely strong, and after violent feuds united themselves, under
                    the leadership of Batur and his son Galdan, into the powerful Jun-garian
                    kingdom. The strife which preceded the unification occasioned important
                    movements of some Calmuck bands towards the E. and S.E. of Russia. Under
                    Kour-liuk, the great mass of the Turguts appeared for the first time within the
                    Russian territory on the eastern side of the Volga in 1630. They conquered the
                    nomadic Nogais of the district, but on this first occasion turned back to the
                    Kirghiz steppes. In 1636 as many as 50,000 <hi rend="italic">kibitkas,</hi> or
                    more than 200,000 men and women crossed the Emba, and took possession of the
                    Trans-Volga steppes of the present Astrakhan government; and plundering
                    incursions began to be made on the Russian settlements, in Saratoff, Penza, and
                    Tamboff, while Tobolsk, in Siberia, had to defend itself with arms in 1646.
                    After the fall of Kour-liuk, in an attack on Astrakhan itself, the Calmucks
                    became less aggressive, and in 1655 passed of their own accord under Russian
                    authority. Down to the middle of the 18th century bands, however, continued to
                    arrive, and the depredations on Russian ground did not cease during all the long
                    reign of the Khan Ayuka (1670-1724). This chief more than once broke his oath to
                    the Russian Government; but he also on several occasions supplied veιy important
                    contingents to the imperial army. His power is shown by the fact that his court
                    was visited in 1713 by an ambassador from China. In the reign of the Empress
                    Catharine the Russian Government created great discontent among the Calmucks by
                    their general treatment, and still more by refusing to confirm Ubashi, the
                    grandson of Ayuka, in his dignities. A Calmuck chieftain from Jungaria skilfully
                    took advantage of this condition of affairs to persuade Ubashi and his subjects
                    to return to Jungaria, and attempt its conquest. The result was the wonderful
                    and disastrous flight of the Calmucks from Russia in 1771, so graphically
                    described by De Quincey. The number of the fugitives amounted, according to some
                    authorities, to 120,000. Harassed on all sides by savage troops of Cossacks and
                    Khirghises, the wretched Calmucks pursued their way across the barren steppes,
                    and their main body was routed in a terrible battle on the shores of the
                    Balkash. The remnants were settled on the banks of the Hi by the Chinese emperor
                    Kien Long, and there their descendants are still to be found. There still
                    remained in Russia the Durbots, who were living in the Don territory, and those
                    of the Astrakhan Calmucks who at the time of the flight happened to be on the
                    right bank of the Volga.</p>

                <p>The total number now in the Russian empire may be estimated at 120,000. In the

                    considerable, but are not precisely known.</p>
