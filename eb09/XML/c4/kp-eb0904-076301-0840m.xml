                    as one of these is included in the other, let us pass at once to the Canaanites
                    in the larger sense, <hi rend="italic">i,e.,</hi> the whole group of nations
                    conquered by the Israelites on the west side of the Jordan. The group is
                    variously described. It is sometimes said to consist of five—Canaanites,
                    Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, Jebusites (Exod. xiii. 5); sometimes of six, the
                    Perizzites, f.e., <hi rend="italic">Pagani,</hi> being added (Exod. iii. 8, 17,
                    xxiii. 23, xxxiii. 2, xxxiv. 11; Deut. xx. 17; Josh. ix. 1, xii. 8); sometimes
                    of seven, by including the Girgashites (Deut. vii. 1; Josh. iii. 10, xxiv. 11);
                    once of ten, omitting the Hittites, and including the aboriginal Rephaim and
                    three Arab tribes, the Kenites, Kenizzites, and Kadmonites (Gen. XV. 19-21 ).
                    The latter, however, are clearly inserted by mistake, as they only became
                    inhabitants of Palestine, so far as they did become such, as the reward of
                    assistance given to the Israelites. There are only two of these nations about
                    whom we have any collateral information— the Hittites and the Amorites. The
                    former, however, seem also to have been included among the Canaanites by
                    mistake. Historical evidence, both Biblical and extra-biblical, proves
                    convincingly that they dwelt beyond the borders of Canaan; and linguistic
                    evidence tends on the whole to show that they did not even speak a Semitic
                    language (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hittites).</hi> The latter, too, were not
                    entirely homogeneous with the other Canaanitish peoples, if the notices in Deut.
                    iii. 11 (“Og . . . of the remnant of the Rephaim”), <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>
                    13; Josh. xii. 4, xiii. 12, may be taken as historical. Perhaps, as Ewald
                    suggests, they were mixed with the aborigines. A Semitic basis seems probable,
                    but has only one linguistic fact in its favour— Senír, the Amorite name of
                    Hermon (Deut. iii. 9), mentioned also in an inscription of Shalmaneser <hi
                    rend="italic">(Brd.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">Coll.,</hi>
                    vol. iii. p. 5, No. 6, 1. 45); personal names like Og and Sihon may easily have
                    been Semiticized, and the name Amorite itself, being probably descriptive (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Amorites),</hi> has no ethnological value. They are at all
                    events un-Canaanitish in their political capacity, two considerable states
                    having been founded by them on the east of the Jordan (Deut. iii. 8; Josh. xii.
                    2; Judg. x. 8, xi. 22). It will therefore be better to exclude Hittites and
                    Amorites from the present notice.</p>
                <p>I. It is extremely difficult to draw any distinction between the remaining
                    members of the Canaanitish group. As described in the early books of the Old
                    Testament, they have a general family likeness. They are described as living in
                    a state of political disintegration, the combined result of the Semitic love of
                    independence and of the varied conformation of the soil. Thirty-one of their
                    petty kings are mentioned in Josh. xii. 9-24, including the king of Hazor
                    (afterwards reckoned to Naphtali), whose realm, in Judg. xi. 10, is called “the
                    chief of all those kingdoms.” We find, indeed,*a king of Bezek claiming to have
                    enslaved “seventy” of the surrounding <hi rend="italic">reguli</hi> (Judg. i.
                    7), but this is an altogether exceptional event, for which the loosening of
                    authority produced by the guerilla warfare of the Israelites sufficiently
                    accounts. Yet the isolation of the Canaanites can never have been complete. Like
                    the Phoenicians, they will have had their federations, as appears to be implied
                    by the title Baal-berith, or “Baal of the Covenant” (Judg. viii. 33); and
                    hieroglyphic inscriptions tell of their alliances with the Khita or Hittites
                    against their Egyptian suzerains. Indeed, the rebellious tendencies of the
                    Syrian states will partly explain the inaction of the Pharaohs during the
                    Israelitish conquest. The only injury Joshua could do to the latter would
                    consist in blocking up the military coast-road to the north of Syria, but this
                    was well secured by Egyptian garrisons, which Joshua did not venture to attack;
                    while to get the Canaanites humbled without any trouble was a clear gain. That
                    the Israelites were not immediately and at all points successful is now
                    universally recognized. The work of many years was concentrated by tradition on
                    a single great name; yet the Old Testament itself corrects by numberless
                    indications the error of the more imaginative narrative. Thus the kingdom of
                    Hazor, which had been utterly destroyed, according to Josh. xi. 10, 11, emerges
                    again in the more accurate account of Judges (iv. 2, 3). And both Joshua and
                    Judges (not to descend later—see <hi rend="smallcaps">Amorites)</hi> supply
                    evidence for the continued Canaanitish occupation of many parts of the country
                    (Josh. xiii. 13, xv. 63, xvi. 10, xvii. 12, 13; Judg. i. 19-36). The immediate
                    result of the invasion was, not the extinction of the old, but the addition of a
                    new (and yet not wholly new) element, of stronger stuff but less advanced
                    culture.</p>
                <p>II. No doubt the Israelites a⅛ first put an end to much of which they could not
                    discern the value, or, to use their own phrase, made it a <hi rend="italic"
                    >lcherem,</hi> a thing consecrated to God by destruction. The origin of Hebrew
                    literature would not be such a blank if the sacred archives of Kiryath-sépher,
                    or “the Book-city,” otherwise called Kiryath-sannah, or “the Law-city (?)”
                    (Josh. xv. 15, 49), had been preserved. Still the attractions of culture were
                    superior in the long run to the dictates of religious zeal. Goodly houses,
                    vineyards, and oliveyards (Deut. vi. 10, 11) were agents more powerful even than
                    chariots of iron. The secrets of agriculture had to be learned from the
                    Canaanites; intercourse naturally led to intermarriage, and so a new strife
                    arose in the field of religion, in which half the Jewish nation perished
                    utterly, and the other half was only saved by its voluntary submission to a
                    spiritual despotism.</p>
                <p>III. The pages of the book of Judges are full of complaints of Israelitish
                    infidelity, which is rightly ascribed by the compiler to mixture of blood (Judg.
                    iii. 6). It is true that expressions like this of infidelity have only a limited
                    accuracy. As Ewald and Kuenen have pointed out, the final editor of Judges lived
                    in the age of the Exile, when the religion of Yahveh (miscalled Jehovah) had
                    attained its full development. From his point of view, religious approximation
                    to the Canaanites was wilful apostasy, because it involved the effacement of the
                    distinction between physical and moral religion. But of this distinction the
                    Israelites were hardly more conscious than the Canaanites.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n841/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0841-0764"/>
                <p>The religions of both nations were based, on a feeling for the powers of nature,
                    whether regarded as destructive and awful, as by the one, or as favourable and
                    lovely, as by the other. Thus the one religion was stern and in tendency moral;
                    the other soft and in tendency immoral: there was indeed a difference, but not a
                    clear-cut distinction between them. To come to particulars,—the chief object of
                    Canaanitish worship was the dual-natured god of life and fruitfulness, viz.,
                    Baal, or rather the Baal, ⅛.e., “the lord,” and his consort Ashérah, z.e., “the
                    happy,” and so “happy-making, favourable” (as in Assyrian, Salmanu-âsir, “Salman
                    is favourable’'). The masculine form is also probably a divine title, and has
                    given its name to the tribe of Asher, as Gad (“good fortune”) to the Gadites. As
                    Movers long ago pointed out, Ashérah is not identical with Ashtoreth or Astarte,
                    whose name is philologically different, and who belongs to another type of
                    Semitic religion. Her symbol was the stem of a tree (Deut. xvi. 21; Judg. vi.
                    25), though this may have been sometimes carved into an image; that of the Baal
                    probably had the form of a cone, arid represented the rays of the sun. It is
                    these symbols which are referred to in the phrase, “the Baals and the Ashérahs”
                    (Judg. iii. 7); the “groves” of the authorized version is an evident
                    mistranslation (see in the Hebrew or some accurate modern version, Judg. vi. 25;
                    1 Kings xv. 13; 2 Kings xxiii. 6). The licensed harlotry which formed part of
                    the worship of Ashérah was profoundly obnoxious to the later Hebrew writers
                    (Num. xxv.; Deut, xxiii. 18), though, indeed, even the folk-lore of the
                    Israelites showstraces of aversion to its attendant immorality. An illustration
                    of this is furnished in the narrative of Sodom (Gen. xviii., xix.), which can
                    only refer to the later Canaanites. Similarly, another writer (Gen. xv. 16)
                    describes “the iniquity of the Amorites” as the divine justification of the
                    Israelitish conquest. It is also the subject of a threatening passage in the
                    Levitical legislation (Lev. xviii.), which if composed during the Babylonian
                    exile, as is held by Graf and Kalisch, is a remarkable evidence of the tenacity
                    of pre-Israelitish customs.</p>
                <p>Another characteristic of Canaanitish religion, though far from peculiar to this,
                    was soothsaying. After Israelite prophecy had broken its shell, and taken its
                    daring flight into a more spiritual region, its first anxiety was to destroy
                    that rival phenomenon which enslaved the minds of men to gross superstition.
                    Hence the earnest dehortations of Isaiah (it 6), and of the writer of
                    Deuteronomy (xviii. 10-14).</p>
                <p>There was only one relic of Canaanitish times which the disciples of prophetic
                    religion could not or would not throw aside—the old traditions. For it can
                    hardly be doubted by uncompromising historical critics that some, perhaps many,
                    of the narratives of Genesis are but purified versions of Canaanitish myths and
                    legends. The most obvious examples will naturally be those stories which are
                    attached to localities in Canaan, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Luz and
                    Beersheba. Of course the story of Melchizedek, “the king of Salem,” and “priest
                    of the most high God” (Gen. xiv. 17-24), is not one of these, being out of
                    harmony with all our other notices of the Canaanites. It is also easily
                    separable from the rest of the narrative, and may possibly be as late as the
                    Maccabean period, and written in honour of the temple and its priesthood, which
                    are glorified by being, as it were, prefigured in the patriarchal age.</p>
                <p>IV. The question has been asked of late, whether a remnant of the old population
                    of Palestine may not still be in existence. Μ. Clermont-Ganneau, following Prof.
                    E. H. Palmer <hi rend="italic">(History of the Jewish Nation,</hi> p. 64),
                    answers it confidently in the affirmative. In the fellahín or peasants of the
                    Holy Land he sees the descendants of the Canaanites, who, having en reduced to a
                    state of serfdom, were contemntuously overlooked by the successive hordes of
                    conquerors. Their strange superstitious customs have been remarked by every
                    close observer, and are evidently survivals of some early form of religion. Μ.
                    Ganneau also mentions some curious legendary parallels to Biblical narratives
                    existing among them. Dr Thomson <hi rend="italic">(The Land and the Book,</hi>
                    pp. 226-8) holds a similar theory about the sect of the Nusairîeh in northern
                    Syria, who are equally bad Moslems, but more probably represent the <hi
                    rend="italic">debris</hi> of the later Syrian paganism.</p>
                <p>V. We have yet to speak of the ethnological relation of the Canaanites and the
                    Israelites. The linguistic evidence points to a kinship as close as that of both
                    to the Phoenicians. Not only are the personal names of the Canaanites
                    (Melchizedek, Adonibezek, Adonizedek, Oman or Aranyah, of which Araunah seems to
                    be a corruption) pure Hebrew, but so too are the names of their cities, an
                    evidence of still greater value, as given both in the Old Testament and in the
                    lists of the places conquered by Thothmes III. The latter have been discovered
                    by Mariette-Bey on a kind of triumphal arch at Karnak; they include 119 names
                    belonging to Canaan, of which 75 have been identified with known Hebrew names of
                    places (Mariette-Bey, in <hi rend="italic">Comptes Rendus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Academie des Inscriptions,</hi> 1874, p. 243,
                    &amp;c.). The same Hebraic character is apparent in the names given in the
                    “Travels of a Mohar” (see the <hi rend="italic">Records of the Past,</hi> vol.
                    ii. pp. 107-116), tvhich have been illustrated, we understand, by the recent
                    explorations of Lieutenant Conder. How, it has been asked, is this community of
                    language to be accounted for? The problem is a real one to those who regard the
                    Table of Nations (Gen. X.) as an ethnological authority, for in that document
                    the Canaanites are classed separately from the Hebrews among the descendants of
                    Ham. From this, as we believe, antiquated point of view, it becomes necessary to
                    assume that the Canaanites borrowed their language from some of the genuine
                    descendants of Shem. From the Israelites? But they spoke the language long
                    before the Israelite immigration. From an aboriginal Semiticspeaking race? But
                    there is no historical evidence for the existence of such a people. We are thus
                    driven to accept the view that the Table of Nations is arranged not on an
                    ethnological but on a geographical principle. The Canaanites will then be
                    classed among the descendants of Ham as belonging, according to the compilers,
                    to the southern terrestrial zone—not, however, the Canaanites, in our sense of
                    the word, for these formed no part of the original Table (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Canaan),</hi> but the Phoenicians. Apart from this
                    misunderstood document there is no difficulty in admitting the affinity of the
                    three nations, the Israelites, the Canaanites, and the Phoenicians, who all
                    appear to have migrated successively from a Babylonian centre (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Phoenicians).</hi> The last to move westward were probably the
                    Hebrews They are generally supposed to have originally spoken an Aramaic
                    dialect, but after entering Palestine to have adopted that of the more civilized
                    Canaanites (see <hi rend="italic">Introductions</hi> of Bleek and De
                    Wette-Schrader). The only evidence, however, offered in support of this view is
                    Gen. xxxi. 47, where the “cairn of witness” receives a Hebrew name from Jacob,
                    an Aramaic from Laban. From this it is inferred that Laban’s great-uncle Abraham
                    must, according to tradition, have spoken Aramaic, as if Aramaic were as early a
                    development as Hebrew, and as if the writer in Genesis had any thought of
                    illustrating philological problems! Of any such event in the history of the
                    Hebrews we have simply no evidence whatever.</p>
