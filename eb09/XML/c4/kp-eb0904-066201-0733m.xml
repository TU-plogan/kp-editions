                    the northern portion of Britain during the period of the Roman occupation of the
                    island, had originally a more restricted application. It is proposed in this
                    article to give, from a geographical as well as an historical point of view, a
                    brief account of what seems to have been known regarding it in ancient
                    times.</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">Caledonia</hi> is first met with in the fourth book of
                    Pliny’s <hi rend="italic">Historia Naturalis</hi><hi rend="italic">(circa</hi>
                    77 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> where, in the very meagre notice of Britain,
                    the Caledonian forest <hi rend="italic">(Caledonia sylvd)</hi> is given as the
                    northern boundary of the Roman part of the island. Its next appearance is in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Agricola</hi> of Tacitus (96 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi>
                    Here, both in the brief geographical description of Britain, chaps, x. and xi.,
                    and in the account of Agricola’s campaigns, chaps, xχv.- xxxviii., Caledonia is
                    unquestionably Britain north of the Firth of Forth. On turning to the geographer
                    Ptolemy <hi rend="italic">(circa</hi> 120 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> we
                    fail to meet with the term except as the name of one of the many tribes among
                    which he has parcelled out the “Bretannic Island, Albion.” To explain this it is
                    not necessary to assume that Ptolemy was ignorant of the wider acceptation in
                    which Caledonia had recently come to be employed among the Romans. It is more
                    reasonable to suppose that, as he avowedly drew the materials for his tables
                    from earlier, chiefly from Tyrian sources, he judged it prudent to follow in the
                    main long-recognized authorities. Yet even in Ptolemy we have an indication
                    either of the importance of the Caledonians among their neighbours or of the
                    occasional use of the word as a general name for all the northern tribes. Twice
                    he gives the Deucaledonian Ocean as bounding Britain on the north, that is,
                    after the necessary correction for his mistake in making the whole of the
                    northern part of the island trend to the east instead of to the north, as
                    washing the shores of modern Scotland on the west. Confused and inaccurate in
                    some respects as the Alexandrian geographer’s tables are, they, notwithstanding,
                    contain a surprising amount of information regarding the leading features of the
                    coast-line of Britain, the correctness of much of which can be verified by
                    existing names. His account of the tribes and their towns, especially towards
                    the north, is, as might have been expected, much less definite and trustworthy.
                    In order to be able to give here some notice of the Ptolemaic geography of North
                    Britain, Caledonia may for the moment be regarded as a synonymous term.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy’s error in turning the northern part of the island to the east has
                    already been noticed. How he was led into it there are no means of determining.
                    One effect of it is to exaggerate greatly the length of the Solway Firth and
                    displace the Hebrides from their true position, as may be seen by referring to
                    certain maps appended to several MSS. of the Geography and given with some
                    editions of it. The error can easily be rectified; and when this is done the
                    outline of the coast will be found to be wonderfully correct.<note

                    that follow is that of the text of Ptolemy (Wilberg’s), and not of the Latin

                    terms by means of Greek (perhaps originally Tyrian) characters, and it seems
                    undesirable to obscure them further by presenting them in those of another
                    language.</p></note> Commencing with the promontory of the Noouantai (Mull of
                    Galloway) in the south-west and proceeding northwards along the shores of the
                    Deucaledonian Ocean, we have in succession the Bay of Rerigonios (Loch Ryan),
                    the Bay of Ouindogara (Ayr), the estuary of the Klota (Clyde), the Bay of
                    Lelaamnonios (Loch Fyne), Cape Epidion (Mull of Kintyre), the outlets of the
                    River Longus (Loch Linnhe <hi rend="italic">1),</hi> outlets of the River Ituos,
                    Bay of Ouolsas (Lochalsh?), outlets of the River Nabaios, and Cape Tarouedoum or
                    Orkas (Dunnet Head). Coming down the east coast, said to be washed by the German
                    Ocean, we find Cape Ouirouedroum (Duncansbay Head), Cape Oueroubium (Noss Head
                    1), the outlets of the River Ila, the High Bank, outlets of the River Loxa,
                    estuary of the Ouarar (Moray Firth), estuary of the Touaisis (Spey ?), outlets
                    of the River Kelnios (Deveron 1), the promontory of the Taizalai (Kinnaird’s
                    Head), outlets of the River Deoua (Dee), estuary of the Taoua (Tay), outlets of
                    the River Tina, estuary of the Boderia (Firth of Forth), outlets of the River
                    Alaunos, outlets of the River Ouedra (Tyne?). On the south, bounded by the
                    Hibernian Ocean, we have the peninsula of the Noouantai (the Rhinns of
                    Galloway), outlets of the River Abraouannos (Luce ?), estuary of the Iena (Cree
                    ?), estuary of the Deoua (Dee), outlets of the River Noouios (Nith), outlets of
                    the Itouna (Eden).</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0734-0663"/> tribes, sixteen in number:—the Noouantai,
                    dwelling under (z.e., east) of the peninsula of the same name (Wigtonshire),
                    their towns Loukopibia and Retigonion; east of them the Selgoouai (along the
                    Solway Firth, and inland), their towns Karbantorigon, Ouxellon (Dumfries?),
                    Korda, Trimontion; still further east, the Otadinoi, probably along the
                    south-east coast, their towns Kouria and Bremenion; and the Damnonioi, occupying
                    apparently the basins of the Clyde, Forth, and Tay (in part), their towns
                    Kolania, Ouandouara (Ayr?), Koria. Alauna (Stirling?), Lindon, Ouiktoria (near
                    Perth); the Kaledonioi, in the district from Loch Fyne to the Moray Firth, with
                    the Caledonian forest to the west of them; eastward the Ouakomagoi (Banff and
                    parts of Moray and Aberdeen), their towns Banatia, Tameia, the Winged Camp,
                    Touaisis; east of these the Taizaloi (part of Aberdeenshire), their town Deouana
                    (Aberdeen), and the Ouenicones (Forfarshire), their town Orrea (Forfar ?); while
                    occupying the west of Argyll and Inverness, part of Ross-shire, and the whole of
                    Sutherland and Caithness, were in succession the Epidioi (in Kintyre), Kerones,
                    Kreones, Karnonakai, Karinoi, Kornauioi (Caithness), Decantai, Lougoi, and
                    Smertai. Near the promontory of Orkas were the islands of Okitis and Doumna;
                    north of which lay the Orkades (Orkneys), about thirty in number, and still
                    farther north Thoule (Shetland ?).</p>
                <p>Ptolemy’s description is the only detailed one we have till we come down to the
                    16th century. It is matter for regret that the <hi rend="italic">Antonine
                    Itinei'ary,</hi> so useful an aid to the identification of the Ptolemaic towns
                    in the southern part of the island, does not extend to the north, and that the
                    lists of the anonymous geographer of Ravenna are so corrupt as to be almost
                    useless. About the middle of the last century a new element of confusion was
                    introduced into what was tangled enough previously, by the publication of
                    Bertram’s well-known forgery <hi rend="italic">De Situ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannice,</hi> falsely ascribed to Richard of Cirencester, which being
                    accepted as genuine by Roy, Chalmers, Stuart, and others, has been the means of
                    giving currency to many unfounded notions regarding the nature and extent of the
                    Roman conquests in North Britain.</p>
                <p>The written history of Caledonia as well as of the rest of what is now Scotland
                    commences with the warlike operations in Britain of Agricola, the lieutenant of
                    the Emperor Domitian. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Britannia,</hi> p. 353.) In the
                    third year of his command this famous general, who was fortunate enough to have
                    his son-in-law Tacitus as his biographer, determined to attempt the annexation
                    of the northern portion of the island. Accordingly, in 80 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> he advanced as far as the estuary of the Taus, or as Wex reads, the
                    Tanaus. Whatever the true reading may be, the supposition that on this occasion
                    Agricola reached the Tay is untenable; though, whether the river referred to be
                    the English Tyne, the Tweed, or the Scotch Tyne, it is impossible to say. The
                    succeeding summer found him as far north as the isthmus formed by the firths of
                    Clota and Bodotria (Clyde and Forth). On it he erected a line of forts, with the
                    intention apparently of making it the northern boundary of the empire in those
                    parts. In the following year he crossed the Clota, and overran additional
                    territory “in that part of Britain which looks towards Ireland.” Information
                    having now reached him that the remoter and still unconquered tribes were
                    forming a combination against the Romans, he resolved to anticipate them, and
                    (83 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> carried the war beyond the Bodotria into the
                    country of the Caledonians. That summer an engagement was fought, which, though
                    it resulted in favour of the invaders, taught the Romans that they had no
                    ordinary foe to cope with. On the approach of winter both sides retired to their
                    quarters to make preparations for renewing the struggle. Next season (84)
                    Agricola, on resuming the offensive, found himself confronted by a grand union
                    of all the tribes of Caledonia, under a leader whom Tacitus names Galgacus. The
                    Roman general had previously despatched a fleet to ravage the coast, and on
                    continuing his march northwards, encountered the enemy, upwards of 30,000
                    strong, near Mount Graupius; for there can be little doubt that this, the
                    reading of Wex and Kritz, ought to be adopted instead of the Grampius of the
                    common editions. The exact locality of the conflict that ensued has been the
                    theme of much profitless controversy; but we shall probably not greatly err in
                    placing it somewhere on the borders of Kincardineshire. General Roy, whose
                    conjecture is usually followed, fixed on Ardoch in Perthshire. A careful study,
                    however, of the whole narrative leads one to look for the field of battle
                    farther north, and nearer the coast. Tacitus, writing on the model of Thucydides
                    and Livy, has put into the mouth of each leader, on the eve of the engagement, a
                    speech of his own composition, in which he describes the feelings that may be
                    supposed to have actuated the hostile armies. That ascribed to Galgacus is a
                    splendid specimen of polished sarcasm, mixed with impassioned appeals to the
                    patriotism of his hearers. Might, however, prevailed over right, and the
                    Caledonians were defeated with a loss of 10,000 men. Agricola, now thinking he
                    had pushed his conquests far enough, made no attempt to pursue his beaten foe,
                    but at once led his army back to the territory of the Boresti <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cd.</hi> Horesti), whose name is probably preserved in the modern Forfar. Here
                    he gave orders to the commander of his fleet to sail round the island, a feat
                    which the latter accomplished. Soon after he himself was recalled to Rome by his
                    jealous master.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding Agricola’s success, the Romans seem to have been quickly obliged
                    to abandon part of their conquests, for in less than forty years (129 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> Hadrian’s wall, which ran from the Tyne to the
                    Solway, became the northern limits of their empire in Britain. About twenty
                    years later a second Agricola appeared in the person of Lollius Urbicus, the
                    lieutenant of Antoninus Pius. Almost nothing is known of his actions, but he
                    seems to have once more carried the arms of Rome to the Clyde and Forth, if not
                    beyond them, and to have erected on the line of Agricola’s forts the more
                    substantial work now known by the name of the emperor he served (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Antoninus, Wall of).</hi> The natives must soon have recovered
                    the lost ground; but scarcely anything is known henceforth of the state of
                    affairs in the north till 208, when, if we may trust the historian Dion Cassius,
                    as abridged by Xiphiline, the Emperor Severus determined to attempt the
                    subjugation of the whole island. At that time the two most powerful tribes of
                    North Britain were the Maeatae, close to Hadrian’s Wall, and the Caledonians
                    beyond them. Protected by their native fastnesses, the latter offered him such a
                    resistance that, without being able to bring them to a decisive engagement, he
                    lost through disease, fatigue, and the sword, no fewer, it is said, than 50,000
                    men. Having reached what is termed the northern extremity of the island, but
                    which was in all likelihood merely the northern coast of Aberdeenshire, Severus
                    retreated southwards in a very feeble state of health, partly induced by the
                    fatigues he had undergone. A league formed the next year between the Caledonians
                    and the Maeatae, both of whom had already cast off his authority, led him to
                    make preparations for a new campaign, with the avowed determination of
                    extirpating the whole race. In the midst of these, however, he died at York in
                    210.</p>
                <p>For a whole century afterwards the ancient writers are almost silent regarding
                    Caledonia. In the year 310 we hear for the first time of the Picts; and in 367
                    Theodosius, an able Roman general, was sent into Britain by Valentinian I. to
                    defend the Britons of the south against the <pb break="no"

                    Ammianus Marcellinus as being the Picts divided into two tribes (the Dicaledones
                    and the Vecturiones), the Saxons, the Attacotti, and the Scots. He was so far
                    successful that the countries between the walls of Hadrian and Antoninus became
                    yet again a subjected province, named Valentian by Theodosius, in honour of the
                    emperor,—a conquest, however, which can have lasted but a brief period.
                    Henceforth, if we except the effusions of the poet Claudian, the scanty notices
                    of Britain to be met with during several succeeding centuries present the same
                    sad tale of sufferings inflicted on the now effeminate Britons of the south by
                    their warlike neighbours, till at length the settlement of large bodies of
                    Saxons in England changed the aspect of affairs.</p>
                <p>The etymology of the word Caledonia has been variously given. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Celydd</hi> (in Welsh, a woody shelter) is the popular derivation; but Isaac
                    Taylor <hi rend="italic">(Words and Places,</hi> p. 44) thinks the word may
                    possibly contain the root <hi rend="italic">gael,</hi> and if so, the
                    Caledonians would be the Gaels of the duns or hills. Equally obscure are the
                    ethnological relations of the people, the most probable opinion being that which
                    regards them as belonging to the British branch of the great Celtic family. A
                    casual inference, hazarded by Tacitus <hi rend="italic">(Agricola,</hi> chap,
                    xi.), that the red hair and large limbs of the inhabitants of Caledonia point
                    clearly to a German origin, must not be pressed too far. There were probably
                    even in his day Teutonic settlements along our eastern and northern shores, but
                    it seems too much to assume that that race was the dominant one north of the
                    Forth. It is a still more doubtful question to what race the Picts belonged. But
                    the discussion of these and other points belongs to the history of <hi
