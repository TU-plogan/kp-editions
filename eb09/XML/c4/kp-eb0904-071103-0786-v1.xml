                        de</hi></label> (1734-1802), a French statesman, was born at Douai in 1734.
                    He was descended from a good family and entered the profession of the law, in
                    which he rapidly attained success. He became in succession advocate to the
                    general council of Artois, <hi rend="italic">procureur</hi> to the parliament of
                    Douai, and finally master of requests, a dignity which gave him the right of
                    sitting in the general council. He seems to have been a man of great business
                    capacity, gay and careless in temperament, and thoroughly unscrupulous in
                    political action. In the terrible crisis of affairs preceding the French
                    Revolution, when minister after minister tried in vain to replenish the
                    exhausted royal treasury and was dismissed for want of success, Galonné was
                    summoned to take the general control of affairs. He assumed office in 1783, and
                    at first everything seemed to prosper. Money flowed in readily, and the gaiety
                    of the minister gave courage to the court. But his prosperity was hollow and
                    rested on no secure foundation. Calonne had levied taxes until it was impossible
                    to extract more from the impoverished people. He had borrowed till his credit
                    was entirely gone, and he at last found himself compelled to disclose to the
                    king the true state of affairs, and to lay before him what in his opinion was
                    the only measure that could restore France. The first step in this proposed plan
                    was the convocation of the notables, and the writs summoning them were issued in
                    December 1786. On the 22d February of the following year Calonne disclosed to
                    the notables his anxiously expected scheme for reconstituting the finances. The
                    main provisions of this plan were the redistribution of the taxes, so that the
                    whole might not fall on the unprivileged classes, the imposition of a land tax
                    on the revenues of the nobles, and of a similar tax on the incomes of the
                    clergy, and the abolition of <hi rend="italic">corvees</hi> and the <hi
                        rend="italic">gabelle.</hi> All Calonne’s eloquence could not succeed in
                    rendering this scheme palatable either to the notables or to the people. The
                    noblesse and clergy strenuously resisted any attempt to infringe upon their
                    privileges, and the people were beginning to feel that in a convocation
                    assembled to settle the affairs of France the nation itself had no part. Calonne
                    had opened the floodgates, and was powerless to resist the torrent. His fall,
                    however, was primarily due to the <pb break="no"

                    from office in April, and exiled to Lorraine. Soon afterwards he passed over to
                    England, and during his residence there kept up a polemical correspondence with
                    N^eckeron the finances. In 1789, when the States-General were about to assemble,
                    he crossed over to Flanders in the hope of being allowed to offer himself for
                    election, but he was sternly forbidden to enter France. In revenge he joined the
                    Bourbon party at Coblentz, wrote in their favour, and expended nearly all the
                    fortune brought him by his wife, a wealthy widow. In 1802, having again taken up
                    his abode in London, he received permission from Napoleon to return .to France.
                    He died 30th October 1802, about a month after his arrival in his native
                    country. Calonne was the author of several works on the financial and political
                    condition of France during the period of the Revolution, which are still of
                    value.</p>
