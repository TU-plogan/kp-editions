                <p><label type="entry">CANNIBALISM</label>, the eating of human flesh by men. This
                    practice has existed from the most ancient times, and has given rise to
                    descriptive terms such as Gr. <hi rend="italic">άνθρωποφάγος</hi> (Lat. <hi
                    rend="italic">anthropophagite),</hi> Anglo-Sax. <hi rend="italic">man-oeta,</hi>
                    Eng. <hi rend="italic">man-eater.</hi> Since the discovery of the New World, the
                    name of the <hi rend="italic">Cartt&gt;s</hi> of the West India Islands,
                    recorded by Columbus under the Latinized forms <hi rend="italic">Canibales</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Caribales,</hi> has come into popular use as a generic term
                    for man-eaters, <hi rend="italic">cannibals.</hi></p>
                <p>Man being by nature carnivorous as well as frugivorous, and human flesh being not
                    unfit for human food, the question first arises why mankind generally have not
                    only avoided it, but have looked with horror on exceptional individuals and
                    races addicted to cannibalism. It is evident on consideration that both
                    emotional and religious motives must have contributed to bring about this
                    prevailing state of mind. Siinple association of thoughts causes the remains of
                    a dead kinsman or friend to be treated with respect and tenderness, as may be
                    seen from the conduct of some of the rudest races. Acting in another way, the
                    same ideal association attaches the horror of death to anything connected with
                    the dead, so that many tribes will avoid the mention of a dead man’s name, and
                    will even abandon his hut, and destroy the furniture he has used; this sentiment
                    must tend to preserve the corpse from violation. Moreover, the religious
                    doctrine that the soul outlives the body, continuing in ghostly shape to visit
                    the living, and retaining a certain connection with the mortal remains it once
                    inhabited, has evidently led the survivors to propitiate this honoured and
                    dreaded spirit by respectful disposal of the corpse. Taking this combination of
                    causes into consideration, it is readily understood why aversion to cannibalism
                    must be taken as a rule established at a very early stage of culture, and we
                    have only to consider what causes have from time to time led to its infraction.
                    The principal of these have been the pressure of famine, the fury of hatred, and
                    sometimes even a morbid kindness, with certain motives of magic and religion, to
                    which must be added the strong tendency of cannibalism, once started in any of
                    these ways, to develop a confirmed appetite which will afterwards be indulged
                    for its own sake.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Famine.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The records of
                    shipwrecks and sieges prove that famine will sometimes overcome the horror of
                    cannibalism among men of the higher nations. Thus it is not surprising that
                    savages, from their want of food adapted <pb break="no"

                    improvidence, should in severe climates be often driven to this extremity. For
                    example, it is known that the miserable natives of Tierra del Fuego, when
                    starving in winter, would throttle and devour the oldest woman of the party;
                    when asked why they did not rather kill their dogs, they replied, “Dog catch
                    otters!” (Fitzroy, <hi rend="italic">Voy. of Adventure and Beagle,</hi> vol. ii.
                    p. 183). For accounts of cannibalism and murder under stress of hunger in

                    rend="italic">—</hi> The North American Indian phrases as to eating the flesh
                    and drinking the blood of their enemies are not to be taken as mere metaphor,
                    but as referring to acts really done. There is even an Iroquois legend of a
                    dialogue between the Manitu (Great Spirit) and a warrior who defends the eating
                    of slain enemies as satisfying at once hunger and revenge (Crèvecoeur, <hi
                    rend="italic">Journey in Pennsylvania</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Klemm, <hi
                    rend="italic">Allgemeine</hi><hi rend="italic">Culturgeschichte,</hi> vol. ii.
                    p. 28). For actual details of this ferocious custom see Schoolcraft, <hi
                    rend="italic">Indian Tribes,</hi> vol. iii. p. 242; Hennepin, vol. ii. p. 159;
                    J. G. Müller, <hi rend="italic">Amerikanische Urreligionen,</hi> p. 145; Waitz,
                    vol. iii. p. 159. Among the Polynesians, there is similar evidence of warriors
                    devouring the flesh and drinking the blood of the slain enemy, where the purpose
                    seems clearly that of inspiring terror and gratifying vengeance. (See Ellis, <hi
                    rend="italic">Polynesian Researches,</hi> vol. i. p. 309; Turner, <hi
                    rend="italic">Polynesia,</hi> p. 194; Waitz, vol. vi. p. 158.)</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Morbid Affection.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Cases of
                    the dead being devoured by relatives and friends (especially children by
                    parents) from a sentiment of affection are recorded among low savage tribes, see
                    Spix and Martius, <hi rend="italic">Reise</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Brasilien,</hi> vol. ii. p. 692; Angas, <hi rend="italic">Savage

                    der Naturvölker,</hi> p. 66. Such accounts are not, however, numerous, and
                    sometimes, at least, may properly belong to other classes. The most remarkable
                    is the often-quoted passage of Herodotus (iv. 26), describing the funeral feasts
                    of the Issedones of Central Asia, where the relatives ate the body of the
                    deceased with other meat, the skull being set in gold and preserved; these were
                    sacred rites done in honour of the dead. As lately as the 13 th century, William
                    of Ruysbruck was told that the people of Tibet had till recently kept up this
                    custom of eating their deceased parents, and still used their skulls as
                    drinking-cups (Rubruquis in <hi rend="italic">Pinkerton's Coll, of Voyages,</hi>
                    vol. vii. p. 54).</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Magic.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Few notions belonging
                    to primitive savage magic are more intelligible or more widely spread than the
                    belief that the qualities of any animal eaten will pass into the eater. This
                    motive naturally leads to cannibalism (see Stanbridge, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trans. Ethnological Soc.,</hi> vol. i. p. 289), especially in war, whore the
                    conqueror eats part of the slain enemy with the avowed purpose of making himself
                    brave. This idea is found among the natives of Australia (see Macgillivray, <hi
                    rend="italic">Voyage of Rattlesnake,</hi> vol. i. p. 152, vol. ii. p. 6), and
                    not less distinctly in New Zealand (Ellis, vol. i. p. 358); among the North
                    American Indians, when warriors would devour the flesh of a brave enemy, and
                    particularly the heart as the seat of courage (Keating, <hi rend="italic">Long's
                    Expedition,</hi> vol. i. p. 102); also in Ashantee (J. L. Wilson, <hi
                    rend="italic">Western Africa,</hi> p. 168). An English merchant in Shanghai,
                    during the Taeping siege, met his Chinese servant carrying the heart of a rebel,
                    which he was taking home to eat to make him brave (Tylor, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Early History of Mankind,</hi> p. 133). The imagined value of human flesh in
                    giving magical powers to the eater is known to the savage world both in
                    Australia and America (Eyre, <hi rend="italic">Central Australia,</hi> vol. ii.
                    pp. 255, 329; Angas, vol. i. p. 123; Keating, vol. i. p. 103; Waitz, vol. iii.
                    p. 159, vol. vi. p. 748). This idea even holds a place in the more cultured
                    magical traditions of Asiatic and European nations (see Gerland, p. 66;
                    Schaafhausen, in <hi rend="italic">Archiv für Anthropologie,</hi> vol. iv. p.
                    247).</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Religion.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> One of the strongest
                    reasons for considering anthropophagy as having widely prevailed in prehistoric
                    ages is the fact of its being deeply ingrained in savage and barbaric religions,
                    whose gods are so often looked upon as delighting in human flesh and blood. The
                    flesh of sacrificed human victims may even serve to provide cannibal feasts. The
                    understood meaning of these rites may be either that the bodies of the victims
                    are vicariously consumed by the worshippers, or that the gods themselves feed on
                    the spirits of the slain men, their bodies being left to the priests and people.
                    Thus in Fiji, “of the great offerings of food, native belief apportions merely
                    the <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> thereof to the gods, who are described as being
                    enormous eaters; the substance is consumed by the worshippers. Cannibalism is a
                    part of the Fijian religion, and the gods are described as delighting in human
                    flesh " (T. Williams, <hi rend="italic">Fiji and the Fijians,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    231). In Mexico, the anthropophagy which prevailed was distinctly religious in
                    its origin and professed purpose. That the primary meaning of the human
                    sacrifice was to present victims to their deities is shown by the manner in
                    which the sacrificing priest, who tore out the heart, offered it to the sun, and
                    afterwards went through ceremonies of feeding the idol with the heart and blood.
                    It was the Aztec worship of the war-god Huitzilopochtli which brought on the
                    enormous prevalence of sacrifices of prisoners; to obtain supplies of such
                    captives became a motive for frequent wars; and it was the limbs of these
                    victims which were eaten in the sacrificial feasts that formed part of the
                    festivals. (For particulars and authorities see Prescott, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conquest of Mexico</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Bancroft, vol. ii.; Waitz, vol.
                    iv.) In Africa, also, cannibalism has in some cases evidently a sacrificial
                    character (see Lander, <hi rend="italic">Records,</hi> vol. ii. p. 250; T. J.
                    Hutchinson, <hi rend="italic">Ten Years among Ethiopians,</hi> p. 62,
                    &amp;c.)</p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Habit.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The extent to which
                    anthropophagy has been carried among some nations is, no doubt, mainly due to
                    the indulgence of the appetite once aroused. In such cases this reason is openly
                    avowed, or some earlier motive remains rather in pretext than in reality, or the
                    practice is justified on the ground of ancestral custom. It seems, for instance,
                    that the cannibal feasts of old Mexico had become in themselves acceptable to
                    the people, and that we must refer the sickening horrors of Fijian anthropophagy
                    more to sensual gratification than to any religious motive. Among conspicuous
                    cannibal races may be mentioned the semi-civilized Battas of Sumatra, whose
                    original instigation to eating their enemies may have been warlike ferocity, but
                    who are described as treating human flesh as a delicacy, and devouring not only
                    war-captives but criminals, slaves, and, according to one story, their aged
                    kinsfolk (Junghuhn, <hi rend="italic">Batta-länder</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    Marsden, <hi rend="italic">Hist, of Sumatra,</hi> p. 390; see also Wuttke, <hi
                    rend="italic">Geschichte</hi><hi rend="italic">des Heidenthums,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    172; Friedmann in <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift für Ethnologie,</hi> 1871, p.
                    313). Cannibalism assumes its most repulsive form where human flesh is made an
                    ordinary article of food like other meat. This state of things is not only
                    mentioned in past times in descriptions of West Africa, where human flesh was
                    even sold in the market (see Pigafetta, <hi rend="italic">Regnum Congo,</hi> in
                    De Bry; Wuttke, vol. i. p. 171), but still continues among the Monbuttu of
                    Central Africa, whose wars with neighbouring tribes are carried on for the
                    purpose of obtaining human flesh, the bodies of the slain being dried for <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n892/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0892-0809"/> transport, while the living prisoners are driven
                    off like cattle (Schweinfurth, <hi rend="italic">Heart of Africa,</hi> and in
                    <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift für Ethnologie,</hi> vol. v. p. 9). Where
                    cannibalism for its own sake becomes popular among a warlike people, its effect
                    in thinning population, and even in exterminating weak tribes, becomes
                    perceptible. This subject has been investigated by Gerland <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Aussterben der Naturvölker,</hi> p. 61).</p>
                <p>As to the history of anthropophagy, the most interesting question is whether at
                    any early period it was ever a general habit of the human irace. This has been
                    debated on the evidence of prehistoric human remains (see Schaafhausen, <hi
                    rend="italic">ubi</hi><hi rend="italic">supra,</hi> p. 264; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proceedings</hi> of Congresses of Prehistoric Archaeology, Paris and
                    Copenhagen. It has been well argued that had the men of the quaternary period
                    been cannibals, we should find the bones generally cracked for the marrow like
                    those of beasts, which is not the case (Le Hon, <hi rend="italic">L’Homme
                    Fossile,</hi> p. 68); also that, as regards the ancient people of the
                    shell-mounds, had they eaten their own species they would have thrown the human
                    bones into the rubbish heaps with those of beasts and fishes (Lubbock, <hi
                    rend="italic">Prehistoric Times,</hi> p. 232). The discovery of some few ancient
                    human remains, the state of which seems to indicate that the flesh had been
                    eaten, may perhaps be taken to show that prehistoric savages were in this
                    respect like those of modern times, neither free from cannibalism nor
                    universally practising it. During later ages, it may have even increased rather
                    than diminished with the growth of population,—its greatest excesses being found
                    among high savage tribes or nations above the savage level. But with the rise of
                    civilization to its middle and upper levels, it is more and more kept down by
                    the growing sense of the dignity of man, and eventually disappears, as we may
                    hope, irrevocably. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. b. t.)</hi></p>
