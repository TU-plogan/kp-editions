                    centuries before Geoffrey of Monmouth, says (c. 56), “Bellum gestum est in urbe
                    Leogis, quae Britannice Cair Lion dicitur.”</p></note> and there can be no doubt
                    that the place was the station of the second Augustan legion, and ranked as a
                    colony and capital of Britannia Secunda in the period of Roman dominion. The
                    existing remains of ancient Caerleon still <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> are
                    unimportant, consisting only of fragments of the city walls and a grass-grown
                    amphitheatre (comprising an area of 222 feet by 192 feet), in which the tiers of
                    seats are indistinctly visible. The hamlet on the opposite bank of the river
                    preserves its Roman name of <hi rend="italic">Ultra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pontem,</hi> and it is probable that the connecting bridge was a pontoon
                    similar in character to that which survived to the close of the last century.
                    The local museum is rich in objects of interest, collected (chiefly through the
                    zeal of Mr J. E. Lee, the author of <hi rend="italic">Isca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Silurum),</hi> either in Caerleon or its immediate neighbourhood. It includes a
                    tesselated pavement of much beauty brought from Caerwent, four Tuscan pillars
                    which are thought to have supported a temple of Diana, a large number of
                    inscribed and sepulchral stones, a series of coins from the time of Otho to that
                    of Honorius, stone coffins, <hi rend="italic">amphoroe,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >antefixa,</hi> amulets, enamels, and Samian ware Of home and foreign
                    manufacture. It is remarkable that on two inscriptions the name of G eta (the
                    younger son of Severus) has been mutilated and partially effaced—evidence of the
                    hatred in which the civil governor was held by his brother Caracalla. In the
                    recent restoration of the Parish church (in style Early English, with traces of
                    rude Norman) a good deal of Roman masonry was brought to light, and upon the
                    hill side, which formed the burial place of the ancient city, fragments of urns
                    and memorial slabs are even now often exhumed. Enough has been discovered to
                    prove that Caerleon was a place of great importance in Roman times, but not
                    enough to support the hyperbolical language of Giraldus Cambrensis (borrowed
                    from Geoffrey of Monmouth) that its “splendid palaces, with their gilded roofs,
                    once emulated the grandeur of Rome” (bk. ix. c. 12).</p>
                <p>Although the chief historic interest attaching to Caerleon is derived from the
                    impress left upon it by Roman occupation, it has also a less substantial claim
                    to notice in connection with the romance of Arthur and the Round Table. It was
                    hither the “blameless king” came at Pentecost to b3 crowned, and made high
                    festival with the chieftains from Lothian and Orkney, from Gower and Carados.
                    Here, too, if we follow the laureate’s version, Arthur took counsel with
                    “Dubric, the high saint” and Guinevere climbed—</p>
                <p>“The giant tower, from whose high crest, they say, Men saw the goodly hills of
                    Somerset, And white sails flying on the yellow sea.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">{Idylls of the King, Enid.)</hi></p>
                <p>The lofty mound upon which this tower is said to have stood is close to the Roman
                    amphitheatre, to which the name of Arthur’s Round Table has been given. The
                    tumulus is evidently artificial, and may perhaps have supported the keep of the
                    castle mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Domesday,</hi> the ruins of which, now
                    limited to a solitary bastion on the river side, were very extensive even in
                    Leland’s time.</p>
                <p>The grantee of Caerieon at the Norman Conquest was William de Scohies, and the
                    lordship was subsequently enjoyed by the Crown and the great families of Clare
                    and Mortimer. From the latter it devolved to King Edward IV., and in later times
                    has been held by the Morgans of Llantarnam and the Howes, Lords Chedworth. The
                    chief proprietor at the present time is Sir Digby Mackworth, Bart.</p>
                <p>The ecclesiastical history of Caerleon reaches back to the first introduction of
                    Christianity into Britain, when it was constituted the seat of an archbishopric.
                    It sent a representative to the councils of Sardis (347 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.)</hi> and Rimini (359); and in the persecution of Diocletian during the
                    previous century two of its citizens, Aaron and Julius, are said to have
                    suffered martyrdom. The see was transferred to St David’s in the 11 th century,
                    and at the present time Caerleon is included within the diocese of Llandaff.
                    Some remains of a Cistercian priory may still be traced, but even the memory of
                    Dubricius, the stout opponent of the Pelagian heresy, has perished with his
                    dwelling-place. (c. J. K.)</p>
