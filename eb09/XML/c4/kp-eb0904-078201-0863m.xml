                <p>NAVIGABLE canals may perhaps be most conveniently treated under two classes, <hi
                    rend="italic">Barge</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Boat</hi> Canals, now in many
                    cases almost superseded by railways and <hi rend="italic">Ship</hi> Canals,
                    which, judging from the stupendous works of this class recently executed and now
                    in contemplation, seem as yet far from having exhausted the important aids they
                    are destined to afford to navigation.</p>
                <p>After giving a historical notice of early canals, the following article contains
                    a brief notice of Barge Canals; a digest of general engineering principles
                    applicable to the construction of all canals; an account of Ship Canals recently
                    constructed; and a notice of Ship Canals which have been proposed and are ere
                    long likely to be carried into execution for facilitating ocean navigation.</p>
                <p>From the writings of Herodotus, Aristotle, Pliny, and other ancient historians,
                    we learn that canals existed in Egypt before the Christian era; and there is
                    reason to believe that at the same early period artificial inland navigation
                    also existed in China. Almost nothing, however, save their existence has been
                    recorded with reference to these very early works; but soon after the
                    commencement of the Christian era canals were introduced and gradually extended
                    throughout Europe, particularly in Greece, Italy, Spain, Russia, Sweden,
                    Holland, and France.</p>
                <p>In speaking, however, of the earliest of these works, it is not to be supposed
                    that they resembled the modern canals now constructed in our own and other
                    countries. Early as inland navigation was introduced, it was not until the
                    invention of canal-locks, by which boats could be transferred from one level to
                    another, that inland navigation became generally applicable and useful, and it
                    has been truly remarked “that to us, living in an age of steam-engines and
                    daguerreotypes, it might appear strange that an invention so simple in itself as
                    the canal-lock, and founded on properties of fluids little recondite, should
                    have escaped the acuteness of Egypt, Greece, and Rome.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi> No.
                    cxlvi. p. 281</p></note> Not only, however, had the invention escaped the notice
                    of the ancients, but what is more striking, the several gradations made towards
                    the attainment of that simple but valuable improvement appear to have been so
                    gradual that, like many discoveries of importance, great doubts exist as to the
                    <hi rend="italic">person</hi> and even the <hi rend="italic">nation</hi> that
                    was the first to introduce canal-locks. One class of writers attributes the
                    discovery to the Dutch, and Messrs Telford and Nimmo, who wrote the article
                    “Inland Navigation” in Brewster’s <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encydopaedia,</hi>
                    adopt the conclusion that locks were used in Holland nearly a century before
                    their application in Italy; while, on the other hand, the invention has been
                    strongly and not unreasonably claimed for engineers of the Italian school, and
                    in particular for Leonardo da Vinci, the celebrated engineer and painter.<note

                    Canals,</hi> p. 154.</p></note> Without, however, entering into a discussion of
                    this question, which it is now perhaps impossible to solve, we may safely state
                    that during <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n864/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0864-0783"/> the 14th century the introduction of locks,
                    whether of Dutch or Italian origin, gave a new character to inland navigation,
                    and laid the basis of its rapid and successful extension. And here it may be
                    proper to remark, that the early canals of China and Egypt, although destitute
                    of locks, do not appear to have been on that account formed on a uniformly level
                    line, unadapted to varying heights. It is very doubtful, indeed, if the use of
                    locks has even yet been introduced into China, intersected as it is by many
                    canals of great antiquity and extent, the imperial canal being about 1000 miles
                    in length. “This canal appears to have been completed in 1289, and is said to
                    extend fora distance of forty days’ navigation, and is provided with many
                    sluices, and when vessels arrive at these sluices they are hoisted by means of
                    machinery, whatever be their size, and let down on the other side into the
                    water.” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Nevertheless the invention of locks was,
                    as has been stated, a most important step in the history of canals; and that
                    mode of surmounting elevations may be said to be almost universally adopted
                    throughout Europe and America. Inclined planes and perpendicular lifts have, it
                    is true, been employed in those countries, as will be noticed hereafter; but the
                    instances of their application are undoubtedly rare.</p>
                <p>But without tracing the gradual introduction of canals from country to country,
                    we remark at once that we find the French at the end of the 17th century, in the
                    reign of Louis XIV., forming the Languedoc Canal, designed by Biquet, between
                    the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean, a gigantic work, which was finished in
                    1681. It is 148 miles in length, and the summit level is 600 feet above the sea,
                    while the works on its line embrace upwards of one hundred locks and fifty
                    aqueducts, an undertaking which is a lasting monument of the skill and
                    enterprize of its projectors; and with this work as a model it seems strange
                    that Britain should not, till nearly a century after its execution, have been
                    engaged in vigorously following so laudable an example. This seems the more
                    extraordinary, as the Romans in early times had executed works in England,
                    which, whatever might have been their original use, whether for the purposes of
                    navigation or drainage, were ultimately, and that even at an early period,
                    converted into navigable canals. Of these works we particularly specify the Caer
                    Dyke and Foss Dyke cuts in Lincolnshire, which are by general consent admitted
                    to have been of Roman origin. The former extends from Peterborough to the River
                    Witham near the city of Lincoln, a distance of about 40 miles; and the latter
                    extends from Lincoln to the River Trent, near Torksey, a distance of 11
                    miles.</p>
                <p>Of the Caer Dyke the name only now remains; but the Foss Dyke, though of Roman
                    origin, still exists, and as it is the oldest British canal, the reader may be
                    interested to ]earn the following facts as to its history. Camden in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Britannia</hi> states that the Foss Dyke was a cut originally made
                    by the Romans, probably for water supply or drainage, and that it was deepened
                    and rendered in some measure navigable in the year 1121 by Henry I. In 1762 it
                    was reported on by Smeaton and Grundy, who found the depth at that time to be
                    about 2 feet 8 inches. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> They, however, discouraged
                    the idea of deepening by excavation. They say they found “the bottom to be
                    either a rotten peat earth, or else a running sand,” and that though the
                    deepening of the navigation is in “nature possible,” yet it “cannot be effected
                    without removing one of the banks in order to widen the same,” which would not
                    only turn out expensive, but would “occasion much loss of time and profit to the
                    proprietor while the work is executing.” Nothing followed on this report; but in
                    1782 Smeaton was again called in, and deepened the navigation to 3 feet 6
                    inches, not, however, by widening the canal or dredging, but by raising the
                    water-level 10 inches. <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> From that period nothing
                    more was done to enlarge the water-way, or adapt it to increased traffic.
                    Meantime the adjoining Witham navigation having been improved, the defects of
                    old Foss became more apparent, and in 1838 Mr Vignoles was consulted, and made
                    an elaborate report on alternative schemes for increasing the depth to 4 and 6
                    feet; nothing, however, was done till 1840, when Messrs Stevenson were employed
                    to design works for assimilating the Foss Dyke as far as practicable, both as
                    regards width and depth, to the navigable channel of the Witham. The depth w as
                    found to be 3 feet 10 inches, and its breadth in many places was insufficient to
                    admit of two boats passing each other, and for their convenience occasional
                    passing places had been provided. It was resolved to increase the dimensions of
                    the canal, and to repair the whole work. Accordingly it was widened to the <hi
                    rend="italic">minimum</hi> breadth of 45 feet, and deepened to the extent of 6
                    feet throughout. The entrance lock communicating with the River Trent at Torksey
                    was renewed, and a pumping engine was erected for supplying water from the Trent
                    during dry seasons, and thus that ancient canal, which is quoted by Telford and
                    Nimmo as “the oldest artificial canal in Britain,” was restored to a state of
                    perfect efficiency, at a cost of £40,000, and now forms an important connecting
                    link between the Trent and Witham navigations.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the existence of this early work, however, and of some others in
                    the country, particularly the Sankey Brook navigation, opened in 1760, it cannot
                    be doubted that the formation of the Bridgewater Canal in Lancashire, the Act
                    for which was obtained in 1759, was the commencement of British Barge Canal
                    Navigation, of which we propose first to treat, and that Francis, duke of
                    Bridgewater, and Brindley the engineer, who were its projectors, were the first
                    to give a practical impulse to a class of works which, under the guidance mainly
                    of Smeaton, Watt, Jessop, Nimmo, Rennie, and Telford, has been very generally
                    adopted throughout the country, and has undoubtedly been of vast importance in
                    promoting its commercial prosperity. <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi></p>
                <p>According to Mr Smiles, the barge-canals laid out by Brindley, although not all

                <p>It is believed that the length of the inland boat navigations constructed in
                    Britain exceeds 4700 miles, and the system has been extensively carried out both
                    in Europe and America. Many of them were made at great cost through hills and
                    over valleys. The Harecastle tunnel on the Grand Trunk Canal, made by Brindley,
                    and afterwards doubled by Telford, is nearly a mile and a half in length, and
                    the Pont-y-Cyssylte aqueduct, on the Ellesmere Canal, over the Dee, constructed
                    by Telford at a cost of £47,000, has nineteen openings 45 feet span, and is

                <p>It must be obvious, that to construct a navigable channel through a country
                    varying in level, and affording, perhaps, no great facilities for obtaining a
                    supply of water, infers high engineering skill. Vast reservoirs must in some
                    cases be formed for storing the water necessary to supply, during dry seasons,
                    the loss by lockage, leakage, and evaporation. Feeders must be made to lead this
                    water to the canal, hills must be pierced by tunnels, valleys must be crossed on
                    lofty embankments, or spanned by spacious aqueducts, and, above all, the whole
                    must be conceived and laid out with scrupulous regard to the all-impcιtant
                    object of securing the works against injury from an overflow of water during
                    floods, and a consequent inundation of the surrounding country. Moreover, the
                    necessity of laying out the canal in level stretches, and surmounting elevations
                    by means of locks or inclined planes, occurring at intervals, often occasions
                    much difficulty and greatly restricts the resources of the engineer. Taking,
                    then, all these circumstances into consideration, and bearing in mind that
                    canals were the pioneers of railways, we think it may safely be affirmed that
                    the canal engineers of former days had more serious <hi rend="italic"
                    >physical</hi> difficulties to contend with than are experienced in carrying out
                    the railways of modern times, if we except such works as the Britannia Bridge,
                    the high-level bridge of Newcastle, the Boxhill tunnel, and some other kindred
                    works. But, indeed, their <hi rend="italic">mechanical</hi> difficulties were
                    also greater, for the introduction of steam, and its wide-spread application to
                    all engineering operations, afford facilities to the engineers of the present
                    day which Smeaton at the Eddystone, Stevenson at the Bell Rock, and Rennie and
                    Telford in their early navigation works, did not enjoy. The distinguished merits
                    of the engineers who practised in the former and at the commencement of the
                    present century, cannot indeed be over-estimated, and had it been within the
                    scope of this article it would have been profitable and instructive to have
                    described in detail some, of the grand aqueducts and other works on the lines of
                    our canals. For this reference is made to the articles <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Aqueduct, Bridge, Tunnel,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Reservoir,</hi> all of
                    which are more or less applicable to the formation of canals. We shall only
                    therefore offer to the student the following summary of engineering principles
                    generally applicable to all cases.</p>
                <p>A canal cannot be properly worked without a supply of water calculated to last
                    over the driest season of the year, and in that respect, except as to the
                    quality of the water, demands all the care requisite in investigating the
                    sources of water for supplying towns. If there be no <hi rend="italic"
                    >natural</hi> lake in the district, available for supply and storage, the
                    engineer must select situations suitable for artificial reservoirs, and the
                    conditions to be attended to in selecting their positions are the same as those
                    for water-works. They must command a sufficient area of drainage to supply the
                    loss by leakage, evaporation, and lockage, due to the length of canal, number
                    and size of the locks, and probable amount of traffic. The capability of the
                    district to afford this supply will depend on the area of the basin drained and
                    the annual amount of rainfall. The offlets from the reservoirs must be at such
                    an elevation as to convey water to the summit-level of the canal. The
                    embankments for retaining the water must be erected on sites affording a
                    favourable foundation, and, if possible, in situations where an embankment of
                    small height and length may dam up a large amount of water. It is further
                    necessary to consider whether the subsoil of the valley forming the reservoirs
                    is throughout of so retentive a nature as to prevent leakage, and it is
                    essential to provide, by means of waste weirs, for the discharge of floods. The
                    Caledonian Canal, to be afterwards noticed, is in this respect very favourably
                    situated, the whole supply being obtained from natural lochs. In other cases,
                    such as the Union, Forth and Clyde, Crinan, Birmingham, and other canals, it was
                    necessary to construct large reservoirs in which the water is stored in winter
                    and led in feeders to points convenient for supplying the canal in summer. Where
                    the canal communicates with the sea or a tidal river, and where the natural
                    supply is small, as at the Foss Dyke already referred to, the water is raised by
                    pumping engines. It will readily be seen, therefore, how important it is to
                    reduce to a <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> the loss of water due to leakage from
                    deficient workmanship, as well as to lockage of the traffic through the canal,
                    and (while on this subject) it may be stated that the <hi rend="italic">up</hi>
                    consumes a greater amount of water than the <hi rend="italic">down</hi> traffic,
                    for an <hi rend="italic">ascending</hi> boat on entering a lock displaces a
                    volume of water equal to its submerged capacity; the water so displaced flows
                    into the lower reach of the canal and the lower gates are closed, the boat is
                    then raised, and on passing into the higher reach of the canal its displacement
                    lost on entering is supplied by water withdrawn from the higher reach. A <hi
                    rend="italic">descending</hi> boat, on the other hand, on entering a lock
                    likewise displaces a volume of water equal to its submerged capacity, but the
                    water in this case flows back into the higher reach of the canal, where it is
                    retained when the gates are closed. Mr Fulton gives the consumption of 25-ton
                    boats through locks of 8 feet lift as about 163 tons of water in ascending, and
                    103 in descending.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    proposals have been made for reducing the loss of water by side ponds to receive
                    part of the water, but all such plans delay the traffic and have not come into
                    general use.</p>
                <p>The barge-canals constructed in this country are between 4 and 5 feet in depth.
                    When the soil in which they were made was retentive, they were formed as shown
                    in the cross-section, fig. 1. But when the soil was porous, clay puddle was
                    introduced, as shown in fig. 2. Professor Rankine says the depth of water and
                    sectional area of water-way should be such as not to cause any material increase
                    of the resistance to the motion of the boats beyond what it would encounter in
                    open water, and gives the following rules as fulfilling these conditions :—</p>
                <p>Least breadth at bottom = 2 × greatest breadth of boat.</p>
                <p>Least depth of water — 1⅛ foot + greatest draught of boat.</p>
                <p>Least area of water-way = 6 × greatest midship section of boat.</p>
                <p>In laying out a line of canal the engineer is more restricted than in forming the
                    route of a road or. railway, where gradients can be introduced to suit the
                    undulating surface of the country. A canal, on the contrary, must follow rigidly
                    the bases of hills and windings of valleys, to preserve a uniform level,
                    accommodation being made for the road traffic by erecting suitable “fixed” and
                    “movable” bridges. It is important, as already stated, to lay out the work in
                    long level reaches, and to overcome <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">cumulo</hi> by groups of locks at places where it can be most
                    advantageously done. This leads to a saving of attendance and expense in working
                    the canal, and causes fewer stoppages to the traffic. But to prevent waste of
                    water the locks must be placed sufficiently far apart, say 100 yards, or an
                    intervening pond or increased width of canal must be formed, so that a
                    descending boat does not let off more water than the area below will receive
                    without raising its surface so much as to lose the surplus water over the waste
                    weirs. The mode of overcoming the difference of level between the various level
                    reaches is, with few exceptions, by locks, which generally have a lift of 8 or
                    10 feet, though in some cases it is somewhat greater. The dimensions of the
                    locks ought to be regulated by the traffic; but they should, in order to save
                    water, be as nearly as possible the size of the craft to be passed through them,
                    allowing from 6 inches to a foot of extra breadth and draught of water. The
                    barge-canals in England have locks about 8 feet in breadth, and from 70 to 80
                    feet long, and their use in raising or lowering boats from the different reaches
                    is so well known as not to require explanation; and for details as to the
                    construction of the masonry of the chamber and walls, and the timber and iron
                    work of the gates and sluices, reference is made to “Rankine’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Engineering”</hi> The water is generally admitted into and flows from each lock
                    by sluices formed in the gates, and the passage of a boat occupies from three to
                    six minutes, depending on the lift. Sir William Cubitt, on the Severn
                    navigation, introduced the water through a culvert parallel to the side wall of
                    the lock, and opening in the centre by means of a tunnel, which admits of 16,000
                    cubic feet of water flowing into or out of the lock in 1½ minute; and in little
                    more than that time loaded vessels can be passed through.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Inclined planes and perpendicular lifts, which have the advantage of saving
                    water, were adopted so long ago as 1789 on the Ketling Canal in Shropshire, and
                    afterwards on the duke of Bridgewater’s canal. Mr Douglas of New York
                    constructed the Morris Canal in the United States with 23 inclined planes,
                    having gradients of about 1 in 10, with an average lift of 58 feet. The boats
                    weighed, when loaded, 50 tons, and after being grounded on a carriage, were
                    raised by water-power up the inclines with great ease and expedition. The length
                    of the Morris Canal, between the rivers Hudson and Delaware, is 101 miles, and
                    the whole rise and fall is 1557 feet, of which 223 were overcome by locks, and
                    the remaining 1334 by inclined planes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    work the author stated that the principal objection to the inclined planes for
                    moving boats was the injury they were apt to sustain in supporting great weights
                    while resting on the cradle. A slimly-built canal boat, 80 feet long, and loaded
                    with 30 tons, could not be grounded on a smooth surface without straining her
                    timbers, but this objection has to some extent been overcome on an inclined
                    plane constructed by Mr Leslie and Mr Bateman on the Monkland Canal, where the
                    boats are not wholly grounded on the carriage, but are transported in a caisson
                    of boiler-plate containing 2 feet of water, and are thus <hi rend="italic"
                    >τvatcr-borne.</hi> This inclined plane is wrought by two high-pressure
                    steam-engines of 25 horse-power each. The height is 96 feet, and the gradient 1
                    in 10. The maximum weight raised is 80 tons, and the transit takes about ten
                    minutes. The average number of boats passing over the incline is about 7500 per
                    annum. Mr Green introduced on the Great Western Canala perpendicular lift of 46
                    feet. Sir W. Cubitt also introduced three inclined planes, having gradients of 1
                    in 8, on the Chard Canal, Somersetshire.</p>
                <p>One of these inclines overcomes a rise of 86 feet; and they are said to act very
                    satisfactorily.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>An essential adjunct to a canal is a sufficient number of waste-weirs to
                    discharge surplus water accumulating during floods, which, if not provided with
                    an exit, may overflow the tow-path, and cause a breach in the banks, stoppage of
                    the traffic, and damage to adjoining lands. The number and positions of these
                    waste-weirs must depend on the nature of the country through which the canal
                    passes. Wherever the canal crosses a stream a waste-weir should bo formed in the
                    aqueduct; but independently of this the engineer must consider at what points
                    large influxes of water may be apprehended, and must at such places not only
                    form waste-weirs of sufficient size to carry off the surplus, but form
                    artificial courses for its discharge into the nearest streams. These waste-weirs
                    are placed atthe top water-level of the canal, so that when a flood occurs the
                    water flows over them and thus relieves the banks. The want of these has
                    occasioned overflows of canal banks, attended with very serious injury to the
                    works, and lengthened suspension of the traffic; and attention to this
                    particular part of canal construction is of essential importance.</p>
                <p>Stop-gates are necessary at short intervals of a few miles for the purpose of
                    dividing the canal into isolated reaches, so that in the event of a breach the
                    gates may be shut, and the discharge of water confined to the small reach
                    intercepted between two of them, instead of extending throughout the whole line
                    of canal. In broad canals these stop-gates may be formed like the gates of
                    locks, two pairs of gates being .made to shut in opposite directions. In small
                    works they may be made of thick planks slipped into grooves formed at the narrow
                    points of the canal under road bridges, or at contractions made at intermediate
                    points to receive them. Self-acting stop-gates have been tried, but their
                    success has not been such as to lead to their general introduction. When repairs
                    have to be made stop-gates allow of the water being run off from a short reach,
                    and afterwards restored with comparatively little interruption to the traffic.
                    Their value in obviating serious accidents has been well exemplified in the
                    author’s own experience. The water during a flood flowed over the towing-path of
                    the Union Canal connecting Edinburgh and Glasgow, and the uncontrolled current
                    carried away the embankment and the soil on which it rested to the depth of 80
                    feet, as measured from the top water-level. The stop-gates were promptly
                    applied, and the discharge confined to a short reach of a few miles, otherwise
                    the injury (which was, even in its modified form, very considerable) would have
                    been enormous, not only to the canal works but to the adjoining lands.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of draining off the water to admit of repairs after the
                    stop-gates have been closed, it is proper to introduce, at convenient
                    situations, a series of exits called “offlets,” which are pipes placed at the
                    level of the bottom of the canal, and fitted with valves which can be opened
                    when required. These offlets are generally formed at aqueducts or bridges
                    crossing rivers, where the contents of the canal can be run off into the bed of
                    the stream, the stop-gates on both sides being closed so as to isolate the part
                    of the canal from which the water is withdrawn.</p>
                <p>In executing the work, provision must be made for the proper drainage of the
                    tow-path, which should be made highest at the side next the canal, and sloped
                    with a gentle inclination towards the outside. The drainage of the tow-path
                    should be carried to a sky drain, and at intervals passed below it into the
                    canal, as shown in fig 3.</p>

                <p>The preservation of the banks at the water-line is also a matter of importance.
                    “Pitching” with stones and “facing” with brushwood are employed, and in the
                    author’s experience the latter, if well executed, forms an economical and
                    effectual protection.</p>
                <p>In forming the <hi rend="italic">alveus</hi> or bed of the canal care must be
                    taken, especially on embankments, and even in cuttings where the soil is porous,
                    to provide against leakage by using puddle, as shown as fig 2. An all-important
                    matter, as affecting the construction of the works, is the possibility of
                    getting clay in the district, or such other soil as may be worked into puddle,
                    on the good quality of which the stability of the reservoir embankments and the
                    imperviousness of the beds and banks of the canal mainly depend.</p>
                <p>These are the only points of general application, in the construction of canals,
                    to which reference can here be made; and in applying them to each case the
                    engineer must be guided, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> by theoretical knowledge,
                    to bo acquired by a careful study of his profession; and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >secondly,</hi> by that knowledge which can be gained only by experience.</p>
                <p>Not a little has been written on the best mode of conducting traffic on canals,
                    and the reader who wishes to study the subject fully is referred to the
                    observations made by Mr Walker and Mr George Rennie in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi> of the Royal Society and of the Institution of Civil
                    Engineers, and especially to the valuable researches on hydrodynamics by Mr J.
                    Scott Russell in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the Royal Society of
                    Edinburgh. Mr Russell while experimenting on propelling boats at high speeds
                    found that the primary wave of displacement produced by the motion of a boat
                    moves with a velocity due to the depth of water in the canal, being the velocity
                    that is due to gravity acting through à height equal to the depth of the centre
                    of gravity of the cross-section of the channel below the surface of the fluid.
                    The velocity is in no degree dependent on the form or velocity of the body which
                    generates it, or on the breadth of the canal. A wave that had a velocity of 8
                    miles an hour was traced to a point where the channel became deeper, and its
                    velocity was suddenly accelerated; the channel became alternately narrower and
                    wider without producing any sensible effect, but when the wave once more reached
                    that part of the channel which was of the original depth it resumed its original
                    velocity. A fact of great practical value was established, that a boat, if
                    raised by a sudden effort to the top of a primary wave, could be drawn along at
                    10 miles an hour with less fatigue to the horses than if drawn at the rate of 6
                    miles, while the waste was less severe on the banks of the canal. These
                    investigations were made before the general establishment of railways, when
                    swift canal travelling seemed a desirable attainment. But though <hi
                    rend="italic">boats</hi> propelled at high speed on canals have given place to
                    <hi rend="italic">railway carriages,</hi> yet the canal traffic at slow speeds
                    must be conducted, and the cheapest means of effecting the “haulage” with the
                    least danger to the banks is still an important inquiry, and has within the last

                    made.</p>
                <p>One great objection to high speeds on canals is the wasting of the banks by the
                    displacement produced in propelling the vessel through the water. The wasting,
                    indeed, takes place even with very low speeds, and as a matter of canal
                    engineering it is necessary to notice it. To give an instance of the effect on
                    the large scale:—Mr Ure says that the river steamers on the Clyde, going at a
                    speed of 8 to 9 miles per hour, produce a swell which commences to rise when the
                    vessel is “2 or 3 miles off,”—a circumstance which was first noticed by Mr J.
                    Scott Russell in 1837. The swell gradually increases as the steamer approaches,
                    and at last becoming a wave of translation, it breaks on the river walls nearly
                    abreast of the vessel, following her on her course along the river, as a violent
                    breaking wave, measuring 8 or 10 feet from the hollow in the channel to the
                    crest on the wall. A coating of heavy whinstone rock, from 2 to 3 feet thick,
                    extending from low to high watermark is found necessary to enable the banks to
                    withstand it. Mr Ureaiso found that the action of passing steamers, though very
                    destructive to the banks, was useful in stirring up the mud from the bottom,
                    which was carried off by the currents to an extent which he estimates to be from
                    20 to 25 per cent, of the whole quantity dredged from one particular part of the
                    river where he carefully measured it. It will at once be apparent, that however
                    inconvenient these wasting waves may be in a river, the waves in a canal, though
                    smaller, are nevertheless a source of greater anxiety, acting as they do in a
                    narrow artificial channel, formed at some places on high embankments, the
                    failure of which would be attended with serious consequences.</p>
                <p>The wasting on canals where the traffic is conducted at a moderate speed is found
                    to extend not more than 18 inches to 2 feet, that is 1 foot above and below the
                    water-fine, and Mr Clegram states that he has found on the Gloucester Canal that
                    a facing of stone filled into a recess cut in the banks formed a complete
                    protection. Brushwood, as already noticed, is also an effectual remedy.</p>
                <p>What has recently led to the consideration of the best means of protecting the
                    banks of canals is the substitution of steam for horse power in working the
                    traffic, which has been entirely successful. The first attempt at using
                    steam-power on canals was made on the Forth and Clyde Canal with Symington’s
                    boat, in 1789. Various experiments were made to introduce tugs, but these were
                    ultimately abandoned in favour of steam-lighters, which now in great numbers
                    navigate the canal, and make passages to Leith, Greenock, and other trading
                    ports on the Firths of Forth and Clyde.</p>
                <p>This system, however, would not suit the trade of the Gloucester Canal, which is
                    chiefly frequented by sea-borne vessels, and steam-towing has been introduced on
                    that navigation. The following extracts from Mr Clegram’s paper<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
                    p. 1.</p></note> seem generally applicable to all navigations where towing is to
                    be adopted. He says the ship canal leads from the Severn at Gloucester to the
                    Severn at Sharpness Point. It is 16½ miles in length, and has a depth varying
                    from 18 to 18 feet 6 inches, navigable by vessels of 700 tons register. Prior to
                    the year 1860 all sea-going vessels passing through were towed by horses, the
                    number of horses being regulated by a scale varying from 1 horse for a vessel of
                    40 tons to 9 horses for a vessel of 420 tons. The cost of this amounted
                    generally to about one farthing per ton per mile on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n868/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0868-0787"/> register tonnage of the vessel. The speed varied
                    from one mile to three miles per hour, according to the size of the vessel and
                    the state of the weather.</p>
                <p>In 1860 steam-tugs were placed upon the canal to do this work. They are iron
                    boats, 65 feet long, 12 feet beam, and draw 6 feet 3 inches of water, fitted
                    with high-pressure engines; the diameters of the cylinders are 20 inches, stroke
                    of 18 inches, pressure of the steam 32 lb on the inch, and the cost of each
                    £3000. Nearly the whole of the sea-going craft are now towed by these tugs. The
                    vessels range from 30 tons up to 700 tons register, with a draught of water from
                    6 to 16 feet. They are towed either singly or in a team, according to
                    circumstances. Sometimes as many as thirteen loaded vessels of from 50 to 100
                    tons register have been towed by one tug at the rate of 3 to 3½ miles an hour.
                    The heaviest load drawn by any one tug has been 1690 tons of goods in three
                    vessels. Their draught of water varied from 14 feet 6 inches to 15 feet 6
                    inches, and they were taken the whole length of the canal at the speed of 2
                    miles an hour. The smaller vessels are tow ed at a speed of 4 miles an hour, to
                    which as a rule they are restricted.</p>
                <p>The employment of steam for towing has been found very advantageous. The vessels
                    rub less against the banks, the power being right ahead, and not on one side as
                    with horses. The wear on the ropes used in tracking is reduced, the speed is
                    increased, and vessels can be moved along the canal in weather which would have
                    prevented horses doing the work. With a strong wind athwart the canal vessels
                    cannot be tracked <hi rend="italic">in train</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> they
                    must then be taken singly, or at most two at a time. When vessels are towed in
                    train, as a rule the largest and heaviest draughted are placed first, and the
                    hawser leading from the first vessel to the tug is taken from each side of the
                    bow. With this arrangement, and a skilful management of the tug, the vessels can
                    be kept <hi rend="italic">fairly</hi> in the line of the canal.</p>
                <p>The only disadvantage of this system, on a canal the sides of which are
                    unprotected, is the additional wear caused by the run of water between the sides
                    of the large vessels and the banks. Such vessels occupy a large part of the
                    sectional area of the canal, and being taken along at a much greater speed than
                    they were by horses the wash of water is more prejudicial. When the vessels or
                    trains of vessels are heavy, and the tugs are working up to their full power and
                    speed, the water thrown back by the action of the screw against the bow of the
                    first vessel is thrown off by it to the banks on either side, and is the cause
                    of considerable wash. This has been attempted to be remedied by placing the
                    first vessel farther back from the tug; but in practice it is found that a
                    distance of 40 to 50 feet is the farthest separation that can be allowed without
                    sacrificing that <hi rend="italic">hold</hi> between the two which prevents the
                    vessel sheering from side to side. The first vessel being kept steadily in her
                    course, the others follow without much difficulty.</p>
                <p>The employment of tugs has afforded an unexpected facility for cleansing the
                    canal from deposit of mud. Formerly it was difficult to remove this deposit from
                    the slopes of the banks on which it collected, sometimes inconveniently
                    contracting the capacity of the canal. Since the vessels have been moved at
                    greater speed and <hi rend="italic">in trains</hi> this deposit has been
                    entirely removed from the slopes to the bottom of the canal, whence it can
                    readily be taken out by the dredger.</p>
                <p>But though all efforts to improve barge-canals can never bring them to compete
                    with railways in the quick conveyance of passengers, it is surprising to find in
                    how many places they still command an enormous traffic in goods and minerals,
                    and thus act as a valuable relief to overburdened railways. This is specially
                    the case in the manufacturing districts of England, where the Birmingham Grand
                    Junction and other canals seem to carry on as brisk a trade as they did in days
                    gone by when they had no competitors but the stage coach and the carrier’s
                    van.</p>
                <p>These remarks, however, as to railway competition do not apply to Ship-canals,
                    which, undisturbed by competing schemes, retain all the monopoly they ever
                    possessed; and indeed, in the recent construction of the Suez and New Amsterdam
                    canals, they have acquired an importance before unclaimed for works of that
                    class—an importance which entitles them to the highest consideration in any
                    engineering treatise; for, apart from their structural interest to the engineer,
                    their usefulness in affording a short and sheltered passage for sea-borne
                    vessels has long been acknowledged and can hardly be over-estimated.</p>
                <p>The Languedoc Canal already mentioned, by a short passage of 148 miles, saves a
                    sea voyage of upwards of 2000 miles through the Straits of Gibraltar. By the
                    Forth and Clyde Canal sea-borne vessels, not exceeding 8½ feet draught of water,
                    can pass from opposite coasts of Scotland, through the heart of the country, by
                    35 miles of inland navigation and avoid the dangers of the Pentland Firth; the
                    Crinan Canal substitutes a short inland route of 9 miles for a sea voyage round
                    the Mull of Kintyτe of about 70 miles; and the last great canal between Suez and
                    Alexandria saves vessels a tedious voyage of 3750 miles on their route to
                    India.</p>
                <p>To most of the early ship canals that have been executed, the principles of
                    construction already stated are generally applicable—the depth of water and
                    dimensions of the locks and all other works being increased to suit the larger
                    size of craft which use them, and therefore further notice of such details is
                    not required. But having still to illustrate the larger class of works, we
                    proceed to describe some of the largest of the ship-canals already constructed
                    and projected, and in doing so, we shall consider shipcanals under the following
                    three classes :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First,</hi> Canals which on their route from sea to sea
                    traverse high districts, surmounting the elevation by locks supplied by natural
                    lakes or artificial reservoirs, such as the Languedoc in France, or the
                    Caledonian Canal in Scotland; <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> Canals in low-lying
                    districts, which are carried on a uniform water-level from end to end, and are
                    defended against the inroad of the sea at high water by double acting locks,
                    which also retain the canal water at low tide, such as the canals of Holland and
                    other low countries; <hi rend="italic">Third,</hi> Canals, of which the Suez is
                    the only example yet made, without locks at either end, and communicating freely
                    with the sea, from which it derives its water supply.</p>
                <p>The Caledonian Canal in Scotland is as good a specimen of works of the <hi
                    rend="italic">first</hi> class as can be selected.</p>
                <p>In 1773 James Watt was employed to survey the country between the Beauly at
                    Inverness and Loch Eil at the mouth of the river Lochy, a distance of about 60
                    miles, with the view of forming a ship canal between the two seas, to save about
                    400 miles of coasting voyage by the North of Scotland through the stormy
                    Pentland Firth. The district referred to, called the “Great Caledonian Glen,” as
                    will be seen from Plate XXXVI., embraces a chain of fresh-water lakes, which, in
                    connection with the surrounding glens, have afforded an interesting field for
                    the speculations of the geologist; and no doubt the first conception of a canal
                    through the district owed its origin to the apparent facilities for inland
                    navigation wlιich the lakes afforded.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    opened in 1823.</p>
                <p>The summit-level is at Laggan, between Loch Oich and Loch Lochy, whence the
                    drainage flows to the Eastern and Western seas.</p>

                <p>The district which discharges into the eastern outlet comprehends an area of
                    about 700 square miles, chiefly of high mountainous country, intersected by
                    streams and lakes, which discharge themselves into Loch Oich, Loch Ness, and
                    Loch Doughfour, and thence are conveyed into the Moray Firth by the River Ness.
                    Loch Oich, the summit-level of the canal, has an area of about 2 square miles,
                    and the present standard level of its surface is understood to be 102 feet above
                    the level of mean high water of neap tides in Beauly Firth. It receives the
                    drainage of Loch Quoich and Loch Garry. The waters of Loch Oich are discharged
                    through the River Oich into Loch Ness, which is about 24 miles in length, and
                    has an area of about 30 square miles. Loch Ness receives the waters of the
                    Tarff, the Foyers, and Glenmoriston, and the drainage of numerous other streams
                    and lakes of less note. It discharges its waters through a comparatively narrow
                    neck, called Bona Passage, into the small loch of Doughfour, whence they find an
                    exit to the Beauly and Moray Firths by the River Ness, on which the town and
                    harbour of Inverness are situated.</p>
                <p>The drainage of the western district of the country, including Loch Arkegg, finds
                    its way into Loch Lochy, which is about 10 miles long, and thence by the River
                    Lochy to the Western Sea at Loch Eil.</p>
                <p>The two locks in Loch Beauly at the northern entrance to the canal are each 170
                    feet long, 40 feet wide, and have a lift of about 8 feet. At Muirtown, a little
                    further on, are four locks of 170 feet in length and 40 feet in width, having a
                    rise of 32 feet, raising the canal to the level of Loch Ness, which it enters at
                    Bona. The works westward of Loch Ness are an artificial canal with seven locks
                    communicating with Loch Oich. Between Lochs Oich and Lochy are two locks; at the
                    south end of Loch Lochy is a regulating lock, and the canal is carried from this
                    point on the level of Loch Lochy to Banavie, where it descends 64 feet by eight
                    connected locks, forming what is calìed in the country “Neptune’s Staircase
                    finally at Corpach the canal descends by two locks to the level of Loch Eil.</p>
                <p>Of the whole distance, about 37½ miles are natural lake navigation, and the
                    remaining 23 are artificial or canal navigation. The canals were made 120 feet
                    in width at top-water level, 50 feet at bottom, and 20 feet in depth. In the
                    course of inquiries as to the state of the canal, under a remit from the
                    Admiralty, the author found that the shallows at Loch Oich and the cutting at
                    the summit level originally contemplated had not been carried to the full depth,
                    and an additional depth had been gained at that place by raising the level of
                    Loch Oich; but still he was led to the conclusion that the standard depth of the
                    canal cannot be regarded as more than 18 feet, giving access to vessels of 160

                <p>In carrying out this remarkable work Telford had to deal with difficulties of no
                    ordinary kind, in rendering available rugged Highland lakes, and surmounting the
                    summit-level of the glen. The work, which cost about one million sterling, is a
                    noble monument of his engineering skill.</p>
                <p>The canals of Holland are specimens of the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> class of
                    works to which reference has been made, and of these a very remarkable one is
                    the North Holland Canal, completed in 1825. It was designed by Μ. Blanken, who,
                    instead of the high rugged Highland glens of Scotland, had to deal with the
                    proverbial lowness of the country, and to protect his works not from the
                    assaults of mountain torrents but from encroachments of the waves, for there
                    vessels are locked <hi rend="italic">down</hi> from the sea into the canal. It
                    extends from</p>
                <p>Amsterdam to the Helder, is 50 miles in length, and is formed of the
                    cross-section shown in fig. 4. It enables vessels trading from Amsterdam to
                    avoid the islands and sand-banks of the dangerous Zuider Zee, the passage
                    through which in former times often occupied as many weeks as the transit
                    through the canal now occupies hours.</p>
                <p>But the North Holland Canal, which has long proved so useful to the commerce of
                    the district, is destined soon to <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> be superseded
                    by the new Amsterdam Canal, a work of great magnitude, which it is proposed to
                    describe as an illustration of ship-canals of the <hi rend="italic">second</hi>
                    class, from details furnished by Mr J. C. Hawkshaw, C.E.</p>
                <p>The rapid increase in the trade of the ports to the southward and eastward of the
                    Helder, effected by the construction of railways throughout Europe, rendered it
                    imperative for the merchants of Amsterdam to provide better communication with
                    the North Sea than that afforded by the North Holland ship canal already
                    noticed, or suffer its trade to pass to other ports more favourably situated for
                    over-sea traffic.</p>
                <p>In 1865 a company was formed for the purpose of constructing a canal from
                    Amsterdam, in nearly a direct line, to the North Sea, through Lake Y and Wyker
                    Meer, a distance of 16½ miles. Sir John Hawkshaw and Mr Dirks were appointed the
                    engineers to carry out the work, a plan and section of which are given in Plate
                    XXXVI.</p>
                <p>The harbour in which the canal terminates in the North Sea is formed by two piers
                    built of concrete blocks founded on a deposit of rough basalt. The piers are
                    each 5069 feet in length, and enclose an area of about 260 acres. About 140
                    acres of this area are to be dredged to a depth of 26½ feet, the remainder is to
                    be left at the present depth for the accommodation of small craft and
                    fishing-boats.</p>
                <p>From its commencement at the harbour the canal passes by a deep cutting through a
                    broad belt of sand hills which protect the whole of this part of the coast of
                    Holland from the inroads of the sea. The cross-section of the canal at this
                    place is shown in fig. 5. This cutting is about 3 miles in length; the greatest
                    depth of cutting from the surface to the bottom of the canal is 78 feet, and the
                    amount of earthwork excavated is 6,213,000 cubic yards. On emerging from the
                    sand-hills the canal passes by the village of Velsen, in the neighbourhood of
                    which it is crossed by the railway from Haarlem to the Helder, and there enters
                    the Wyker Meer, a large tract of tide-covered land. After traversing the Wyker
                    Meer it passes by a cutting of 327,000 cubic yards through the promontory called
                    Buitenhuizen, which separates that Meer from Lake Y, another large tide-covered
                    area. The rest of its course lies through Lake Y as far as Amsterdam.</p>
                <p>There are two sets of locks, one set at each end. The North Sea locks are at a
                    distance of about three-quarters of a mile from the North Sea harbour. These
                    locks, as shown in fig. 6, have three passages. The central or main one is 60
                    feet wide and 390 feet long, and will be furnished with two pairs of gates at
                    each end, pointing in opposite directions<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n870/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0870-0789"/>, and one pair in the centre. The northernmost
                    side passage for barges is 30 feet long and 34 feet wide, with three pairs of
                    gates; that to the south is 227 feet in length and 40 feet wide, with five pairs
                    of gates.</p>
                <p>Tn constructing the canal,which is (1876) now far advanced towards completion,
                    the cuttings were first begun. The material proceeding from these cuttings was
                    deposited so as to form two banks 443 feet apart, through the lakes on each side
                    of the main canal, as shown by the hard lines on the plan, and also to form the
                    banks of the branch canals on either side. The total length of these banks is
                    38½ miles. The nucleus of the bank is formed of sand with a coating of clay, and
                    protected during its progress with fascines; and when the banks are far enough
                    advanced, the deep channel for the canal is excavated by dredging. The
                    cross-section of the canal and banks through these meers or lakes is shown in
                    fig. 7.</p>
                <p>The formation of the banks through the Wyker Meer and Lake Y will enable about
                    12,000 acres of the area, as shown on the plan, which is now occupied by these
                    lakes, to be reclaimed. For the purpose of this reclamation, and also to provide
                    for the drainage of the land on the margin of the lakes, including a large
                    portion of what was formerly Haarlem Meer, pumps are provided by the company at
                    various points on the main and branch canals. The Canal Company are bound to
                    keep the surface-water of the canal about 1 foot 7 inches <hi rend="italic"
                    >below</hi> average high-water level. In order to insure this level being
                    maintained, three large pumps have been erected in connection with the locks
                    hereafter to be described, on the dam between Amsterdam and the Zuider Zee. They
                    consist of three Appold pumps, the largest of the kind yet made, the fans being
                    8 feet iιi diameter. Each pump is worked by a separate engine of 90 nominal
                    horse-power. The maximum lift is 9 feet 9 inches, at which the three pumps are
                    capable of discharging 1950 tons a minute; with the ordinary working lift of 3½
                    feet they will discharge 2700 tons a minute.</p>
                <p>Lake Y extends about 4½ miles to the eastward of Amsterdam; and here it was
                    necessary to form a dam with locks for the passage of vessels. The dam crosses
                    Lake Y at a point about 2 miles to the eastward of Amsterdam, where it is
                    contracted to 4265 feet in width. As it was necessary to construct these locks
                    before completing the dam across Lake Y, a circular cofferdam 590 feet in
                    diameter, consisting of two rows of piles 49 feet long, was constructed in the
                    tideway, and within this dam the locks were built. These locks have three main
                    passages, each with five pairs of gates, and one smaller passage with three
                    pairs of gates, arranged much in the same manner as the North Sea locks in fig.
                    6. The whole of the masonry and brickwork for these locks and sluiceways was
                    founded on bearing-piles, upwards of 10,000 in number. The bottom where the
                    cofferdam was placed consisted of mud, and some difficulty was experienced in
                    maintaining it till the work was completed. Tho dam across Lake Y, as shown in
                    section, fig. 8, consists of clay and sand, placed on and protected at the sides
                    by large masses of wicker-work, which is afterwards covered with basalt in the
                    manner usually adopted in Holland.</p>
                <p>All the lock gates at both ends of the canal pointing seawards are of malleable
                    iron; the gates pointing inwards towards the canal are of wood. The necessity,
                    for drainage purposes, of maintaining the surface water of the canal at the
                    prescribed low level calls for a sufficient barrier being provided against the
                    sea at both ends, as the sea-level will not unfrequently, at high water, be
                    several feet above the level of the canal. This necessity, as well as the
                    difference of level and periods of high water in the Zuider Zee and the North
                    Sea, required a totally different design from the Suez Canal, to be afterwards
                    described. The contract sum for the execution of the Amsterdam Canal is
                    £2,250,000, and it is expected that it will be ready for traffic in 1877.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> class of works there is, as yet, only a
                    single example in the Suez Canal, one of the most remarkable engineering works
                    of modern times; but though it is called a canal, it bears little resemblance to
                    the works we have described under that name, for it has neither locks, gates,
                    reservoirs, or pumping-engines, nor has it, indeed, anything in common with
                    canals, except that it affords a short route for sea-borne ships. It is in fact,
                    correctly speaking, an artificial strait or arm of the sea, connecting the
                    Mediterranean and the Bed Sea, from both of which it derives its water-supply;
                    and the fact that the two seas are nearly on the same level, and the rise of
                    tide very small, allowed this construction to be adopted.</p>
                <p>The idea of forming this connecting link between sea and sea is of very ancient
                    origin, and its author is unknown. It is understood, however, that a water
                    communication for small vessels between the two seas was formed as early as 600
                    years before the Christian era, and existed for a period of about 1400 years,
                    after which it was allowed to fall into disuse. Baron De Tott in his <hi

                    historian Diodorus as to the existence of certain portions of the early work,
                    and its having been abandoned in consequence of the supposed difference of level
                    between the two seas, and threatened inundation of Egypt, says there still exist
                    those early traces of work “qu’un léger travail rendrait navigable sans y
                    employer d’écluses et sans menacer l’Égypte d’inondations.” De Tott’s opinion
                    expressed in 1785 has certainly been carried out, but on a scale and at an
                    expenditure of labour and money far beyond the conception of the French
                    diplomatist.</p>

                    due to Napoleon I. who, about the close of the last century, obtained a report
                    from Μ. Lepère, a French engineer, which however was followed by no result, and
                    it remained for Μ. de Lesseps, in the present day, to realize what were thought
                    the dreams of commercial speculators, by carrying out the long-desired passage
                    between the two seas. But the postponement of the scheme unquestionably favoured
                    the chances of its commercial success, for had the canal been completed even a
                    few years earlier, comparatively few vessels would have been found to take
                    advantage of it. Masters of sailing-vessels would not from choice have navigated
                    the Mediterranean and encountered the passage through the canal and the tedious
                    and difficult voyage of the Red Sea. They would undoubtedly have preferred to
                    round the free seaway of the Cape of Good Hope, with all its ocean dangers and
                    excitements, to threading their way through such an inland passage, involving
                    risks of rocks and shoals, protracted calms and contrary winds. But the
                    introduction of ocean-going screw-steamers was an entirely new feature in
                    navigation. Being independent of wind for their propulsion, and being admirably
                    fitted for navigating narrow straits and passages, their rapid and general
                    adoption by all the leading shipping firms in the world afforded not only a
                    plea, but a necessity for the short communication by the Mediterranean and Red
                    Sea. It was indeed a great achievement to reduce the distance between Western
                    Europe and India from 11,379 to 7628 miles, equal, according to Admiral Richards
                    and Colonel Clarke, R.E., to a saving of thirty-six days on the voyage; and this
                    is the great result effected by cutting the Suez Canal between the Mediterranean
                    and the Red Sea.</p>
                <p>Mr Bateman, C.E., who visited the canal as the representative of the Royal
                    Society, communicated to that body a description of the works, in which he gives
                    the following account of the early negotiations of Μ. Ferdinand Lesseps, who has
                    the credit of having brought the work to a successful issue:<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proceedings
                    of the R</hi><hi rend="italic">ydl Society,</hi> 1870, p. 132.</p></note> —</p>
                <p>“The project” of Μ. Ferdinand Lesseps “was to cut a great canal on the level of
                    the two seas, by the nearest and most practicable route, which lay along the
                    valley or depression containing Lake Menzaleh, Lake Ballah, Lake Timsah, and the
                    Bitter Lakes. The character of this route was described in 1830 by General
                    Chesney, R.A., who examined and drew up a report on the country between the
                    Mediterranean and the Red Sea. At that time a difference of 30 feet between the
                    two seas was still assumed, and all proposals for canals were laid out on that
                    assumption. General Chesney summed up his report by stating, —‘As to the
                    executive part there is but one opinion; there are no serious difficulties; not
                    a single mountain intervenes, scarcely what deserves to be called a hillock; and
                    in a country where labour can be had without limit, and at a rate infinitely
                    below that of any other part of the world, the expense would be a moderate one
                    for a single nation, and scarcely worth dividing among the great kingdoms of
                    Europe, who would all be benefited by the measure.’</p>
                <p>“Μ. Lesseps was well advised therefore in the route he selected, and (assuming
                    the possibility of keeping open the canal) in the character of the project he
                    proposed.</p>
                <p>“From 1849 to 1854 he was occupied in maturing his project. In.the latter year
                    Mahomet Saïd Pasha became Viceroy of Egpyt, and sent at once for Μ. Lesseps to
                    consider with him the propriety of carrying out the work. The result of this
                    interview was, that on the 30th of November a commission was signed at Cairo,
                    charging Μ. Lesseps to constitute a company named ‘ The Universal Suez Canal
                    Company.’ In the following year, 1855, Μ.</p>
                <p>Lesseps, acting for the Viceroy, invited a number of gentlemen, eminent as
                    directors of public works, as engineers, and distinguished in other ways, to
                    form an International Commission for the purpose of considering and reporting on
                    the practicability of the scheme.</p>
                <p>“The Commission met in Egypt in December 1855 and January 1856, and made a
                    careful examination of the harbours in the two seas, and of the intervening
                    desert, and arrived at the conclusion that a ship canal was practicable between
                    the Gulf of Pelusium in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea near Suez. They
                    differed, however, as to the mode in which such a canal should be constructed.
                    The three English engineering members of the Commission were of opinion that a
                    ship canal, having its surface raised 25 feet <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the
                    sea-level, and communicating with the Bay of Pelusium at one end and the Red Sea
                    at the other, by means of locks, and supplied with water from the Nile, was the
                    best mode of construction. The foreign members, on the contrary, held that a
                    canal having its bottom 27 feet <hi rend="italic">below</hi> sea-level, from sea
                    to sea, without any lock, and with harbours at each end, was the best
                    system,—the harbours to be formed by piers and dredging out to deep water.</p>
                <p>“The Commission met at Paris in June 1856, when the views of the English
                    engineers were rejected, and the report to the Viceroy recommended the system
                    which has since been carried out.</p>
                <p>“Two years from the date of this report were spent in conferences and preliminary
                    steps before Μ. Lesseps obtained the necessary funds for carrying out the works.
                    About half the capital was subscribed on the Continent, by far the larger
                    portion being taken in France, and the other half was found by the Viceroy.
                    Further time was necessarily lost in preparation, and it was not till near the
                    close of 1860 that the work was actually commenced.</p>
                <p>“The original concession granted extraordinary privileges to the Company. It
                    included or contemplated the formation of a ‘ sweet water’ canal for the use of
                    the workmen engaged, and the Company were to become proprietors of all the land
                    which could be irrigated by means of this canal. One of the conditions of the
                    concession also was that the Viceroy should procure forced labour for the
                    execution of the work, and soon after the commencement of operations, and for
                    some time, the number of workmen so engaged amounted to from 25,000 to 30,000.
                    The work thus commenced steadily proceeded until 1862, when the late Viceroy,
                    during his visit to this country at the time of the International Exhibition,
                    requested Sir John Hawkshaw to visit the canal and report on the condition of
                    the works and the practicability of its being successfully completed and
                    maintained. His Highness’s instructions were that Sir John Hawkshaw should make
                    an examination of the works quite independently of the French company and their
                    engineers, and report the results at which he arrived.”</p>
                <p>We quote these results as given in Sir John Hawkshaw’s report, because they show
                    the nature of the difficulties that had been raised and the soundness of the
                    advice which Sir John gave—advice which undoubtedly greatly contributed to the
                    successful completion of the work.</p>
                <p>The following are given by Sir John as the objections to the work :—</p>
                <p>“1. That the canal will become a stagnant ditch.</p>
                <p>“2. That the canal will silt up, or that the moving sands of the Desert will fill
                    it up.</p>
                <p>’ ∙ 3. That the Bitter Lakes through which the canal is to pass will be filled up
                    with salt.</p>
                <p>“4. That the navigation of the Red Sea is dangerous and difficult.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“5.</hi> That shipping will not approach Port Saïd, because of
                    the difficulties that will be met with, and the danger of that port on a lee
                    shore.</p>
                <p>“6. That it will be difficult, if not impracticable, to keep open the
                    Mediterranean entrance to the canal. ’’</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n874/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0874-0791"/>
                <p>Having analysed each of these objections, and fully weighed the arguments on
                    which they were based, he came to the following conclusions as to the
                    practicability of construction and maintenance:—</p>
                <p>“lsζ As regards the engineering construction, there are no works on the canal
                    presenting on their face any unusual difficulty of execution, and there are no
                    contingencies that I can conceive likely to arise that would introduce
                    difficulties insurmountable by engineering skill.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">2dly,</hi> As regards the maintenance
                    of the canal, I am of opinion that no obstacles would be met with that would
                    prevent the work, when completed, being maintained with ease and efficiency, and
                    without the necessity of incurring any extraordinary or unusual yearly
                    expenditure.”</p>
                <p>“Saïd. Pasha died between the period of Sir John Hawkshaw’s examination of the
                    country and the date of his report. He was succeeded by his brother, Ismail, the
                    present Viceroy or Khedive, who, alarmed at the largeness and uncertainty of the
                    grants to the Canal Company, of the proprietorship of land which could be
                    irrigated by the sweet water canal, and anxious to retire from the obligation of
                    finding forced labour for the construction of the works, refused to ratify or
                    agree to the concessions granted by his brother. The whole question was then
                    referred to the arbitration of the late Emperor of the French, who kindly
                    undertook the task, and awarded the sum of £3,800,000 to be paid by the Viceroy
                    to the Canal Company as indemnification for the loss they would sustain by the
                    withdrawal of forced or native labour, for the retrocession of large grants of
                    land, and for the abandonment of other privileges attached to the original act
                    of concession. This money was applied to the prosecution of the works.</p>
                <p>“The withdrawal of native labour involved very important changes in the mode of
                    conducting the works, and occasioned at the time considerable delay. Mechanical
                    appliances for the removal of the material, and European skilled labour, had to
                    be substituted; these had to be recruited from different parts of Europe, and
                    great difficulty was experienced in procuring them. The accessory canals had to
                    be widened for the conveyance of larger dredgingmachines, and additional
                    dwellings had to be provided for the accommodation of European labourers.
                    Ultimately all difficulties were overcome, and the work proceeded.”</p>
                <p>After the works had been nearly completed, the Lords of the Admiralty instructed
                    Admiral Richards, the hydrographer, and Lieutenant-Colonel Clarke, R.E,, to
                    visit Egypt, and report as to the condition of the canal. These officers
                    accordingly made a most minute survey of the canal and its terminal harbours,
                    and issued a most interesting report,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Report on the Maritime Canal connecting
                    the Mediterranean at Port Saïd with the Red Sea at Suez,</hi> February
                    1870.</p></note> from the information contained in which the plan of the canal,
                    Plate XXXVI., has been mainly constructed. From this plan it will be seen that
                    the canal extends from Port Saïd on the Mediterranean to Suez on the Red Sea,
                    and that, as shown by the section, it traverses a comparatively flat country.
                    This route has been selected so as to take advantage of certain valleys or
                    depressions which are called lakes, but were in fact, previous to the
                    construction of the canal, low-lying tracts of country, at some places below the
                    level of the Mediterranean and Red Seas. These valleys were found to be coated
                    with a deep deposit of salt, and are described as having had all the appearance
                    of being covered with snow, bearing evidence of their having been at one period
                    overflowed by the sea. As will be seen from the plan, Lake Menzaleh is next to
                    the Mediterranean, Lake Timsah about half-way across the isthmus, and the Bitter
                    Lakes next to the Red Sea. Lake Timsah, which is about 5 miles long, and the
                    Bitter Lakes, about 23, were quite dry before the cutting of the canal, and the
                    water which has converted them into large inland lakes was supplied from the Red
                    Sea and Mediterranean. The water began to flow from the Mediterranean in
                    February 1869, and from the Red Sea in July, and by the beginning of October of
                    the same year these vast tracts of country, which had formerly been parched and
                    arid valleys, were converted into great lakes navigated by vessels of the
                    largest class. It will be seen from the section that the surface of the ground
                    is generally very low, the chief cuttings being at Serapeum and El Guisr, where
                    the sandy dunes attain an elevation of about 50 to 60 feet. The channel through
                    the lakes was excavated partly by hand labour and partly by dredging, and for a
                    considerable portion the level of the valleys was so low as to afford sufficient
                    depth without excavation. The material excavated appears to have been almost
                    entirely alluvial, and easily removed; the only rock was met with at El Guisr,
                    where soft gypsum occurred, removable to a considerable extent by dredging, so
                    that the canal works presented no physical difficulty.</p>
                <p>The whole length of the navigation is 88 geographical miles. Of this distance 66
                    miles are actual canal, formed by cuttings, 14 miles are made by dredging
                    through the lakes, and 8 miles required no works, the natural depth being equal
                    to that of the canal. Throughout its whole length the canal was intended to have
                    a navigable depth of 26 feet for a width of 72 feet at the bottom, and to have a
                    width at the top varying according to the character of the cuttings. At those
                    places where the cuttings are deep, the slopes were designed to be 2 to 1, with
                    a surface width at the water-line of about 197 feet, as shown in fig. 9, which
                    is a cross-section at El Guisr; in the less elevated portions of the land, where
                    the stuff is softer, the slopes are increased, giving a surface width of 325
                    feet. It will be understood that in the lakes the canal consists of a navigable
                    channel of sufficient depth and breadth to admit the traffic, the surface of the
                    water extending on either side to the edge of the lake. Fig. 10 shows a
                    cross-section at Lake</p>
                <p>Menzaleh. The deep channel through the lakes is marked by iron beacons on either
                    side, 250 feet apart, and the Admiralty reporters state that “in practice it is
                    found more difficult to keep in the centre while passing through these beacons,
                    than it is when between the embankments.” At every 5 or 6 miles there is a
                    passing-place, to enable large vessels to moor for the night, or to bring-up in
                    order to allow others to pass, all these movements being regulated by telegraph
                    from Port Saïd, Ismailia, or Suez. Perhaps the most interesting question to the
                    engineer is the action of the tide in the narrow channel between the two seas,
                    and the observations made on this subject are given in the following quotation
                    from the Admiralty report :—</p>
                <p>“The tidal observations which we were able to make were necessarily somewhat
                    imperfect from want of time, but they were made at that period of the moon’s age
                    when their effect would be greatest; the results show that in the southern
                    portion of the canal, between Suez and Great Bitter Lake, the tidal influence
                    from the Red Sea is felt, there being a regular flow and ebb,—the flood running
                    in for about seven hours, and the ebb running out for five hours; at the Suez
                    entrance, the rise at springs, unless effected by strong winds, is between 5 and
                    6 feet; about half way from Suez to the Small Bitter Lake, a distance of 6
                    miles, it is under 2 feet; at the south end of the Small Bitter Lake, a few
                    inches only; while at the south end of the Great Lake there is scarcely any
                    perceptible tidal influence. We were informed by the authorities at Ismailia,
                    that since the Great Lake has been filled, the level of Lake Timsah, which was
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n875/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0875-0792"/> filled from the Mediterranean in April 1867, lias
                    risen 12 centimetres, or about 4 inches, and that its waters are continually
                    running at a slow rate into the Mediterranean; certainly this statement agreed
                    with what we ourselves remarked, for we always found a current running northward
                    from Lake Timsah at the rate of from half a mile to a mile an hour. Limited,
                    however, as these tidal observations were, they were taken with great care, and
                    appear sufficient to show that, except at the Suez end, the tides will not
                    materially affect the passage of vessels; at that end, therefore, large vessels
                    must regulate their time of passing; indeed, the greatest difficulty which will
                    he experienced will be not from the tides, but from the prevailing north-east
                    wind in the canal, which will make close steerage difficult in going from north
                    to south.”</p>
                <p>It thus appears that the tidal column of 5 feet range in the Red Sea is reduced
                    to 2 feet at the distance of 6 miles, and is practically annihilated by the wide
                    expanse of the Bitter Lakes. But it would be highly interesting to have this
                    conclusion confirmed by further systematic tidal observations.</p>
                <p>In executing this strange work of the desert, and converting dry sands into
                    navigable lakes, it is stated that there have been about <hi rend="italic"
                    >eighty millions</hi> of cubic yards of material excavated, and at one time
                    sixty dredging-machines and nearly 30,000 labourers were employed. For their use
                    a supply of fresh water was conveyed from the Nile at Cairo, and distributed
                    along the λvhole length of the canal, a work which of itself was one of no small
                    magnitude.</p>
                <p>The cost of the whole undertaking, including the harbours, is stated to have been
                    about £20,000,000. The terminal harbours are important adjuncts of this great
                    work. That on the Mediterranean is Port Saïd, which is formed by two breakwaters
                    constructed of concrete blocks, the western one 6040 feet in length and the
                    eastern 6020 feet, enclosing an area of about 450 acres, with an average depth
                    of only 13 or 14 feet, excepting in the channel leading to the canal, where the
                    depth is 25 to 28 feet. The entrance to the canaI at Suez is also protected by a
                    breakwater, and in connection with the harbour at this place there are two large
                    basins and a dry dock.</p>
                <p>The canal may be regarded as a highway for steamers of 400 feet in length and 50
                    feet beam. A delay of three days is calculated on for the passage across from
                    Port Saïd to Suez.</p>
                <p>It is satisfactory to learn from the report of Commander Wharton, of H.M.S.
                    “Shearwater,” “that the canal retains its depth of water. That report states
                    that “comparing generally the depth of the canal in 1873 and 1875 it seems that
                    it is iii about the same condition, with perhaps a slight balance in favour of
                    increased depth now; while its average minimum may be stated at 26 feet, there
                    are yet considerable tracts where 25 feet and even as little as 24 feet will be
                    passed over.” The survey of Lieutenant Millard, also reported to the Admiralty
                    in 1875, shows that at the entrance to Port Saïd harbour the 27, 30, and 33 feet
                    contour lines were seaward of those obtained before, proving that some
                    shallowing of the water at the entrance has taken place.</p>
                <p>The use made of the canal may be judged of from the following table of the
                    traffic passing through since its commencement<note anchored="true"

                <p>The tonnage has thus been quadrupled in five years; and the best means of
                    enlarging the canal to accommodate increas ing trade must soon become an
                    important question for its owners.</p>
                <p>Such works as the ship canals we have been describing entirely revolutionize
                    ocean navigation, and consequently demand the zealous attention of all nations
                    whose interests they seem to affect. Of this zealous watchfulness the interest
                    taken by the Powers of Europe in the distribution of the property in the Suez
                    Canal may be cited as an example. But notwithstanding the difficulties, legal
                    and political, which the execution of such works are almost sure to create by
                    severing continents before united, and connecting seas before separated by
                    thousands of miles of exposed navigation, we may safely conclude that wherever
                    the perils and delays of ocean sailing can be lessened by forming canals these
                    valuable helps to navigation will at all hazards be carried out. Viewing then
                    the subject <hi rend="italic">prrospec-tively,</hi> we offer no apology for
                    noticing two important shortsea passages which, though still unexecuted, will
                    doubtless in some form be eventually earned out·.</p>
                <p>One of these canals is designed to obviate the navigation of the dangerous strait
                    between Ceylon and the mainland of India, which is shallow and narrow, and in
                    some states of the wind has a violent current, so that it can only be navigated
                    by vessels of ’ small draught. Ships of the larger class have to circumnavigate
                    Ceylon in making their passages to the eastern section of Hindustan. The
                    importance of avoiding this detour round Ceylon of 350 miles of exposed
                    navigation in the direct Suez route to Calcutta and Madras will be readily
                    acknowledged, and the execution of the work cannot long be delayed.</p>
                <p>The strait to which we allude is the Paumben passage leading from the Gulf of
                    Manaar on the west to Palk Bay on the east, as shown in fig. 11, and many
                    attempts have been made by blasting to clear away the rocky obstructions that at
                    present render its navigation dangerous. But in order to provide a safe passage
                    of the strait between Ceylon and India for the ships which now navigate the Suez
                    Canal, nothing will suffice but a canal affording the same depth and width,
                    though very much shorter in length than its great pioneer in shortening ocean
                    sailing; and accordingly surveys have been made and schemes have been proposed
                    to effect this important improvement. Mr George Robertson, Civil Engineer, when
                    inspecting the harbours of India, was asked by the British Government to visit
                    the locality and report on these schemes; and from his Report on Indian Harbours
                    we find that the site he selected as most suitable is through the island of.
                    Ramaseram, about a mile east from Paumben lighthouse. The distance across from
                    sea to sea is about 2 miles, the ground being a flat sandy plain, raised on an
                    average about 7 feet above high water, and from the borings that have been made
                    it is not expected that much rock will be found in the course of the canal. In
                    order to assimilate it to the Suez Canal the navigable depth should if possible
                    be about 26 feet. On the north side the distance from high water mark to 30 feet
                    at low water is, according to a chart by the SurveyorGeneral at Colombo, upwards
                    of a mile; <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the south side the distance to the same
                    depth is still greater, so that very considerable works of dredging will be
                    necessary in forming and afterwards maintaining the entrances to the canal. The
                    south end of the canal is under shelter of a coral reef, but the north end may
                    perhaps require to be protected by breakwaters. The cost of cutting the canal
                    has been named at £440,000.</p>
                <p>The other scheme to which we referred has a far higher importance, its object
                    being to separate the continents of North and South America, and to give a free
                    navigation between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, by overcoming the
                    physical difficulties presented by the climate and the geological formation of
                    the Isthmus that separates the two <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0876-0793"/> seas, to which has to be added the problem of
                    making and maintaining a deep-water channel from the ocean to the entrances to
                    the canal.</p>
                <p>This bold scheme, first proposed in the 16th century, has at various intervals
                    been the subject of many deputations and much correspondence between the
                    American and European powers; and more recently, in 1845, when Louis Napoleon
                    was confined as a state prisoner at Ham, he spent much of his exile in
                    investigating its practicability, and in making arrangements for carrying out,
                    under the name of the “Napoleon Interoceanic Canal,” a passage between the two
                    seas from Port San Juan to Port Realejo. But we have not space to record the
                    various early attempts to realize this project, and must therefore confine our
                    remarks to giving an idea of the present state of negotiations regarding it.</p>
                <p>The recent enormous growth of Californian trade has led to the revived
                    consideration of the scheme by the United States of America, who would be the
                    greatest gainers by the work, and therefore are its most natural promoters; and
                    what we propose is to give a sketch of the present state of the question, as
                    afforded by reports and documents recently issued by the Government of the
                    United States, from which alone authentic information can be derived.</p>
                <p>It appears from these-documents that two routes have recently been investigated;—
                    <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> that of the Isthmus of</p>
                <p>Darien, shown in fig. 12, under the direction of Commander Selfridge, U.S.N.; and
                    <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> that of Nicaragua, also shown in fig. 12, under
                    the direction of Commander Lull, U.S.N. To both of these expeditions were
                    attached a large staff, including naval officers, civil engineers, surveyors,
                    mineralogists, &amp;c., and their surveys appear to have extended over the years
                    1871, 1872, and 1873.</p>
                <p>The results of these surveys are thus summarized in the report of the Secretary
                    to the Navy, submitted to the Government of the United States in 1873, from
                    which we take the following information. Of the Darien route, it is said that it
                    includes 100 miles of navigation of the River Atrato, which has been carefully
                    sounded, and found to be fully capable of being navigated by the largest class
                    of ocean-steamers. Between Atrato and the Pacific a canal or artificial cut must
                    be formed of 28 miles in length. The canal for 22 miles of this distance passes
                    through a plain having a gradual rise of 90 feet. There will then remain 6 miles
                    to the Pacific, three of which will be in moderate open cutting, and 3 miles
                    will be tunneling. It is estimated that the work will cost between £10,400,000
                    and £12,600,000, and that it can be completed in ten years. The tunnel, being
                    for the passage of ships of the largest size, is proposed to be 112 feet high
                    and 60 feet wide, and is to have 87 feet of clear headway above the surface of
                    the water. The canal is to be 25 feet in depth, with a bottom width of 50 feet,
                    and a surface width of 70 feet. The locks, twenty in number, are to be 427 feet
                    long, 54 feet wide, with a lift of 10 feet. The water supply is to be derived
                    from the Napipi river, and the gaugings and observations made on evaporation
                    lead to the conclusion that there is a great excess of water above the supply
                    required for the canal. Commander Selfridge gives two alternative schemes, by
                    which the tunneling is increased in length and the number of the locks
                    diminished, at an estimated cost of from £17,000,000 to £18,000,000
                    respectively.</p>
                <p>The exploration of the Nicaraguan route, under Commander Lull, the position of
                    which is also shown in fig 12, is said to have proved the existence of a
                    practicable route, having Lake Nicaragua as its summit-level, being 107 feet
                    above mean tide. It is proposed by this route to connect the lake with the
                    Pacific by a canal 16 ’ 3 miles in length, beginning at the mouth of the Rio del
                    Medio and terminating at Brito. The first 7 ’ 5 miles will require an excavation
                    averaging 54 feet in depth, and will be the most expensive part of the whole
                    work. Ten locks and one tide-lock will be required between the lake and the sea.
                    There will be 56 miles of lake navigation.</p>
                <p>Slack-water navigation in the San Juan from its head to the mouth of San Carlos
                    is considered perfectly feasible, and it is proposed to improve the river by
                    four dams, at Castillo Rapids, Balas Rapids, Machuca Rapids, and at the mouth of
                    the San Carlos River, at all of which places there are excellent sites for dams.
                    A short section of canal with <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n877/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0877-0794"/> one lock will be required to get around each of
                    the upper three dams. From the fourth dam to Greytown in the Caribbean Sea an
                    independent canal will be required 41 ’ 9 miles in length with seven locks,
                    which apparently presents no difficulty. The total length of the proposed canal
                    is 61 ’ 7 miles, and no tunnel is required. The harbour of Greytown has been
                    partially destroyed by a silt which comas from the San Carlos, and others of the
                    lower tributaries of the San Juan, and the branch of the river leading to
                    Greytown has become so much filled up that it is now, at the lowest stage of the
                    water, only 324 feet wide and 6 inches deep at the fork. It is proposed to shut
                    off this branch entirely and send all the silt-bearing water through the
                    Colorado mouth, which empties into the sea 18 miles from</p>
                <p>Greytown, and to admit to the harbour only the water of the canal, which, being
                    drawn from the main river above the mouth of the San Carlos, will be perfectly
                    clean. The harbour then cleared out, will leave nothing to deteriorate it
                    again.</p>
                <p>Short breakwaters will be required to protect the entrances from the surf, both
                    of which are included in the estimate for the work.</p>
                <p>Careful gauging at the lowest stage shows that Lake Nicaragua, which has a
                    surface area of 2700 square miles, and a drainage area of 8000 square miles,
                    will supply thirtyeight times the maximum póssible demand of water.</p>
                <p>The depth of water is to be 26 feet, the width at bottom 72 feet, and at surface
                    150 feet. The locks, twenty-one in number, With a lift of from 8 to 10 feet, are
                    to be 400 feet long and 72 feet wide. The estimate is stated at £15,900,000.</p>
                <p>Μ. Lesseps, in a lecture on the Suez Canal, delivered before the Société des Gens
                    de Lettres at Paris, has given it as his opinion that unless the Atlantic and
                    Pacific can be united by simply piercing the Isthmus from sea to sea without
                    locks, as at the Suez Canal, the proposed scheme cannot possibly succeed as a
                    commercial enterprise, because of the inadequacy of a canal with locks to pass
                    the traffic that will frequent it, and also of the uncertainty of sufficient
                    water to supply the lockage and evaporation. This latter objection, however,
                    seems to be disproved by the researches of the American engineers who have
                    investigated the subject. A further difficulty arises in maintaining a
                    sufficient sea-water depth to the canal even after it has been formed. On this
                    point the writer of this article, judging from documents prepared under the
                    sanction of the Government of the United States and submitted to him by an
                    authorized official of the Government, arrived at the conclusion that there are
                    very formidable obstacles to the establishment and future maintenance of a
                    deep-water entrance to the proposed Nicaraguan Canal at Greytown in the
                    Caribbean sea. These obstacles involve the engineering problem of maintaining
                    permanent deep water through an extensive shallow foreshore composed of soft
                    materials and exposed to heavy seas. The reports state “that at Greytown there
                    are now islands where twenty years ago there was water enough to float a
                    frigate.” It remains to be seen whether the same difficulties apply to the
                    entrance to the proposed Darien scheme; and, to show that such fears may not be
                    unfounded, we may remind the reader that the difficulties exist, as we have
                    stated, at the Mediterranean entrance to the Suez Canal.</p>
                <p>The question as to the best route for transit between the Atlantic and Pacific
                    is, it will be seen, still far from being solved, but the necessity for free
                    access from sea to sea remains an acknowledged fact. Its importance, especially
                    to the United States, but in some degree to all the world, is such that, great
                    as are the engineering difficulties, this long-cherished bold <hi rend="italic"
