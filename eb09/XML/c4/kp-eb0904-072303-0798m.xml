                    >Camboja,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Kamboja,</hi> a very ancient kingdom of
                    South-eastern Asia, still subsisting in decay. As now limited the territory of
                    Camboja forms a rough parallelogram, consisting in large part of alluvial plain,
                    lying athwart the lower course of the Mekong or Great Camboja River, just above
                    the Delta. The greatest length of the territory runs from W. to E., covering a
                    little more than 3½ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> of longitude, viz., from
                    about 103° E. long, to 106° 40'. The mean breadth from S. to N. is a little over
                    2° of latitude, extending on the western coast from 10° 30' N^. lat. to 11° 45',
                    and on the little known eastern frontier from about 11° 35' to 13° 40'. On the
                    N. it is bounded by provinces which the Siamese have wrested from Camboja; on
                    the E. by Cochin-Chinese territory; on the S. by the Delta Provinces first taken
                    by Cochin-China from Camboja, and then by the French from Cochin-China; on the
                    W. by the Gulf of Siam, along which it extends for 200 miles, now its only
                    seaboard.</p>
                <p>Both the ethnology and the early history of Camboja partake of the obscurity that
                    hangs over Indo-China generally. But traditions of the ancient grandeur of the
                    kingdom are borne out by the recent exploration of numerous architectural
                    remains of extraordinary extent and magnificence within its former limits. Some
                    important notices are found in Chinese annals, and more information is to be
                    expected when numerous existing inscriptions shall have been successfully
                    interpreted.</p>
                <p>The name given by the people of Camboja to their own race is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Khmer,</hi> a name which was known and used by early Arab voyagers and
                    geographers under the form <hi rend="italic">Komdr,</hi> and noted by them as a
                    country famous for aloes-wood; it has, however, been imbroiled in much confusion
                    both by them and by their commentators. There is a persistent and apparently
                    well-founded tradition among the Khmér, that before their own immigration, as
                    they say from the north, the <hi rend="italic">Tsiam</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Champa</hi> race were in possession of the soil, whilst the Khmér themselves
                    seem to have preceded the descent of the <hi rend="italic">Thai</hi> race, to
                    which the people of Siam and Laos belong.</p>
                <p>Local written legends again appear to speak of two early immigrations from
                    Gangetic India. We know that the Pali-Buddhistical annals of Ceylon record that
                    at the conclusion of the third great synod of the Buddhist church, held at
                    Palibothra, in the year 302 after Buddha (corresponding, according to ordinary
                    Ceylonese reckoning, to 241 B.C., but as corrected by Professor Max Müller to
                    175 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> a mission was despatched to the region of

                    this record may have been the real basis of the earlier Cambojan tradition. But
                    it must not be forgotten that in Ptolemy’s map of the Indo-Chinese coast are
                    found many Sanskrit names, indicating the existence of Hindu settlements at
                    least as early as the 1st century of our era. The name of <hi rend="italic"

                    subjected to fantastic charade-making after the Chinese fashion of

                    of <hi rend="italic">Kambοja</hi> have been tortured by the later natives to

                    the transfer of a name famous in old Indian literature as that of a race and
                    region on the N.W. of the Panjâb, in or near the present Chitrâl. Such transfers
                    were common, and many survive in Indo-Chinese use or memory to this day.<note

                    Camboj⅛did not even then exist.</p></note></p>
                <p>It is a singular circumstance that some of the Cambojan legends collected by
                    Bastian—indications of which were also recorded by missionaries two centuries
                    ago—bring the second Indian immigration from a western region called <hi
                    rend="italic">Rom</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Roma-visei.</hi> This will be
                    noticed again.</p>
                <p>Like other Indo-Chinese states Camboja possesses written annals; but these do not
                    commence till 1346 <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.</hi> Hence they .only take up the
                    history of the kingdom when its power, and perhaps its civilization, were
                    already past their climax.</p>
                <p>From the Chinese annals older information is obtained. These mention, under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Fu-nan,</hi> and as early as the 12th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> a kingdom embracing what afterwards became Camboja;
                    and the Emperor Hiao-wuti of the Han dynasty is alleged to have made Funan
                    tributary, along with adjoining countries, <hi rend="italic">circa 125</hi> B.c.
                    Some two centuries later the same annals place an immigration under a foreign
                    prince, who became the founder of a dynasty, and is perhaps to be identified
                    with the Indian leader of the native legends. The fourth king of this
                    dynasty—say in the latter part of the 2d century—makes extensive conquests over
                    the adjoining kingdoms and coasts, and takes the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tawang</hi> (“great king”), probably a translation of the Indian title <hi
                    rend="italic">MahA-rdja</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> which reappears
                    some centuries later in Arab narratives as that of the King of the Isles. It is
                    alleged, too, at this time, that the people of <hi rend="italic">Ta-tsán,
                    i.e.,</hi> of the Roman empire, including Western Asia, frequented the ports of
                    Funan for trade. This circumstance is highly probable when we consider that
                    Ptolemy attests such voyages as having been made at least <hi rend="italic"
                    >occasionálly,</hi> in the 1st or 2d century, whilst the Arab narratives show
                    that they were habitual in the 9 th.</p>
                <p>Cambojan legend, like that of nearly all the Indo-Chinese countries, couples the
                    introduction of Buddhism (perhaps rather its re-introduction) with the name of
                    Buddhaghosha. However that may be, it is about the 1000th year of Buddha (i.e.,
                    according to the ordinary calculation 457 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> and
                    near the date usually assigned to Buddhaghosha, that the traditions place a
                    great king, <hi rend="italic">Phutamma Surivong, i.e.,</hi> Padma Suryavansi;
                    and it is at this epoch of the 5th and 6th centuries that Garnier is inclined to
                    place the great kings, who were the founders of the older architectural
                    monuments. Fergusson would place these several centuries later, but the whole
                    subject of their chronology is as yet too obscure. From about this time the
                    kingdom is known in Chinese records as <hi rend="italic">Chinla,</hi> and to
                    those days of splendour may be referred an old Chinese proverbial saying, “Rich
                    as Chinla.” It appears long to have ruled over the valley of the Menam (since
                    the 14th century the seat of Siamese monarchy), and perhaps at one time to the
                    shores of the Bay of Bengal. In the reign of Prakrama Bahu of Ceylon (1155 A.D.)
                    we hear, in the annals of that island, of his intercourse with Camboja <hi
                    rend="italic">(Jour.</hi> As. <hi rend="italic">Soc. Bengal,</hi> vol. xli. p.
                    198).</p>
                <p>A very remarkable account of Chinla or Camboja, by an envoy sent from Peking
                    shortly after the death of Kublaí Khan (viz., in 1295-1297), has been translated
                    by Abel-Rémusat, and affords us a strange peep into the midst of a civilization
                    now in the profoundest decay. The accuracy of his details regarding topography
                    and surviving monuments of architecture attests the writer’s truthfulness. The
                    court and capital are described as very splendid, whilst (as in all Indo-Chinese
                    countries) some traits of the deepest barbarism in manners show themselves. The
                    kingdom possessed many fortified cities; but its power was already in decline,
                    for it had not long before suffered from one of those invasions of the Thai
                    which have ever since been wearing it away. Again and again such invasions and
                    temporary occupation were repeated, especially after the foundation of the
                    Siamese monarchy by another branch of the Thai in 1350.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese found their way to Camboja not long after the conquest of Malacca,
                    and the kingdom still retained a good deal of the shell of its old splendour.
                    Yet its native force appears by this time to have been in reality almoăt burnt
                    out; and towards the end of the 16th century the land swarmed with foreign
                    adventurers, both European and Asiatic, among the latter of whom Japanese were
                    prominent. At the instigation of some of these adventurers we find the Spanish
                    authorities at Manilla (1594- 1598) engaging in “fillibustering” expeditions to
                    Camboja, with little result. Somewhat later the Portuguese had factories in the
                    country, and then the Dutch (1635). Notices of English trade with Camboja appear
                    as early as 1616. In 1641 Gerard van Wusthoff of the Dutch factory conducted a
                    remarkable expedition up the Great River to Vienchang, the capital of one of the
                    Laos states, about 1000 miles from the sea,—a feat never repeated till the
                    French mission of 1866-68. In 1643 Mynheer Regemortis, envoy from Batavia, with
                    all the Europeans of the factory, on his way to court, were assassinated under
                    Portuguese instigation, and this put a discreditable and too characteristic end
                    to the official relations of Europeans with Camboja. The English established a
                    factory at Pulo Condore, a group of islands off the coast of the Cambojan delta
                    in 1702, but this also came to a speedy end in the massacre of its members by
                    the Macassar sepoys of the garrison. The first missionary who entered Camboja
                    was Gaspar da Cruz, a Dominican, in 1555. He has left some curious particulars
                    which are given by Purchas.</p>
                <p>Camboja continued to be ground between the two millstones of Siam and the now
                    rising kingdom of Cochin-China. The former about 1690 annexed large tracts on
                    the N.W., augmented a century later, and again in 1810-12, by seizures which
                    embraced the districts adjoining the Great Lake, at the very heart of the old
                    monarchy; the latter in the middle of the last century absorbed the whole of the
                    Delta; and Camboja was thus reduced to its present narrow limits. In 1846 a king
                    was enthroned under the joint investiture of Siam and Cochin-China. The French
                    invasion of the Anamite provinces in the Delta took place in 1859, and these
                    were formally ceded in 1862. Meantime Camboja seemed about to be finally
                    swallowed up by Siam. It was manifest, however, that the prospects of the new
                    French possession would be materially restricted if all above the Delta were
                    Siamese; and France began to claim the character of protector of Camboja. In
                    1864 the king, Morodam, was solemnly crowned in the presence of a French and of
                    a Siamese representative; and a treaty was <pb break="no"

                    joint protection of those two powers, but practically of France. The presence of
                    a Siamese resident at the court ceased; and thus a reprieve at least was given
                    to this ancient monarchy.</p>

                    we shall speak below, abandoned in consequence of its exposure to Siamese
                    aggression in 1388, but briefly reoccupied in 1437. In 1388 the court moved to

                    of the outlet of the Great Lake with the Mekong. This appears to be the place
                    named by some of the old. writers <hi rend="italic">Ghordamuco.</hi> About 1528
                    it was established at <hi rend="italic">Lovek</hi> (called by Valentijn <hi

                    opposite Lovek. Udong, a few miles north of the confluence, became the capital
                    in 1739, and so continued down to 1866, when it was again transferred to
                    P’nompenh. The chief port of foreign trade in the 17th century was <hi
                    rend="italic">Potai-mat,</hi> called by foreigners <hi rend="italic"

                    by the Cochin-Chinese, and now French. Since the annexations by Siam and Anam
                    Camboja has only one port, <hi rend="italic">Kdmpot.</hi> The trade is chiefly
                    in Chinese hands. Between this and the rich alluvial tract round the capitals a
                    high range of hills has to be passed, but there is a cart road the whole way to

                    name bestowed when its delta yet belonged to Camboja, flows through the existing
                    territory for about 250 miles, from N.E, to S.W. This river as a whole will be

                    called by the Cochin-Chinese <hi rend="italic">(Bienhoα),</hi> or “Freshwater
                    Lake” of the Cambojans <hi rend="italic">(Tale-Sab),</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    those sheets of water which in Bengal are called <hi rend="italic">jhils,</hi>
                    viz., a shallow depression in an illuvial plain, retaining a part of the annual
                    overflow of the rivers throughout the year, and hence subject to great
                    variations in depth and extent. In the rains it is said to have a length of
                    about 100 miles (N.W. to S.E.) with a breadth of one-third as much. Its average
                    depth in the dry season is only 4 feet. The üdong River, communicating between
                    the lake and the Mekong, fills a channel of great breadth. Its waters change
                    their direction half-yearly, from June to December filling the lake from the
                    Mekong, and from December to June draining the lake into the Mekong. The lake is
                    an object of superstitious regard to the people, and the fishery therein is the
                    most important event in their annual life. It is carried on in the dry season,
                    during which time extensive pile-villages are erected in the lake, where the
                    drying and salting of the fish is carried on. The dried fish is exported largely
                    to Cochin-China, as well as live fish in cages. Much also is converted into
                    oil.</p>

                    >and Exports.</hi> —The <hi rend="italic">elephant</hi> may be regarded as the
                    characteristic animal of Camboja. Wild herds are numerous, and frequent the
                    shores of the lake in the dry season. The tamed animals are by no means so well
                    trained as in India, but they are the chief beasts of burden, and a few years
                    ago did not cost more than £10 or £12. The <hi rend="italic">rhinoceros</hi>
                    also abounds (the species we do not find stated) about the foot of the mountains
                    north of the lake. Strong and handsome <hi rend="italic">ponies</hi> are bred,
                    much in demand at Bangkok. Among wild animals there are said to be three species
                    of <hi rend="italic">ιvilxl cattle.</hi></p>
                <p>The Chinese envoy of 1295-97 mentions among Cambojan exports rhinoceros’ horns,
                    gamboge, cardamoms, and eagle-wood; and these are still among the most
                    characteristic. Though the gum called <hi rend="italic">gamboge</hi> derives its
                    name from Camboja, and is chiefly supplied by that country, the tree <hi
                    rend="italic">(Garcinia Morelia)</hi> does not appear to have been seen in its
                    native localities by any botanist. Dr Thorel, of the French expedition,
                    indicates its habitat as in the N.W. of the old Cambojan territory, about Korat,
                    now subject to Siam. The <hi rend="italic">cardamoms (</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Amomum villosum,</hi> Louveiro) are produced in the mountains not far from the
                    lake. <hi rend="italic">Eaglewood</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Aloes-wood)</hi>
                    appears to be the result of disease, forming internal cavities in the soft white
                    wood of <hi rend="italic">Aqτιi∙ laria agallocha,</hi> and is obtained by
                    splitting the tree,- its probable existence in any tree being recognized by
                    indications known to the collectors. It is now found chiefly near the coast of
                    the Gulf of Siam, about Chantibun (now Siamese), and is said to be common in the
                    island of Kotran, or Phukok, off Kampot. The names <hi rend="italic">eagle-wood,
                    agila,</hi> &lt;tc., are corruptions from the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aguru,</hi> and have nothing to do with eagles.</p>
                <p>Other vegetable products are nutmeg, liquorice, caoutchouc and gutta-percha,
                    tobacco, sapan-wood, pepper, rice, cotton, &amp;c., with benzoin from the Upper
                    Mekong. Additional exports of sorts are hides and horns, tortoise-shell, lac,
                    ivory, and dried elephant flesh. Iron of excellent quality is smelted and
                    wrought by some of the hill tribes.</p>

                    still imperfectly known, we cannot speak in our limited space. The Cambojans
                    proper, or <hi rend="italic">Khmer,</hi> differ much from both Siamese and
                    Cochin-Chinese. They are described as tall, well and strongly made, showing less
                    of Mongoloid feature than any of the better known nations of Indo-China;
                    good-natured but apathetic, and leaving all the trouble and gains of trade to
                    Chinese, Anamites, and Malays. Their religion is Buddhism of the usual
                    Indo-Chinese type. But like the other races of that region they call in the
                    devil-dancing medicineman in illness. They cut the hair short, leaving a
                    top-tuft, and wear the <hi rend="italic">langŭti,</hi> or loin-cloth, tucked
                    between the legs, using that Hindu name for it.</p>
                <p>There are some 2000 Roman Catholic Christians in the country, and some
                    considerable number of Malay and Tsiam Mahometans. The Malays are chiefly on the
                    coast, and claim to be very ancient settlers.</p>
                <p>The government is an absolute monarchy, after the usual Indo-Chinese kind, with a
                    second king or caesar, the <hi rend="italic">Yuvα-râja</hi> of ancient India,
                    known by a corruption of that title.</p>
                <p>The language is placed by the late Mr Logan in his “Mon Anam” class. But it
                    appears to differ materially from the Anamite, as well as from other purely
                    monosyllabic languages of Indo-China. These, like the Chinese, employ a variety
                    of so-called <hi rend="italic">tones,</hi> or inflexions of voice, by which
                    different meanings of the same monosyllable are discriminated,—the Anamite
                    having six such tones. The Cambojan is without these, being spoken, as a
                    missionary expresses it, <hi rend="italic">recto tono.</hi> The numeration is
                    stated by Garnier to present traces of a quinary system, but the vocabulary
                    which he gives hardly confirms this. The letters are an ornamental form of the
                    Pali, which has been the foundation of all the Indo-Chinese alphabets. An older
                    form, illegible to the modern priests, is used in the inscriptions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Architectural Antiquities.</hi> ∙ As already indicated, these
                    are of the highest importance and interest. They are found in some forty or more
                    known localities, and some as far north as Suren in the Korat district, now
                    Siamese (14° 47' N. lat.) Indeed the most important remains are all in what is
                    now Siamese territory, north of the Great Lake. The remains embrace walled
                    cities of large extent; palaces and temples, stupendous in scale and rich in
                    design, and often most elaborately decorated with long galleries of <pb

                    walls of cut stone; stone bridges of extraordinary design and excellent
                    execution; elaborate embanked highways across the alluvial flats, &amp;c. Were
                    it possible to reconcile the geography, they would almost justify the
                    extravagant fictions of Mendez Pinto regarding the palaces and temples of
                    Timplan and Timagogo.</p>
                <p>About fifteen miles north of the lake, buried in forest, is the ancient capital,
                    commonly called <hi rend="italic">Angkor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Na,khoη</hi>
                    (both corruptions of the Indian <hi rend="italic">Nagara) Thom,</hi> or “the
                    Great City,” the proper old name of which was <hi rend="italic">Intlιapata-buri,
                    i.e.,</hi> Indraprasthapuri, after the capital of the Pandus in the ancient
                    India of the Mahâbhârat. Mouhot and Thomson have by some misapprehension greatly
                    exaggerated its size; but its walls do in fact form a quadrangle of nearly 8½
                    miles in circuit and 30 feet in height, surrounded by a very wide ditch. There
                    are five gates (two on the east), of very grandiose though fantastic
                    architecture. About five miles south of the city is the great temple called <hi
                    rend="italic">Nakhon Wat, i.e.,</hi> “the city monastery,” one of the most
                    extraordinary architectural relics in the world.</p>
                <p>This also is enclosed by a quadrangular wall of 3860 yards in compass, outside of
                    which is a wide ditch. We cannot attempt to describe this edifice with its
                    corridors, sculptures, and towers rising to 180 feet and upwards. Much in the
                    detail is Indian; much that is but obscurely traced as yet in India connects
                    itself with other remains in Indo-China and in Java; much again is unique. One
                    remarkable point is the <hi rend="italic">Roman-Dorie</hi> character of the
                    enriched pilasters which form a feature frequently recurring; this, too, has
                    parallels, though not quite so striking, in Ceylon and in mediaeval Burmese
                    remains.</p>
                <p>Some remarkable features of the Camboja monuments are distinctly mentioned in the
                    Chinese mediaeval narrative, but there is apparently no notice of the Nakhon
                    Wat. If force is to be attached to this omission, it will indicate the date of
                    that building as between 1296 and 1352, the date of the first great Siamese
                    invasion. We are not yet in a .position to say with certainty to what worship
                    they were dedicated, though inclining to the view of Garnier, who regards them
                    as belonging to Buddhism, the still existing worship of the nation; and. <hi
                    rend="italic">some</hi> of the temples are certainly Buddhist. Mr Fergusson
                    dissents, and regards the great temples as monuments of serpent-worship,—though
                    admitting doubt.</p>
                <p>Though the existence of these remarkable ruins had been quite forgotten till what
                    may be called their rediscovery, of which the first distinct account was given
                    by Μ. Mouhot in 1859, they had been known to some of the early Jesuit
                    missionaries, who speak of their “discovery in 1570 and a notice of them from
                    such a source will be found in Zedler’s <hi rend="italic">Universal Lexicon</hi>
                    under “Cambodscha” (1733). Father Ribadeneyra (1601) says a legend ascribed the
                    erection to Alexander the Great. This must have originated with the Malays,
                    among whom Iskandar and . the “Alexander Saga” were familiar and popular. And to
                    the same communication may perhaps be due that strange introduction of <hi
                    rend="italic">Rome</hi> into the legendary history. This would then be Rome in
                    its Mussulman sense,— <hi rend="italic">Rûm</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
