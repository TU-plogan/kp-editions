                    matters, enclosing a central fibrous wick, and designed for giving light.</p>
                <p>The raw materials mostly used for candles are tallow and palm oil; they are also
                    made from wax, cocoa-nut oil, paraffin, spermaceti, the mineral wax called
                    ozokerit, &amp;c. For ordinary tallow candles, the mutton or ox tallow, taken as
                    soon as possible after separation from the carcase, is sorted, cut into pieces,
                    and melted in a pan; the membranous matters, which are known as <hi
                    rend="italic">graves</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cracklings,</hi> collect at the
                    surface; and the liquid tallow, after being strained through a sieve and washed
                    with boiling water, is ready for use. The candles are made either by dipping or
                    by moulding.</p>
                <p>The common tallow candles, however, are greatly inferior, both as regards
                    illuminating power and absolute expense, to those now obtained from raw fats by
                    processes based on the researches of some French chemists. The stearine or
                    stearic acid industry, which is now of large proportions, originated in Μ.
                    Chevreul’s discovery that fats are composed of oιre or more inflammable fatty
                    acids combined with a comparatively uninflammable base, glycerine. Thus, tallow
                    or palm oil consists of palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids, with glycerine. An
                    economical method of separating the acids and the glycerine was first discovered
                    in 1831 by De Milly, who used lime for the purpose, in place of potash and soda,
                    the substances adopted by Chevreul and Gay-Lussac in their patent of 1825. The
                    factory established by De Milly and Motard near the <hi rend="italic">Barrière
                    de</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">Étoile,</hi> in Paris, gave the
                    “star candles” their name.</p>
                <p>In this saponification by means of lime, the melted fat is stirred some hours
                    with a mixture of lime (about 14 per cent, of the weight of the fat) and water.
                    The lime combines with the acids to form a soap, and the glycerine, dissolved in
                    the water, is then run off. Next, the lime soap is decomposed, under heat, by
                    means of sulphuric acid, which unites with the lime, the fatty acids being set
                    free. 100 parts of the fatty acids, at this stage, give on an average 45 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 9 parts of a mixture of stearic and palmitic acids.
                    The acids are washed with water, and allowed to cool and solidify. They are then
                    pressed in press bags, both in the cold state and with application of heat, to
                    expel oleic acid, which is liquid. After further purification, they are ready to
                    be made into “stearine candles.”</p>
                <p>Various other methods of saponification have come into practice. Thus it was
                    found that the amount of lime in the foregoing process might be greatly reduced
                    if the mixture were heated to a higher temperature with superheated steam. In
                    another method, sulphuric acid is added to the fat, and the mixture is heated.
                    The black mass produced is washed with boiling water till all the fatty acids
                    are completely freed from sulphuric acid. Then they are distilled with the aid
                    of superheated <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n886/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0886-0803"/> steam, cooled and pressed. This process offers
                    advantages in treatment of impure and refuse fats, but it involves some waste of
                    fat. Distillation has been dispensed with in the simpler process of De Milly
                    (who found that fat could be saponified with sulphuric acid without formation of
                    tarry matter), and more recently in that of Bock. According to the latter, most
                    neutral fats consist of small fat spherules, with thin albuminous skins. A
                    little strong sulphuric acid introduced, under given conditions, has the effect
                    of partly carbonizing the skins and liberating the neutral fat, which is then
                    ready for decomposition by boiling with water in open vessels. The fatty acids
                    obtained after decomposition (they are about 94 per cent, of the original fat)
                    are of a dark colour, from the presence of portions of the carbonized skins. By
                    suitable oxidation with acid, the colouring matters are rendered precipitable.
                    The fatty acids are afterwards pressed. A method of saponification specially
                    suitable for palm oil is that of heating the substance in a still to a
                    temperature of 290° to 315° C., and passing a current of superheated steam
                    through it. Saponification by water under high pressure seems to have been first
                    observed by Faraday in 1823; a∏d the process has been developed industrially by
                    Tilghmann, Meisens, and others.</p>
                <p>The wicks of candles are generally of cotton-yarn, and, to secure good steady
                    combustion, they should be of uniform thickness, and free from knots or loose
                    threads. The parallel threads of the wick are commonly twisted into a loose
                    spiral. Plaited wicks were introduced by Cambacérès, his object being to do away
                    with the necessity of snuffing. Through twisting of the plaited wick as it
                    burns, the protruding end is kept just outside the flame, and consumed to ash by
                    the surrounding air. In stearine candles, the combustibility is often aided by
                    impregnating the wicks with a solution of boracic acid; a glass bead is formed
                    at the top of the burning wick through the action of the acid on the
                    constituents of the ash, and this by its weight turns the wick out of the flame.
                    Another form of wick for stearine candles is prepared by first winding
                    cotton-yarn round a wire. The covered rod is inserted in the mould, and after
                    moulding is withdrawn from its covering, which remains as the wick. Machinery is
                    now used in making various kinds of wick.</p>
                <p>In the production of candles by dipping, the wicks are first arranged in pendant
                    position on sticks on a frame corresponding in size to the dipping-trough, and
                    each frame is suspended from one of a number of cross arms projecting from and
                    jointed with an upright beam which turns on pivots. The workman turns these arms
                    round, and as each frame comes over the dipping-trough, he presses the frame
                    down, so that all the wicks are immersed in the tallow. This coats the wicks
                    with one thin layer; the arms are then turned round, and each frame, as it
                    successively arrives over the cistern, is treated the same way. The layer of
                    tallow added in the dipping becomes consolidated before the turn comes for that
                    set of candles to receive a second dip; and the arms are turned round and the
                    candles dipped again and again, until all have acquired the requisite thickness
                    and weight, which is known by a counterpoise fixed to the arm.</p>
                <p>In the process of moulding, on the other hand, a number of slightly conical
                    pewter moulds (ten to eighteen), finely-polished inside, are fixed by the larger
                    extremity to a kind of trough, their taper ends projecting downwards. The wick
                    is then fixed in the centre of the mould by being drawn through an aperture at
                    the point of the mould which forms the upper end of the candle, and is retained
                    in its place at the open extremity within the trough by means of a wire or other
                    arrangement. The liquid material, being υoured into the trough, fills all the
                    moulds, and as soon as it is solidified, any redundance is removed and the
                    candie drawn out of the mould by the end of the wick which has been held by the
                    wire. Moulding-machines are in common use, in which as one set of candles is
                    discharged from the moulds, the latter are, by the same movement, rewicked for
                    the next process of filling. A reel of wick is connected with each mould. The
                    discharged candles are held in a horizontal position, while a knife severs the
                    wicks. Before receiving the fat, the moulds are slid on a railway into a hot
                    closet to be heated. Each machine holds about 200 frames of moulds, and each
                    frame contains 18 bobbins, each of which at first has 60 yards of cotton
                    wick.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">stearine</hi> candles are made by moulding. A difficulty
                    arose from the tendency of stearic acid to crystallize in large foliated
                    crystals, the candles produced being thus irregular in structure and brittle.
                    The remedy at first adopted was the addition of a little arsenious acid, but
                    this proved detrimental to health. The method now employed is to mix 2 to 6 per
                    cent, of white wax with the stearic acid when molten, or to add about 20 per
                    cent, of paraffin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wax</hi> is a material not very suitable for moulding on
                    account of its contraction in cooling and adhesion to the moulds. Several
                    varieties of wax, besides that of bees, are used in candle-making. The wax is
                    first submitted to a bleaching process; and the candles are generally made by
                    ladling molten wax upon the wicks from a large basin over which they are
                    suspended from an iron ring. When the proper thickness has been acquired, the
                    candles are taken down and rolled on a marble slab, or wooden table, and arc
                    then cut and trimmed. Where wax candles are made by the hand, the wax, being
                    kept soft in hot water, is applied bit by bit to the suspended wick. Presses
                    have been contrived for making wax candles; they are of similar arrangement to
                    those for making continuous lengths of lead and block-tin pipes. The wick is so
                    directed that it is concentrically surrounded with soft wax when ejected from
                    the spout of the cylinder of the press, thus forming a continuous candle, which
                    is afterwards cut up into lengths. Wax tapers of various thickness are produced
                    by drawing the uncut wick through molten wax in a pan, then through a draw iron
                    provided with somewhat conical apertures, arranged like those for wire-drawing,
                    in the side of the vessel. The waxed wick is wound very slowly on a drum, the
                    wax having time to solidify in its passage. The process may be repeated several
                    times with drawing irons of increasing aperture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Paraffin,</hi> now largely made into candles, is obtained from
                    native petroleum (Rangoon oil), or from the products of dry distillation of
                    peat, brown coal, Boghead mineral, lignite, bituminous schist, or ozokerit. The
                    paraffin of candles is generally a mixture of several paraffins having different
                    melting points. A little stearic acid (5 to 15 per cent.) is usually added, in
                    order to make the candles more rigid, and in some instances to raise the
                    temperature of fusion; it also facilitates colouring. The candles are moulded
                    much in the same way as stearine candles. The molten paraffin, however, is
                    solidified suddenly by immersion of the warm moulds in cold water, the paraffin
                    being thus prevented from becoming crystalline and opaque. For black paraffin
                    candles the paraffin is heated with anacardium shells, the resin of which is
                    dissolved by it.</p>
                <p>The mineral wax dr paraffin known as <hi rend="italic">ozokerιt</hi> is found in
                    the Carpathian Mountains, Galicia, Bohemia, and elsewhere. At the low
                    temperature of 66° C. it becomes fluid, and other less fusible substances can
                    then be added. Dr Letheby has observed that the light of 754 ozokerit candles
                    equals that of 891 paraffin, or 1150 wax candles. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sperma-</hi><hi rend="italic">ceti</hi> is the solid matter obtained from the
                    oil of the sperm whale by filtration. In further preparation for candles it is
                    hardened and whitened by pressure, and refined by a weak <pb break="no"

                    to prevent crystallization. Sperm candles have a high illuminating power, and
                    notwithstanding their costliness, a considerable trade is done in them. The
                    well-known <hi rend="italic">composite</hi> candles are made of a mixture of
                    palm-acid and the stearine of cocoa-nut oil in various proportions. <hi

                    thin wick, calculated usually to burn from six to ten hours. In making them, the
                    melted fat is poured into shallow moulds having movable bottoms, with a
                    projecting wire which moulds a narrow tube for the wick. By pressing up the
                    bottom the cylinders of fat are ejected; a wax-covered wick supported on a small
                    piece of tin is afterwards inserted, and is cemented at the bottom part by
                    pressing the night light on a warm porcelain slab. <hi rend="italic">Child’s
                    night lights</hi> are made in paper cases of the nature of pill boxes, having a

                    inserted.</p>
                <p>A candle is a simple but ingenious contrivance for supplying a flame with as much
                    melted material as it can consume without smoking. If the thickness of the
                    candle be properly adapted to that of the wick, the fatty matter immediately
                    below the flame is melted, so that a cup-like reservoir is produced, always
                    properly filled for feeding the flame. The fibres of the wick act as a congeries
                    of capillary tubes which convey the fluid fat into the flame, where, being
                    exposed to a high temperature and sheltered from the air by the outer shell of
                    flame, it becomes subjected to a dry distillation. The inflammable vapour thus
                    produced rises, and by constant combustion diminishes in quantity and
                    consequently in diameter, until at length it entirely disappears in a point. A
                    current of air from below is produced by the heat of the flame; the oxygen of
                    the air, aided by the high temperature, decomposes the inflammable vapour of the
                    føt into hydrogen and carbon, and unites with these to form water and carbonic
                    acid.</p>
                <p>The interior dark part of a candle or other flame contains unignited inflammable
                    vapour which will not of itself support combustion; it may be drawn off with a
                    glass tube and ignited at a distance. According to Frankland, the luminosity of
                    an ordinary candle, lamp, or gas flame is due, not, as commonly supposed, to the
                    separation of solid particles of carbon, but to that of very dense hydrocarbons,
                    which produce the same effect as the vapours of arsenic and phosphorus in their
                    respective flames.</p>
