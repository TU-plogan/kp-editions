                    shortening it. Some of these, such as the Abacus, Napier’s Bones (invented by
                    the father of logarithms), and the modern Sliding Rule, are rather aids to
                    calculation than calculating machines. Pascal is believed to have been the
                    original inventor of a calculating machine; its use was limited to addition,
                    multiplication, &amp;c., of sums of money, and as it required the constant
                    intervention of a human operator the results were subject to the ordinary errors
                    of manipulation. After him came the celebrated Leibnitz, Dr Saunderson, who,
                    blind from his childhood, became professor of mathematics in Cambridge, and
                    others. But all their machines were completely cast into the shade by the
                    wonderful inventions of the late Charles Babbage. He knew well the immense value
                    that absolutely correct tables possess for the astronomer and the navigator, and
                    that a machine which could produce them with speed was a very great desideratum.
                    The first calculating machine he invented he called a difference engine, because
                    it was to calculate tables of numbers by the method of differences. By setting
                    at the outset a few figures the attendant would obtain by a mechanical operation
                    a long series of numbers absolutely correct. The difference engine was not
                    intended to answer special questions, but to calculate and then print numerical
                    tables, such as logarithm tables, tables for the <hi rend="italic">Nautical
                    Almanac,</hi> &amp;c. An interesting account of some of the errors which are
                    found in what are considered reliable tables is given in a paper by Babbage in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Astronomical Society,</hi> 1827.</p>
                <p>Every numerical table consists of a series of numbers which continuously increase
                    or diminish. As an example take the squares of the natural numbers, 1, 4, 9, 16,
                    25, 36, &amp;c. Designate this series by N. If we subtract each term from the
                    one following it we get a new series, 3, 5, 7, 9, &amp;c., which is called the
                    series of first differences; designate this by ∆ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>.
                    If in the same way we subtract each term of this series from the succeĕding
                    term, we get what is called the series of second differences, every term of
                    which is in this instance 2. Designate this series by Δ <hi rend="superscript">

                    The natural numbers from 0 to 9 were cut on the rims of the figure wheels; hence
                    each figure-wheel in a column could represent a digit. Thus the lowest wheel
                    gave the units digit, the second wheel the tens digit. The number 5703 would be
                    represented on the wheels of a column as in the margin. The different columns
                    were to represent the successive series of differences above referred to, and
                    were called the table column, the first difference column, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>“The mechanism was so contrived that whatever might be the numbers placed
                    respectively on the figure wheels of each of the different columns, the
                    following succession of operations took place as long as the handle was moved.
                    Whatever number was found upon the column of first differences, would be added
                    to the number found upon the table column. The same first difference remaining
                    upon its own column, the number found upon the column of second differences
                    would be added to that first difference.” Similarly for all the other columns.
                    For example, suppose we are calculating the cubes of the natural numbers. At a
                    certain stage of the work we would find 125 shown by the wheels of the table
                    column, 91 by those of the first difference column, 36 by those of the second
                    difference column, and 6 on the lowest wheel of the third difference column. On
                    making a turn of the handle the 91 would be added to the 125, which would then

                <p>It was about 1822 that Babbage having constructed a small model of his engine
                    sent an account of it to Sir Humphrey Davy, then president of the Royal Society
                    of London. Government heard of the invention, and, having received from the
                    Royal Society a favourable report on the merits and utility of the engine,
                    advanced money towards its construction. Sums of money were at irregular
                    intervals voted for this purpose; but so great were the difficulties to be
                    overcome, so entirely new even were many of the tools necessary, so much time
                    was occupied in testing the value of each proposed contrivance, that in 1834
                    only a portion was completed. The construction of the machine here stopped,
                    although the Royal Society had again, in 1829, reported most favourably on the
                    engine as regards its practicability, immense utility, and the progress it had
                    made. The Government had already advanced £17,000 (over and above what Babbage
                    had spent, besides giving his personal superintendence without any
                    remuneration), and they saw no definite limit to the amoun it would cost; <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n726/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0726-0655"/> and Babbage had a delicacy in pressing for the
                    completion of the difference engine, as he had recently designed a new machine,
                    the analytical engine, which, if completed, would entirely supersede it. The
                    portion completed is in King’s College, London.</p>
                <p>It will be noticed that the use of the difference engine was limited to the
                    working of such problems as can be solved by successive additions or
                    subtractions. The analytical engine, on the other hand, was designed to <hi
                    rend="italic">work out</hi> any problem that the superintendent knew <hi
                    rend="italic">how</hi> to solve. It consists of two parts, each of a number of
                    vertical columns of figure wheels, similar to those of the difference engine; on
                    the one set called the “variables,” which we shall designate by V <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, &amp;c., the numbers
                    of the special problem or formula are placed; the other set is called the
                    “mill,” and performs the required operations of multiplication, division,
                    addition, or subtraction. Its working was directed by means of two sets of
                    cards—“operation” cards, which instructed the mill whether to multiply, divide,
                    add, or subtract, and “variable” cards, which indicated to the mill the
                    particular columns, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> numbers on which it was to
                    perform this operation. An example will make this clear. Suppose we wish to
                    solve the equations <hi rend="italic">ax + by = c, dχ + fy = g.</hi></p>
                <p>On the wheels of V <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, the first column of the
                    variables, the number α is placed, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> on V <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> on V <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>, and so on. Six columns in all are required for this. It is evident that
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> =</hi> —È? ∙ Hence, to gθ
                    <hi rend="superscript"> fc a</hi> 5 <hi rend="superscript"> we</hi> require the
                    products of ∕ and <hi rend="italic">c,</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">g,</hi> &amp;c. To get these the superintendent intimates to the
                    mill by means of an “operation” card that a multiplication is to be performed,
                    then points out by a “variable” card what are the two numbers, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the two columns to be multiplied, and on what column the result is
                    to be placed. In the first case the columns indicated would be V <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, V <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and V <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi> respectively. By another operation card and another
                    variable card, the mill would then be instructed to multiply the numbers ón V
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and V <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi>, and to place
                    the result on V <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>. Similarly <hi rend="italic"
                    >ca</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bd</hi> would be obtained on V <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 9</hi> and V <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi>. The superintendent
                    would then instruct the mill to subtract the number on V <hi rend="subscript">
                    8</hi> from that on V <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi>, to place the result <hi
                    rend="italic">(fc</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">bg)</hi> on V
                    <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi>, and similarly, <hi rend="italic">fa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">bd</hi> would be placed on V <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 12</hi>, By a new operation card the mill would now be put
                    into a “dividing” state, and a variable card would tell it that V <hi
                    rend="subscript"> π</hi> was to be divided by V <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi>,
                    and the result given on V <hi rend="subscript"> 13</hi>. This would be the value
                    of <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> Similarly for <hi rend="italic">y.</hi> The number
                    of cards can be greatly diminished. Thus, for the four multiplications one card
                    would suffice. The cards are of pasteboard (say) and have holes punched in
                    them,—a multiplication” card having a certain number of holes bored in it and
                    arranged in a particular way, a “division” card a different arrangement of
                    holes, &amp;c. The cards are so placed in the machine that certain levers drop
                    through these holes, while others are unaffected, and the machinery in
                    connection with the levers is put out of gear or not as is desired. In this way
                    the mill is put into a condition in which it multiplies (say) the numbers
                    indicated to it. The variable cards act in a similar manner. When an operation
                    card arid a variable card are given to the engine, the numbers on the assigned
                    columns are transferred to the mill, the operation is performed, and the numbers
                    and the result are placed on the proper columns. The series of cards used for
                    any one problem would enable the machine to solve any other similar problem.
                    Babbage says of the engine, “The analytical engine is therefore a machine of the
                    most general nature. Whatever formula it is required to develop, the law of its
                    development must be communicated to it by two sets of cards. When these have
                    been placed the engine is special for that particular formula. The numerical
                    constants must then be put on the wheels, and on setting the engine in motion it
                    will calculate and print the numerical results of that formula.” In the
                    construction of this engine he overcame one of the greatest difficulties in such
                    an instrument, that of effecting the carrying of tens. The engine was designed
                    so as to foresee these carriages, and act upon that foresight, and thus a great
                    reduction of the time necessary to make a given calculation was at once obtained
                    by effecting all carriages simultaneously instead of in succession. He says of
                    it, “The analytical engine will contain—1°, apparatus for printing on paper,
                    one, or if required, two copies of its results; 2°, means for producing a
                    stereotype mould of the table or results it computes. The engine would compute
                    all the tables it would itself require. It would have the power of expressing
                    every number to fifty places of figures.” It would multiply two numbers of fifty
                    figures each, and print the result in one minute. Its construction was never
                    begun, but Babbage left complete plans of every part of it.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi><hi rend="italic">Review</hi> for July
                    1834 appeared an account of the principles of Babbage’s difference engine. Herr
                    George Scheutz, a printer at Stockholm, read it, and shortly afterwards he and
                    his son Edward set about constructing a calculating machine. By 1843 they
                    produced one capable of calculating series with terms of five figures, with
                    three orders of differences, also of five figures each, and of printing its
                    results. Provided with a certificate to this effect from the Royal Swedish
                    Academy of Sciences, they endeavoured unsuccessfully to get orders for their
                    machine. In 1853, with the aid of grants from the Swedish Government, the Messrs
                    Scheutz finished a second machine which was exhibited in England, and at the
                    Paris exhibition of 1855. It eventually went to America. It was about the size
                    of a small square pianoforte. It could calculate series with four orders of
                    differences each of fifteen figures. It printed the results to eight figures,
                    the last of which was capable of an automatic correction where necessary for
                    those omitted. “It could calculate and stereotype without a chance of error two
                    and a half pages of figures in the same time that a skilful compositor would
                    take to set up the types for one single page.”</p>
                <p>A new machine by the Messrs Scheutz was constructed about 1860 by Messrs Donkin
                    for the Registrar-General for the sum of £1200. It has been used in the
                    calculation of some of the tables in the <hi rend="italic">English Life
                    Table,</hi> published in 1864. Dr Farr says of it, “The machine has been
                    extensively tried, and it has upon the whole answered every expectation. But it
                    is a delicate instrument, and requires considerable skill in the manipulation.
                    It approaches infallibility in certain respects; but it is not infallible,
                    except in very skilful hands. The weakest point is the printing apparatus, and
                    that admits of evident improvement.”</p>
                <p>Μ. Staffel and Μ. Thomas (de Colmar) have invented machines which can perform
                    addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and. extraction of the square
                    root. Μ. Thomas’s machine is extensively used.</p>
                <p>Sir William Thomson has recently invented an instrument (no description of which
                    has yet been printed) which is able to solve any linear differential equation
                    with variable coefficients.</p>
                <p>Professor Tait has also invented the principle of a machine, which, if
                    constructed, will integrate any linear differential equation of the second order
                    with variable coefficients.</p>
