                <p><label type="entry">CABLE</label>, a rope or chain used for connecting a ship
                    with her anchor. Chain cables are generally used, but on account of their weight
                    they are unsuitable for mooring in very deep water, when several lengths of
                    cable would be hanging at the “hawse pipe;” and they cannot be used, also on
                    account of their weight, when it is required to lay an anchor out at some
                    distance from the ship. Hempen cables are, therefore, supplied to all ships as
                    well as chain cables. For sizes, number, and lengths of cables carried by ships
                    of the Royal Navy and required by Lloyd’s rules to be supplied to merchant
                    ships, see article <hi rend="smallcaps">Anchor.</hi></p>
                <p>The length of a chain cable is 100 fathoms, and that of a hempen cable 101
                    fathoms. The term “a cable’s length,” by which the distance of vessels from each
                    other is usually given in nautical parlance, is understood to mean 100 fathoms,
                    or 200 yards. Cables are sometimes made of common chain, but the best and most
                    approved are made of stud-link chain, as shown in fig. 1, which gives the
                    relative proportions of the various parts. Cables are made in lengths of 12½
                    fathoms, connected together by “joining shackles,” as shown at D. Each length is
                    “marked” by a piece of iron-wire being twisted round the stud of one of the
                    links, the wire being placed on the first stud inside the first shackle,— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the stud nearest to the shackle on the side remote from
                    the anchor,—on the second stud inside the second shackle, and so on, so that the
                    length of cable which is out may always be known. For instance, if the mark is
                    on the sixth stud inside the first inboard shackle, it is known that six
                    lengths, or 75 fathoms, of cable are out, measuring from that shackle. In
                    joining the lengths together the round end of the shackle should be placed
                    towards the anchor. The end links of each length C, C are made without studs in
                    order to receive the shackles, and it is necessary to make them of iron of
                    greater diameter than that used for the stud links, in order to keep them of
                    equal strength. The stud keeps the link from collapsing, and increases its
                    strength considerably.</p>

                    for one-inch chains and signify so many diameters of the iron of the common
                    links,—thus forming a scale for all sizes.</p></note></p>-->
                <p>The next links B, B in their turn have to be enlarged to enable them to take the
                    increased size given to the links C, C. It will be observed from the sketch of
                    the shackle D that the pin is made oval, its greater diameter being in the
                    direction of the strain. The pin of the shackle which attaches the cable to the
                    anchor, and is called the “anchor shackle” in distinction from the “joining
                    shackles,” may project and be secured by a forelock; but as any projection would
                    be detrimental when the chain is running out (sometimes with great rapidity)
                    through the hawse pipes, the pins of the joining shackles are made as shown, and
                    are secured by a small pin <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> This small pin is kept from
                    coming out by being made a little short, so that a lead pellet may be driven in
                    at either end to fill up the holes in the shackle, which are made with a groove,
                    so that as the pellets are driven in they expand or dovetail, and thus keep the
                    small pin secure in its place.</p>
                <p>The cables are stowed in the chain lockers, the inner ends being firmly secured
                    to the ship by a “slip.” This is done to render it impossible for the cable to
                    run out and be lost accidentally, the slip being provided so that the cable may
                    be let go without difficulty if stress of weather or any other cause renders
                    such a proceeding imperative. It is necessary to fit one or two swivels in each
                    cable to avoid turns being taken in it as the ship swings. When a ship is moored
                    with two anchors the cables are attached to a mooring swivel (fig. 2); if this
                    is not done the cables get entwined around each other, forming what is termed a
                    “foul hawse/’ which is a troublesome thing to clear.</p>
                <p>The cable is hove up in large vessels by a capstan, and in small ones by a
                    windlass. It is brought directly to the capstan, the inner end passing to the
                    deck pipe, and thence to the chain lockers; or it is brought in by means of a
                    messenger, which is an endless chain passing round the capstan and a roller on
                    each side of the deck near the hawse pipes. The cable is stoppered to the
                    messenger by rope or iron nippers, and as the messenger goes round with the
                    capstan the cable is brought in, the nippers being shifted as required.
                    Messengers are now almost entirely superseded by the improved make of
                    capstans.</p>
                <p>Various means for checking the caole as it is running out, and for holding it,
                    have been devised. The old-fashioned<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n693/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0693-0622"/>, plan is to fit a strong iron lever called a
                    “compresser” under the deck pipe, fixed at one end in such a position that when
                    the other end is hove round by a tackle the cable will be jammed between the
                    compresser and the lower edge of the pipe. In place of compressers, or to act in
                    conjunction with them, several kinds of stoppers have been used, fitted either
                    at the deck pipes, or just inside the hawse pipes; those patented by Harfield
                    and Co. find the most favour in the Royal Navy, but the compressers are almost
                    invariably fitted with them. Ships are generally held when “riding at anchor” by
                    one or two turns of the cable being taken round the “riding bitts,” which are
                    strong structures of iron or wood, placed for this purpose near the hawse pipes.
                    “Stopper bolts”— <hi rend="italic">ix.,</hi> ring-and-eye bolts, placed in the
                    deck forward—are also fitted, to which the cable may be secured while the turns
                    are being put on or taken off the riding bitt, while the mooring swivel is being
                    attached, or at other times. (τ. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.)</hi></p>
