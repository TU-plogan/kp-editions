                    had any liking for law—at any rate he found in theology a study much more to his
                    taste. While at Edinburgh he fell into the habit of attending the theological
                    lectures, and this was followed, when the term of his apprenticeship expired, by
                    his enrolment as a regular student in the Aberdeen divinity hall. After a
                    distinguished career he was, in 1746, licensed to preach by the Presbytery of
                    Aberdeen; but his first attempt to obtain a charge—that of Fordoun in
                    Ki^cardine-shire—was unsuccessful. In 1748, however, he was ordained minister of
                    Banchory Ternan, a parish on the Dee, some twenty miles from Aberdeen. Here he
                    spent the next nine years, labouring with much success as a country minister,
                    and planning two at least of the works by which he was afterwards to make
                    himself known. In 1757 he left Banchory Ternan to become one of the ministers of
                    Aberdeen. That city was at the time the centre of no inconsiderable intellectual
                    activity. Reid was professor of philosophy at King’s College; John Gregory,
                    Reid’s predecessor, held the chair of medicine; Alexander Gerard was professor
                    of divinity at Marischal College; and in 1760 Beattie became professor of moral
                    philosophy in the same college. These men, with others of less note, formed
                    themselves in 1758 into a society for the discussion of questions in philosophy.
                    Reid was its first secretary, and Campbell one of its founders. It lasted till
                    about 1773, and during this period not a few papers were read, particularly
                    those by Reid and Campbell, which were afterwards extended in the form of
                    published treatises.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Campbell was, in 1759, made principal of Marischal College, an
                    appointment due rather to the high estimation in which he was held by those who
                    knew him, and perhaps also to his family influence with the duke of Argyll, than
                    to any published evidence he had given of his fitness for the post. But this
                    evidence, if it was required, was soon forthcoming. In 1763 he published his
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on Miracles,</hi> a work that
                    originated in a sermon preached two years previously before the Synod of
                    Aberdeen. In it he seeks to show, in opposition to Hume, that miracles are
                    capable of proof by testimony, and that the miracles of Christianity are
                    sufficiently attested. Hume derived our belief in testimony equally with our
                    belief in the laws of nature from experience; he held that where the laws of
                    nature, being a uniform experience, contradict testimony, the latter must give
                    way; and he further held that in the case of miracles the laws of nature do
                    actually contradict the testimony in favour of miracles, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> miracles are incapable of proof. In reply Campbell asserts—(1) that
                    testimony is not derived from experience, but “has a natural and original
                    influence on belief antecedent to experience.” As, however, he admits that
                    experience is, if not the source, at least the measure, of testimony, he
                    virtually grants all that Hume desires, and leaves the question where it was.
                    But (2) he urges, and with more success, that testimony can prove a miracle.
                    There is no contradiction, he argues, as Hume said there was, between what we
                    know by testimony and the evidence upon which a law of nature is based; they are
                    of a different description indeed, but we can without inconsistency believe that
                    both are true. He also dwells at considerable length upon the ambiguity of the
                    word “experience” as it is used by Hume, and devotes the rest of the work to a
                    discussion of the actual evidence for the miracles of Christianity. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertation</hi> is not a complete treatise upon miracles, and
                    does not approach the subject from points of view it would be regarded from now,
                    but with all deductions it was and still is a valuable contribution to
                    theological literature.</p>
                <p>In 1771 Campbell was elected professor of theology at Marischal College, and in
                    consequence he resigned his city charge, although he still preached as minister
                    of Greyfriars, a duty then attached to the chair. His next work was not a
                    theological one. During his early ministerial life at Banchory Ternan he planned
                    and began the composition of a work on rhetoric. The results of his labours were
                    partly communicated to the Aberdeen Philosophical Society, for most of the
                    papers he read there were on “Eloquence” and cognate subjects; but it was not
                    until 1776 that his <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Rhetoric</hi> appeared,—a
                    work that at once took a high place among books on the subject, which it can
                    hardly be said even now to have lost. The most interesting portion is perhaps
                    that which treats of evidence; certainly the least satisfactory is that on the
                    syllogism. In 1778 his last and in some respects his greatest work appeared, <hi
                    rend="italic">A New Translation of the Gospels.</hi> The translation is a good
                    one, but it is the critical and explanatory notes which accompany it that give
                    the book its high value. Several of his sermons were published, notably one in
                    1777 <hi rend="italic">On the Success of the first publishers of the Gospel,
                    considered as a proof of its truth.</hi> It was preached before the Society for
                    Propagating Christian Knowledge, and is one of the happiest specimens of his
                    style and method of argument.</p>
                <p>Campbell, who had never enjoyed robust health, was in 1795 compelled by
                    increasing weakness to resign the offices he held in Marischal College, and on
                    his retirement he received a pension of £300 from the king. He did not long
                    enjoy the royal bounty, for he died on the 31st of March 1796 of a stroke of
                    palsy. Principal Campbell had married Miss Grace Farquharson, daughter of Mr
                    Farquharson of Whitehouse. They had no children. In church politics he belonged
                    to the moderate side, but his independence of judgment and strength of
                    conviction were too great to permit him to be confined by the trammels of party.
                    It is as a theologian and as a scholar, the acutest and most cultivated that the
                    Church of Scotland has produced, that he will be best remembered.</p>
                <p>His <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Ecclesiastical History</hi> and some smaller
                    writings were published after his death; and there is a uniform edition of his
                    works in six vols. 8vo. A short account of his life, by the Kev. Mr Keith, is
                    prefixed to his <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Church History.</hi></p>
