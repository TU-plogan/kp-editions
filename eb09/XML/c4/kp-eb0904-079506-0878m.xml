                <p>Fuerteventura lies nearest to the African coast, the interval being between 50
                    and 60 miles. Besides these there are many islets, most of which are
                    uninhabited.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> There is ground for
                    supposing that the Phoenicians were not ignorant of the Canaries. The Romans, in
                    the time of Augustus, received intelligence of them through Juba, king of
                    Mauritania, whose account has been transmitted to us by the elder Pliny. He
                    mentions “Canaria, so called from the multitude of dogs of great size,” and
                    “Nivaria, taking its name from perpetual snow, and covered with clouds,”
                    doubtless Teneriffe. Canaria was said to abound in palms and pine trees. Both
                    Plutarch and Ptolemy speak of the Fortunate Islands, but their description is so
                    imperfect that it is not clear whether the Madeiras or the Canaries are referred
                    to. There is no farther mention of them until we read of their rediscovery about
                    1334, by a French vessel driven amongst them by a storm. A Spanish nobleman
                    thereupon obtained a grant of them, with the title of king, from Clement VI.,
                    but want of means prevented him from carrying out his project of conquest. Two
                    expeditions subsequently set out from Spanish ports, and returned without having
                    taken possession. At length three vessels, equipped by Jean de Bethencourt, a
                    gentleman of Normandy, sailed from Rochelle in 1400, and bent their course to
                    the Canaries. He landed at Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, but being opposed by the
                    natives, and finding himself deficient in means to effect his purpose, he
                    repaired to the court of Castile, and obtaining from Henry III. a grant of the
                    islands, with the title of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0879-0796"/> king, he sailed, in 1404 with a strong force,
                    which mastered Lauzarote, Fuerteventura, Gomera, and Hierro, without bloodshed.
                    Being repulsed in his attempts on Palma and Canary, he returned to Europe in
                    1408 to obtain further assistance. He was well received at the Castilian court,
                    where he was promised aid; but he died shortly afterwards in France.
                    Bethencourt’s nephew had been left governor of the islands, and claimed to
                    succeed to his uncle’s rights. Being charged with many acts of misgovernment, he
                    went to Spain to clear himself, and whilst there sold his rights to Don Enrique
                    de Guzman, who, after expending large sums iu fruitless endeavours to reduce the
                    unconquered islands, sold them to another Spaniard named Paraza. His successors,
                    about 1461, took nominal possession of Canary and Teneriffe, but the natives
                    effectually resisted their occupation of them. Meantime it appeared that Jean de
                    Bethencourt’s nephew had fraudulently made a second sale of the islands to
                    Portugal, and the difference thus arising between the crowns of Spain and
                    Portugal was ended by the cession of the islands to the former. Grand Canary,
                    Teneriffe, and Palma remaining unsubdued in 1476, Ferdinand» and Isabella of
                    Spain compelled Paraza’s successors ] to seit those islands to the crown; and
                    the following year 1000 men were despatched to reduce them. After much
                    bloodshed, and with reinforcements from the mother country, the Spaniards, under
                    Pedro de Vera, became masters of Grand Canary in 1483. Palma was conquered in
                    1491, and Teneriffe in 1495, by Alonzo de Lugo. All the islands still continue
                    in the possession of Spain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inhabitants.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> As to the derivation
                    of their original inhabitants, the Guanches, nothing certain is known. The most
                    probable supposition is that they came from the adjoining coast of Africa. Pliny
                    states that the islands were uninhabited at the time of which he wrote. If this
                    were so, we might infer, from the absence of any trace of Mahometanism amongst
                    the people found there by the Spaniards, that the migration took place between
                    the time to which his account refers and the time of the conquest of Barbary by
                    the Arabs. Many of the Guanches fell in opposing the Spanish invasion, many were
                    sold by the conquerors as slaves, and many conformed to the Roman Catholic faith
                    and intermarried with the Spaniards,—so that all trace of them as a distinct
                    race is lost. They were said to be of tall stature, and Humboldt styles them the
                    Patagonians of the Old World; but the skeletons of Guanches when measured have
                    been found to be less than average skeletons of Europeans. The Guanches embalmed
                    the bodies of their dead, and placed them in caves; and many mummies have been
                    found at different times in a state of extreme desiccation, each weighing not
                    more than 6 or 7 ft&gt;. Two inaccessible caves in a vertical rock by the shore,
                    three miles from Santa Cruz (Teneriffe), are said still to contain bones. A few
                    words of the languages spoken by the ancient inhabitants have been preserved,
                    and a resemblance of some of them to words of North African dialects has been
                    noticed. On the other hand, the Guanches had customs, such as that of preserving
                    their dead, in which they differed from the Berbers. Councillor Von Löher, one
                    of the most recent investigators of the question, finds that the names of places
                    in the interior of the island are generally either of Berber or of Teutonic
                    origin, and maintains that the Guanches were in all probability the descendants
                    of Vandal and Gothic immigrants.</p>
                <p>The present inhabitants are slightly darker than the people of Spain, but in
                    other respects arc scarcely distinguishable. The men are of middle height,
                    well-made, and strong; the women are not striking in respect of beauty, but they
                    have good eyes and hair. Spanish is the only language in use. The people have
                    most of the traits of the people of the peninsula; they are sober, but given to
                    gambling; they are quick, but lazy, faithless, and superstitious. The lower
                    orders are quite illiterate, and the better classes not very enlightened. A few
                    booksellers’ shops of a minor description exist at Santa Cruz and Las Palmas.
                    The sustenance of the lower classes is chiefly composed of fish, potatoes, and
                    <hi rend="italic">gofio,</hi> which is merely Indian corn or wheat roasted and
                    then, when ground, kneaded with water or milk.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government, dec.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The Archipelago
                    is politically considered part of the province of Andalusia. The
                    governorgeneral, who resides at Santa Cruz, has chief command both in civil and
                    military affairs. The actual administration of affairs is in the hands of two
                    lieutenant-governors, who reside at Santa Cruz and Las Palmas. On the other
                    islands are deputy-governors, acting under the lieutenant-governor to whose
                    district they belong. The military force is composed of a battalion of soldiers
                    of the line, numbering about 1000 men; six regiments of militia, amounting to
                    about 8000 men, distributed amongst the islands; and a few companies of
                    artillery. There is a military commander on each island. The great court of
                    appeal sits at Las Palmas. Courts of first instance sit at Santa Cruz, Orotava,
                    and Las Palmas. The land in great part is strictly entailed. The islands form
                    two bishoprics, Teneriffe and Grand Canary. The whole ecclesiastical revenue is
                    estimated at upwards of £36,000. The monkish establishments have been
                    suppressed, and such of the monasteries and convents as are not kept up for
                    secular purposes are falling to ruin. No form of religion except the Roman
                    Catholic is tolerated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Meteorology.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> From
                    April to October a north or north-east wind of more or less strength blows upon
                    the islands, commencing at 10 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> and continuing
                    until 5 or 6 p.M. In summer this wind produces a dense stratum of sea cloud
                    (cumuloni), 1000 feet thick, whose lower surface is about 3500 feet above the
                    sea at Teneriffe. This does not reach up to the mountains, which have on every
                    side a stratum of their own, about 500 feet thick, the lower surface being about
                    2500 feet above the level of the sea. Between these two distinct strata there is
                    a gap through which persons on a vessel approaching or leaving the island may
                    obtain a glimpse of the peak. Travellers who ascend the mountains look down on
                    these stationary layers of cloud. The sea cloud conceals from view the other
                    islands, except those whose mountains pierce through it. On the south-west
                    coasts there is no regular sea or land breeze. In winter they are occasionally
                    visited by a hot south-east wind, called Levante, from the African continent,
                    producing various disagreeable consequences on the exposed parts of the person,
                    besides injuring the vegetation, especially on the higher grounds. Locusts have
                    sometimes been brought by this wind. In 1812 it is said that locusts covered
                    some fields in Fuerteventura to the depth of 4 feet. Hurricanes, accompanied by
                    waterspouts, sometimes cause much devastation; but, on the whole, these islands
                    are singularly free from such visitations. The climate generally is mild, dry,
                    and salubrious. On the lower grounds the temperature is equable, the daily range
                    seldom exceeding 6° Fahr. The rainy season occurs at the same period as in
                    southern Europe. The dry season is at the time of the trade-winds, which extend
                    a few degrees farther north than this latitude. “In no part of the world is the
                    barometer more susceptible of atmospheric changes than amongst the Canary
                    Islands. A rapid rise is the sure precursor of an easterly wind, whilst the
                    contrary as certainly indicates a change to west or south-west” (Lieut.

                    >—</hi> In ordinary years sufficient grain and potatoes are produced to supply
                    the wants of the islands. The soil on the lower part of the islands, where water
                    is plentiful, is productive; in some places two crops of Indian corn and one of
                    potatoes <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n880/mode/1up"

                    a twelvemonth. Except at Fuerteventura, the vine is much cultivated, but chiefly
                    at Teneriffe, the best wines being produced on the north-west coast. None,
                    however, is considered so good as the wine of Madeira. The most esteemed kind is
                    sent to England under the name of Vidonia. The grape disease made its appearance
                    at the Canaries in 1853, and destroyed nearly the whole crop. Previously the
                    total annual produce was estimated at about 40,000 pipes, of which 25,000 pipes
                    were produced in Teneriffe. Between 8000 and 9000 pipes were exported. The price
                    per pipe on board ranged from £8 to £20. Some of the wine is distilled into good
                    brandy. Sumach, canary-seed, and a little flax are grown. Sweet potatoes, maize,
                    gourds, pumpkins, tara <hi rend="italic">(Colocasia antiquorum),</hi> lentils,
                    <hi rend="italic">Cicer arietinum,</hi> beans, kidney beans, and lupines are
                    extensively cultivated for food. From bad management the fruits are generally
                    inferior. They include oranges, figs, bananas, dates, pineapples, pomegranates,
                    papaws, guavas, custard apples, and prickly pears. There are no cocoa-nut trees
                    or bread-fruit trees. A little oil is obtained from the olive in Grand Canary.
                    The agave is abundant, and supplies a material for ropes, girths, &amp;c. The
                    leaves of the date palm are made into hats and baskets. A good deal of
                    orchil-lichen is gathered for exportation; and the ice-plant is grown in smaîl
                    quantity for barilla. The sugar manufacture, once largely carried on, has fallen
                    before the American and West Indian trade; the only two existing mills are on
                    Palma. Wine having been for some time so little remunerative, other products
                    have received attention, the chief being cochineal. This insect, which feeds on
                    a species of cactus, was introduced in 1825, and is now largely produced on all
                    the islands,—land formerly occupied by grain and vines being devoted to its
                    cultivation. In 1873 upwards of 5,728,000 lb, of the total value of 13,894,225
                    pesetas, or about £555,849, were exported, principally to France and England.
                    The silkworm is reared to á small extent, chiefly on Palma. Raw silk is
                    exported, and some is manufactured on the spot into stockings, ribands, &amp;c.
                    Some linen and woollen stuffs of a coarse kind are made for home consumption,
                    but the great bulk of the clothing in use is of British manufacture. The island
                    goats (a peculiar and esteemed breed) furnish milk, from which butter and cheese
                    are made. Pigs and sheep of a small coarse-woolled breed are numerous. Horses
                    and cattle are scarce; domestic fowls and rabbits are plentiful. Asses and mules
                    are much used. A fishery on the African coast, which gives employment to many
                    persons, has existed from an early period. The fish, principally bream, is
                    salted and largely consumed at the Canaries.</p>
                <p>There is a good deal of intercourse by means of boats and small sailing vessels
                    amongst the different islands. In this way wine, raw silk, cochineal, barilla,
                    and dried fruits are taken to the places of export; and grain is conveyed from
                    those islands where it is abundant to those where the supply is deficient. The
                    principal foreign trade is with England, the chief articles of export being
                    wine, cochineal, barilla, and orchil. The imports consist of iron, metal goods,
                    glass, crockery, leather, and silk, cotton, and woollen manufactures. There is
                    also a considerable trade with the United States and the countries bordering the
                    Mediterranean. With Hamburg and France an exchange of commodities takes place.
                    The ships employed in this commerce are foreign, chiefly British; but the
                    islanders send a few vessels of their own with brandy, coarse earthenware, and
                    silk goods to the Spanish West Indies, bringing back cigars, sugar, coffee, rum,
                    cocoa (the material of chocolate), and a few other articles. Santa Cruz,
                    Orotava, and Las Palmas are the only ports engaged in foreign trade; nearly 300
                    vessels enter these ports in the course of a year. In 1852 the ports were
                    practically made free— the small duty of 2s. per cent, only being now levied
                    upon imported goods, with the exception of tobacco, which pays 5d. per ft&gt;.,
                    and cigars which pay 10d. per lb. Spanish steamers ply between Cadiz and Santa
                    Cruz. The Spanish Government packet on its outward voyage to Havana touches at
                    Santa Cruz once a month; and the same port is visited by the English mail
                    steamers in their voyages to and from the African coast.</p>

                    and reptiles of the Canary Islands are very few in number. Of the former, only
                    species of dog, of swine, of goat, and of sheep were found upon the island by
                    the Spanish conquerors. The race of large dogs which is supposed to have given a
                    name to Canary has been long extinct. A single skeleton has been found, which is
                    deposited in one of the museums at Paris. The ferret, rabbit, cat, rat, mouse,
                    and two kinds of bat have become naturalized. The ornithology is more
                    interesting, on account at once of the birds native to the islands and the
                    stragglers from the African coast. The latter are chiefly brought over in winter
                    when the wind has blown for some time from the east. Among the former are some
                    birds of prey, as the African vulture, the falcon, the buzzard, the
                    sparrow-hawk, and the kite. There are also two species of owl, three species of
                    sea-mew, the stockdove, quail, raven, magpie, chaffinch, goldfinch, blackcap,
                    canary bird, titmouse, blackbird, house-swallow, &amp;c. The bird with the
                    sweetest song is a variety of the blackcap or <hi rend="italic">Sylvia
                    atricapilla.</hi> As to the insects, mention may be made of a species of gnat or
                    mosquito which is sometimes troublesome, especially to strangers, and the
                    cockroach. The list of reptiles is limited to three lizards and a frog. The only
                    fresh-water fish is the eel. The marine fishes are not numerous, the reason
                    perhaps being that the steepness of the coast does not allow seaweed to grow in
                    sufficient quantity to support the lower forms of marine animal life. Whales and
                    seals are occasionally seen. The cuttle-fish is abundant, and is sought for as
                    an article of food.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Botany.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The position of
                    mountainous islands like the Canaries, in the sub-tropical division of the
                    temperate zone, is highly favourable to the development, within a small space,
                    of plants characteristic of both warm and cold climates. Von Buch refers to five
                    regions of vegetation in Teneriffe :—1. From the sea to the height of 1300 feet.
                    This he styles the African region. The climate in the hottest parts is similar
                    to that of Egypt and southern Barbary. Here grow, among the introduced plants,
                    the coffee-tree, the date-palm, the sugar-cane, the banana, the orange tree, the
                    American agave, and two species of cactus; and among indigenous plants, the
                    dragon tree on the north-west of Teneriffe. A leafless and fantastic euphorbia,
                    <hi rend="italic">E. canariensis,</hi> and a shrubby composite plant, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cacalia Kleinia,</hi> give a character to the landscape about
                    Santa Cruz. 2. Between 1300 feet and 2800 feet. This is the region of South
                    European vegetation, the climate answering to that of southern France and
                    central Italy. Here flourish the vine and the cereals. 3. The region of
                    indigenous trees, including various species of laurel, an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ardisia, Ilex, lihamnus, Olea,</hi><hi rend="italic">Myrica,</hi> and other
                    trees found wild also at Madeira. The clouds rest on this region during the day,
                    and by their humidity support a vegetation amongst the trees, partly of shrubs,
                    and partly of ferns. It extends to the height of 4000 feet. 4. The region of the
                    beautiful <hi rend="italic">Pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">canariensis,</hi>
                    extending to the height of 6400 feet; here the broad-leaved trees have ceased to
                    grow, but arborescent heaths are found throughout its whole extent, and

                    nothing but a little lichen. The number of wild flowering plants may be
                    estimated at 900, upwards of 270 of which are peculiar to the Canaries. The
                    forms of vegetation must in the main be considered North African, since the
                    origin of many of those which they have in common with Southern Europe should be
                    looked for in Africa. The character of the vegetation in Lanzarote and
                    Euerteventura islands, composed of extensive plains and low hills, with few
                    springs, is different from that of the other islands, which are more elevated
                    and have many springs. The wood is more abundant, and the vegetation more
                    luxuriant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Recent soundings have
                    proved that the Canary Islands, like the other island groups of the North
                    Atlantic, are the summits of mountains that are surrounded by an ocean of great
                    depth. The lower and exterior portion of these islands consists for the most
                    part of basalt, compact, vesicular, or scoriaceous, interstratified with beds of
                    variously-coloured tufa. The compact variety of basalt frequently contains
                    scattered grains and crystals of augite and olivine. In some cases the rock is
                    chiefly trachyte. In Grand Canary the fossils contained in the tufas prove that
                    movements of elevation began in the Upper Miocene period. They continued down to
                    the Pleistocene period, for raised beaches containing shells of the recent
                    period exist both in Teneriffe and Grand Canary. Simultaneously with the
                    upheaval subaërial eruptions were taking place. Many of the superimposed streams
                    of lava are divided from one another by red bands of laterite, probably ancient
                    soils formed by the decomposition of the surfaces of the lava, and showing that
                    the building up of the islands was a slow process. In Teneriffe the basalt and
                    tufa form an exterior mass, through which in the centre emerge the felspathic or
                    trachytic rocks forming the nucleus of the volcanic cone, and over them
                    fragments of pumice and streams of modern lava have been thrown. These trachytic
                    rocks contain numerous disseminated crystals of glassy felspar. Obsidian is
                    found in several parts of Teneriffe, and is usually spotted with white crystals
                    of felspar. The few minerals that have been found in the Canary Islands are
                    those characteristic of volcanic regions. A little iron exists, but is not
                    turned to account. In no part of Teneriffe has there been discovered any
                    sedimentary rock. The old lavas in Lanzarote are covered by a thin layer of
                    white concretionary limestone, the origin of which is obscure, In Grand Canary
                    and Fuerteventura there is also calcareous stone, but its nature does not appear
                    to be known, <hi rend="smallcaps">Teneriffe,</hi> the largest island of the
                    group, lies between Grand Canary and Gomera. It is of irregular shape, 60 miles
                    in length, with an extreme breadth of 30 miles, Not more than one-seventh is
                    cultivable. A chain of mountains traverses the island in the direction of its
                    greatest length, and in the middle of the broadest part rises the celebrated
                    Peak, locally known as the Pico de Teyde, which, with its supports and spurs,
                    occupies nearly two-thirds of the whole island. It has a double top; the highest
                    point, El Piton, is 12,200 feet above the sea; the other, Chahorra, connected
                    with the first by a short narrow ridge, has a height of 9880 feet. They are both
                    orifices in the same grand dome of trachyte. Neither reaches the line of
                    perpetual snow. There is, however, a natural cavern, 11,050 feet above the sea,
                    where snow is preserved all the year Snow remains about four months on the upper
                    part of the Peak.</p>
                <p>For more than one-half of its circumference the base of the true peak rises from
                    an elevated but comparatively level tract, called by the Spaniards <hi
                    rend="italic">El Llano ds</hi><hi rend="italic">la Rétama (rétama</hi> being the
                    name of the <hi rend="italic">Cytisus</hi><hi rend="italic">nubigenus</hi> which
                    abounds there), and by the English the Pumice-Stone Plains. On the south-east,
                    south, and south-west there is a high curved ridge overlooking the Pumice-Stone
                    Plains, and presenting a very steep face to the Peak. This is the analogue of
                    the Somma ridge of Vesuvius. Between the ridge and the sea the slope is more
                    gradual, and there are intervening table-lands. A path used by the country
                    people in going from one side of the island to the other crosses this ridge at
                    the height of 8000 feet. Peaks rise from the ridge, one of which <hi
                    rend="italic">(Guaÿara)</hi> attains the height of 8900 feet. This ridge (the
                    Llano) and the modern volcanic cone resemble in aspect a fortress with circular
                    ramparts and a fosse. The ramparts are about 8 miles in diameter, and tower in
                    some places more than 1500 feet above the fosse. They consist, as shown in the
                    sections, of beds of trachyte, greenstone, and tufa of various thicknesses, and
                    intersected by dykes and faults. On the north-west comparatively late eruptions
                    have filled up the fosse. The modern cone, then, is a pile of lava, pumice, and
                    ashes, thrown up in an ancient crater which had become greatly enlarged either
                    by a falling in of the upper part of the cone, or by a series of violent
                    explosions. Both El Piton and Chahorra have craters on their summits, from which
                    issue steam and a little sulphureous vapour. The crater on El Piton is partly
                    surrounded by a wall of lava, which has been made white by the action of
                    sulphureous vapours, and every crevice contains small crystals of sulphur. The
                    thermometer rises considerably when thrust into the ground. The crater is about
                    300 feet across, with a depth of; 70 feet. The average slope of the lower part
                    of the cone is 28°; that of the sugar loaf at the top is 33°. The crater on
                    Chahorra has a diameter of 4000 feet; its depth is scarcely 150 feet. The view
                    from the highest point, when no clouds intervene, is very extensive. All the
                    islands of the Archipelago are visible, and the horizon is 140 miles distant.
                    Neither the coast of Africa nor the island of Madeira is within the range of
                    vision.</p>
                <p>The ascent of the Peak is usually made from Oro ta va, on the northern side of
                    the island. After the cultivated grounds are left, the region of arborescent
                    heaths is crossed. This zone extends over the zones of laurels and pines which
                    have here disappeared. Above this is a belt covered with <hi rend="italic"
                    >codeso (Adenocarpus frαnkenioides),</hi> and this extends to the region of <hi
                    rend="italic">rétama,</hi> the first bushes of which are met with at the pass
                    which admits the traveller into the <hi rend="italic">Llano de la Retarna.</hi>
                    The scenery here is in striking contrast with what it has previously been.
                    Instead of a steep and rugged ascent among black basaltic rocks, the traveller
                    enters upon gently sloping ground, covered to a considerable depth with white
                    pumice gravel, amongst which spring bushes of rétama. The tender shoots of this
                    shrub serve the wild goats for food, and the flowers yield a rich honey to the
                    bees. The entrance to the Llano at a sort of portal (called Portillo) between
                    two basaltic hills, is about 7000 feet above the sea. Between two and three
                    hours are consumed in crossing the Llano to the base of the cone, the lower part
                    of which (<hi rend="italic">Monton de Trigo)</hi> is ascended to a point 9750
                    feet above the sea, called <hi rend="italic">Estancia de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >los</hi><hi rend="italic">Ingleses,</hi> where the mules are usually left, and
                    where travellers frequently pass the night. Then comes the Malpays, 1000 feet in
                    altitude, consisting of rough black lava streams broken up into blocks and
                    stones. These cease at the neck called Rambleta, the lip of an older crater over
                    which the lava poured before the sugar-loaf cone of pumice and ashes was thrown
                    up. The pumice is in such quantity that at a distance it has the appearance of
                    snow coating the Peak. From twenty to twenty-four hours are consumed in
                    ascending the Peak and returning to Orotava.</p>
                <p>To the north-west of the grand cone some thousands of feet below Chahorra, there
                    are many small cones of eruption, showing that the intensity of volcanic action
                    was greatest on this side. Eastward from the ridge bounding the Pumice-Stone
                    Plains extends a chain of mountains to <pb break="no"

                    highest peaks are Izana (7374 feet), Perejil (6027), and Cuchillo (5467).</p>
                <p>We have no account iu history of eruptions from either crater of the Peak. In
                    1795 a great quantity of lava was poured out from three vents on the eastern
                    side; and in the same year lava streams issued from a crater near Guimar,
                    half-way between Santa Cruz and the Peak. In the following year, a vent on the
                    north-western side of the Peak discharged a copious stream, which flowed down to
                    the sea, and nearly filled up the harbour of Garachico. For three months in 1798
                    much lava and other volcanic matter were ejected from orifices to the west of
                    Chahorra.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Santa Cruz de Santiago,</hi> on the south coast, is the

                    with a court-yard in the middle, planted with shrubs in the Spanish fashion. The

                    indigenous trees. A British consul resides in the town, and several English
                    families. The accommodation for strangers is neither plentiful nor good. The
                    Spanish cloak is much worn by the men, and the white mantilla by the women.

                    conveyance of merchandise and in agricultural operations. A good animal costs
                    from 30 to 40 dollars. A few wheel-carriages are in use. Much ground in the
                    neighbourhood is planted with cactus <hi rend="italic">(Opuntia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tuna)</hi> for the support of the cochineal insect. The town is
                    defended by several batteries; and it was by a shot from one of these that Lord
                    Nelson lost his arm, when he unsuccessfully attacked the place in 1797. Some
                    English flags lost on that occasion are still hanging in one of the churches.
                    The anchorage is good, and a mole facilitates landing. About 200 vessels
                    annually visit the port, The climate is dry and moderately warm, the annual mean
                    being 71° Fahr. The mean of the coldest month is 63 <hi rend="superscript">

                    Rain falls on an average on thirty-six days in the year.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Laguna</hi> (population 4645) stands at the distance of four
                    miles from Santa Cruz, in the centre of a plain where much grain is produced,
                    elevated 1725 feet above the sea, and nearly surrounded by mountains. The
                    situation is beautiful, but the town itself is gloomy. It contains several
                    deserted convents and a cathedral. In summer the temperature is refreshingly
                    cool, and for that reason Laguna is then resorted to by the rich of Santa Cruz.
                    In winter it is cold and damp, the plain being frequently laid under water by
                    rain. This is in consequence of three aerial currents meeting there, from the
                    north, east, and south-west. The mean temperature of the year is 63 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 2 Fahr. Snow has never been known to fall here. The
                    humidity of the atmosphere is shown by the quantities of sempervivum growing on
                    the houses and walls</p>
                <p>A good road connects Santa Cruz and Orotava, a town on the north coast 25 miles
                    distant. It passes through Laguna and Matanza,—a place deriving its name from
                    the overthrow of the invading Spaniards J&gt;y the Guanches in 1494. AU
                    traveUers sneak in terms of warm admiration of the scenery in this part of the
                    island. Humboldt says he “never beheld a prospect more varied, more attractive,
                    more harmonious in the distribution of the masses of verdure and of rocks, than
                    the western coast of Teneriffe.” Date palms form a striking feature in the
                    landscapes. The town of <hi rend="italic">Orotava</hi> (population 3228) is 1040
                    feet above the sea. The houses are solidly built, but it has a deserted aspect.
                    A stream of water is conducted through every street. The famous dragon-tree,
                    which so many travellers have described, was lately destroyed by a storm. <hi
                    rend="italic">Port Orotava,</hi> three miles from the town, is a clean place,
                    with between 4000 and 5000 inhabitants, amongst whom are three or four English
                    families. The streets are broad and the houses well built. The roadstead,
                    protected by a fort and some batteries, affords little or no shelter against
                    wind. The botanic garden, founded by a patriotic Spanish nobleman, is now in the
                    hands of a market-gardener. At <hi rend="italic">Icod de</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    existing in the island. The stem near the ground has a circumference of 38 feet,
                    and its height is upwards of 60 feet. Near the town is an immense cavern, in
                    which many Guanche bones are to be seen. There are several other towns of less
                    importance, principally in the north-west, not far from the coast. The highest
                    inhabited place is Chasna, on a plain more than 4000 feet above the sea, to the
                    south of the Peak.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Grand Canary</hi><hi rend="italic">(Gran Canaria),</hi> the
                    most fertile island of the group, is nearly circular in shape, with a diameter
                    of 24 miles and a circumference of 75 miles. The interior is a mass of mountain,
                    reaching to the height of about 6000 feet above the sea, with ravines radiating
                    to the shore. Its highest peak, Los Pexos, is 6400 feet above the sea. Large
                    tracts are covered with native pine <hi rend="italic">(P. canarixnsis).</hi>
                    There are several mineral springs on the island. From the nature of the ground
                    only a small part is under cultivation. <hi rend="italic">Las Palmas</hi>
                    (population 12,572), the seat of the local Government, is a well-built and clean
                    town on a small bay on the north coast, deriving its name from the numerous palm
                    trees. It contains a handsome cathedral, a hospital, a college, several
                    secularized convents, and an alameda or public walk. Its climate is more humid
                    than that of Santa Cruz. Water is brought into the principal streets and squares
                    by an aqueduct. The harbour, Puerto de la Luz, is defended by several forts, and
                    affords good anchorage and shelter against all winds except the south-east. A
                    British vice-consul resides here. In 1851 the cholera visited the island, and
                    9000 persons died, whilst not a single case occurred on any other island. <hi
                    rend="italic">Telde,</hi> the second place in the island, stands on a plain,
                    surrounded by palm trees. At <hi rend="italic">Atalaya,</hi> a short distance
                    from Las Palmas, the making of earthenware vessels employ some hundreds of
                    people, who inhabit holes made in the tufa.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Palma</hi> (correctly, San Miguel de la Palma), 26 miles
                    long, with an extreme breadth of 16 miles, lies 67 miles W.N.W. of Teneriffe. It
                    is traversed in its longest direction (north to south) by a chain of mountains,
                    the highest of which is 7900 feet above the sea. At the broadest part is a
                    crater nine miles in diameter, known as the Caldera (t.e., cauldron), from
                    which, on its south-west side, runs a ravine to the sea. The bottom of the
                    crater has an elevation above the sea of 2300 feet, and it is overhung by peaks
                    that rise more than 5000 feet above it. Some of these peaks are covered with
                    snow for several months in the year. Extensive woods, principally composed of
                    chestnut and pine, lie on their flanks. Palma contains several mineral springs,
                    but there is great want of fresh water. The only stream which is never dried up
                    is that which issues from the Caldera. In 1677 an eruption, preceded by an
                    earthquake, took place from a volcano at the southern extremity of the island,
                    and much damage <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">Santa Cruz</hi> on the eastern coast is the principal town
                    (population 44:00). Ribands and stockings are manufactured there from silk
                    produced on the island. The anchorage is good. The cultivated soil is fertile,
                    but the labouring classes are in a wretched condition, notwithstanding their
                    industrious habits.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lanzarote,</hi> the most easterly of the group, has a length
                    of 31 miles and a breadth varying from 5 to 10 miles. It is naked and
                    mountainous, bearing everywhere marks of its volcanic origin. Montana Blanca,
                    the highest point, attains a height of 2000 feet, and is cultivated to the
                    summit. In 1730 the appearance of half the island was altered by a volcanic
                    outburst. A violent earthquake preceded the catastrophe, by which nine villages
                    Were destroyed. In 1825 another volcanic eruption took place accompanied by
                    earthquakes, and two hills were thrown up which still emit smoke. The port of
                    Naos on the southeast of the island affords safe anchorage. It is protected by
                    two forts. A short distance inland is the town of Arrecife (population 2700),
                    where a British vice-consul resides. The climate is hot and dry. There is only a
                    single spring of fresh water on the island, and that is in a position difficult
                    of access. From the total failure of water the inhabitants were once compelled
                    to abandon the island. Grain, wine (which is of superior quality), brandy,
                    barilla, orchil, and raisins made from the muscatel grape are the principal
                    articles of export. Dromedaries are used as beasts of burden. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Teguise</hi> (population 1000), on the north-west coast, is the residence of
                    the local authorities. A strait of about 6 miles in width separates Lanzarote
                    from Fuerteventura.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Graciosa,</hi> a small uninhabited island, is divided from
                    the north-eastern extremity of Lanzarote by a channel a mile in width, which
                    affords the most capacious and only safe harbour for large ships at the
                    Canaries; but basaltic cliffs, 1500 feethigh, prevent intercourse with the
                    inhabited part of Lanzarote. A few persons reside on the little island
                    Allegranza, a mass of lava and cinders ejected at various times from a now
                    extinct volcano, the crater of which has still a well-defined edge.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fuerte</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">ventura</hi> lies between
                    Lanzarote and Grand Canary. It has a length of 52 miles, and an average width of
                    12 miles, Though less mountainous than the other islands, its aspect is barren.
                    The springs of fresh water are only two, and they are confined to one valley.
                    Lava streams and other signs of volcanic action abound, but there has been no
                    igneous activity since the Spaniards took possession. At each of its extremities
                    are high mountains, which send off branches along the coast so as to enclose a
                    large arid plain. The highest peak reaches 2500 feet. In external appearance,
                    climate, and productions this island greatly resembles Lanzarote. An interval of
                    three years without rain has been known. The wine is bad. Barilla and orchil are
                    largely exported. <hi rend="italic">Oliva,</hi> with 970 inhabitants, is the
                    largest town. A smaller place in the centre of the island named <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Cornera</hi> lies 20 miles south-west of Teneriffe. Its
                    greatest length is about 23 miles. The coast is precipitous and the interior
                    mountainous, but it has the most wood and is the best watered of the group. The
                    inhabitants are very poor. The palm trees produce excellent dates; and wine,
                    brandy, orchil, raw silk, and dried fruits are sent to Teneriffe. Dromedaries
                    are bred on Gomera in large numbers. <hi rend="italic">St Sebastian,</hi> the
                    chief town and a port, has 2240 inhabitants. Columbus resided here before
                    sailing in search of the New World.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hierro,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ferro,</hi> the most
                    westerly and the smallest: island of the group, is somewhat crescent-shaped. Its
                    length is about 18 miles, its greatest breadth about 15 miles, and its
                    circumference probably 50 miles. It lies 92 miles W.S.W. of Teneriffe. Its coast
                    is bound by high steep rocks, which only admit of one harbour, but the interior
                    is tolerably level. Its hill-tops in winter are sometimes wrapped in snow,
                    which, however, does not lie long. Better and more abundant grass grows here
                    than on any of the other islands. The island is exposed to westerly gales, which
                    frequently commit great damage. Fountains of fresh water are few, but there is a
                    sulphurous spring, with a temperature of 102° Fahr. The once celebrated and
                    almost sacred Til tree, which was reputed to be always distilling water in great
                    abundance from its leaves, no longer exists. Only a small part of the cultivable
                    land is under tillage, the inhabitants being principally employed in pasturage.
                    Wine, brandy, orchil, excellent dried figs, and sheep are sent to Teneriffe. At

                    assigned at first has, however, turned out to be erroneous; and the so-called
                    “Longitude of Ferro’’ does not coincide with the actual longitude of the
