                    Protestant merchant at Toulouse, who was barbarously murdered under forms of law

                    years at Toulouse. His wife was an Englishwoman of French extraction. They had

                    son, and this domestic. Antoine being of a melancholy turn of mind, was
                    continually dwelling on passages from authors on the subject of suicide, and one
                    night in that month he hanged himself in his father’s warehouse. The crowd,
                    which collected on so shocking a discovery, took up the idea that he had been
                    strangled by the family to prevent him from changing his religion, and that this
                    was a common practice among Protestants. The officers of justice adopted the
                    popular tale, and were supplied by the mob with what they accepted as conclusive
                    evidence of the fact. The fraternity of White Penitents buried the body with
                    great ceremony, and performed a solemn service for the deceased as a martyr; the
                    Franciscans followed their example; and these formalities led to the popular
                    belief in the guilt of the unhappy family.</p>

                <p>Being all condemned to the rack in order to extort confession, they appealed to
                    the parliament; but this body, being as weak as the subordinate magistrates,
                    sentenced the father to the torture, ordinary and extraordinary, to be broken
                    alive upon the wheel, and then to be burnt to ashes; which diabolical decree was
                    carried into execution on the 9th of March 1762. Pierre Calas, the surviving
                    son, was banished for life; the rest were acquitted. The distracted widow,
                    however, found some friends, and among them Voltaire, who laid her case before
                    the council of state at Versailles; and the parliament of Toulouse was ordered
                    to transmit the proceedings. These the king and council unanimously agreed to
                    annul; the chief magistrate of Toulouse was degraded and fined; old Calas was
                    declared to have been innocent; and every imputation of guilt was removed from
                    the family. See <hi rend="italic">Causes</hi><hi rend="italic">Célèbres,</hi>
