                    (1782-1850), a leading politician of the United States, was grandson of an Irish
                    Presbyterian, who founded Calhoun settlement, in the district of Abbeville,
                    South Carolina. It was there that John Calhoun was born in 1782. For some years
                    he assisted his widowed mother in the management of her farm, but at the age of
                    eighteen he commenced to study for the bar. He graduated with honours at Yale
                    College, and spent eighteen months at Litchfield, at that time the only law
                    school in the country. He then returned to practise in his native district of
                    Abbeville. While there, in June 1807, the searching of the Chesapeake having
                    aroused strong feeling in America, Calhoun drew up for a public meeting a
                    resolution expressive of indignation against Great Britain, and supported it in
                    a speech of such power that he was soon after elected a member of the
                    legislature, and in November 1811, became member of Congress, where he continued
                    to be an enthusiastic and prominent adherent of the war party. For seven years
                    (commencing with 1817) he acted with credit as secretary of war under Monroe; in
                    1825 he became Vice-President of the United States under J. Quincy Adams; and in
                    1829 he was re-elected under General Jackson. He now began to be looked upon as
                    champion of the South; and, though he had supported the protective tariff of
                    1816, he became an eager advocate of free-trade,—that policy being, even
                    popularly, recognized as specially advantageous to the cotton-growing States. He
                    is, however, best known as a strenuous defender of slavery, and as the author of
                    a doctrine to which the Civil War may be traced,—the doctrine of
                    “nullification,” according to which each State has the right to reject any act
                    of Congress which it considers unconstitutional. This view was in 1829 adopted
                    by the legislature of his native State, and drawn up in a document, mainly
                    prepared by Calhoun, which was known as the “South Carolina Exposition,” and
                    which was approved by Virginia, Georgia, and Alabama. In 1832 the legislature of
                    South Carolina carried the theory into practice by passing laws nullifying the
                    obnoxious tariff of that year; but its opposition was crushed by the firmness of
                    General Jackson, who declared that he would resort to force, if necessary. The
                    most important of the other political acts of Calhoun are his defence of the
                    right of veto which belongs to the president, his advocacy of the annexation of
                    Texas, and his maintenance of the cause of peace, when war with Great Britain
                    was threatened by the claims of the United States to Oregon. He died at
                    Washington on the 31st March 1850. His works, with memoir, were published
                    posthumously in 6 vols, in 1853-4, by Richard K. Cralle, who had been his
                    amanuensis. They include a dissertation <hi rend="italic">On the Constitution
                    and Government of the United States</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and from this
                    book we learn that he advocated the election of two presidents, one by the free
                    and another by the slave States, the consent of both of whom should be essential
                    to the passing of any law. Calhoun’s speeches were always directly to the point,
                    clear, and forcible, while he seldom indulged in the imaginative or purely
                    rhetorical. The integrity and worth of his character have been spoken of in the
                    highest terms even by political opponents.</p>
