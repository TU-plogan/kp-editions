                <p><label type="entry">CAeDMON, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Cebmon</hi></label> (the
                    former way of spelling is that of Bede, the latter that of Florence of
                    Worcester), is the name of the earliest Anglo-Saxon or Old English poet of whom
                    we have any knowledge. The meaning of the name has been much disputed. Sir
                    Francis Palgrave, despairing of finding a native derivation, suggested <hi
                    rend="italic">(Archoe-ologiα,</hi> vol. xxiv.) that the poet might have been so
                    called from the Chaldaic name for the book of Genesis, which is “b’ Cadmin,” in
                    the beginning, or “Cadmon,” beginning, from the opening words of the first
                    chapter of Genesis. He thought that he might even have been an “Eastern
                    visitor,” who had arrived in Britain from the East, mastered the language, and
                    come out as a vernacular poet. A hypothesis so fanciful as this last may be at
                    once rejected. Another suggestion of the same lively writer connects the name
                    with the Adam Cadmon (the primitive and ideal man) of the Cabalists. It is true
                    that Cabalistic speculations cannot be traced back with certainty beyond the 9th
                    century, but it is quite possible that the word may have <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0701-0630"/> been recognized as an important word in the East,
                    and as bearing a distinct philosophic or theosophic meaning at a far earlier
                    date. On the other hand, in favour of the view which gives to the name a native
                    origin, it may be urged that Bede, though he only employs the word once, says in
                    that passage that the poet’s nocturnal visitant “called him by his name,” and
                    said, “Caedmon, &amp;c.” Does not this look as if the name had a homely and
                    north-country sound in Bede’s ears? If so, What did it mean <hi rend="italic">ĭ
                    Sir</hi> Francis Palgrave maintains that no Anglo-Saxon derivation can be found
                    for the first part of the name. Dr Bouterwek, however (in a work on Caedmon,
                    published at Elberfeld in 1845), together with Professor Sandras, explains <hi
                    rend="italic">ced</hi> as meaning a boat in Anglo-Saxon, whence the former
                    translates the name “pirate,” the latter “boat-man.” This would be satisfactory
                    if it rested on any ground of fact; but unfortunately this word “ced” is a pure
                    invention of Professor' Bouterwek’s; neither the Anglo-Saxon language, as known
                    to us, nor the Old English ’of the first three centuries after the Conquest, nor
                    any local dialect contains any such word. On the whole, Sir Francis Palgrave’s
                    first suggestion seems to involve the least difficulty. ‘ <hi rend="superscript"
                    > i</hi> Cadmon” means “beginning” in the Targum of Onkelos, the Chaldee version
                    of the Scriptures, which was in popular use among the Jews from the 1st century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> downwards, and some learned ecclesiastic at
                    Whitby who had visited the Holy Land may have given to the poet the name Cadmon
                    (which in Anglo-Saxon mouths became Caedmon), because he was to sing of the
                    “beginning” of things.</p>
                <p>The few particulars that are known of the life of Caedmon are all to be found in
                    Bede’s <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History,</hi> a book so well known that
                    an abridgement of them is all that will be necessary here. Caedmon was probably
                    a ceorl, employed under the “villicus” or bailiff of the lands belonging to the
                    monastery of St Hilda at Whitby. He had arrived at mature age, and had embraced
                    Christianity at the call of the devoted Irishmen who from Iona and from
                    Lindisfarne, through two-thirds of the 7th century, spread the light of faith
                    through the regions of northern England. He used to attend festive meetings; but
                    when the song went round, and the harp was passed into his hands, Caedmon,
                    ignorant of the rough old battle-songs of the heathen time, could sing nothing.
                    On one such occasion he is said to have left the feast and gone to the stables,
                    where it was his turn that night to attend to the horses and plough-oxen. He
                    fell asleep, and dreamed that a person appeared to him, who, calling him by his
                    name, said, “Caedmon, sing me something.” On his replying that he could not
                    sing, and that on this account he had left the revellers, the other replied,
                    “Nevertheless thou shalt sing for me.” “What,” said Caedmon,“must I sing!”
                    “Sing,” he answered, “of the beginning of created beings” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(principium creaturarum).</hi> Thereupon Caedmon began to sing verses which'he
                    had never heard or learned, praising and magnifying the Creator who had made
                    heaven and earth for the children of men. Awaking from his sleep he remembered
                    the verses which had come to him in his dream, and added others to them.</p>
                <p>In the morning he wentTo the bailiff who was over him and told him what had
                    happened; the bailiff took him to the abbess. St Hilda assembled a company of
                    pious and learned persons, and before them trial was made of Caedmon’s gift. He
                    told his story, and repeated the verses, and they all judged that he had
                    received an inspiration from above. They explained to him then and there a
                    passage from holy writ, and desired him to versify it. He went away and returned
                    the next morning with his task most excellently performed. The abbess then
                    received him “<hi rend="italic">cum omnibus</hi><hi rend="italic">suis”</hi> (it
                    is not easy to determine whether this phrase applies to his kith and kin or
                    merely to his worldly goods) into the monastery; and there he lived as a monk
                    for the remainder of his life, employing diligently his leisure hours in the
                    cultivation of the gift which he had received. The English poets who, up to the
                    time when Bede wrote, had attempted to write religious poems in imitation of
                    Caedmon, h⅛d, in the historian’s opinion, fallen far short of him. How long he
                    lived in the monastery we are not informed. The narrative of his death,
                    beautiful in its piety and simplicity, relates how, after an illness of fourteen
                    days, he desired to be removed to the infirmary, where, on the same night, after
                    receiving the Eucharist by way of viaticum, and “signing himself with the sign
                    of the holy cross,” he sank into a peaceful slumber from which he never
                    woke.</p>
                <p>Florence of Worcester speaks of him, under the year 680, as that celebrated monk
                    of St Hilda’s Abbey who had received from heaven the free gift of poetic
                    inspiration. William of Malmesbury, in the <hi rend="italic">Gesta
                    Pontificum</hi> (lib. iii. § 116), says that his relics had been discovered at
                    Whitby shortly before he wrote (early in the 12th century), and had been,
                    according to popular report, the occasion of miracles.</p>
                <p>An important question remains—whether Caedmon was really the author of the
                    metrical paraphrase of Genesis, Exodus, part of the book of Daniel, &amp;c.,
                    which usually goes by his name. The unique MS. containing this paraphrase came
                    into the hands of Archbishop Usher in the 17th century, and was by him given to
                    the French scholar, Francis Dujon, better known as “Junius,” who bequeathed it
                    to the Bodleian Library. It is in a hand of the latter part of the 10th century,
                    and contains no indication of authorship. The poem opens as follows:—</p>
                <p>Us is riht micel thaet we rodera weard, Wereda wuldor-cining, wordum
                    lιerigen,—</p>
                <p>(For us it is very right that we should praise with our words the Guardian of the
                    heavens, the glorious King of hosts.) A number of very curious illustrations,
                    etchings heightened with green and red colour, are in the earlier portion of the
                    MS.; engravings of them may be seen in the 24th volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Árchaeologia.</hi> Obviously the only means of identifying this anonymous poem
                    as the work of Caedmon is to compare it, as to its opening and contents, with
                    the poem described by Bede. The substance of Caedmon’s opening, according to
                    Bede, was this: “Now we ought to praise the author of the heavenly kingdom, the
                    power of the Creator and His counsel, the deeds of the Father of glory. How He,
                    since He is eternal God, is the author of all wonders, who, the Almighty
                    Guardian of the human race, first created for the sons of men the heaven, to be
                    the roof of their abode, and afterwards the earth.” The opening of the
                    paraphrase, though more diffuse, agrees with that here described pretty well as
                    to its general meaning, except that the heavens are represented in it as created
                    for the angels rather than for the children of men, who do not come upon the
                    scene till later. Were there no other evidence, it might seem not unreasonable
                    to identify the paraphase with the poem of Caedmon. But here a new difficulty
                    meets us. King Alfred translated Bede’s <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical
                    History,</hi> and when he comes to this passage he gives us a metrical version
                    of Bede’s Latin description of the opening, which he seems to' intend his
                    hearers to take for the <hi rend="italic">ipsissima</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >verba</hi> of Caedmon. Of this there are two indications :—first, he renders
                    Bede’s words, “quorum [sc. versuum] iste est <hi rend="italic">sensus,”</hi>
                    into “thara endebyrdnes this is,” “their <hi rend="italic">order</hi> is this;
                    ’’ secondly, he <hi rend="italic">omits</hi> a long sentence immediately
                    following the description of the opening, in which Bede explains that from the
                    difficulty of translating verses literally from one language into another he has
                    merely given the <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> and not the “ordo ipse verborum.”
                    Now Alfred tells us that he <hi rend="italic">does</hi> give the order
                    (endebyrdnes) of the words, and he leaves untranslated the passage which <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n702/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0702-0631"/> affirms that only the general sense is given The
                    verses which he inserts begin thus :—</p>
                <p>Nu we sceolon herian heofon-rices weard, Metodes mihte and his mod-gethonc,— (Now
                    must we praise the Warder of the heavenly kingdom, the might of the Creator, and
                    the thought of His mind.) In short, Bede’s description is turned with great
                    literalness into Anglo-Saxon verses. But are these Caedmon’sî If they are, then
                    the paraphrase is not the work of Caedmon; for not one line in the opèning as
                    given by Alfred agrees with the paraphrast’s opening However, in spite of the
                    circumstances mentioned above, the judgment of criticism will not identify
                    Alfred’s verses with the true work of Caedmon. They are so bald, so literal,
                    that the conviction forces itself upon us that Alfred is here merely translating
                    from Bede’s Latin, and amusing himself with making his version metrical On the
                    other hand the paraphrast is a genuine poet; variety, force, and colour are the
                    ever-present attributes of his poetic diction; his imagination is bold and
                    fertile; his moral purpose clear and pervading—in fact he is just such a man as
                    we should conceive the real Caedmon to have been.</p>
                <p>The other point of comparison between the paraphrase and Bede’s description
                    relates to the <hi rend="italic">contents</hi> of Caedmon’s poem. “He sang,”
                    says the historian, “the creation of the world, the origin of man, and all the
                    history of Genesis; and made many verses on the departure of the children of
                    Israel out of Egypt, and their entering into the land of promise, with many
                    other histories from holy writ; the incarnation, passion, resurrection of our
                    Lord, and His ascension into heaven; the coming of the Holy Ghost, and the
                    preaching of the apostles; also the terror of future judgment, the horror of the
                    pains of hell, and the delights of heaven.” With this account the contents of
                    the paraphrase which we have agree, up to a certain point, remarkably well. It
                    may be said, generally, to embrace the whole history of Genesis, except that
                    portion which relates to events posterior to the time of Isaac. It then passes
                    to the history of Moses and his statutes, “Moyses dómas,” briefly giving the
                    thread of events till it arrives at the passage through the Red Sea, on which
                    the writer enlarges with evident enjoyment. An abrupt transition is then made to
                    the book of Daniel; the story of the three children saved out of the fiery
                    furnace is told; Daniel’s dream-wisdom is set forth, and the doom denounced
                    against Belshazzar. Then what is called the second book of the paraphrase, the
                    beginning of which coincides with a change of handwriting in the MS., commences,
                    and now the resemblance to Bede’s description ceases. This book opens with the
                    complaints of the fallen angels in hell and the lamentations of the souls
                    detained in the <hi rend="italic">Limbus Patrum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the
                    descent of Christ after his passion to liberate these souls is described; the
                    resurrection is barely mentioned, but the intercourse of Christ with his
                    apostles previous to his ascension, and the ascension itself, are told at some
                    length. The book concludes with a description of the terrors of the Day of
                    Judgment. Such a poem cannot be said to correspond with Bede’s description; but
                    then it must be remembered that, partly on account of the change of hand and of
                    subject, partly on account of the presence in it of later linguistic forms, the
                    ascription of this second book of the paraphrase to the author of the first has
                    always been held problematical. On the whole, although the grounds of a
                    confident judgment do not exist, the analysis of the evidence here attempted
                    points to the conclusion that the first book of the paraphrase, though not the
                    second, may with considerable probability be assigned to Caedmon.</p>
                <p>Some writers have assigned other extant poems to Caedmon, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">∏alga Pod</hi> (Holy Rood) of the Vercelli
                    codex, a passage in which has been found to tally with the Runic inscription on
                    the Ruthwcll Cross, and also the fragment called <hi rend="italic">Judith,</hi>
                    in the MS. volume containing <hi rend="italic">Beowulf.</hi> But the evidence in
                    favour of either supposition may be set down as <hi rend="italic">nil</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> nor does the style in <hi rend="italic">Judith,</hi> still
                    less in the <hi rend="italic">Halga Rod,</hi> agree with that of the Paraphrast.
