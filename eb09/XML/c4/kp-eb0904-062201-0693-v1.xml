                    a Genoas sonne, borne in Bristow.” Galvano and Herrera also give to England the
                    honour of his nativity. Neither the year of his birth nor that of his death can
                    be stated with precision; conjecture fixes the former event in about 1476. No
                    instructive details of his early life, until he had passed his twentieth year,
                    can now be recovered.</p>
                <p>The discoveries of Columbus infused into young Sebastian an ardent desire to
                    emulate his brilliant achievements. Henry VII. resolved to enter the new field
                    of maritime discovery, which had already rewarded Spain with the Antilles; and
                    the Cabots having proposed to the king the project of shortening the voyage to
                    India by sailing west, to them was confided its execution.</p>
                <p>The first patent was granted March 5, 1496 (11th Henry VΠ.), to “John Gabote,
                    citizen of Venice; to Lewes, Sebastian, and Santius, sonnes of the said John.”
                    It empowered them to seek out, subdue, and occupy, at their own charges, any
                    regions which before had “been unknown to all Christians.” They were authorized
                    to set up the royal banner, and possess the territories discovered by them as
                    the king’s vassals. Bristol was the only port to which they were permitted to
                    return; and a fifth part of the gains of the voyage was reserved to the Crown.
                    The discoverers were vested with exclusive privilege of resort and traffic.</p>
                <p>With respect to Lewes and Santius, the chronicles are silent. John and Sebastian
                    sailed from Bristol in the “Matthew” in the following year (1497), and, as now
                    seems probable, returned to England after the first discovery had been made (see
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Bristol,</hi> p. 350). There is in the account of the
                    Privy Purse expenses of Henry VII. the following entry:—“10th August 1497. To
                    him that found the New Isle, £10.”</p>
                <p>Although it is probable that the Island of Newfoundland was discovered in this
                    voyage, a careful scrutiny of the various maps and chronicles sustains the
                    belief that the Cabots saw the mainland of America before any other,—the term
                        <hi rend="italic">Terra</hi><hi rend="italic">primum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >visa</hi> having been used to distinguish tħe continent, or what was
                    believed to form a part of it. The relation of Sebastian (see Hakluyt, 111, p.
                    7) does not warrant the inference that the first land seen was an island.</p>
                <p>The most precise account of the discovery is from a map drawn by Sebastian Cabot,
                    and engraved in 1549 by Clement Adams, which is known to have hung in Queen
                    Elizabeth’s gallery at Whitehall. The notice runs as follows :—“In the year of
                    our Lord 1497, John Cabot, a Venetian, and his son Sebastian, discovered that
                    country which no one before his time had ventured to approach, on the 24th of
                    June, about five o’clock in the morning. He called the land <hi rend="italic"
                        >Terra</hi><hi rend="italic">primum</hi><hi rend="italic">visa,</hi>
                    because, as I conjecture, this was the place that first met his eye in looking
                    from the sea. On the contrary, the island which lies opposite the land he called
                    the island of St John,—as I suppose, because it was discovered on the festival
                    of St John the Baptist.”</p>
                <p>On Sebastian Cabot’s map of 1544, the original of which is in the Geographical
                    Cabinet of the Imperial Library at Paris (see fac-similé in Jomard <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s√lfon amen⅛de <hi rend="italic">la</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Geographie),</hi> nothing is designated above the sixtieth
                    parallel. <hi rend="italic">Prima</hi><hi rend="italic">tierra vista</hi> is
                    delineated between 45° and 50°, with the island St Juan (corresponding with
                    Prince Edward), within the great gulf at the embouchure of what is plainly the
                    St Lawrence. The authenticity of the map being accepted, the “land first seen”
                    could be no other than the coast of Nova Scotia, or island of Cape Breton.</p>
                <p>A second “patent” to John Cabot, dated 3d February 1498, authorized him to take
                    six English ships, of not more than 200 tons, in any port in the realm, “and
                    them convey and lede <hi rend="italic">to the</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >lande</hi><hi rend="italic">and isles</hi> of late found by the said John
                    in oure name and by oure commandment.” Before the expedition was ready, John
                    Cabot died, and Sebastian, with a fleet of five vessels, sailed from Bristol in
                    May 1498. It is believed that this is the voyage referred to by Peter Martyr,
                    Gomara, Fabyan, and by Sebastian himself in his letter to Ramusio. Cabot, upon
                    falling in with the coast, ascended it as high as latitude 67½ <hi
                        rend="superscript"> o</hi>, probably passing into Hudson’s Bay. He
                    persevered in the effort to find an open channel to India, until his sailors,
                    appalled by the danger of navigating the ship among icebergs, broke out in open
                    mutiny and compelled him to turn back. He then retraced his course, pausing at
                    Baccalaos to refit; and, after examining the coast as far south as 38°, returned
                    to England. Sebastian took with him in this voyage three hundred men, with the
                    purpose, as Gomara states, of colonizing the newly-found regions. Thevet, French
                    cosmographer, relates that Cabot landed these emigrants where the cold was so
                    intense that nearly the whole company perished, although it was in July. Cabot
                    brought to England three native inhabitants of the countries he had visited; his
                    great achievement was the discovery of eighteen hundred miles of sea-coast of
                    the North American continent.</p>

                <p>Except the vague report of a voyage undertaken by him in 1499, nothing more
                    appears relative to Sebastian until 1512, when he is found living at Seville,
                    engaged in revising the Spanish king’s maps and charts. The death of Ferdinand
                    put an end to a design to renew the search for a north-west passage to Cathay,
                    and Cabot, who was to have commanded, returned to England. In 1517 he undertook,
                    with Sir Thomas Perte, another voyage,— whether of discovery or conquest in
                    Spanish America is uncertain. In 1518 Sebastian revisited Spain, and was
                    appointed pilot-major. After the conference of Badajos, a squadron was fitted
                    out under Cabot to pursue Spanish discovery in the Pacific. It set sail in
                    August 1526, but some of his chief officers having spread disaffection in the
                    fleet, Cabot abandoned the original plan as impracticable, and put into the La
                    Plata. He sailed up this river 350 leagues, built a fort at one of the mouths of
                    the Parana, which stream he ascended in boats, and also penetrated some distance
                    up the Paraguay. Failing to obtain the aid he solicited, and weakened by the
                    assaults of the natives, Sebastian was forced to leave the coast for Spain.</p>
                <p>He now, for the second time, returned to England, and notwithstanding a demand by
                    the emperor that “he might be sent over to Spain,” settled at Bristol. Edward
                    VI., in 1549, granted the now aged seaman a pension of two hundred and fifty
                    marks. Hakluyt states that the office of Grand Pilot of England was created for
                    him. It was at this period that he explained to the king the phenomenon of the
                    variation of the needle. He was active in promoting the expedition of 1553 to
                    Russia, the success of which gave him the life appointment of Governor of the
                    Muscovy Company.</p>
                <p>Cabot is supposed to have died in London, in 1557, sixty-one years subsequent to
                    the date of his first commission from Henry VII., and not far from eighty years
                    old. The place of his burial is unknown, and we are indebted to Eden for the
                    death-bed scene of this intrepid navigator, who saw the American continent
                    before Columbus or Amerigo Vespucci. His character is^ extolled by
                    contemporaries, and was distinguished for lofty courage and unflagging
                    perseverance in the execution of his designs. Few lives exhibit such incessant
                    activity in the pursuit of an idea. The maps and discourses drawn and written by
                    himself would, if in existence, have shed much light on an illustrious career;
                    but, with the exception of a map said to have been recovered in Germany, and
                    another existing in France, no trace of them remains. The memoir by Richard
                    Biddle, London and Philadelphia, 1831, though faulty in arrangement, is still
                    the best.</p>
