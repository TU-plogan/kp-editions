                <p><label type="entry">CABINET</label>, a conventional, but not a legal, term
                    employed to describe those members of the Privy Council who fill the highest
                    executive offices in the State, and who, by their concerted policy, direct the
                    Government, and are responsible for all the acts of the Crown. The Cabinet now
                    always includes the persons filling the following offices, who are therefore
                    called Cabinet Ministers, viz :—The First Lord of the Treasury, the Lord
                    Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council, the Lord Privy Seal, the five
                    Secretaries of State, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the First Lord of the
                    Admiralty. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Postmaster General, the
                    First Commissioner of Works, the President of the Board of Trade, the Chief
                    Secretary for Ireland, the President of the Poor Law Board, and the
                    Vice-President of the Education Committee are sometimes members of the Cabinet,
                    but not necessarily so. Hence the Cabinet must consist of at least eleven
                    members, and it has sometimes included as many as seventeen. But the better
                    opinion appears to be that a large Cabinet is an evil. Mr Disraeli in 1874 acted
                    wisely in restricting the numbers of his colleagues to eleven besides the Prime
                    Minister. When Lord Grenville in 1806 brought Lord Chief Justice Ellenborough
                    into the Cabinet by combining his judicial office with that of Lord President,
                    the appointment, was strongly reprobated, and the experiment has never been
                    repeated. The Master-General of the <pb break="no"

                    and the duke of Wellington sat there for a short time as Commander-inChief. Of
                    late years there has been no military officer in the Cabinet, a thing much to be
                    regretted. In a few instances privy councillors of very high standing, as the
                    duke of Wellington, Lord Sid mouth the marquis of Lansdowne, and Lord Russell,
                    have been summoned to the Cabinet without office. There is no constitutional
                    objection to summoning any privy councillor to the Cabinet by command of the
                    sovereign.</p>
                <p>The word “Cabinet,” or “Cabinet Council,” was originally employed as a term of
                    reproach. Thus Lord Bacon says, in his essay <hi rend="italic">Of Counsel</hi>
                    (xx.), “The doctrine of Italy and practice of France, in some kings’ times, hath
                    introduced Cabinet Councils—a remedy worse than the disease <hi rend="italic"
                        >;”</hi><hi rend="italic">and,</hi> again, “As for Cabinet Councils, it may
                    be their motto <hi rend="italic">Plenus rimarum</hi><hi rend="italic">sum.”</hi>
                    Lord Clarendon—after stating that, in 1640, when the great Council of Peers was
                    convened by the king at York, the burden of affairs rested principally on Laud,
                    Strafford, and Cottington, with five or six others added to them on account of
                    their official position and ability—adds, “These persons made up the Committee
                    of State, which was reproachfully after called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Juncto,</hi> and enviously then in Court the <hi rend="italic">Cabinet
                        Council.’'</hi> And in the Second Remonstrance in January 1642, Parliament
                    complained “of the managing of the great affairs of the realm in <hi
                        rend="italic">Cabinet Councils,</hi> by men unknown and not publicly
                    trusted.” But this use of the term, though historically curious, has in truth
                    nothing in common with the modern application of it. It meant, at that time, the
                    employment of a select body of favourites by the king, who were supposed to
                    possess a larger share of his confidence than the Privy Council at large.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus, under Charles II.,
                            in 1671, the king’s confidential advisers were Clifford, Arlington,
                            Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale. The initial letters of their names
                            spell the word “Cabal ;” and Lord Macaulay affirms that the word cabal
                            was popularly used as synonymous with cabinet. But the word cabal
                            certainly never was applied to any other cabinet; and tħeVabal itself
                            was not in truth a cabinet at all.</p></note> Under the Tudors, at least
                    from the later years of Henry VIII., and under the Stuarts, the Privy Council
                    was the Council of State or Government. During the Common-wealth it assumed that
                    name.</p>
                <p>The Cabinet Council; properly so called, dates from the reign of William III. and
                    from the year 1693, for it was not until some years after the Revolution that
                    the king discovered and adopted the two fundamental principles of a
                    constitutional Executive Government, namely, that a ministry should consist of
                    statesmen holding the same political principles and identified with each other;
                    and, secondly, that the ministry should stand upon a parliamentary basis, that
                    is, that it must command and retain the majority of votes in the Legislature. It
                    was long before these principles were thoroughly worked out and understood, and
                    the perfection to which they have been brought in modern times is the result of
                    time, experience, and, in part, of accident. But the result is that the Cabinet
                    Council for the time being <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the Government of Great
                    Britain; that all the powers vested in the sovereign (with one or two
                    exceptions) are practically exercised by the members of this body; that all the
                    members of the Cabinet are jointly and severally responsible for all its
                    measures, for if differences of opinion arise their existence is unknown as long
                    as the Cabinet lasts,—when publicly manifested the Cabinet is at an end; and
                    lastly, that the Cabinet, being responsible to the sovereign for the conduct of
                    executive business, is also collectively responsible to Parliament both for its
                    executive conduct and for its legislative measures, the same men being as
                    members of the Cabinet the servants of the Crown, and as Members of Parliament
                    and leaders of the majority responsible to those who support them by their votes
                    and may challenge in debate every one of their actions. In this latter sense the
                    Cabinet has sometimes been described as a Standing Committee of both Houses of
                    Parliament.</p>
                <p>This in reality is the form to which the active governing machinery of the
                    British Constitution has now been brought. It has been ingeniously argued by Mr
                    Bagehot, in his <hi rend="italic">Essays on the Constitution,</hi> that “the
                    Cabinet is a board of control, chosen by the Legislature, out of the persons
                    whom it trusts and knows, to rule the nation,” and that the choice of the Crown
                    and of the Prime Minister, who frames the list of Cabinet Ministers to be laid
                    before the sovereign, is in fact circumscribed and predetermined by the position
                    which a small number of men in each party have acquired in Parliament. No man
                    can long remain a Cabinet Minister who is not in Parliament; and of those who
                    sit in either House of Parliament, but a small proportion have attained to the
                    rank or influence that fits a man to be a Cabinet Minister. This is especially
                    the case in the House of Commons, largely composed of men engaged in various
                    professions; for it is easier to find men of high senatorial rank and experience
                    in the House of Peers than in the other House, because in England members of the
                    Peerage are frequently trained and educated from early life for high office and
                    the public service. The Cabinet, therefore, really originates in the
                    Legislature, though its functions are the functions of executive government, and
                    although it disposes on behalf of the Crown of a vast amount of power,
                    patronage, honours, &amp;c., to which the authority of the Legislature does not
                    extend. The Cabinet has, moreover, one most important power, which it derives
                    entirely from the Crown, namely, that of dissolving the Legislature to which it
                    owes its own existence—though this is in fact no more than an appeal to the
                    nation at large, whose representative the Legislature is. The power of
                    dissolving Parliament is one usually, though not always unreservedly, entrusted
                    by the sovereign to the Prime Minister; but if withheld when solicited, the
                    minister would resign.</p>
                <p>Instances are not wanting in our history in which the direct action of the
                    sovereign has overthrown a Cabin δt, or prevented a Cabinet from being formed.
                    In 1784 George III. dismissed the Coalition Ministry. In 1807 the king also
                    dismissed Lord Grenville’s Cabinet, in the teeth of Lord Erskine’s declaration
                    of the high Whig doctrine, that the king had handed over every power of
                    government, and even his own conscience, to his responsible advisers. In these
                    instances the Crown succeeded, and the new Parliament ratified the change. Not
                    so in 1834 when William IV. dismissed Lord Melbourne’s Cabinet, placed the duke
                    of Wellington for some weeks in sole possession of all the Cabinet offices, and
                    called Sir Robert Peel to power. In 1812 Lord Moira was defeated in the attempt
                    to form a Cabinet by the refusal of the regent to consent to a change in the
                    household; and in 1839 a similar reason was alleged by Queen Victoria to prevent
                    the accession to office of Sir Robert Peel. But though this step was defended
                    and sanctioned by a minute of the Whig Cabinet of the day, it is now generally
                    regarded as unconstitutional, and the objection was never repeated.</p>
                <p>One of the consequences of the close connection of the Cabinet with the
                    Legislature is that it is desirable to divide the strength of the ministry
                    between the two Houses of Parliament. Mr Pitt’s Cabinet of 1783 consisted of
                    himself in the House of Commons and seven peers. But so aristocratic a
                    Government would now be impracticable. In Mr Gladstone’s large Cabinet of 1868,
                    eight, and afterwards nine, ministers were in the House of Commons and six in
                    the House of Peers. Great efforts were made to strengthen <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n691/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0691-0620"/> the ministerial bench in the Commons, and a
                    new principle was introduced, that the representatives of what are called the
                    spending departments—that is, the Secretary of State for War and the First Lord
                    of the Admiralty— should, if possible, be members of the House which votes the
                    supplies. Mr Disraeli followed this precedent.</p>
                <p>Although the Government of this country is one of extreme publicity, it is to the
                    credit of the good sense and good faith of Englishmen that the deliberations and
                    proceedings of the Executive Government are veiled in impenetrable secrecy,
                    until the moment when the result of them is made known. Beyond the meagre
                    announcement in the <hi rend="italic">Court Circular</hi> of the bare fact that
                    a Cabinet has been held, and that certain ministers were present, nothing .is
                    communicated to the public. Cabinets are usually convoked by a summons addressed
                    to “Her Majesty’s Confidential Servants,” by direction of the Prime Minister;
                    and the ordinary place of meeting is the Foreign Office, but they may be held
                    anywhere. No secretary or other officer is present at the deliberations of this
                    council. No official record is kept of its proceedings, and it is even
                    considered a breach of ministerial confidence to keep a private record of what
                    passed in the Cabinet, inasmuch as such memoranda may fall into other hands. But
                    on some important occasions, as is known from the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                        Lord Sidmouth,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Correspondence of Earl Grey with
                        King William IV.,</hi> and from Sir Robert Peel’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Memoirs,</hi> published by permission of the Queen, Cabinet minutes are
                    drawn up and submitted to the sovereign, as the most formal manner in which the
                    advice of the ministry can be tendered to the Crown and placed upon record. More
                    commonly, it is the duty of the Prime Minister to lay the collective opinion of
                    his colleagues before the sovereign, and take his or her pleasure on public
                    measures and appointments. The sovereign never presides at a Cabinet, and at the
                    meetings of the Privy Council, where the sovereign does preside, the business is
                    purely formal. It has been laid down by some writers as a principle of the
                    British Constitution that the sovereign is never present at a discussion between
                    the advisers of the Crown; and this is, no doubt, an established fact and
                    practice. But like many other political usages of this country it originated in
                    a happy accident. King William and Queen Anne always presided at weekly Cabinet
                    Councils. But when the Hanoverian princes ascended the throne, they knew no
                    English, and were barely able to converse at all with their ministers; for
                    George I. or George II. to take part in, or even to listen to, a debate in
                    council was impossible. When George III. mounted the throne the practice of the
                    independent deliberations of the Cabinet was well established, and it has never
                    been departed from. In no other country has this practice been introduced, and
                    perhaps this is one reason why in many instances constitutional government has
                    failed to take root.</p>
                <p>Differences of opinion, of course, occur in all bodies of men, and arguments are
                    frequently presented with greater ability and temper in private than in public
                    debate. These differences are decided in the Cabinet, as in all committees of
                    council, by the majority of votes, and the rule holds good in all of them that
                    “no man shall make publication of how the minority voted” The vote once taken
                    and the question decided, every member of the Cabinet becomes equally
                    responsible for the decision, and is equally bound to support and defend it. A
                    decided difference of opinion cannot be persisted in or publicly expressed
                    without withdrawing from the Cabinet, as when Mr Gladstone quitted Sir Robert
                    Peel’s administration upon the proposal to endow Maynooth. Hence it arises that
                    resignations, or threats of resignation, are much more common than the public
                    imagine; and a good deal of tact and management is continually exercised in
                    reconciling these differences. A serious “division in the Cabinet" is, as is
                    well known, an infallible sign of its approaching dissolution. There are cases
                    in which a minister has been dismissed for a departure from the concerted action
                    of his colleagues. Thus, in 1851, Lord Palmerston having expressed to the French
                    ambassador in London his unqualified approbation of the <hi rend="italic">coup
                        d’état</hi> of Louis Napoleon against the Assembly, when the Cabinet had
                    resolved on observing a strict neutrality on the subject, Lord Russell advised
                    Her Majesty to withdraw from Lord Palmerston the seals of the Foreign
                    Department, and his lordship never again filled that office.</p>
                <p>A clause was introduced into the Act of Settlement of 1705 requiring all Acts of
                    State tobe transacted in the Privy Council and signed by all the members
                    present. This provision was found to be inconvenient, and was repealed two years
                    afterwards. According to modern usage only one kind of public document is signed
                    by all the mem bers of the Cabinet, as privy councillors, and that is the order
                    for general reprisals which constitutes a declara tion of war. Such an order was
                    issued against Russia in 1854, and was signed by all the members of Lord
                    Aberdeen’s Cabinet.</p>
                <p>Upon the resignation or dissolution of a ministry, the sovereign exercises the
                    undoubted prerogative of selecting the person who may be thought by the Court
                    most fit to form a new Cabinet. In several instances the statesmen selected by
                    the Crown have found themselves unable to accomplish the task confided to them.
                    But in more favourable cases the minister chosen for this supreme office iby the
                    Crown has the power of distributing all the political offices of the Government
                    as may seem best to himself, subject only to the ultimate approval of the
                    sovereign. The First Minister is therefore in reality the author and constructor
                    of the Cabinet; he holds it together; and in the event of his retirement, from
                    whatever cause, the Cabinet is really dissolved, even though its members are
                    again united under another head, as was the case when Lord Melbourne succeeded
                    Lord Grey in 1834, and when Mr Disraeli succeeded Lord Derby in February 1868.
                    Each member of the Cabinet, in fact, holds office under the First Lord of the
                    Treasury, and in the event of resignation it is to him that the announcement of
                    such an intention should be made.</p>
                <p>The best account of the Cabinet council and. of the other executive machinery of
                    the constitution is to be found in Mr Alpheus Todd’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                        Parliamentary Government in England</hi> (2 vols. 8vo, 1867-69), where all
                    the authorities are collected—Hallam, May, John Austin, Lord Macaulay—and a vast
                    quantity of political information, compiled from debates and bearing on this
                    subject. Mr Bagehot’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on the English Constitution</hi>
                    contains an ingenious comparison, or rather contrast, between the British
                    Cabinet and the administrative mechanism of the United States of America. (H.
