                    Fcter. It is at this day one of the titles of the grand seignior or sultan, who
                    claims to be successor to Mahomet, through the line including Abu-Bekr, Oman,
                    and Othman (the Sunnite view), and also of the Sophi or Sufi of Persia as
                    claimant through Ali (the Shiite view). The history of the rule of the Sophis
                    may occasionally remind the student of the saying current respecting Russian
                    autocracy some fifty years ago, that it was “despotism tempered by
                    assassination.” When Louis XIV. was one day, in the presence of some courtiers,
                    extolling the government of the Sophis as something approaching to an almost
                    ideal excellence, the Marshal d’Estrees replied, “But, sire, I have seen three
                    of them strangled during my lifetime.” One of the chief functions of the caliph,
                    in his quality of imaum or chief priest of Islamism, was to begin the public
                    prayers every Friday in the chief mosque, and to deliver the <hi rend="italic"
                    >khootba</hi> or sermon. In after times they had assistants for this latter
                    office; but the former was always performed by the caliph in person. The caliph
                    was also obliged to lead the pilgrims to Mecca in person, and to march at the
                    head of the armies of his empire. He granted investiture to princes and sent
                    swords, standards, gowns, and the like, as presents to princes of the Mahometan
                    religion, who, though they had thrown off the yoke of the caliphate, held of it
                    as vassals. The caliphs usually went to the mosque mounted on mules; and the
                    Seljukian sultans, though masters of Baghdad, held their stirrups and led their
                    mules by the bridle some distance on foot, till the caliphs gave them the sign
                    to mount on horseback. At a window of the caliph’s palace there always hung a
                    piece of black velvet 20 cubits long, which reached to the ground, and was
                    called the <hi rend="italic">caliph's sleeve;</hi> this the grandees of his
                    court kissed daily with great respect. After the destruction of the caliphate by
                    Hulagu, the Mahometan princes appointed a particular officer in their respective
                    dominions to sustain the sacred authority of caliph. In Turkey this officer is
                    called <hi rend="italic">mufti,</hi> and in Persia <hi rend="italic"
                    >sadne.</hi></p>
                <p>The successions of caliphs continued from the death of Mahomet till the 655th
                    year of the Hegira, when Baghdad was taken by the Tatars. After this, however,
                    there were persons who claimed the caliphate, as pretending to be of the family
                    of the Abbassides, and to them the sultans of Egypt rendered great honours at
                    Cairo, as the true successors of Mahomet; but this honour was merely titular,
                    and the right allowed them only in matters of religion; and though they bore the
                    sovereign title of <hi rend="italic">caliphs,</hi> they were subjects and
                    dependents of the sultans. In the year of the Hegira 361, a kind of caliphate
                    was erected by the Fatimites in Africa, and lasted till it was suppressed by
                    Saladin. Historians also speak of a third caliphate in Yemen or Arabia Felix,
                    erected by some princes of the family of the Jobites. The emperors of Marocco
                    assume the title of <hi rend="italic">grand scherιfs,</hi> and pretend to be the
                    true caliphs, or successors of Mahomet, though under another name. For
