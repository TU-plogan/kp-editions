                    The word itself represents the Mongol <hi rend="italic">Kaan-Baligh,</hi> “the
                    city of the khan,” or emperor, the title by which Peking continues, more or
                    less, to be known to the Mongols and other northern Asiatics.</p>
                <p>A city occupying approximately the same site had been the capital of one of the
                    principalities into which China was divided some centuries before the Christian
                    era; and during the reigns of the two Tartar dynasties that immediately preceded
                    the Mongols in Northern China, viz., that of the Khitans, and of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kin</hi> or “Golden” khans, it had been one of their royal
                    residences. Under the names of Yenking, which it received from the Khitan, and
                    of Chungtu, which it had from the Kin, it holds a conspicuous place in the wars
                    of Chinghiz Khan against the latter dynasty. He captured it in 1215, but it was
                    not till 1264 that it was adopted as the imperial residence in lieu of Kara
                    Korum in the Mongol steppes, by his grandson Kublaï. The latter selected a
                    position a few hundred yards to the N.E. of the old city of Chungtu or Yenking,
                    where he founded the new city of <hi rend="italic">Ta-tu</hi> (“great capital
                    ”), called by the Mongols <hi rend="italic">Tαidu</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Daitu,</hi> but also <hi rend="italic">Kaaη-bηligh</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and from this time dates the use of the latter name as applied to this site.</p>
                <p>The new city formed a rectangle, enclosed by a colossal mud-rampart, the longer
                    sides of which ran north and south. These were each about 5½ English miles in
                    length, the shorter sides 3⅜, so that the circuit was upwards of 18 miles. The
                    palace of the khan, with its gardens and lake, itself formed an inner inclosure
                    fronting the south. There were eleven city gates, viz., three on the south side,
                    always the formal front with the Tartars, and two on each of the other sides;
                    and the streets ran wide and straight from gate to gate (except, of course,
                    where interrupted by the palace-walls), forming an oblong chess-board plan.</p>
                <p>Tatu continued to be the residence of the emperors till the fall of the Mongol
                    power (1368). The native dynasty (Ming) which supplanted them established their
                    residence at <hi rend="italic">Nan-king</hi><hi rend="italic">(“</hi>
                    South-Court ”), but this proved so inconvenient that the second sovereign of the
                    dynasty reoccupied Tatu, giving it then, for the first time, the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pe-king</hi> (“North-Court ”). This was the name in common use
                    when the Jesuits entered China towards the end of the 16th century, and began to
                    send home accurate information about China. But it is not so now; the names in
                    ordinary use being <hi rend="italic">Kiηg-eheηg</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >King-tu,</hi> both signifying “capital.” The restoration of Cambaluc was
                    commenced in 1409. The size of the city was diminished by the retrenchment of
                    nearly one-third at the northern end, which brought the enceinte more nearly to
                    a square form. And this constitutes the modern (so-called) “Tartar city” of
                    Peking, the south front of which is identical with the south front of the city
                    of Kublaï. The walls were completed in 1437. Population gathered about the
                    southern front, probably using the material of the old city of Yenking, and the
                    excrescence so formed was, in 1544, enclosed by a wall, and called the “outer
                    city.” It is the same that is usually called by Europeans “the Chinese city.”
                    The ruins of the retrenched northern portion of Kublaï’s great rampart are still
                    prominent along their whole extent, so that there is no room for question as to
                    the position or true dimensions of the Cambaluc of the Middle Ages; and it is
                    most probable, indeed it is almost a necessity, that the present palace stands
                    on the lines of Kublaï’s palace, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n798/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0798-0723"/> The city, under the name of Cambaluc, was
                    constituted into an archiépiscopal see by Pope Clement V. in 1307, in favour of
                    the missionary Franciscan John of Montecorvino; but though some successors were
                    nominated it seems probable that no second metropolitan ever actually occupied
                    the seat.</p>
                <p>Maps of the 16th and 17th centuries often show Cambaluc in an imaginary region to
                    the north of China, a part of the misconception that has prevailed regarding
                    Cathay (see <hi rend="smallcaps">China).</hi> The name is often in popular
                    literature written Cambaïu, and is by Longfellow accented in verse <hi
                    rend="italic">Cámbalú.</hi> But this spelling originates in an accidental error
                    in Ramusio’s Italian version, which, till lately, was the chief channel through
                    which Marco Polo’s book was popularly known. The original (French) MSS. all
                    agree with the etymology in calling it Cambaluc, which should be accented <hi
                    rend="italic">Cărnbaluc.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(h. y.)</hi></p>
