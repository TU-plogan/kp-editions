                    1551. His father, who was a native of Lichfield, settled in London, where he
                    became a member of the company of paper-stainers. His mother was of the ancient
                    family of Curwen of Workington in Cumberland. Young Camden received his early
                    education at Christ’s Hospital and St Paul’s School; and in 1566 he entered as a
                    servitor of Magdalen College, Oxford; but not succeeding in getting a demi’s
                    place, he removed to Broadgate Hall, and, somewhat more than two years
                    afterwards, to Christ Church, where he was supported by his friend and patron Dr
                    Thornton. About this time he became a candidate for a fellowship at All Souls
                    College, which he lost through the adverse influence of the Roman Catholic
                    party. In 1570 he supplicated the regents of the university to be admitted
                    bachelor of arts, but in this also he was disappointed. The following year
                    Camden came to London, where he prosecuted his favourite study of antiquity,
                    under the patronage of Dr Goodman, dean of Westminster, by whose interest he was
                    made, in 1575, second master of Westminster school. From the time of his leaving
                    the university to this period, he had travelled through great part of England,
                    with a view to make observations and collect materials for his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannia,</hi> on which he was now seriously engaged. In 1581 he became
                    intimately acquainted with the learned President Brisson, who was then in
                    England, and in 1586 he published the first edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannia,</hi> a survey of the British isles, written in elegant Latin. In
                    1593 he succeeded to the head mastership of Westminster school, on the
                    resignation of Dr Grant. In this office he continued till 1597, when he was
                    promoted to be Clarencieux king-at-arms. In 1600 Camden made a tour to the
                    north, as far as Carlisle, accompanied by his friend Mr (afterwards Sir Robert)
                    Cotton. In 1606 he began his correspondence with the celebrated President de
                    Thou, which continued to the death of that historian. In the following year he
                    published his last edition of the <hi rend="italic">Britannia,</hi> from which
                    the several English translations have been made; and in 1608 he began to digest
                    his materials for a history of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In 1609, after
                    recovering from a dangerous illness, he retired to Chiselhurst in Kent, where he
                    continued to spend the summer months during the remainder of his life. The first
                    part of his annals of the queen did not appear till 1615, and he determined that
                    the second volume should not appear till after his death. The work was entirely
                    finished in 1617; and from that time he was principally employed in collecting
                    materials for the further improvement of his <hi rend="italic">Britannia.</hi>
                    In 1622, being now upwards of seventy, he determined to lose no time in
                    executing his design of founding a history lecture in the university of Oxford.
                    His deed of gift was accordingly transmitted by his friend Mr Heather to Mr
                    Gregory Wheare, who was by himself appointed the first professor. Camden died at
                    Chiselhurst, Nov. 9, 1623, in the seventy-third year of his age, and was buried
                    with great solemnity in Westminster Abbey, where a monument was erected to his
                    memory. He was a man of great modesty and integrity, profoundly learned in the
                    history and antiquities of England, and a judicious and conscientious historian.
                    The Camden Society, founded in 1838 for historical research, was so named in
                    honour of him. Besides the works already mentioned, he was author of an
                    excellent Greek grammar, and of several tracts in Hearne’s collection. His
                    greatest and most useful work is the <hi rend="italic">Britannia.</hi> It was
                    first translated into English, and published in folio in London in 1611, by Dr
                    Philemon Holland, who is thought to have consulted the author himself; and
                    therefore great respect has been paid to his additions and explanations, on the
                    supposition that they may belong to Camden. But in a later edition of the same
                    translation, published in 1636, the doctor has taken liberties which cannot be
                    excused. A new translation, made with the utmost fidelity from the last edition,
                    was published in 1695, by Edmund Gibson of Queen’s College, Oxford, afterwards
                    bishop of London; in which, besides the addition of notes, and of all that
                    deserved to be taken notice of in Dr Holland’s first edition, there are many
                    other augmentations <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n810/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0810-0735"/> and improvements, all properly distinguished from
                    the genuine work of the author.</p>
                <p>Gibson’s edition was reprinted in 1722, and several times subsequently. The
                    latest and best editions are those by Gough, 1789-90, 3 vols, fol., and by Gough
                    and Nichols, 1806, 4 vols. fol.</p>
