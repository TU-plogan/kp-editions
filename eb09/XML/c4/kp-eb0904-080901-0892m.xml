                    (1770-1827), one of the greatest of English statesmen and orators, was born in
                    London on the 11th April 1770. He was descended from an ancient family; but his
                    father, having incurred the displeasure of his parents, was cut off with a
                    scanty allowance, and obliged to try his fortune in the metropolis. Here he
                    studied for the bar, but literature proved too attractive for him, without
                    yielding him even a tolerable livelihood. His affairs were not improved by a
                    marriage with an Irish lady, of good connections and some beauty, but as poor as
                    himself. He died of a broken heart, a year after the birth of his son. The
                    widowed mother took to the stage without achieving any great success, and in
                    this new way of life married twice,—neither time wisely.</p>
                <p>It was thus, in the society of the stage, that the future premier of England
                    passed his earliest years. It was well for him, therefore, when one of his
                    paternal uncles, a wealthy banker in London, took upon himself the care of his
                    education Young Canning was then in his eighth year, and from that time had all
                    the advantages of the best education and the most cultured society, for Burke,
                    Fox, Sheridan, and other leading Whigs were guests at his uncle’s house After
                    spending a few years at a London school he went in due time to Eton and Oxford.
                    At both places he highly distinguished himself. He was a brilliant scholar, gave
                    promise of the future orator in the debating societies, became known as a wit in
                    a wide circle of admiring friends, and even at Eton, at the age of sixteen, gave
                    decided evidence of literary talent, in a periodical got up amongst his
                    schoolmates. From Oxford he returned to London with the reputation of a man able
                    to perform great things. And now he had to choose between two careers, not
                    easily to be combined by one who had his own way to make in the world. The
                    generous enthusiasm of youth tempted him into a political career; worldly
                    prudence pointed him to the bar as the safer profession for a man without means.
                    Circumstances decided in favour of the former. Pitt was new being drawn into the
                    ter rible crusade against the French Revolution, and greatly needed able
                    associates to make head against the fiery eloquence of Fox and Sheridan. To
                    Canning, who soon became known in the clubs and other political circles of the
                    metropolis as a young man of the most brilliant promise, he made the offer of
                    the nomination borough of Newport. This was accepted, and Canning entered
                    Parliament as an adherent of Pitt in 1793, being twenty-three years of age.</p>
                <p>Canning is charged with having taken this step from interested motives. In the
                    debating societies of Oxford and the metropolis he had been an enthusiastic
                    Liberal, and had long been the friend of the Liberal leaders. Now, when the
                    prospects of the Whig party were becoming gloomier every day, this crossing over
                    to the ranks of Pitt had a suspicious appearance of convenience. But there is no
                    real ground for such suspicion. With regard to the French Revolution, which was
                    now the all-absorbing political question, Canning simply underwent the same
                    change of opinion as the immense majority of educated Englishmen, Pitt included,
                    hailing it at first as the dawn of a new day for France and Europe, but turning
                    away from it in dismay and indignation, and determined to oppose it, when he saw
                    it was more likely to subvert than to reform society.</p>
                <p>From his entrance into Parliament till the death of Pitt in 1806, Canning was an
                    ardent and devoted supporter of all the measures of that statesman. In the House
                    of Commons he soon took his place as one of the most brilliant and successful
                    debaters of the time, though unhappily his efforts needed to be directed against
                    his own friends, Fox and Sheridan; and he gave proof of his business capacity in
                    some of the less prominent departments of the administration. Out of Parliament
                    he fought the Revolution almost as effectively by starting (in 1797) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anti-Jacobin,</hi> a weekly paper, in which the principles of
                    innovation in morals, in literature, and above all, in politics, were
                    mercilessly attacked, and their advocates covered with ridicule and abuse.
                    Canning contributed many of the humorous articles, and in this way extended the
                    reputation for caustic wit he had already acquired in Parliament.</p>
                <p>In 1800 Canning married Miss Joan Scott. The marriage was in every way a happy
                    and a fortunate one, based on mutual love and esteem, which continued unbroken
                    to the end; while Miss Scott had a largo fortune, and was connected with some of
                    the highest of the aristocracy.</p>
                <p>On the death of Pitt in 1806, and the formation of a Whig ministry by Fox and the
                    Grenvilles, Canning went into opposition, and showed that, even on a question of
                    humanitarian interest, he was not above the pettiest feelings of party. He
                    supported, but very coldly, the bill for the abolition <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> of the slave-trade.</p>
                <p>On the return of the Tories to power in 1807, Canning entered on his first great
                    Government office, the secretaryship for Foreign Affairs. It was one of the
                    darkest periods in the history of England. The great European coalition had been
                    overthrown at Austerlitz, Austria compelled to an ignominious peace, Prussia
                    nearly annihilated, and Russia obliged, at the peace of Tilsit, to connive at
                    the supremacy of Napoleon, or induced to share in the division of the Continent.
                    Canning performed the arduous duties of his office with extraordinary tact and
                    energy. It was he that planned the expedition to Copenhagen, for the seizure of
                    the Danish fleet, with such secrecy and despatch as completely to anticipate
                    Napoleon, and excite in him the liveliest astonishment and wrath. The
                    negotiations for peace opened with the English Government by Napoleon and
                    Alexander, and the invasion of Spain, still further complicated the difficulties
                    of his position, only to throw new lustre on his genius. He soon saw that the
                    Peninsula was the battlefield on which England could bring her strength
                    advantageously to bear <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n893/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0893-0810"/> against the armies of the French conqueror. He
                    encouraged the spirit of resistance in tho Spanish nation, supported the Spanish
                    armies, first with supplies of arms, and then with the active co-operation of
                    the English forces, and was one of the first to recognize and employ the
                    military capacity of the future duke of Wellington. Unfortunately, an event soon
                    occurred which deprived the country of his services, when the need was greatest,
                    and when he was the only statesman in England whose talents were of the first
                    order. In 1809, Lord Castlereagh, as Secretary-at-War, had organized the
                    expedition to Walcheren, the worst conducted and the most disastrous of the
                    whole war. In consequence of it a dispute arose between his lordship and
                    Canning, which resulted in a duel, and in the resignation of both. From this
                    unfortunate incident till 1822, Canning took no very prominent part in the
                    Government of the country. This is particularly to be regretted, as the period
                    in question includes the decisive years of the Napoleonic struggle, and the new
                    settlement of Europe by the peace of Vienna, when Canning might have done good
                    service by insisting, more than was done, on the claims of nationality and
                    constitutional liberty. In this he was not free from blame, as he allowed his
                    personal dislikes too much to interfere with his duty to his country. But the
                    chief reason was his advocacy of Catholic Emancipation, which lost him favour at
                    court Men’s motives must always remain to some extent doubtful; still it seems
                    clear that at one time his dislike of Castlereagh, at another his insistance on
                    Catholic Emancipation, prevented him from resuming his place in the Foreign
                    Office. He lived to regret this deeply, and to declare that two years of office
                    at the termination of the European struggle would, have been worth ten years of
                    life. Even now, however, he was not idle. In 1812 he made a powerful speech in
                    favour of Emancipation, which was carried in the Commons by a large majority,
                    but rejected by the Lords. From 1814 to 1816 he was ambassador at Lisbon, and
                    from 1817 to 1820 President of the Board of Control for India As a member of the
                    Cabinet during the latter period he was very active in support of Government,
                    strongly advocating the coercive measures employed at home during the years
                    which immediately followed the Revolution. It is indeed a noteworthy fact in his
                    political career that, though unable to act with Castlereagh in the most
                    dangerous crisis of the French war, he found it right to join him and his
                    associates in such severe measures of repression,-—noteworthy, but quite
                    explicable, as Canning never professed to be anything else than a disciple of
                    Pitt.</p>
                <p>At the head of the Board of Control, Canning gained the entire confidence of the
                    directors of the East India Company. In consequence, they had appointed him to
                    the governor-generalship of India, and he had proceeded to Liverpool to take
                    leave of the constituents who had four times returned him to Parliament, when
                    news came of the death of Castlereagh (then earl of Londonderry). The voice of
                    the country had already named him successor in the Foreign Office, and, in this
                    capacity, under the premiership of Lord Liverpool, Canning entered upon the last
                    and most brilliant period of his career. The state of Europe had greatly changed
                    since his resignation of the same office in 1809. The Holy Alliance now aspired
                    to regulate the affairs of the world. Inaugurated by the emperor of Russia,
                    under the inspiration of Madame Krüdener, it was •at first a sincere attempt of
                    the rulers of Europe to govern on Christian principles. But even the Russian
                    emperor was soon frightened from the path of benevolent reform by the revival of
                    the revolutionary spirit and its appearance in his own army; while interested
                    statesmen like Metternich so utilized the pious aspirations of kings to the
                    profit of despotism, that the Holy Alliance soon became a byword in Europe.
                    Castlereagh had yielded too far to this tendency. The country was getting weary
                    of it. And now Canning came forward to assert the free action of England and the
                    universal right of self-government. He was, however, no revolutionist. In his
                    home and foreign policy alike he aimed at holding a middle course. At home he
                    advocated Catholic Emancipation, and believed in Free Trade, but strenuously
                    opposed Parliamentary Reform. In his foreign policy his principle was that
                    England should hold the balance between the reactionary and the revolutionary
                    parties, “that in order to prevent things going-to extremities, she should keep
                    a distinct middle ground, staying the plague both ways.” Seeing that the
                    reactionary party predominated in 1822, he judged that England should throw the
                    weight of her influence into the Liberal scales. In accordance with these views,
                    he protested against the doctrine that free institutions should be held only as
                    a spontaneous gift of the sovereign, and disapproved of the measures adopted at
                    the Congress of Verona in 1822, especially of the French invasion of Spain for
                    the restoration of absolutism in 1823,—a year, too, which was marked at home by
                    the passing of the Reciprocity Act, the first step in the direction of Free
                    Trade. In order to render the protest against the invasion of Spain more
                    effectual, it was determined in 1824 to recognize the independence of the South
                    American colonies. On the threatened invasion of Portugal by reactionary Spain
                    in 1826, Canning, again interposed with the utmost decision, and the invasion
                    was abandoned. The speeches he made on these occasions, and his general attitude
                    of defiance to despotism, had a marvellous effect, not only in Parliament and in
                    England, but in all civilized communities. He was everywhere hailed as the
                    champion and spokesman of national and popular liberty. The party of progress
                    recovered from the torpor consequent upon the Revolution, and returned to new
                    life. The enthusiasm for his name was heightened when it became known that he
                    had taken the initiative in another act of international justice, by proposing
                    (1826) to France and Russia that combination of the three Powers which led to
                    the battle of Navarino and the establishment of Greek independence.</p>
                <p>But ere that result had been attained the great statesman was no more. Early in
                    1827 Lord Liverpool, who had been the nominal head of the Government since 1812,
                    was disabled Canning, who now became premier, expected the co-operation of the
                    members of the late administration, but was disappointed, and had to struggle on
                    under the greatest difficulties, and against the most virulent opposition. His
                    exciting labours and the alienation of so many friends were too severe for his
                    sensitive temperament. He caught a severe cold, and died on the 8th of August
                    1827. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, in the Statesmen’s Corner, by the
                    grave of his master Pitt.</p>
                <p>His death created a sensation commensurate with his world-wide fame and with the
                    hopes still entertained of him. The splendour of his talents was only matched by
                    their versatility. In his high and brilliant career he had proved himself equal
                    to anything—from guiding the destinies of a great nation through the storms of
                    the Napoleonic wars, down to the editing of a comic journal. He had all the
                    natural endowments of a great orator,—a graceful and commanding form, a musical
                    voice, a perfect mastery of the’ choicest language, and a ready wit that played
                    with all the resources of his intellect. In private life he was even more
                    admirable,—in his own family, an almost perfect model of all the household
                    charities, and towards his mother, whose imprudent marriages had endangered his
                    infancy, full of the tenderest and most affectionate piety. (τ. κ.)</p>
