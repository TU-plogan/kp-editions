                <p><label type="entry">CAMPAGNA DI ROMA</label>, is, in the wider application of the
                    word, an extensive plain of central Italy, almost coinciding with the ancient
                    Latium, and, in a more restricted signification, that portion of the larger area
                    which lies immediately round the city of Rome between the Tiber and the Anio.
                    The circumference of the latter “might be marked,” says Gregorovius, “by a
                    series of well-known points,—Civita Vecchia, Tolfa, Ronciglione, Soracte,

                    rend="italic">Ciminia),</hi> on the E. by the lower ranges of the Apennines, and
                    on the S. and W. by the Tyrrhenian Sea. It extends about 84 miles in length from
                    Civita Vecchia to Terracina, and has a breadth of 24 miles,—its area being
                    nearly 1400 square miles. Of distinctly volcanic formation, the surface presents
                    a very undulating appearance, broken by deep gullies and studded with extinct
                    craters, that now form the basins of lakes, such as those of Bolsena, Vico, and
                    Baccano. In ancient times it seems to have been a well-peopled region, and was
                    the seat of numerous cities; but in the 3d and 4th centuries <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Roman aristocracy turned the most of the district
                    into huge estates, and thus led to the disappearance of the agricultural
                    population. In the earlier period of the empire its condition grew worse and
                    worse, and many parts of the plain became covered with pestilential marshes. The
                    emperors Claudius, Nerva, and Trajan turned their attention to the amelioration
                    of the district, and under their example and exhortation the Roman aristocracy
                    erected numerous villas within its boundaries, and used them at least for summer
                    residence. With the ruin of the empire and the inroad of the barbarian hordes
                    the desolation of the Campagna was complete; but, again, in the Middle. Ages, it
                    became dotted over with the baronial castles of the rival families of Rome—the
                    Orsini, the Colonnas, the Savelli, the Conti, and the Caetani-—who ruthlessly
                    destroyed the remains of earlier edifices to obtain materials for their own.
                    Several of the popes, as Boniface IX., Sixtus IV., and Julius III., made
                    unsuccessful attempts to improve the sanitary condition of the Campagna; and
                    equally fruitless in more recent times—as far, at least, as the general purpose
                    is concerned—have been the efforts of Popes Pius VI. and VII., and of General
                    Miollis, the French governor of Rome. The most healthy portions of the territory
                    are in the north and east, embracing the slopes of the Apennines which are
                    watered by the Teverone and Saccho; and the most pestilential is the stretch
                    between the Lepini Hills and the sea. The Pontine marshes, included in the
                    latter division, were drained, according to the plan of Bolognini, by Pius VI.;
                    but though they have been restored to cultivation, their insalubrity is still
                    notorious. The soil in many parts is very fertile; and the atmosphere, which is
                    so deadly to man, has no hurtful effect on the lower animals. In summer, indeed,
                    the vast expanse is little better than an arid steppe; but in the winter it
                    furnishes abundant pasture to flocks of sheep and herds of silver-grey oxen and
                    shaggy black horses. The land is for the most part let by the proprietors to <hi
                    rend="italic">Mercaηti di Campagna,</hi> who employ a subordinate class of
                    factors <hi rend="italic">(fattori)</hi> to manage their affairs on the spot. It
                    is evident that the malaria which renders the Campagna almost uninhabitable
                    during the summer is owing to natural causes affecting a wide area with which it
                    is very difficult to deal, and that no merely local improvements can have any
                    effect. The regulation of the rivers is so defective that they annually overflow
                    a great extent of surface; the character of the soil allows the waters to gather
                    in fetid masses, and the heat of summer turns them into noxious vapours. The
                    attention∙of the Italian Government and of General Garibaldi has recently been
                    turned towards the systematic sanitary improvement of the district, —with what
                    results remains to be seen. The planting of the <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus
                    globulus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Helianthus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >annuus</hi> has been partially resorted to, especially in the district of Tre
                    Fontani, and, it is reported, with some success.</p>
