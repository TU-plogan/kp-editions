                <p><label type="entry">CALABAR BEAN</label>, the seed of a leguminous plant, <hi
                        rend="italic">Physostigma</hi><hi rend="italic">venenosum,</hi> a native of
                    tropical Africa. The plant has a climbing habit like the scarlet runner, and
                    attains a height of about 50 feet, with a stem an inch or two in thickness. The
                    seed pods, which contain two or three seeds or beans, are 6 or 7 inches in
                    length; and the beans are about the size of an ordinary horse bean but much
                    thicker, with a deep chocolate brown colour. They constitute the E-ser-e or
                    ordeal beans of the negroes of Old Calabar, being administered to persons
                    accused of witchcraft or other crimes. In cases where the poisonous material did
                    its deadly work it was held at once to indicate and rightly to punish guilt; but
                    when it was rejected by the stomach of the accused, innocence was held to be
                    satisfactorily established. A form of duelling with the seeds is also known
                    among the natives, in which the two opponents divide a bean, each eating
                    one-half; that quantity has been known to kill both adversaries. Although thus
                    highly poisonous, the bean has nothing in external aspect, taste, or smell to
                    distinguish it from any harmless leguminous seed, and very disastrous effects
                    have resulted from its being incautiously left in the way of children. The beans
                    were first introduced into England in the year 1840; but the plant was not
                    accurately described till 1861, and its physiological effects were investigated
                    in 1863 by Dr Thomas R. Fraser. In that year an alkaloid was isolated from the
                    seeds to which the name physostigmine was applied; and under the name eserine
                    another alkaloid was prepared from them; but it is not yet quite certain that
                    the two substances are essentially different. Dr Fraser’s investigations, which
                    were conducted with an alcoholic extract of the seeds, showed that the active
                    principles exerted a remarkable influence in contracting the pupil of the eye,
                    and in counteracting the influence of atropine. The antagonism of physostigmine
                    and atropine and its relations to many other alkaloids have subsequently been
                    the subject of very numerous investigations. A committee of the British Medical
                    Association under Professor Hughes Bennett found that the antagonism between
                    sulphate of atropine and extract of Calabar bean exists only within narrow
                    limits, so that for practical purposes atropine is useless as an antidote to
                    Calabar bean. The investigation of the same committee into the relations of
                    hydrate of chloral and Calabar bean, however, proves that they are mutually
                    antagonistic, but as the toxic influence of the Calabar bean is very rapid, it
                    is necessary to administer the chloral as soon as possible after the Calabar
                    bean is taken. Calabar bean in the form of powder and extract is used in medical
                    practice. It has been chiefly employed by ophthalmists to produce contraction of
                    the pupil, but it is also used in tetanus, neuralgia, and rheumatic
                    diseases.</p>
