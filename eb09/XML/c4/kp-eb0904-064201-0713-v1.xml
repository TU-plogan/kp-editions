                <p><label type="entry">CAHORS</label>, a town in the south of France, formerly the
                    capital of Cahourcin or Upper Quercy, and now of the department of Lot, on the
                    high road between Paris and Toulouse, 358 miles S.W. from Paris, and 60 miles
                    north of Toulouse, in 44° 27' N. lat., 1° 24' E. long. It stands on the right
                    bank of the River Lot, on a rocky peninsula formed by a bend in the stream, and
                    communicates with the opposite shore by three bridges,—one, the Pont Valendré,
                    built in the 13th century, and surmounted by three massive towers. In the more
                    ancient part of the town the streets are narrow and the houses antique; but in
                    the modern and more elevated quarter there are many handsome buildings, with
                    terraces which command an extensive view. The most remarkable building is the
                    cathedral, built in the 11th or 12th century, and occupying the site, if not
                    actually consisting of the remains, of an ancient Roman temple. Besides it,
                    there is the theological seminary, the prefecture (formerly an episcopal
                    palace), an academy, a theatre, a public library, and a monument erected to
                    Fénelon in front of the cathedral. Cahors is the see of a bishop, and the seat
                    of judicial and commercial tribunals of the first class. Its university, founded
                    by Pope John XXII. in 1332, was incorporated with that of Toulouse in 1751. The
                    principal articles of manufacture are stoneware, cotton-yarn, woollen stuffs,
                    and paper; and it has a considerable traffic in oil, hemp, flax, hides,
                    truffles, and a strong deeply-coloured wine, which is made in the neighbouring
                    districts. Population of the town in 1872, 13,061, and of the commune
                    14,593.</p>
                <p>Cahors is the ancient <hi rend="italic">Divona,</hi> afterwards called <hi
                        rend="italic">Civitas Cadurcorum,</hi> from the Celtic tribe of which it was
                    the capital, and still exhibits traces of its greatness during the Roman sway.
                    The most conspicuous remains are those of an immense aqueduct, which conveyed
                    the water to the city from a distance of about 19 miles by a precipitous route
                    along the mountain sides, and crossed the valley of Larroque-des-arcs on a
                    bridge 180 feet high. There are also remains of baths and a theatre, a marble
                    altar in front of the prefecture (erected, according to the inscription, in
                    honour of Lucterius Leo); and a celebrated fountain, supposed to be the fountain
                    Divona, and now called Des Chartreux, from the Carthusian convent to which it
                    has been attached.</p>
                <p>After the decline of the Roman empire Cahors passed in succession into the hands
                    of the Goths the Franks, the Saracens, and the Normans; and in the 12th century
                    it was the subject of severe fighting between the English and French. In 1572
                    the Protestant party in the town were strong enough to prevent their
                    fellow-citizens following the example of Pans; and yet a few years later, in
                    1580, we find the opposition to Henry of Navarre so violent that he only made
                    himself master of the place after several days of conflict. The bishops of
                    Cahors, who date from the 4th century, had formerly also the title of count, and
                    used to lay their sword and gauntlets on the altar when about to officiate.
                    During the Middle Ages the town is said to have been a great seat of the
                    Caorsini (Cawertschen or Cauder-Wälsche), who preceded the Lombards as usurers
                    and moneychangers.</p>
