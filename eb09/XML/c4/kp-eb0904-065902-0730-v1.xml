                    (1745-1815), Baronet, was born at Elgin, in Scotland, July 2, 1745 (o. s.) He
                    belonged to a very ancient family of Morayshire, and was the second son of Sir
                    Thomas Calder of Muirton. He was educated at the grammar school of Elgin, and at
                    the age of fourteen entered the British navy as midshipman. In 1766 he was
                    serving as lieutenant of the “Essex,” under captain the Honourable George
                    Faulkner, in the West Indies. Promotion came slowly, and it was not till 1782
                    that he attained the rank of post-captain. He acquitted himself honourably in
                    the various services to which he was called, but for a long time had no
                    opportunity of distinguishing himself. In 1796 he was named captain of the fleet
                    by Sir John Jervis, and took part in the great battle off Cape St Vincent
                    (February 14,1797). He was selected as bearer of the despatches announcing the
                    victory, and on that occasion was knighted by George III. He also received the
                    thanks of parliament, and in the following year was created a baronet. In 1799
                    he became rear-admiral; and in 1801 he was despatched with a small squadron in
                    pursuit of a French force, under Admiral Gantheaume, conveying supplies to the
                    French in Egypt. In this pursuit he was not successful, and returning home at
                    the peace, he struck his flag. When the war again broke out he was recalled to
                    service, was promoted vice-admiral in 1804, and was employed in the following
                    year in the blockade of the ports of Ferrol and Coruña, in which (amongst other
                    ports) ships were preparing for the invasion of England by Napoleon I. He held
                    his position with a force greatly inferior to that of the enemy, and refused to
                    be enticed out to sea. On its becoming known that the first movement directed by
                    Napoleon was the raising of the blockade of Ferrol, Rear-admiral Stirling was
                    ordered to join Sir R. Calder and cruise with him to intercept the fleets of
                    France and Spain on their passage to Brest. The approach of the enemy was
                    concealed by a fog; but on July 22, 1805, their fleet came in sight. It still
                    outnumbered the British force; but Sir Robert entered into action. After a
                    combat of four hours, during which he captured two Spanish ships, he gave orders
                    to discontinue the action. He offered battle again on the two following days,
                    but the challenge was not accepted. The French admiral, Villeneuve, however, did
                    not pursue his voyage, but took refuge in Ferrol. In the judgment of Napoleon,
                    his scheme of invasion was baffled by this day’s action; but much indignation
                    was felt in England at the failure of Calder to win a complete victory. He was,
                    nevertheless, again sent out in August, and prevented Villeneuve from effecting
                    a junction with the French fleet at Brest. In consequence of the strong feeling
                    against him at home he demanded a court-martial. This was held on the 23d of
                    December, and resulted in a severe reprimand of the vice-admiral for not having
                    done his utmost to renew the engagement, at the same time acquitting him both of
                    cowardice and disaffection. False expectations had been raised ill England by
                    the mutilation of his despatches, and of this he indignantly complained in his
                    defence. The tide of feeling, however, turned again; and in 1815, by way of
                    public testimony to his services, and of acquittal of the charge made against
                    him, he was appointed commander of Portsmouth. He died at Holt, near Bishop’s
                    Waltham, in Hampshire, August 31, 1818.</p>
