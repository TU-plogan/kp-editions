                    Africa. It is situated at the angle of the Bight of Biafra, directly opposite
                    the island of Fernando Po, with which it has evidently an intimate geological
                    connection. Its European name is said to be derived from the Portuguese Camarãos

                    neighbouring coast from the abundance of its Crustacea. The native designation
                    of the highest peak is Mongo-má-Lobá, or the Mountain of the Sky, and the whole
                    upper region is usually called Mongo-mo-Ndemi, or the Mountain of Greatness. The
                    area of the Cameroons proper is calculated at about 380 square miles; but
                    offshoots and underfalls seem to stretch both north and south for considerable
                    distances. The pile is of distinctly volcanic formation, and the higher district
                    contains numerous craters and lava-beds of comparatively recent date. On the
                    principal summit, whose twin peaks of Mount Albert and Victoria rise to a height
                    of about 13,120 feet above the sea-level, there are one small and two large
                    craters, from which, if native report can be trusted, eruptions have taken place
                    within the memory of man (1838). The lower portions of the mass are occupied by
                    a luxuriant vegetation of palms, acacias, fig-trees, kokos, plantains, and a
                    rich variety of tree and shrub; while at the height of about 7000 feet these
                    give place to ferns, grasses, and heaths. The climate of the middle zone would
                    render it an excellent site for a sanatorium for Europeans debilitated by the
                    malaria of the neighbouring coasts; and the fertility of the soil would soon
                    raise the district to great commercial importance, if it were brought under
                    cultivation. The native tribes which inhabit the mountain sides are
                    comparatively few, and have a very small proportion of the surface in actual
                    possession. To the south of the Cameroons lies the Bay of Ambas (Ambozes, or
                    Amboize), with the two islands of Ndami and Mondori. It forms a well-sheltered
                    harbour, and is capable of receiving the largest vessels. In 1837 the king of
                    Bimbia on the mainland made over a large part of the country round the bay to
                    Colonel Nicolls, and in 1848 he agreed to abolish human sacrifices at the
                    funerals of his great men. In 1858 a settlement was made on the coast at the
                    mouth of a small river, flowing into Morton Cove, now known as the Victoria
                    River. The settlers were Mr Saker, a Baptist missionary, and his converts, who
                    removed from Fernando Po, when the Spanish authorities published an edict
                    forbidding public worship to be celebrated by any but the Roman Catholic clergy.
                    To the south-east of the mountains flows the Cameroons River, where the Baptist
                    mission has had a station since 1850. The most important tribe is the Duallas,
                    whose language has been reduced to writing within recent years. The ascent of
                    the Cameroons Mountains was first attempted by Mr Merrick in 1847; but it was
                    not till 1861 that the summit was actually gained by Captain Richard Burton and
                    Mr Mann, a botanist. See Burton’s <hi rend="italic">Abeokuta and the Camerooηs
