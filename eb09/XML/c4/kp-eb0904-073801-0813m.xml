                <p><label type="entry">CAMEO</label>, a term of doubtful origin, applied to engraved
                    work executed in relief, on hard or precious stones, on imitations of such
                    stones in glass called “pastes,” or on the shells of molluscous animals. A cameo
                    is thus the converse of an intaglio, which consists of an incised or sunk
                    engraving executed in the same class of materials. The word cameo is generally
                    regarded as being derived from the Arabic <hi rend="italic">carnea,</hi> a charm
                    or amulet; but a number of other derivations have been suggested, among which a
                    highly allegorical origin of the word from the Arabic <hi rend="italic"
                    >camaut,</hi> the camel’s hump, implying any object in relief, has been
                    maintained by an eminent authority. Cameocutting is an art of much more recent
                    introduction than the sister art of intaglio-engraving. The earliest known
                    traces of any attempt at cutting gem-figures in relief are seen in certain
                    Phoenician and Etruscan scarabei, in which the back of the beetle has been
                    utilized for the faint delineation of another and quite different figure. One of
                    the most ancient known cameos, of which the date can be fixed with certainty,
                    consists of a sardonyx of three layers with portrait heads of Demetrius Soter
                    and his wife Laodice, which must have been engraved between the years 162 and
                    150 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>The materials which ancient artists used for cutting into cameos were chiefly
                    those siliceous minerals which, under a variety of names, present various strata
                    or bands of two or more distinct colours, and properly the name cameo should be
                    restricted to work executed in relief on such banded stones. The minerals, under
                    different names, are essentially the chalcedonic variety of quartz, and the
                    differences of colour they present are due to the presence of variable
                    proportions of iron and other foreign ingredients. These banded stones, when cut
                    parallel to the layers of different colours, and when only two coloured
                    bands—white and black, or sometimes white and black and brown—are present, are
                    known as onyxes, but when they have with the onyx bands layers of carnelian or
                    sard, they are termed sardonyxes. The sardonyx, which was the favourite stone of
                    ancient cameo-engravers, and the material in which their masterpieces were cut,
                    was procured from India, and the increased intercourse with the East by the way
                    of Egypt after the death of Alexander the Great had a marked influence on the
                    development of the art. Cameo-cutting attained the zenith of its pristine
                    perfection in Rome during the first two centuries of the Christian era, the
                    chief works being portraits of the reigning families, and allegorical
                    illustrations of their glories. Contemporaneously with the production of the
                    finest works in Oriental precious stones, pastes or imitations in glass were
                    made in incredible numbers to meet the requirements of the classes who could not
                    afford the other necessarily rare aud costly luxuries. Both in perfection of
                    material and in artistic merit these imitations were, in the best period, of
                    extraordinary merit. The Barberini or Portland vase in the British Museum is a
                    rare example of the skill of both the glass-worker and engraver on glass of
                    ancient times.</p>
                <p>The two most famous examples of this art which have come down to the present day
                    are the Great Agate of the Sainte Chapelle in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris,
                    and the Augustus Cameo in the Vienna collection. The former <pb break="no"

                    Baldwin IL of Constantinople to Saint Louis. It is mentioned in 1344 as “Le
                    Camahieu,” having been sent in that year to Rome for the inspection of Pope
                    Clement VI. It is a sardonyx of five layers of irregular shape, like all
                    classical gems, measuring about 13 inches by 11 inches. During the Middle Ages
                    the subject was supposed to be the triumph of Joseph in Egypt; but it is now
                    known to represent on its upper part the apotheosis of Augustus, the centre
                    being occupied with the reception of Germanicus on his return from his great
                    German campaign by the Emperor Tiberius and his mother Livia. The lower division
                    is filled with a group of captives in attitudes expressive of woe and deep
                    dejection. The Vienna gem <hi rend="italic">(Gemma augustea),</hi> an onyx of
                    two layers measuring 9 inches by 8, is a work of still greater artistic interest
                    The upper portion is occupied with an allegorical representation of the
                    coronation of Augustus,—the emperor being represented as Jupiter with Livia as
                    the goddess Roma at his side. In the composition Neptune and Cybele, with
                    several members of the family of Augustus, are introduced, and on the exergue or
                    lower portion are Roman soldiers preparing a trophy, barbarian captives, and
                    female figures. The history of this inestimable treasure has been traced from
                    the time of the Crusades, and it came into the possession of the Emperor Rudolph
                    II. in the 16th century for the enormous sum of 12,000 gold ducats.</p>
                <p>While these and other similar monuments of antiquity, which have come down to us
                    only mellowed and not injured by time, have intrinsically a priceless value as
                    the expression of the most perfect artistic culture and feeling of the age to
                    which they belong, they possess at the same time equally great significance to
                    the student of the history, civilization, morals, and manners of the period.
                    They supply the most authentic means of confirming the inferences to be drawn
                    from classical sources as to beliefs, usages, dress, domestic and public habits,
                    and pursuits of the people with whom they deal, and by means of such gems not
                    only are the prevailing features of an ancient race accurately delineated, but
                    the actual portraits of many of the most prominent personages in the world’s
                    history have been faithfully preserved, and can be identified beyond the shadow
                    of a doubt.</p>
                <p>The art of cameo-engraving waned in the early part of the 3d century, after the
                    death of the Emperor Severus, but under the first Christian Emperor Constantine
                    it enjoyed a brief period of revival. Many very beautiful cameo portraits of
                    Constantine are extant; and it was during or shortly after his reign that
                    Christian Scripture subjects began to appear on cameos. That class of subjects
                    constituted the staple of such work—generally rude and artistically debased—as
                    continued to be cultivated under the Byzantinft empire down to nearly the epoch
                    of the Renaissance. From the Byzantine period downward one peculiarity of
                    gem-engraving becomes noticeable. Cameowork as compared with intaglios in
                    classical times was rare and infrequent, but now and onwards the opposite is the
                    case, intaglio-sinking having almost died out, and cameos being chiefly
                    produced. Commercial intercourse with the East still secured for the engravers a
                    supply of magnificent sardonyxes, although blood-stone and other non-banded
                    stones were very commonly used for works in relief. Cameos during the long dark
                    ages were used chiefly for the decoration of reliquaries and other altar
                    furniture, and as such their designs were purely ecclesiastical or scriptural.
                    To this period also belongs the class of complimentary or motto cameos, which,
                    containing only inscriptions and an ornamental border, executed in nicolo
                    stones, were used as personal gifts and adornments.</p>
                <p>In mediaeval times antique cameos were held in peculiar veneration on account of
                    the belief, then universal, in their potency as medicinal charms. This power was
                    supposed to be derived from their origin, of which two theories, equally
                    satisfactory, were current. By the one they were held to be the work of the
                    children of Israel during their sojourn in the wilderness (hence the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Pierres d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Israel),</hi> while the other
                    theory held them to be direct products of nature, the engraved figures pointing
                    to the peculiar virtue lodged in them.</p>
                <p>The revival of the glyptic arts in Western Europe dates from the pontificate of
                    the Venetian Paul II. (1464-71), himself an ardent lover and collector of gems,
                    to which passion, indeed, it is gravely affirmed he was a martyr, having died of
                    a cold caught by the multiplicity of gems exposed on his fingers. The cameos of
                    the early part of the 16th century rival in beauty of execution the finest
                    classical works, and, indeed, many of them pass in the cabinets of collectors
                    for genuine antiques, which they closely imitated. The Oriental sardonyx was not
                    available for the purposes of the Renaissance artists, who were consequently
                    obliged to content themselves with the colder German agate onyx. The scarcity of
                    worthy materials led them to use the backs of ancient cameos, or to improve on
                    classical works of inferior value executed on good material, and probably to
                    this cause must also be assigned the introduction of shell cameos, which are not
                    supposed to have been made previous to this period.</p>
                <p>Among the means of distinguishing antique cameos from Cinquecento work, the kind
                    of stone is one of the best tests, the classical artists having used only rich
                    and warm-tinted Oriental stones, which further are frequently drilled through
                    their diameter with a minute hole, from having been used by their original
                    Oriental possessors in the form of beads. The Cinquecento artists also, as a
                    rule, worked their subjects in high relief, and resorted to undercutting, no
                    case of which is found in the flat low work of classical times. The projecting
                    portions of antique work exhibit a dull chalky appearance, which, however,
                    fabricators learned to imitate in various ways, one of which was by cramming the
                    gizzards of turkey fowls with the gems. Another index of antiquity is found in
                    the different methods of working adopted in classical and Renaissance times. The
                    tools employed by the Renaissance engraver were the drill and the wheel, both
                    fed with oil and diamond or emery dust. The drill was simply the common
                    instrument known by that name, and the wheel was a small metallic disc, which
                    cut by its periphery being made to rotate in a vertical plane. Antique gems of
                    the best period were cut or scratched (γλυ&lt;∕&gt;eιv, <hi rend="italic"
                    >scalpere)</hi> with the diamond point (splinters either of corundum or
                    sapphire), with the aid of the drill, which the artists possessed in common with
                    their modern successors.</p>
                <p>In the early part of the 18th century great confusion was introduced into the
                    study of this department of art, by the fraudulent insertion on a wholesale
                    scale of names in Greek, purporting to be those of the engravers of the gems
                    bearing them. In reality the insertion of his name by any artist, on cameos
                    especially, was an exceedingly rare occurrence. An invariable and unfailing test
                    of the authenticity of any signature on a cameo is “that it be always in relief,
                    which is a sure evidence that it was cut at the same time with the rest of the
                    composition.” Another fraud practised in Italy during the revival consisted in
                    engraving on unnamed portrait gems a name supposed to suit the aspect of the
                    individual.</p>
                <p>In our own day the engraving of cameos has ceased to be pursued as an art. Roman
                    manufacturers cut stones in large quantities to be used as shirt-studs and for
                    setting in finger-rings; and in Rome and Paris an extensive trade is carried on
                    in the cutting of shell cameos, which are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n815/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0815-0740"/> largely imported into England and mounted as
                    brooches by Birmingham jewellery manufacturers. The principal shell used is the
                    large bull’s-mouth shell <hi rend="italic">(Cassis rufa),</hi> found in East
                    Indian seas, which has a sard-like underlayer. The black helmet <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cassis</hi><hi rend="italic">tuberosa)</hi> of the West Indian
                    seas, the horned helmet <hi rend="italic">(C cornuta)</hi> of Madagascar, and
                    the pinky queen’s conch <hi rend="italic">(Strombus</hi><hi rend="italic">gig
                    as)</hi> of the West Indies are also employed. The famous potter Josiah Wedgwood
                    introduced a method of making imitations of cameos in pottery by producing white
                    figures on a coloured ground, this constituting the peculiarity of what is now
                    known as Wedgwood ware. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">pa.)</hi></p>
