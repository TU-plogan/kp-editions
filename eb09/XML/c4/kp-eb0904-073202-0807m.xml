                    <hi rend="italic">Kambujiya</hi> (Oppert, Spiegel). In Zend the name takes the
                    form <hi rend="italic">Kavaus,</hi> and in Arabic and modern Persian it is worn
                    down still further to <hi rend="italic">Kavus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kaus.</hi> In Egyptian the name occurs under three forms of transcription,— <hi
                    rend="italic">Kanbuza, Kembatet</hi> (Lepsius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kŏnigsbuch,</hi> taf. xlix.), or rather <hi rend="italic">Kambuzia,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Kambunsa</hi> (Lauth, <hi rend="italic">Ein netter</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Kambyses-text,</hi> p. 5). The etymology of the name is obscure,
                    and the attempts to explain it by Rawlinson <hi rend="italic">(Jour. As.
                    Soc.,</hi> xi. p. 97) and Benfey <hi rend="italic">(Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >persischen Keilinschriften,</hi> p. 77) cannot be regarded as successful. It
                    has been often remarked that the name, or one very similar, occurs more than
                    once in the East as an ethnical and geographical designation. Thus we find
                    Camboja a territory in India, Kamoj a tribe of the Kafirs in Cabul; and a
                    territory named Cambysene, situated in the north on the Kur, is known to Greek
                    geographers. In the same region there was a river called Cambyses, the modern
                    Jora. Perhaps with Spiegel <hi rend="italic">(Eranische Alterthurnskunde,</hi>
                    vol. ii. p. 294) we may regard the personal name Kambujiya as originally an
                    adjective, meaning belonging to Kambuja. In Egypt, also, Cambysu occurs in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Itinerarium</hi> as the name of a place in the Delta, but this
                    is probably derived from the Persian king about to be mentioned, by whom Egypt
                    was conquered</p>
                <p>The persons known by the name of Cambyses belong to the Achaemenian line of
                    Persian kings. It is thought that the great-grandfather of Cyrus the Great was
                    thus called. The evidence, however, for the existence of this Cambyses, though
                    strong, is constructive rather than direct (see Rawlinson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Herodotus,</hi> vol. iv. p. 259). It is certain that the father of Cyrus was
                    named Cambyses. He is called by Herodotus (i. 107) “a Persian of good family,”
                    but by Xenophon <hi rend="italic">(Cyrop.,</hi> i. 11, 1) he is denominated
                    “king of the Persians.” The justness of this title is proved by an inscription
                    on a brick found at Senkereh, in which Cyrus calls himself “the son of Cambyses,
                    the powerful king,” as well as by the statement of Darius Hystaspis, in the
                    Behistun inscription (col. i. 4), that eight of his Achaemenian ancestors had
                    been kings. During the reign of this Cambyses the Persian nation was included in
                    the Median empire, and he is represented as the vassal of the Median king
                    Astyages. At the same time he is said to have married Mandane, the daughter of
                    Astyages, by whom he became the father of Cyrus. Such, at least, is the account
                    of Herodotus, Xenophon, Diodorus, and Trogus Pompeius. Ctesias and Nicolaus
                    Damascenus give a different representation.</p>
                <p>It is stated by Loftus <hi rend="italic">(Chaldoea and Susιαna,</hi> p. 224) that

                    brother of Cyrus, a personage of whom we possess no historical notice

                <p>The only other, and the best known, king of this name is the elder son and
                    successor of Cyrus, who reigned over the Persian empire, according to Herodotus,
                    for seven years and five months—from 529 to 521 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    Of his proceedings before his famous invasion of Egypt little is known. 'To this
                    period we must now, on the authority of the Behistun inscription (i. 10), in
                    opposition to Herodotus (iii. 30), assign the secret murder of his brother,
                    Bardiya (the Smerdis, Merdis, Mardus, or Mergis of the Greeks,— called
                    Tanyoxarces by Ctesias, and Tanyoxares by Xenophon). Egypt at this time lay on
                    the borders of the Persian empire; its subjugation had long been an object of
                    ambition to the great Asiatic conquerors; it had recently provoked reprisals
                    from Persia by sending help to Lydia against Cyrus; and in resolving to attack
                    that country Cambyses was both carrying out the settled policy of his
                    predecessors and accomplishing the purpose of his own father. If therefore, as
                    is not unlikely, there was such an occasion given for the enterprise as that
                    which Herodotus relates, it is not necessary to suppose that this was more than
                    a pretext. A year or two were spent in collecting the forces of the empire, and
                    the preparatory measures taken seem to have been marked by prudence and skill. A
                    fleet of Phoenician and Greek ships was collected to operate against the vessels
                    of the Egyptians; and the help of an Arabian chief was secured to provide water
                    for the army in crossing the desert on the south and west of Palestine. The old
                    king of Egypt, Amasis, under whom the country had enjoyed a long period of peace
                    and prosperity, died a few months before the invasion, and was succeeded by his
                    son Psammenitus, under whom the measures of defence proved unsuccessful. An
                    obstinately contested but decisive victory was gained by the Persian arms near
                    Pelusium, and this was speedily followed up by the siege and capture of the
                    capital, Memphis, and by the subjugation of the whole country. The date of this
                    conquest is commonly regarded as 525 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (see
                    Rawlinson, <hi rend="italic">Anc. Mon.,</hi> vol. i. p. 385), though some find
                    cause to place it one or even two years earlier <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> v.

                <p>Henceforward the life and activity of Cambyses centred iu his new dominion. We
                    know from an important hieroglyphic inscription proceeding from a priest of
                    Neith at Sais, that he assumed the responsibilities and titles proper to a king
                    of Egypt, taking’ as his throne-name that of Ramesut. Moreover, it is evident
                    that for a time at least he cultivated the good-will of his new subjects. We
                    learn that he took Egyptians who had been officers of Psam-r.ιenitus into his
                    immediate service; that he sought instruction in regard to the rites of their
                    religion, and was initiated into certain of its mysteries; that he listened to
                    complaints in regard to the profanation of the temples by Persian and other
                    foreign soldiers, and gave orders for their removal from the sacred precincts;
                    that he secured the priests in the receipt of the temple*revenues, and arranged
                    for the due and continued celebration of the customary ceremonies and festivals.
                    A monument is still extant on which he is represented adoring, on bended knee,
                    the god Apis. (See De Rougé, <hi rend="italic">Mémoire sur la statue naopliore
                    du Vatican,</hi> passim; Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">op.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dt.</hi>, vol. i. pp. 266,∕.; Lauth, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> pp.
                    17,∕.) One act, indeed, of a different complexion is reported by Herodotus (iii.
                    16), viz., his outraging and finally consuming by fire the embalmed body of
                    Amasis,—an act, the historian assures us, which shocked the feelings alike of
                    Egyptians and of Persians, and which strongly attests the same jealous and
                    resentful temper which prompted the murder of his brother.</p>
                <p>After having established himself in his new possession, Cambyses, Herodotus (iii.
                    17, ∕.) informs us, planned three expeditions. One was against Carthage, in
                    regard to which, however, he was thwarted by the refusal of his Phoenician
                    mariners, who formed the principal portion of his sea-forces, to operate against
                    their kindred. Another was directed against the Oasis and temple of Jupiter
                    Ammon in the desert west of Egypt (see Heeren, <hi rend="italic">D.
                    afrikan.</hi><hi rend="italic">Völker,</hi> i. p. 416), the issue of which was
                    that the whole of the force sent on this enterprise, numbering, it is said,
                    50,000 men, perished in the sand. The third was intended for the subjugation of
                    the Ethiopians on the south of Egypt (regarding whose locality see Heeren, <hi
                    rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> i. pp. 337, ∕.; Rawlinson, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Herod.,</hi> vol. ii. p. 421; Maspero, <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    ancienne,</hi> pp. 533, ∕.), and of this Cambyses himself took the command. The
                    army, however, had marched less than a fifth of the distance when their
                    provisions failed, and they were reduced to the utmost straits,—even, it is
                    said, to cannibalism. Cambyses was thus forced to retrace his steps and to lead
                    back the remnant of his army to Egypt in disappointment and disgrace.</p>
                <p>Under the smart of this threefold discomfiture the conduct of Cambyses towards
                    the Egyptians assumed a new and much more stern and cruel aspect. The people of
                    Memphis were rejoicing on occasion of the discovery of a calf bearing the marks
                    of their god Apis, when he arrived there on his return from his unfortunate
                    expedition. Irritated by their apparent lack of sympathy, and misconstruing
                    their joy, he ordered some of the magistrates of the city to be put to death;
                    and what was still more fatal to his popularity, he commanded the newly-found
                    god to be led into his presence, and inflicted upon it with his dagger a mortal
                    wound. The epitaph of this unfortunate god “has been found by Μ. Mariette in the
                    Serapeum, and is now in the museum of the Louvre” (Lenormant, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manual of Anc. Hist.,</hi> vol. ii. p. 99). We hear also of his violating the
                    sepulchres of the Egyptians, and of his penetrating into the sanctuaries of
                    their gods, and making sport of the more grotesque images. According to
                    Herodotus, it seemed to the Egyptians that he had gone mad; and it is certain
                    that they retained the most gloomy recollections of this period of their
                    history. In the inscription already mentioned, drawn up while the Persians were
                    still supreme in the country, and therefore with due reserve and caution,
                    reference is made to the procedure of Cambyses in such language as the following
                    :—“There happened a calamity in this district along with the very great calamity
                    which befell the whole land;” “a frightful misfortune befell Egypt, the like of
                    which never occurred in this land” (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">op. dt.,</hi> i.
                    p. 271; Lauth, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 19, <hi rend="italic"
                    >cf.</hi> p. 49). It is, in all probability, the sense of this “frightful
                    misfortune ”—the keenness of feeling excited by the outrageous deeds of Cambyses
                    towards their gods—which led the Egyptians to allege that he was smitten with
                    frenzy, and to put in circulation some at least of the many stories relating to
                    his cruelty towards his own countrymen and relatives which Herodotus and others
                    report.</p>
                <p>After an absence from Persia of several years, Cambyses, having appointed
                    Aryandes, a Persian, governor of Egypt, set out on his homeward march. He was
                    met, according to Herodotus (iii. 64), at a place in Syria called Agbatana,
                    supposed by some to be Batanaea, or Bashan, by others to be Hamath, by the
                    tidings of the Median revolution, the usurpation of the sovereignty by Gomates,
                    the Magian, and the impersonation by the usurper of his own brother whom, as has
                    been noticed, he had caused to be secretly murdered. Springing hastily upon his
                    horse, his sword fell from the sheath and wounded him mortally in the thigh.
                    According <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n809/mode/1up"

                    of wood for his amusement These accounts agree in representing his death as
                    accidental A somewhat different impression is conveyed by the statement of
                    Darius on the point in the Behistun inscription (i. 11), who says that “killing
                    himself he died’ <hi rend="italic">(Of.</hi> Oppert, <hi rend="italic">Les

                    rend="italic">(Erαn. Alterthum.,</hi> ii. p. 302), that the phrase expresses
                    nothing more than the Greek tradition reports. Rawlinson, however <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anc. Mon.,</hi> iv. p. 394), and Duncker <hi rend="italic">(op.
                    cit.,</hi> ii. p. 801) understand it as meaning that he committed suicide. The
                    character of this king is sufficiently obvious. It is evident that he was an
                    impulsive, self-willed, reckless, ambitious despot, of the peculiarly Oriental
                    type, possessed of considerable ability as a general, but with passions so
                    strong and uncontrolled as to render the powers he possessed worthless for good.
                    It was reported that from his childhood he was liable to epilepsy and also, what
                    is probably more trustworthy, that he came to be much given to wine. By the
                    Egyptians he made himself utterly abhorred. By the Persians also, while they
                    acknowledged his success in enlarging their empire, his memory was held in evil
                    repute. While they called Cyrus a father, they called his son a despot or
                    master; and while they said the one was “gentle, and procured them all manner of
                    goods,” they called the other “harsh and reckless” (see Herodotus, iii. 33, 34,
                    89). In the Hebrew Scriptures, Cambyses appears once under the name of
                    Ahasuerus, in Ezra iv. 6 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Artaxerxes).</hi> Some
                    suppose that he is the “cruel lord” and “fierce king,” to whose hands the
                    Egyptians were to be given over, according to Isa. xix. 4 His name occurs in
                    Babylonian contract-tablets found at Warka, with the title “Cambyses, king of
                    Babylon.” (See Loftus, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 222; Bosanquet, <hi
                    rend="italic">Trans. Bib. Archaeology,</hi> i. pp. 210, ∕.) He is usually
                    regarded as the Lohrasp of Persian traditional history (Malcom, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist, of Persia,</hi> i. p. 334); but another of the heroes of
                    that cycle of romance, Kaus, appears both from the name and from the exploits
                    ascribed to him to be the true representative of Cambyses. <hi rend="italic"
