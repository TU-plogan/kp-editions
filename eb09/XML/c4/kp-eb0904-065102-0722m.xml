                    same name, in the arrondissement of Boulogne and the department of Pas de
                    Calais, 26 miles E.S.E. of Dover, and 185 miles by rail from Paris, in 50° 57'
                    45" N. lat., 1° 51' E. long. Calais is a fortress of the first class, and was
                    formerly a place of great strength, but it would now probably not be able to
                    defend itself long against modern artillery. It is built in a rectangular form,
                    having one of its longer sides towards the sea, while on the E. and S. it is
                    surrounded by low and marshy ground which can be flooded to strengthen its
                    defences. Overlooking the town on the W. is the citadel, erected in 1641 by
                    Cardinal</p>
                <p>Richelieu. In the centre of the town is the great marketplace, in which stands
                    the Hôtel de Ville (rebuilt in 1740, restored in 1867), with busts of Eustache
                    de St Pierre, the Due de Guise, and Cardinal Richelieu. Near the Hôtel de Ville
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Tour du</hi><hi rend="italic">guet,</hi> or
                    watch-tower, used as a lighthouse until 1848. The Church of Nôtre Dame was
                    almost entirely rebuilt at the end of the 15th century, during the English
                    occupancy of Calais; its lofty tower serves as a landmark for sailors. At the
                    end of the Rue de la Prison is the Hôtel de Guise, built as a guildhall for the
                    English woolstaplers. It was given to the Due de Guise as a reward for the
                    recapture of Calais, and hence its name. The building which was formerly the
                    Hôtel Dessin, immortalized by Sterne in the <hi rend="italic">Sentimental
                    Journey,</hi> is now used as a museum. The harbour of Calais is shallow,
                    admitting vessels of from 400 to 500 tons only at high water. The French
                    Government contemplates the construction of a large harbour of refuge near
                    Calais. There are two lighthouses at the entrance to the harbour, and a still
                    larger one on the fortifications, with a revolving light visible 20 miles off.
                    The principal institutions are the schools of design, hydrography, and
                    artillery, a public library with 10,000 volumes, and public baths. The imports
                    are chiefly from Great Britain, and consist of coal, iron, woollen and cotton
                    fabrics, linen, skins, machinery, and colonial produce. Of late years the
                    importation of timber <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n723/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0723-0652"/> from Norway has greatly increased. The exports
                    comprise corn, wine and spirits, eggs, silk, fruit, vegetables, glass, and
                    sugar. The fisheries are much less important than those of Boulogne. The
                    manufacture of <hi rend="italic">tulle</hi> or bobbin-net was introduced from
                    Nottingham by the English in 1818, and is one of the main sources of the
                    prosperity of the town and suburbs. Calais communicates with Great Britain by
                    submarine telegraph, laid down in 1851. Steamers carrying the mails cross twice
                    a day to Dover and back. It is the principal landing-place for English
                    travellers on the Continent. The number of passengers who crossed both ways was
                    208,432 in 1875, being an increase of 66 per cent, in the last ten years. The
                    terminus of the proposed tunnel beneath the channel is near Sangatte, a village
                    six miles west of Calais. The project has received the sanction of the French
                    and English Governments. Population (in 1872) 12,843; the adjoining
                    manufacturing suburb of St Pierre les Calais had 20,409 inhabitants in 1872,
                    more than 1800 of whom were English.</p>
                <p>Calais was a petty fishing-village, with a natural harbour at the mouth of a
                    stream, till the end of the 10th century. It was first improved by Baldwin IV.,
                    count of Flanders, in 997, and afterwards, in 1224, was regularly fortified by
                    Phillip of France, count of Boulogne. It was besieged in 1346, after the battle
                    of Crécy, by Edward III., and held out resolutely by the bravery of Jean de
                    Vienne, its governor, till famine forced it to surrender. Its inhabitants were
                    saved from the cruel fate with which Edward menaced them by the devotion of
                    Eustache de St Pierre and six of the chief citizens, who were themselves spared
                    at the prayer of Queen Philippa. The city remained in the hands of the English
                    till 1558, when it was taken by the duke of Guise at the head of 30,000 men,
                    from the ill-provided English garrison only 800 strong, after a siege of seven
                    days. It was held by the Spaniards from 1595 to 1598, but was restored to France
                    by the treaty of Vervins.</p>
