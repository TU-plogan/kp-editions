                    bucolic poet, under whose name eleven eclogues have been transmitted to us, is
                    interesting as the first imitator of Virgil in pastoral poetry, and from the
                    controversy respecting his date. His eclogues usually occur in MS. along with

                    under Carinus (284: A.D.), and hence he has been generally referred to the same
                    epoch. This view is expressed in a famous passage of Gibbon (ch. xii.), where
                    Calpurnius is cited as an authority for the spectacles exhibited with unusual
                    splendour by Cariuus. Gustavus Sarpe, in an ingenious disquisition published in
                    1819, first maintained that Calpurnius had lived as early as the reign of Nero;
                    his arguments have been repeated and greatly fortified by Moritz Haupt (1854),
                    and have convinced the most recent authorities, Teuffel, the latest and most
                    accurate historian of Latin literature, and Mr Pinder. This thesis would indeed
                    be untenable if the last four eclogues could be ascribed to Calpurnius, as they
                    contain manifest imitations of Statius. Haupt, however, seems to have proved
                    from internal evidence that they are the work of Nemesianus. Upon attentive
                    consideration, however, it appears to the present writer that Calpurnius cannot
                    have written either under Nero or under Carinus. 1. The first eclogue is
                    indirectly dedicated to a sovereign, complimented as the auspicious successor of
                    a lawless tyrant, by whom a large proportion of the senate had been executed or
                    imprisoned (ver. 60-62, 69-73). This censure is inapplicable to Carus, and the
                    compliment could in no case have been addressed to his son and successor
                    Carinus. It is almost equally inappropriate to Nero’s predecessor, Claudius, who
                    was popular with the senate (Suet, <hi rend="italic">in Claudio,</hi> 12, 46).
                    2. The accession of the new emperor is hailed as the termination of war <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ecl.</hi> i. ver. 46-50) and the harbinger of a durable peace (i.
                    54; iv. 127, 131, and other passages). But Nero’s accession took place at a
                    period of profound peace, and Carinus’s at one of extensive foreign hostilities.
                    3. Carinus cannot have been intended, inasmuch as no mention is made of his own
                    or his father’s military renown or of the association of his brother in the
                    empire; nor can he have been represented as favourable to the senate, which he
                    notoriously detested (Vopiscus <hi rend="italic">in Carino,</hi> c. 17). If, on
                    the other hand, the poet had written to celebrate the accession of Nero, he
                    would not have omitted to celebrate the then omnipotent Agrippina. 4.
                    Calpurnius’s description of the games in the amphitheatre <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ecl.</hi> 7) differs from the account of Vopiscus in the Augustan
                    history,—whatever is especially celebrated by the one being omitted by the
                    other. Calpurnius dwells wholly on the zoological, Vopiscus on the musical and
                    dramatic features of the entertainment; the former has not a word to say on the
                    <hi rend="italic">nova</hi><hi rend="italic">spectacula</hi> indicated by the
                    latter as the distinguishing features of the show—the thousand pantomimists, the
                    four hundred performers on wind instruments, the <hi rend="italic">ursi mimum
                    agentes.</hi> It may also be remarked that Calpurnius speaks of the amphitheatre
                    as looking down upon the Tarpeian rock, which, according to the preferable
                    opinion, was on the opposite side of the Capitoline hill to the Campus Martius,
                    where the games were exhibited by Nero ÍSuet. <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Nerone,</hi> 12).</p>
                <p>It remains, therefore, to discover an emperor to whom the panegyric of Calpurnius
                    can apply, whose predecessor should have been a scourge to his subjects in
                    general and to the senate in particular, and whose own accession at an early age
                    should have been hailed as a pledge of permanent tranquillity—one, moreover, who
                    should have exhibited public spectacles in the amphitheatre. All these
                    conditions are fulfilled by Gordian III., whose accession at the age of thirteen
                    or sixteen (238 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> closed a series of civil wars
                    and revolts which had proved fatal to six emperors, while the character of
                    Maximus, virtually his immediate predecessor, entirely corresponds to the
                    description of Calpurnius. Maximus’s ferocity had been chiefly indulged at the
                    expense of the senate (Capitolinus, <hi rend="italic">passim),</hi> and the
                    public relief at Gordian’s accession is significantly expressed by the great
                    preponderance of inscriptions celebrating the tranquillity, of which he was
                    regarded as the harbinger, among the legends of the medals struck during his
                    reign. Other medals attest the fact of his having exhibited wild beasts in the
                    Flavian amphitheatre (Gori, vol. iii. pp. 115-121). It may be added that the
                    imperial favourite upon whose patronage Calpurnius relies may be plausibly
                    identified with Timesitheus, Gordian’s virtuous minister and father-in-law; and
                    that the mention <hi rend="italic">(Ecl.</hi> i. 77-78) of the comet which
                    signalized the succession of the prince is illustrated by the appearance of a
                    comet in China, which would probably be visible in Italy, in September 238,
                    three months after Gordian’s proclamation as sole emperor. (Williams, <hi
                    rend="italic">Chinese Observations of Cornels,</hi> p. 21.) This comet continued
                    visible in China for forty-one days. Calpurnius’s statement that it had been
                    conspicuous for twenty days when he wrote enables us, if our hypothesis be
                    correct, to indicate the date of his literary <hi rend="italic">debut</hi> with
                    remarkable precision.</p>
                <p>In this case Calpurnius is not strictly entitled to the distinction of having led
                    the way in the bucolic imitation of Virgil,—fragments of two anonymous eclogues
                    having been recently discovered and published which undoubtedly belong to the
                    age of Nero. He is, however, Virgil’s first follower of any mark, and no
                    important modification has been introduced into his treatment. He is
                    unquestionably a skilful literary craftsman, a fair scholar and an apt courtier,
                    and not devoid of real poetical feeling. The bastard style of pastoral
                    cultivated by him, in which the description of nature is made the writer’s
                    pretext, while ingenious flattery is his real purpose, nevertheless excludes
                    genuine pleasure, and consequently genuine poetical achievement. He may be
                    fairly compared to the minor poets of the reign of Anne. No biographical
                    particulars respecting him are known except his complaints of his poverty.</p>
                <p>Calpurnius was first printed in 1471, together with Silius Italicus. He has been
                    frequently republished, generally in company with Gratius and Nemesianus. The
                    best edition is in vol. ii. of Wernsdorfs <hi rend="italic">Poetoe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Latini Minores.</hi> The most recent is that by Glaeser,
                    Göttingen, 1842. (R. G.)</p>
