                    organizations of Scotland, was formed in 1847 by the union of the United
                    Secession and Relief Churches (see below). The doctrinal standards are those of
                    the other Presbyterian churches of Scotland, and the formula employed at the
                    ordination of ministers is similar to that of the Established and Free Churches;
                    but adherence to the doctrinal standards is professed in view of the Declaratory
                    Act of 1879, according to which signatories “are not required to approve of
                    anything in the standards of the church which teaches or is supposed to teach
                    compulsory or persecuting and intolerant principles in religion,” and are
                    allowed freedom of opinion on all points which, in the judgment of the church,
                    do not enter into the substance of the faith. The denomination in 1887 consisted
                    of 32 presbyteries and 564 congregations (518 in 1847), with a total membership
                    of 182,063 (175,066 in 1878; 178,195 in 1883), thus representing about 14 per
                    cent, of the population of Scotland. The number of baptisms in 1886 was 9894;
                    there were 887 Sunday schools, with 11,994 teachers and 97,535 scholars, besides
                    788 advanced Bible classes, with 30,535 scholars. The total income of the church
                    in 1886 was £373,545 (average for ten years from 1877 to 1886, £375,660); of
                    this total £237,300 was ordinary congregational income, and £136,245 missionary
                    and benevolent income. The average stipend paid to each minister was £259, 16s.

                    1887-88) 114 students. The term of study is three years. The United Presbyterian
                    Church has missions in Jamaica (a synod with four presbyteries), Trinidad,
                    Kaffraria, Old Calabar, India, China, Japan, and Spain. The mission staff
                    consists of 60 ordained Europeans, 22 ordained natives, 8 medical missionaries,
                    3 European evangelists, and 19 female missionaries. Under these are 502 native
                    evangelists, teachers, and other helpers. In 1886 the membership of the native
                    congregations was 13,214 (10,215 in 1881). In Jamaica there is a theological
                    institution. At the end of 1875 the denomination had 620 congregations, with
                    190,242 members, but in June 1876 98 of its congregations in England, with
                    20,207 members, were incorporated with the English Presbyterian Church.</p>

                        Church.—</hi> The general causes which led to the first great secession from
                    the Church of Scotland as by law established in 1688 have already been briefly
                    indicated under <hi rend="smallcaps">Presbyterianism</hi> (see vol. xix. p. 685;

                    Assembly of 1732 which abolished the last remnant of popular election by
                    enacting that, in cases where patrons might neglect or decline to exercise their
                    right of presentation, the minister was to be chosen, not by the congregation,
                    but only by the elders and Protestant <pb break="no"

                    the Assembly, although the presbyteries to which it had been previously
                    submitted as an overture had disapproved of it by a large majority; and in
                    accordance with a previous Act (1730), which had taken away even the right of
                    complaint, the protests of the dissentient majority were refused. In the
                    following October Ebenezer <hi rend="smallcaps">Erskine</hi> (g ’.u), minister
                    of Stirling, who happened to be moderator of the synod of Perth and Stirling,
                    preached a synod sermon, in the course of which he took occasion to refer to the
                    Act in question as in his opinion unscriptural and unconstitutional.<note

                            was certainly unconstitutional; it was rescinded in 1734, “because not
                            made accordingto former Acts.”</p></note> Some of his expressions were
                    objected to by members of synod because “tending to disquiet the peace of the
                    church and impugning several Acts of Assembly and proceedings of church
                    judicatories,” and after long and keen debate it was resolved that he should be
                    censured for them. This judgment, on appeal, was affirmed by the Assembly in May
                    1733, whereupon Erskine protested to the effect that he held himself still at
                    liberty to teach the same truths and to testify against the same or similar
                    evils on every proper occasion. This protest, in which he was joined by William
                    Wilson, Alexander Moncrieff, and James Fisher, ministers at Perth, Abernethy,
                    and Kinclaven respectively, was regarded by the Assembly as contumacious, and
                    the commission of Assembly was ordered to procure its retractation or to proceed
                    to higher censures. In November accordingly the protesting ministers were
                    severed from their charges, their churches declared vacant, and all ministers of
                    the church prohibited from employing them in any ministerial function. They
                    replied by protesting that they still adhered to the principles of the church,
                    though now obliged to “make a secession from the prevailing party in
                    ecclesiastical courts,” maintaining their continued right to discharge all the
                    duties of the ministerial and pastoral office “according to the word of God, the
                    Confession of Faith, and the constitution of the church,” and appealing to the
                    “first free, faithful, and reforming General Assembly of the Church of
                    Scotland.” In December 1733 they formally constituted themselves into a
                    presbytery, but for some time their meetings were devoted almost entirely to
                    prayer and religious conference. In 1734 they published their first “testimony,”
                    with a statement of the grounds of their secession, which made prominent
                    reference to the doctrinal laxity of previous General Assemblies. In 1736 they
                    proceeded to exercise “judicial powers” as a church court, published a “judicial
                    testimony,” and began to organize churches in various parts of the country.
                    Having been joined by four other ministers, including the well-known Ralph
                    Erskine, they appointed Mr Wilson professor of divinity. For these acts
                    proceedings were again instituted against them in the Assembly, with the result
                    that, having disowned the authority of that body in an “act of declinature,”
                    they were in 1740 all deposed and ordered to be ejected from their churches.
                    Meanwhile the members of the “Associate Presbytery” and its adherents steadily
                    increased, until in 1745 there were forty-five congregations under its
                    jurisdiction, and it was reconstituted into an “Associate Synod.” A violent
                    controversy arose the same year respecting the religious clause of the oath
                    taken by burgesses in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Perth (“I profess and allow with
                    my heart the true religion presently professed within this realm and authorized
                    by the laws thereof ”), and resulted in April 1747 in a “breach,” when two
                    bodies were formed, each claiming to be the “Associate Synod”; those who
                    condemned the swearing of the burgess oath as sinful came to be popularly known
                    as “Antiburghers,” while the other party, who contended that abstinence from it
                    should not be made a term of communion, were designated “Burghers.” The
                    Antiburghers not only refused to hold further friendly conference with the
                    others, but ultimately went so far as to pass sentences of deposition and the
                    greater excommunication on the Erskines and other ministers who held the
                    opposing view.</p>
                <p>The Associate (Antiburgher) Synod held its first meeting in Edinburgh in the
                    house of Adam <hi rend="smallcaps">Gib</hi> (g.v.) on April 10, 1747. It grew
                    with considerable rapidity, and in 1788 had ninety-four settled charges in Great
                    Britain and nineteen in Ireland, besides a presbytery in America. For purposes
                    of organization it was formed in that year into four provincial synods, and took
                    the name of “The General Associate Synod.” The “new light” controversies as to
                    the province of the civil magistrate in matters of religion led to the
                    publication of a revised testimony in the “voluntary” sense in 1804, and in
                    consequence M <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> Crie, the historian of Knox, with
                    three other brethren, withdrew to form the Constitutional Associate
                    Presbytery.</p>
                <p>The Associate (Burgher) Synod held its first meeting at Stirling on June 16,
                    1747. The number of congregations under its charge rapidly increased, and within
                    thirty years there were presbyteries in connexion with it in Ireland and North
                    America, as well as throughout Scotland. In 1782 the American presbyteries took
                    the designation of the Associate Reformed Church in America. About the year 1795
                    the “voluntary” controversy respecting the power of the civil magistrate in
                    matters of religion arose within this synod also, and a large majority was found
                    to have adopted “new light’’ views. This led in 1799 to the secession of the
                    “Associate Presbytery,” which in 1805 took the designation of the Associate
                    Synod or Original Burgher Synod.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>The majority of this synod joined the Church of Scotland
                            in 1839. The small minority which still retained the name joined the
                            Original Seceders (see next note) in 1842, the resultant body assuming
                            the designation of United Original Seceders. A small majority
                            (twentyseven ministers in all) of the Synod of United Original Seceders
                            joined the Free Church in 1852. A synod of this name still exists,
                            having under its jurisdiction four presbyteries, with twenty-nine
                            charges (of which two are in Ireland).</p></note></p>
                <p>In 1820 the General Associate or Antiburgher Synod (to the number of 129

                            resultant body being called the Associate Synod of Original

                    Associate or Burgher Synod. The body thus constituted, “The United Secession
                    Church,” had increased by 1847 to 400 congregations, the whole of which united
                    in that year with the Relief Synod to form the United Presbyterian Church.</p>

                    constituted in 1761 by three ministers of the Church of Scotland, one of whom

                    the Assembly in 1752 for refusing to take part in the intrusion of unacceptable
                    ministers. The number of congregations under its charge increased with
                    considerable rapidity, and a Relief Synod was formed in 1773, which in 1847 had
                    under its jurisdiction 136 congregations; of these 118 united with the United
                    Secession Church in that year. The Relief Church issued no distinctive
                    “testimonies,” and a certain breadth of view was shown in the formal declaration
                    of their terms of communion, first made in 1773, which allowed occasional
                    communion with those of the Episcopal and Independent persuasion who are
                    “visible saints.” A Relief theological hall was instituted in 1824.</p>
