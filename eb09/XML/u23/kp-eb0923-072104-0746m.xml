                    in nature as a proximate component of <hi rend="smallcaps">Lapis Lazuli</hi>
                    (⅛.v.). Lapis lazuli has long been known as a precious stone, and highly valued
                    as such, and as early at least as the 11th century the art of extracting a blue
                    pigment from it was practised. From the beginning of the 16th century this
                    pigment began to be imported into Europe from “over the sea,” as <hi
                    rend="italic">azurrum ultramannum.</hi> To extract it, the stone, after having
                    been powdered coarsely, is heated to redness and thrown into cold water to
                    facilitate its conversion into a very fine powder, which is next treated with
                    dilute acetic acid to remove the carbonate of lime which is present in almost
                    all specimens. The insoluble blue residue is mixed up into a “dough” with a
                    composition of resin, pitch, and linseed oil, and this dough is then kneaded
                    under water, which is renewed as long as it runs off with a blue colour. The
                    blue liquor, when allowed to stand, deposits a fine precipitate, which is
                    collected, washed, dried, and sold as ultramarine. As the yield amounts to only
                    2 to 3 per cent, of the mineral used, it is not surprising to learn that the
                    pigment used to be weighed up with gold. It was valued chiefly on account of its
                    brilliancy of tone and its inertness in opposition to sunlight, oil, and slaked
                    lime (in fresco-painting).</p>

                <p>In 1814 Tassaer observed the spontaneous formation of a blue compound, very
                    similar to ultramarine, if not identical with it, in a soda-furnace at St
                    Gobain, which caused the “Société pour ΓEn-couragement d’Industrie” to offer a
                    prize for the artificial production of the precious colour. The problem was
                    solved almost simultaneously by Guimet and by Christian Gmelin, then professor
                    of chemistry in Tübingen; but while Guimet kept his process a secret (it has
                    indeed never become known) Gmelin published his, and thus became the originator
                    of an industry which flourishes to this day chiefly in Germany. There are very
                    few ultramarine works in other countries, and none, as far as we know, in Great
                    Britain. The raw materials used in the manufacture are—(1) iron-free kaolin, or
                    some other kind of pure clay, which should contain its silica and alumina as
                    nearly as possible in the proportion of 2SiO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>: A1
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> demanded by the
                    formula assigned to ideal kaolin (a deficit of silica, however, it appears can
                    be made up for by addition of the calculated weight of finely divided silica);
                    (2) anhydrous sulphate of soda; (3) anhydrous carbonate of soda; (4) sulphur (in
                    the state of powder); and (5) powdered charcoal or relatively ash-free coal, or
                    colophony in lumps. The numerous modes of manufacture may be viewed as
                    modifications or combinations of three processes.</p>
                <p>(1) In the <hi rend="italic">Nuremberg process</hi> the soda is used as sulphate,
                    or partly as such and partly as carbonate. The following recipe gives an idea of
                    the proportions in which the materials are used :—kaolin (calculated as
                    anhydrous matter) 100 parts; calcined sulphate of soda 83 to 100 (or 41 of
                    sulphate and 41 of carbonate); charcoal 17; powdered sulphur 13. These
                    ingredients are mixed most intimately; they are then rammed tight into fire-clay
                    crucibles and kept at a nearly white heat for 7 to 10 hours, access of air being
                    prevented as far as possible. The product obtained is a greyish or yellowish
                    green mass, which is soaked in and washed with water; the porous residue is
                    ground very fine in mills, again washed, dried, and again ground in the dry
                    state and passed through sieves. The product at this stage has a green colour,
                    and is sometimes sold as “green ultramarine,” although it has not a high
                    standing amongst green pigments. For its conversion into blue ultramarine it is
                    heated with sulphur in the presence of air to a relatively low temperature. Of
                    the various apparatus used for this important stage of the manufacture, the
                    easiest to describe is a large muffle, heated from the outside. On its floor the
                    green ultramarine is spread out to a depth of 2⅜ to 3 inches, and heated (with
                    closed doors) to a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n747/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0747-0722"/> temperature at which sulphur powder when thrown
                    in catches fire spontaneously. This temperature being maintained, a shovelful of
                    sulphur is thrown in and allowed to burn off while the mass is being constantly
                    agitated with iron rakers. Another dose of sulphur is then added, and so on
                    until a sample taken out is found to have come up to the highest attainable
                    brilliancy and depth of blue. The product is then lixiviated with water, which
                    removes a deal of sulphate of soda formed in the process; it is then ground up
                    very fine, and finally subjected to elutriation to produce a graduated series of
                    ultramarines of different degrees of fineness. In some works the process of
                    sulphuration is divided into two or more periods, after each of which the
                    product is washed, dried, and ground before being returned to the muffle to
                    produce a higher degree of homogeneity.</p>
                <p>(2) In the <hi rend="italic">carbonate of soda process</hi> the soda is used
                    solely, or at least principally, in the carbonate form. The following is one of
                    many recipes :—kaolin (calculated as anhydrous matter) 100; carbonate of soda
                    100; charcoal 12; sulphur 60. The mixture is heated in a reverberatory furnace
                    to form in the first instance a white mass, which is so porous that it readily
                    passes, by oxidation, into green and partly even into blue ultramarine. Green
                    ultramarine, saleable as such, cannot be produced in this manner. The half-blue
                    product is finished by sulphuration pretty much as explained above for the
                    Nuremberg process. Well-made soda-ash ultramarine has a richer colour than the
                    Nuremberg variety.</p>
                <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Silica ultramarine</hi> is soda-ash ultramarine in whose
                    preparation a quantity of finely divided silica, equal to 5 to 10 per cent, of
                    the weight of the kaolin, has been added. It is distinguished by a reddish
                    tinge, which is the more fully developed the greater the proportion of added
                    silica. It is more highly proof against the action of alum solution than
                    non-siliceous ultramarine is.</p>
                <p>Since 1873 the Nuremberg works have been producing four varieties of
                    magnificently violet ultramarine. The mode of manufacture has not transpired. At
                    the Paris Exhibition in 1867 a magnificent block of ultramarine exhibited by the
                    Kaiserslautern works attracted attention. In its manufacture the roasting
                    (blueing) process is said to have been continued for three weeks.</p>
                <p>Artificial, like natural, ultramarine has a magnificently blue colour, which is
                    not affected by light nor by contact with oil or lime as used in painting.
                    Hydrochloric acid, at once bleaches it with liberation of sulphuretted hydrogen
                    gas and milk of sulphur. The natural pigment is proof against dilute acetic acid
                    and solution of alum; the artificial pigment is even alum-proof only in a higher
                    or lower relative sense. Hence there is room for progress in one direction at
                    least. The composition of the pigment is quite similar to that of lapis lazuli;
                    but the constitution of both is still a chemical enigma. It is remarkable that
                    even a small addition of zinc-white (oxide of zinc) to the reddish varieties
                    especially causes a considerable diminution in the intensity of the colour,
                    while dilution with artificial precipitated sulphate of lime (“annalin ”) or
                    sulphate of baryta (<hi rend="superscript"> ft</hi> blanc fix ”) acts pretty
                    much as one would expect. Ultramarine being very cheap (it sells at 7d. to 10d.
                    per lb), it is largely used for wall painting, the printing of paper hangings
                    and calico, &amp;c., and also as a corrective for the yellowish tinge often
                    present in things meant to be white, such as linen, paper, &amp;c. Large
                    quantities are used in the manufacture of paper, and especially for producing
                    that kind of pale blue writing paper which is so popular in Great Britain. Only
                    the very finest ultramarine can be used for paper tinging, because the least
                    admixture of coarse particles becomes visible in the paper as dark spots or
                    stains.</p>
