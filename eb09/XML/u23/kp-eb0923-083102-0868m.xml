                    universities in their historical development, each being brought under notice,
                    as far as practicable, in the order of its original foundation. In the

                    mediaeval Latin term <hi rend="italic">universitas</hi> (from which the</p>
                <p>English word “university” is derived) was originally employed to denote any
                    community or corporation regarded under its collective aspect. When used in its
                    modern sense, as denoting a body devoted to learning and education, it required
                    the addition of other -words in order to complete the definition,—the most
                    frequent form of expression being “universitas magistrorum et scholarium” (or
                    “discipulorum ”). In the course of time, probably towards the latter part of the
                    14th century, the term began to be used by itself, with the exclusive meaning of
                    a community of teachers and scholars whose corporate existence had been
                    recognized and sanctioned by civil or ecclesiastical authority or by both. But
                    the more ancient and customary designation of the university in mediaeval times
                    (regarded as a place of instruction) was “studium generale” (or sometimes
                    “studium” alone), a term implying a centre of instruction for all.<note

                    collegium” are also occasionally to be met with in official documents.</p>
                <p>It is necessary, however, to bear in mind, on the one hand, that a university
                    often had a vigorous virtual existence long before it obtained that legal
                    recognition which entitled it, technically, to take rank as a “studium
                    generale,” and, on the other hand, that hostels, halls, and colleges, together
                    with complete courses in all the recognized branches of learning, were by no
                    means necessarily involved in the earliest conception of a university. The
                    university, in its earliest stage of development, appears to have been simply a
                    scholastic guild,—a spontaneous combination, that is to say, of teachers or
                    scholars, or of both combined, and formed probably on the analogy of the trades
                    guilds, and the guilds of aliens in foreign cities, which, in the course of the
                    13th and 14th centuries, are to be found springing up in most of the great
                    European centres. The design of these organizations, in the first instance, was
                    little more than that of securing mutual protection,—for the craftsman, in the
                    pursuit of his special calling,—for the alien, as lacking the rights and
                    privileges inherited by the citizen. And so the university, composed as it was
                    to a great extent of students from foreign countries, was a combination formed
                    for the protection of its members from the extortion of the townsmen and the
                    other annoyances incident in mediaeval times to residence in a foreign state. It
                    was a first stage of development in connexion with these primary organizations,
                    when the chancellor of the cathedral, or some other authority, began, as we
                    shall shortly see, to confer on their masters the right of teaching at any
                    similar centre that either already existed or might afterwards be formed
                    throughout Europe,—“facultas ubique docendi.” It was a still further development
                    when it began to be recognized that, without a licence from either pope,
                    emperor, or king, no “studium generale” could be formed possessing this right of
                    conferring degrees, which originally meant nothing more than licences to
                    teach.</p>
                <p>In order, however, clearly to understand the conditions under which the earliest
                    universities came into existence, it is necessary to take account, not only of
                    their organization, but also of their studies, and to recognize the main
                    influences which, from the 6th to the 12th century, served to modify both the
                    theory and the practice of education. In the former century, the schools of the
                    Roman empire, which had down to that time kept alive the traditions of pagan
                    education, had been almost entirely swept away by the barbaric invasions. The
                    latter century marks the period when the institutions which supplied their
                    place— the episcopal schools attached to the cathedrals and the monastic
                    schools—attained to their highest degree of influence and reputation. Between
                    these and the schools of the empire there existed an essential difference, in
                    that the theory of education by which they were pervaded was in complete
                    contrast to the simply secular theory of the schools of paganism. The cathedral
                    school taught only what was supposed to be necessary for the education of the
                    priest; the monastic school taught only what was supposed to be in harmony with
                    the aims of the monk. But between the pagan system and the Christian system by
                    which it had been superseded there yet existed something<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n869/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0869-0832"/> that was common to both: the latter, even in the
                    narrow and meagre instruction which it imparted, could not altogether dispense
                    with the ancient text-books, simply because there were no others in existence.
                    Certain treatises of Aristotle, of Porphyry, of Martianus Capella, and of
                    Boetius continued consequently to be used and studied; and in the slender
                    outlines of pagan learning thus still kept in view, and in the exposition which
                    they necessitated, we recognize the main cause which prevented the thought and
                    literature of classic antiquity from falling altogether into oblivion.</p>
                <p>Under the rule of the Merovingian dynasty even these scanty traditions of
                    learning declined throughout the Frankish dominions; but in England the designs
                    of Gregory the Great, as carried out by Theodorus, Bede, and Alcuin, resulted in
                    a great revival of education and letters. The influence of this revival extended
                    in the 8th and 9th centuries to Frankland, where Charles the Great, advised and
                    aided by Alcuin, effected a memorable reformation, which included both the
                    monastic and the cathedral schools; while the school attached to the imperial
                    court, known as the Palace School, also became a famous centre of learned
                    intercourse and instruction.</p>
                <p>But the activity thus generated, and the interest in learning which it served for
                    a time to diffuse, well nigh died out amid the anarchy which characterizes the
                    10th century in Latin Christendom, and it is at least questionable whether any
                    real connexion can be shown to have existed between this earlier revival and
                    that remarkable movement in which the university of Paris had its origin. On the
                    whole, however, a clearly traced, although imperfectly continuous, succession of
                    distinguished teachers has inclined the majority of those who have studied this
                    obscure period to conclude that a certain tradition of learning, handed down
                    from the famous school over which Alcuin presided at the great abbey of St
                    Martin at Tours, continued to survive, and became the nucleus of the teaching in
                    which the university took its rise. But, in order adequately to explain the
                    remarkable development and novel character which that teaching assumed in the
                    course of the 12th and 13th centuries, it is necessary to take account of the
                    operation of certain more general causes to which the origin of the great
                    majority of the earlier universities may in common unhesitatingly be referred.
                    These causes are—(1) the introduction of new subjects of study, as embodied in a
                    new or revived literature; (2) the adoption of new methods of teaching which
                    were rendered necessary by the new studies; (3) the growing tendency to
                    organization which accompanied the development and consolidation of the European
                    nationalities.</p>
                <p>That the earlier universities took their rise to a great extent in endeavours to
                    obtain and provide instruction of a kind beyond the range of the monastic and
                    cathedral schools appears to be very generally admitted, and this general fact
                    has its value in assisting us to arrive at a conclusion with respect to the
                    origin of the first European university,—that of Salerno in Italy, which became
                    known as a school of medicine as early as the 9th century. The circumstances of
                    its rise are extremely obscure, and whether it was monastic or secular in its
                    origin has been much disputed. One writer<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    independent tradition of classical learning which continued to exist in Italy
                    down to the 10th century. Another writer<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    >della</hi><hi rend="italic">Medicina,</hi> i. 317-326.</p></note> maintains
                    that it had its commencement in the teaching at the famous Benedictine monastery
                    of Monte Cassino, where the study of medicine was undoubtedly pursued. But
                    various facts may be urged in contraven tion of such a theory. The school at
                    Salerno, so far as its history can be traced, appears to have been entirely a
                    secular community; it was distinguished also by its catholic spirit, and, at a
                    time when Jews were the object of religious persecution throughout Europe,
                    members of this nationality were to be found both as teachers and learners at
                    Salerno. Situated, moreover, as it was on the seacoast, its communication with
                    the neighbouring island of Sicily was easy and frequent; and it would
                    accordingly seem far more probable that it was owing to the new knowledge gained
                    from the Saracens, after their occupation of that island, that Salerno acquired
                    its reputation. It was by a band of these invaders that Bertharius, abbot of
                    Monte Cassino, and the author of certain medical treatises, was massacred along
                    with his monks in the year 883. The Saracens were famed for their medical skill,
                    and, by their translations of Galen and Hippocrates, did much to advance the
                    study; and, according to Jourdain,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the time of Constantine the African, but these versions have perished. In the
                    course of the 11th century, under the teaching of Constantine the African (d.
                    1087), the celebrity of Salerno became diffused all over Europe. Ordericus
                    Vitalis, who wrote in the first half of the 12th century, speaks of it as then
                    long famous. In 1231 it was constituted by the emperor Frederick II. the only
                    school of medicine in the kingdom of Naples.</p>
                <p>It was at a considerable interval after the rise of the school at Salerno, about
                    the year 1113, that Irnerius commenced at Bologna his lectures on the civil law.
                    This instruction, again, was of a kind which the monastic and cathedral schools
                    could not supply, and it also met a new and pressing want. The states of
                    Lombardy were at this time rising rapidly in population and in wealth; and the
                    greater complexity of their political relations, their increasing manufactures
                    and commerce, called for a more definite application of the principles embodied
                    in the codes that had been handed down by Theodosius and Justinian. But the
                    distinctly secular character of this new study, and its intimate connexion with
                    the claims and prerogatives of the Western emperor, aroused at first the
                    susceptibilities of the Roman see, and for a time Bologna and its civilians were
                    regarded by the church with distrust and even with alarm. These sentiments were
                    not, however, of long duration. In the year 1151 the appearance of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Decretum</hi> of Gratian, largely compiled from spurious
                    documents, invested the studies of the canonist with fresh importance; and
                    numerous decrees of past and almost forgotten pontiffs now claimed to take their
                    stand side by side with the enactments contained in the <hi rend="italic">Corpus
                    Juris</hi><hi rend="italic">Civilis.</hi> They constituted, in fact, the main
                    basis of those new pretensions asserted with so much success by the popedom in
                    the course of the 12th and 13th centuries. It was necessary, accordingly, that
                    the <hi rend="italic">Decreturn</hi> should be known and studied beyond the
                    walls of the monastery or the episcopal palace, and that its pages should
                    receive authoritative exposition at some common centre of instruction. Such a
                    centre was to be found in Bologna. The needs of the secular student and of the
                    ecclesiastica! student were thus brought for a time into accord, and from the
                    days of Irnerius down to the close of the 13th century we have satisfactory
                    evidence that Bologna was generally recognized as the chief school both of the
                    civil and the canon law.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    his forces into Italy on his memorable expedition of 1155, and reasserted those
                    imperial claims which had so long lain dormant, the professors of the civil law
                    and their scholars, but more especially the foreign students, gathered round the
                    Western representative of the Roman Caesars, and besought his intervention in
                    their favour in their relations with the citizens of Bologna. A large proportion
                    of the students were probably from Germany; and it did not escape Frederick’s
                    penetration that the civilian might prove an invaluable ally in the assertion of
                    his imperial pretensions. He received the suppliants graciously, and, finding
                    that their grievances were real, especially against the landlords in whose
                    houses they were domiciled, he granted the foreign students substantial
                    protection, by conferring on them certain special immunities and privileges

                    discern the precedent for that state protection of the university which, however
                    essential at one time for the security and freedom of the teacher and the
                    taught, has been far from proving an unmixed benefit,— the influence which the
                    civil power has thus been able to exert being too often wielded for the
                    suppression of that very liberty of thought and inquiry from which the earlier
                    universities derived in no small measure their importance and their fame.</p>
                <p>But, though there was a flourishing school of study, it is to be observed that
                    Bologna did not possess a university so early as 1158. Its first university was
                    not constituted until the close of the 12th century. The “universities” at
                    Bologna were, as Denifle has shown, really student guilds, formed under
                    influences quite distinct from the protecting clauses of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Authentica,</hi> and suggested, as already noted, by the precedent of those
                    foreign guilds which, in the course of the 12th century, began to rise
                    throughout western Europe. They had their origin in the absolute necessity,
                    under which residents in a foreign city found themselves, of obtaining by
                    combination that protection and those rights which they could not claim as
                    citizens. These societies were modelled, Denifle considers, not on the trade
                    guilds which rose in Bologna in the 13 th century, but on the Teutonic guilds
                    which arose nearly a century earlier in north-western Europe, being essentially
                    “spontaneous confederations of aliens on a foreign soil.” Originally, they did
                    not include the native student element.</p>
                <p>The power resulting from this principle of combination, when superadded to the
                    privileges conferred by Barbarossa, gave to the students of Bologna a
                    superiority of which they were not slow to avail themselves. Under the
                    leadership of their rector, they extorted from the citizens concessions which
                    raised them from the condition of an oppressed to that of a specially privileged
                    class. The same principle, when put in force against the professors, reduced the
                    latter to a position of humble deference to the very body whom they were called
                    upon to instruct, and imparted to the entire university that essentially
                    democratic character by which it was afterwards distinguished. It is not
                    surprising that such advantages should have led to an imitation and extension of
                    the principle by which they were obtained. Denifle considers that the
                    “universities” at Bologna were at one time certainly more than four in number,
                    and we know that the Italian students alone were subdivided into two,—the
                    Tuscans and the Lombards. In the centres formed by secession from the parent
                    body a like subdivision took place. At Vercelli there were four “universitates,”
                    composed respectively of Italians, English, Provençale, and Germans; at Padua
                    there were similar divisions into Italians, French <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,
                    Francigenae,</hi> comprising both English and Normans), Provençale (including
                    Spaniards and Catalans). When accordingly we learn from Odofred that in the time
                    of the eminent jurist Azo, who lectured at Bologna about 1200, the number of the
                    students there amounted to some ten thousand, of whom the majority were
                    foreigners, it seems reasonable to conclude that the number of these
                    confederations of students (“societates scholarium ”) at Bologna was yet
                    greater. It is certain that they were not formed simultaneously, but, similarly
                    to the free guilds, one after the other,—the last in order being that of the
                    Tuscans, which was composed of students from Tuscany, the Campagna, and Rome.
                    Nor are we, again, to look upon them as in any way the outcome of those
                    democratic principles which found favour in Bologna, but rather as originating
                    in the traditional home associations of the foreign students, fostered, however,
                    by the peculiar conditions of their university life. As the Tuscan division (the
                    one least in sympathy, in most respects, with Teutonic institutions) was the
                    last formed, so, Denifle conjectures, the German “university” may have
                    introduced the conception which was successively adopted by the other
                    nationalities.</p>
                <p>In marked resemblance to the guilds, these confederations were presided over by a
                    common head,—the “rector scholarium,” an obvious imitation of the “rector
                    societatum” or “artium” of the guild, but to be carefully distinguished from the
                    “rector scholarum,” or director of the studies, with whose function the former
                    officer had, at this time, nothing in common. Like the guilds, again, the
                    different nations were represented by their “consiliarii,” a deliberative
                    assembly with whom the rector habitually took counsel.</p>
                <p>While recognizing the essentially democratic character of the constitution of
                    these communities, it is to be remembered that the students, unlike the majority
                    at Paris and later universities, were mostly at this time of mature years. As
                    the civil law and the canon law were at first the only branches of study, the
                    class whom they attracted were often men already filling office in some
                    department of the church or state,—archdeacons, the heads of schools, canons of
                    cathedrals, and like functionaries forming a considerable element in the
                    aggregate. It has been observed, indeed, that the permission accorded them by
                    Frederick I. of choosing, in all cases of dispute, their own tribunal, thus
                    constituting them, to a great extent, <hi rend="italic">sui juris,</hi> seems to
                    presuppose a certain maturity of judgment among those on whom this discretionary
                    power was bestowed.</p>
                <p>With the middle of the 13th century, these various confederations became blended,
                    for the first time, into one or other of the two great divisions already
                    referred to,—those of theUltramontani and the Citramontani, JohannesdeVaranis
                    being rector of the former and Pantaleon de Venetiis of the latter. Innocent
                    IV., in according his sanction to the new statutes of the university in 1253,
                    refers to them as drawn up by the “rectores et universitas scholarium
                    Bononiensium.” With the commencement of the 16th century, the two corporations
                    were combined under one rector.</p>
                <p>About the year 1200 were formed the two faculties of medicine and philosophy (or

                    of the civil 1aw had been developed, by a succession of able teachers, among
                    whom Thaddeus Alderottus was especially eminent. The faculty of arts, down to
                    the 14th century, scarcely attained to equal eminence. The teaching of theology
                    remained for a long time exclusively in the hands of the Dominicans; and it was
                    not until the year 1360 that Innocent VI. recognized the university as a
                    “studium generale” in this branch,—in other words, as a place of theological
                    education for all students, with the power of conferring degrees of universal
                    validity.</p>
                <p>In the year 1371 the cardinal legate, Anglicus, compiled, as chief director of
                    ecclesiastical affairs in the city, an account of the university, which he
                    presented to Urban V. The information it supplies is, however, defective, owing
                    to the fact that only the professors who were in receipt of salaries from the
                    municipality are mentioned. Of these there were twelve of civil law and six of
                    canon law; three of medicine, three of practical medicine, and one of surgery;
                    two of logic, and one each of astrology, rhetoric, and notarial practice. The
                    professors of theology, who, as members of the religious orders, received no
                    state remuneration, are unmentioned.</p>
                <p>Colleges existed at Bologna at a very early date, but it is not until the 14th
                    century that we find them possessing any organization. They were designed solely
                    for necessitous students, not being natives of Bologna. A separate house, with a
                    certain fund for the maintenance of a specified number of scholars, was all that
                    was originally contemplated. Such was the character of that founded by Zoen,
                    bishop of Avignon, in February 1256 (O.S.), the same month and year, it is to be
                    noted, in which the Sorbonne was founded in Paris. It was designed for the
                    maintenance of eight scholars from the province of Avignon, under the
                    supervision of three canons of the church, maintaining themselves in the
                    university. Each scholar was to receive 24 Bolognese lire annually for five
                    years. The college of Brescia was founded in 1326 by William of Brescia,
                    archdeacon of Bologna, for poor foreign students without distinction as to
                    nationality. The Spanish college, founded in 1364, for twenty-four Spanish
                    scholars and two chaplains, is noted by Denifle as the one college founded in
                    mediaeval times which still exists on the Continent.</p>
                <p>Of the general fact that the early universities rose in response to new wants the
                    commencement of the university of Paris supplies us with a further illustration.
                    The study of logic, which, prior to the 12th century, was founded exclusively on
                    one or two meagre compends, received about the year 1100, on two occasions, a
                    powerful stimulus,—in the first instance, from the memorable controversy between
                    Lanfranc and Berengar; in the second, from the no less famous controversy
                    between Anselm and Roscellinus. A belief sprang up that an intelligent
                    apprehension of spiritual truth depended on a correct use of prescribed methods
                    of argumentation. Dialectic was looked upon as “the science of sciences”; and,
                    when, somewhere in the first decade of the 12th century, William of Champeaux
                    opened in Paris a school for the more advanced study of dialectic as an art, his
                    teaching was attended with marked success. Among his pupils was Abelard, in
                    whose hands the study made a yet more notable advance; so that, by the middle of
                    the century, we find John of Salisbury, on returning from the French capital to
                    England, relating with astonishment, not unmingled with contempt, how all
                    learned Paris had gone well nigh mad in its pursuit and practice of the new
                    dialectic.</p>
                <p>Abelard taught in the first instance at the cathedral school at Notre Dame, and
                    subsequently at the schools on the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève, of which he was
                    the founder, and where he imparted to 1ogic its new development. But in 1147 the
                    secular canons of Ste Genevieve gave place to canons regular from St Victor; and
                    henceforth the school on the former foundation was merely a school for the
                    teaching of theology, and was attended only by the members of the house.<note

                    arose out of a combination of these several schools is rejected by Denifle (see

                    >kc.,</hi> i. 653-694).</p></note> The schools out of which the university arose
                    were those attached to the cathedra! on the île de la Cité, and presided over by
                    the chancellor, —a dignitary who must be carefully distinguished from the later
                    chancellor of the university. For a long time the teachers lived in separate
                    houses on the island, and it was only by degrees that they combined themselves
                    into a society, and that special buildings were constructed for their
                    class-work. But the flame which Abelard’s teaching had kindled was not destined
                    to expire. Among his pupils was Peter Lombard, who was bishop of Paris in 1159,
                    and widely known to posterity as the compiler of the famous volume of the <hi

                    Conceived with the purpose of allaying and preventing, it really stimulated,
                    controversy. The logicians seized upon it as a great storehouse of indisputable
                    major premises, on which they argued with renewed energy and with endless
                    ingenuity of dialectical refinement; and upon this new compendium of theological
                    doctrine, which became the text-book of the Middle Ages, the schoolmen, in their
                    successive treatises <hi rend="italic">super</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sententias,</hi> expended a considerable share of that subtlety and labour
                    which still excite the astonishment of the student of metaphysical
                    literature.</p>
                <p>It is in these prominent features in the history of these early universities—the
                    development of new methods of instruction concurrently with the appearance of
                    new material for their application—that we find the most probable solution of
                    the question as to how the university, as distinguished from the older cathedral
                    or monastic schools, was first formed. In a similar manner, it seems probable,
                    the majority of the earlier universities of Italy— Reggio, Modena, Vicenza,
                    Padua, and Vercelli—arose, for they had their origin independently alike of the
                    civil and the papal authority. Instances, it is true, occur, which cannot be
                    referred to this spontaneous mode of growth. The university of Naples, for
                    example, was founded solely by the fiat of the emperor Frederick II. in the year
                    1224; and, if we may rely upon the documents cited by Denifle, Innocent IV.

                    Charles the Great accompanied that monarch on his progresses.</p>
                <p>As the university of Paris became the model, not only for the universities of
                    France north of the Loire, but also for the great majority of those of central
                    Europe as well as for Oxford and Cambridge, some account of its early
                    organization will here be indispensable. Such an account is rendered still
                    further necessary by the fact that the recent and almost exhaustive researches
                    of Denifle, the Dominican father, have led him to conclusions which on some
                    important points run altogether counter to those sanctioned by the high
                    authority of Savigny.</p>
                <p>The original university, as already stated, took its rise entirely out of the

                    conferred by the chancellor of the cathedral. In the second decade of the 13th
                    century, it is true, we find masters withdrawing themselves from his authority
                    by repairing to the left bank of the Seine and placing themselves under the
                    jurisdiction of the abbot of the monastery of Ste Geneviève; and in <hi

                    were desirous of opening schools in that district. But it was around the
                    bestowal of this licence by the chancellor of Notre Dame, on the île de la Cité,
                    that the university of Paris grew up. It is in this licence that the whole

                    for</hi> what is technically known as admission to that degree was really

                    commencement of, the functions of a duly licensed teacher, and his recognition
                    as such by his brothers in the profession. The previous stage of his academic
                    career, that of bachelordom, had been one of apprenticeship for the mastership;
                    and his emancipation from this state was symbolized by placing the magisterial
                    cap <hi rend="italic">(biretta)</hi> upon his head, a ceremony which, in
                    imitation of the old Roman ceremony of manumission, was performed by his former
                    instructor, “under whom” he was said to incept. He then gave a formal inaugural
                    lecture, and, after this proof of magisterial capacity, was welcomed into the
                    society of his professional brethren with set speeches, and took his seat in his
                    master’s chair.</p>
                <p>This community of teachers of recognized fitness did not in itself suffice to
                    constitute a university, but some time between the years 1150 and 1170, the
                    period when the <hi rend="italic">Sentences</hi> of Peter Lombard were given to
                    the world, the university of Paris came formally into being. Its first written
                    statutes were not, however, compiled until about the year 1208, and it was not
                    until long after that date that it possessed a “rector.” Its earliest
                    recognition as a legal corporation belongs to about the year 1211, when a brief
                    of Innocent III. empowered it to elect a proctor to be its representative at the
                    papal court. By this permission it obtained the right to sue or to be sued in a
                    court of justice as a corporate body.</p>
                <p>This papal recognition was, however, very far from implying the episcopal
                    recognition, and the earlier history of the new community exhibits it as in
                    continual conflict alike with the chancellor, the bishop, and the cathedral
                    chapter of Paris, by all of whom it was regarded as a centre of insubordination
                    and doctrinal licence. Had it not been, indeed, for the papal aid, the
                    university would probably not have survived the contest; but with that powerful
                    assistance it came to be regarded as the great Transalpine centre of orthodox
                    theological teaching. Successive pontiffs, down to the great schism of 1378,
                    made it one of the foremost points of their policy to cultivate friendly and
                    confidential relations with the authorities of the university of Paris, and
                    systematically to discourage the formation of theological faculties at other
                    centres. In 1231 Gregory IX., in the bull <hi rend="italic">Parens</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Scientiarum,</hi> gave full recognition to the right of the
                    several faculties to regulate and modify the constitution of the entire
                    university,—a formal sanction which, in Denifle’s opinion, rendered the bull in
                    question the Magna Charta of the university.</p>
                <p>In comparing the relative antiquity of the universities of Paris and Bologna, it
                    is difficult to give an unqualified decision. The university of masters at the
                    former was probably slightly anterior to the university of students at the
                    latter; but there is good reason for believing that Paris, in reducing its
                    traditional customs to statutory form, largely availed itself of the precedents
                    afforded by the already existing code of the Transalpine centre, while its
                    rectorship, proctorships, and four “nations” are all clearly distinct
                    adaptations of the corresponding divisions at Bologna. These nations, which
                    included both professors and scholars, were—(1) the French nation, composed, in
                    addition to the native element, of Spaniards, Italians, and Greeks; (2) the
                    Picard nation, representing the students from the north-east and from the
                    Netherlands; (3) the Norman nation; (4) the English nation, comprising, besides
                    students from the provinces under English rule, those from England, Ireland,
                    Scotland, and Germany. These several nations first came into existence some time
                    before the year 1219, and all belonged to the faculty of arts; but the fully
                    developed university was divided into four faculties,—three “superior,” viz.,
                    those of theology, canon law, and medicine, and one “inferior,” that of arts.
                    The head of each faculty was the dean; the head of each nation was the proctor.
                    The rector, who in the first instance was head of the faculty of arts, by whom
                    he was elected, was eventually head of the whole university. Each of the nations
                    and each of the superior faculties, while subject to the general authority which
                    he represented, was, like a royal colony, in a great measure self-governed, and
                    made statutes which were binding simply on its own members. Congregations of the
                    faculty of arts were presided over by the rector, who discharged the same
                    function when general congregations of the whole academic community were
                    convened. In the former the votes on any question were taken by nations, in the
                    latter by faculties and nations. Only “regents,” that is, masters actually
                    engaged in teaching, had any right to be present or to vote in congregations.
                    Neither the entire university nor the separate faculties had thus, it will be
                    seen, originally a common head, and it was not until the middle of the 14th
                    century that the rector became the head of the collective university, by the
                    incorporation under him, first, of the stuαents of the canon law and of medicine
                    (which took [dace about the end of the 13th century), and, secondly, of the
                    theologians, which took place about half a century later.</p>
                <p>Apart from the broad differences in their organization, the very conception of
                    learning, it will be observed, was different at Bologna from what it was at
                    Paris. In the former it was entirely professional,—designed, that is to say, to
                    prepare the student for a definite and practical career in after life; in the
                    latter it was sought to provide a general mental training, and to attract the
                    learner to studies which were speculative rather than practical. In the sequel,
                    the less mercenary spirit in which Paris cu1ti-vated knowledge added immensely
                    to her influence and reputation. The university became known as the great school
                    where theology was studied in its most scientific spirit; and the decisions of
                    its great doctors upon those abstruse questions which absorbed so much of the
                    highest intellectual activity of the Middle Ages were regarded as almost final.
                    The popes themselves, although averse from theological controversies, deemed it
                    expedient to cultivate friendly relations with a centre of such importance for
                    the purpose of securing their influence in a yet wider field. Down therefore to
                    the time of the great schism (1378), they at once conciliated the university of
                    Paris and consulted w hat they deemed to be the interests of the Roman see, by
                    discouraging the creation of faculties of theology elsewhere. The apparent
                    exceptions to this policy are easily explained: the four faculties of theology
                    which they sanctioned in Italy—Pisa (1343), Florence (1349), Bologna (1362), and
                    Padua (1363)—were designed to benefit the Italian monasteries, by saving the
                    monks the expense and dangers of a long journey beyond the Alps; while that at
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n873/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0873-0836"/> Toulouse (1229) took its rise under circumstances
                    entirely exceptional, being designed as a bulwark against the heresy of the
                    Albigenses. The popes, on the other hand, favoured the creation of new faculties
                    of law, and especially of the canon law, as the latter represented the source
                    from which Rome derived her most warmly contested powers and prerogatives. The
                    effects of this twofold policy were sufficiently intelligible: the withholding
                    of each charter which it was sought to obtain for a new school of theology only
                    served to augment the numbers that flocked to Paris; the bestowal of each new
                    charter for a faculty of law served in like manner to divert a certain
                    proportionate number from Bologna. These facts enable us to understand how it is
                    that, in the 13th and 14th centuries, we find, even in France, a larger number
                    of universities created after the model of Bologna than after that of Paris.</p>
                <p>In their earliest stage, however, the importance of these new institutions was
                    but imperfectly discerned alike by the civil and the ecclesiastical power, and
                    the first four universities of Italy, after Bologna, rose into existence, like
                    Bologna itself, without a charter from either pope or emperor. Of these the
                    first were those of Reggio and Modena, both of which are to be found mentioned
                    as schools of civil law before the close of the 12th century. The latter,
                    throughout the 13th century, appears to have been resorted to by teachers of
                    sufficient eminence to form a flourishing school, composed of students not only
                    from the city itself, but also from a considerable distance. Both of them would
                    seem to have been formed independently of Bologna, but the university of Vicenza
                    was probably the outcome of a migration of the students from the former city,
                    which took place in the year 1204. In the course of the century Vicenza attained
                    to considerable prosperity; its students were divided into four nations, each
                    with its own rector; and in 1264 it included in its professoriate teachers, not
                    only of the civil law, but also of medicine, grammar, and dialectic. The
                    university of Padua was founded in 1222 as the direct result of the migration of
                    a considerable number of students from Bologna. Some writers, indeed, have
                    inferred that the “studium” in the latter city was transferred in its entirety,
                    but the continued residence of a certain proportion in Bologna is proved by the
                    fact that two years later we find them appealing to Honorius III. in a dispute
                    with the civic authorities. In the year 1228 the students of Padua were
                    compelled by circumstances to transfer their residence to Vercelli, and the
                    latter city guaranteed them, besides other privileges, the right to rent no less
                    than five hundred lodging-houses at a fixed rental for a period of eight years.
                    At first Padua was a school only of the civil and canon law; and during the
                    oppressive tyranny of Ezzelin (1237-1260) the university maintained its
                    existence with some difficulty. But in the latter part of the century it
                    incorporated the faculties of grammar, rhetoric, and medicine, and became known
                    as one of the most flourishing schools of Italy, and a great centre of the
                    Dominicans, at that time among the most active promoters of learning.</p>
                <p>The university of Naples was founded by the emperor Frederick II. in the year
                    1225, as a school of theology, jurisprudence, the arts, and medicine,—his design
                    being that his subjects in the kingdom of Naples should find in the capital
                    adequate instruction in every branch of learning, and “not be compelled in the
                    pursuit of knowledge to have recourse to foreign nations or to beg in other
                    lands.” In the year 1231, however, he decreed that the faculty of medicine
                    should cease to exist, and that the study should be pursued nowhere in the
                    kingdom but at Salerno. The university never attained to much eminence, and
                    after the death of Frederick came for a time altogether to an end, but was
                    restored in 1258 by King Manfred. In 1266 its faculty of medicine was
                    reconstituted, and from 1272-74 Thomas Aquinas was one of its teachers of
                    theology. The commencement of the university of Vercelli belongs to about the
                    year 1228; it probably included, like Naples, all the faculties, but would seem
                    to have been regarded with little favour by the Roman see, and by the year 1372
                    had ceased to exist, although mention of colleges of law and medicine is to be
                    found after that date. The two universities of Piacenza and Pavia stand in close
                    connexion with each other. The former is noted by Denifle as the earliest in
                    Italy which was founded by virtue of a papal charter (6th February 1248),
                    although the scheme remained for a long time inoperative. At length, in the year
                    1398, the university was reconstituted by Giovanni Galeazzo Visconti, duke of
                    Milan, who in the same year caused the university of Pavia to be transferred
                    thither. Piacenza now became the scene of a sudden but shortlived academic
                    prosperity. We are told of no less than twenty-seven professors of the civil
                    law,—among them the celebrated Baldus; of twenty-two professors of medicine; of
                    professors of philosophy, astrology, grammar, and rhetoric; and of lecturers on
                    Seneca and Dante. The faculty of theology would appear, however, never to have
                    been duly constituted, and but one lecturer in this faculty is mentioned. With
                    the death of Galeazzo in 1402, this precarious activity came suddenly to an end;
                    and in 1404 the university had ceased to exist. Its history is, indeed,
                    unintelligible, unless taken in conjunction with that of Pavia. Even before
                    Irnerius taught at Bologna, Pavia had been widely known as a seat of legal
                    studies, and more especially of the Lombard law, although the evidence is
                    wanting which would serve to establish a direct connexion between this early
                    school· and the university which was founded there in 1361, by virtue of the
                    charter granted by the emperor Charles IV. The new “studium” included faculties
                    of jurisprudence, philosophy, medicine, and the arts, and its students were
                    formally taken under the imperial protection, and endowed with privileges
                    identical with those which had been granted to Paris, Bologna, Oxford, Orleans,
                    and Montpellier; but its existence in Pavia was suddenly suspended by the
                    removal, above noted, of its students to Piacenza. It shared again in the
                    decline which overtook the university of Piacenza after the death of Giovanni
                    Galeazzo, and during the period from 1404 to 1412 it altogether ceased to exist.
                    But in October 1412 the lectures were recommenced, and the university entered
                    upon the most brilliant period of its existence. Its professors throughout the
                    15th century were men of distinguished ability, attracted by munificent salaries
                    such as but few other universities could offer, while in the number of students
                    who resorted thither from other countries, and more especially for the study of
                    the civil law, Pavia had no rival in Italy but Padua. Arezzo appears to have
                    been known as a centre of the same study so early as 1215, and its earliest
                    statutes are assigned to the year 1255. By that time it had become a school of
                    arts and medicine also; but for a considerable period after it was almost
                    entirely deserted, and is almost unmentioned until the year 1338, when it
                    acquired new importance by the accession of several eminent jurists from
                    Bologna. In May 1355 it received its charter as a studium generale from Charles
                    IV. After the year 1373 the school gradually dwindled, although it did not
                    become altogether extinct until about the year 1470. The university of Rome
                    (which is to be carefully distinguished from the school attached to the curia)
                    owed its foundation (1303) to Boniface VIII., and was especially designed by
                    that pontiff for the benefit of the poor foreign students sojourning in the
                    capital. It originally included all the faculties; but in 1318 John XXII.
                    decreed that it should possess the power of confer <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n874/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0874-0837"/> ring degrees only in the canon and civil law. The
                    university maintained its existence throughout the period of the residence of
                    the popes at Avignon (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Popedom),</hi> and under the
                    patronage of Leo X. could boast in 1514 of no 1ess than eighty professors. This
                    imposing array would seem, however, to be but a fallacious test of the
                    prosperity of the academic community, for it is stated that many of the
                    professors, owing to the imperfect manner in which they were protected in their
                    privileges, were in the receipt of such insufficient fees that they were
                    compelled to combine other employments with that of lecturing in order to
                    support themselves. An appeal addressed to Leo X. in the year 1513 represents
                    the number of students as so small as to be sometimes exceeded by that of the
                    lecturers (“ut quandoque plures sint qui legant quam qui audiant ”). Scarcely
                    any of the universities in Italy in the 14th century attracted a larger
                    concourse than that of Perugia, where the study chiefly cultivated was that of
                    the civil law. The university received its charter as a studium generale from
                    Clement V. in the year 1308, but had already in 1306 been formally recognized by
                    the civic authorities, by whom it was commended to the special care and
                    protection of the “podestà.” In common with the rest of the Italian
                    universities, it suffered severely from the great plague of 1348-49; but in 1355
                    it received new privileges from the emperor, and in 1362 its first college,
                    dedicated to Gregory the Great, was founded by the bishop of Perugia. The
                    university of Treviso, which received its charter from Frederick the Fair in
                    1318, was of little celebrity and but short duration. It is doubtful, indeed,
                    whether it continued to exist after the city became subject to the republic of
                    Venice in the year 1339; but in 1409 the Venetian senate issued a decree that no
                    subjects of the republic should resort for study to any city in its dominions
                    save that of Padua, and from this date the studium at Treviso must be held to
                    have been no longer in existence. The circumstances of the rise of the
                    university of Florence are unknown, but the earliest evidence of academic
                    instruction belongs to the year 1320. The dispersion of the university of
                    Bologna, in the March and April of the following year, afforded a favourable
                    opportunity for the creation of a studium generale, but the necessary measures
                    were taken somewhat tardily, and in the meantime the greater number of the
                    Bolognese students had betaken themselves to Siena. The charter of foundation
                    for Florence was accordingly not granted until 31st May 1349, when Clement VI.
                    decreed that there should be instituted a studium generate in theology,
                    jurisprudence, medicine, and every other recognized faculty of learning, the
                    teachers to be professors who had obtained the degree of doctor or master either
                    at Bologna or Paris, or “some other studium generale of celebrity.” On 2d
                    January 1364 the university also obtained the grant of imperial privileges from
                    Charles IV. On 14th February 1388 it adopted a body of statutes which are still
                    extant, and afford an interesting study in connexion with the university history
                    of the period. The university now entered upon that brilliant period in its
                    history which was destined to so summary an extinction. “It is almost touching,”
                    says Denifle, “to note how untiringly Florence exerted herself at this period to
                    attract as teachers to her schools the great masters of the sciences and
                    learning.” In the year 1472, however, under the influence of Lorenzo de’ Medici,
                    it was decided that Florence was not a convenient seat for a university, and its
                    students were removed to Pisa. The commencement of the university of Siena
                    belongs to about the year 1241, but its charter was first granted by the emperor
                    Charles IV., at the petition of the citizens, in the year 1357. It was founded
                    as a studium generale in jurisprudence, the arts, and medicine. The imperial
                    charter was confirmed by Gregory XII. in 1408, and the various bulls relating to
                    the university which he subsequently issued afford a good illustration of the
                    conditions of academic life in these times. Residence on the part of the
                    students appears to have been sometimes dispensed with. The bishop of Siena was
                    nominated chancellor of the university, just as, says the bull, he had been
                    appointed to that office by the imperial authority. The graduates were to be
                    admitted to the same privileges as those of Bologna or Paris; and a faculty of
                    theology was added to the curriculum of studies. The university of Ferrara owes
                    its foundation to the house of Este,—Alberto, marquis of Este, having obtained
                    from Boniface IX. in 1391 a charter couched in terms precisely similar to those
                    of the charter for Pisa. In the first half of the 15th century the university
                    was adorned by the presence of several distinguished humanists, but its fortunes
                    were singularly chequered, and it would appear for a certain period to have been
                    altogether extinct. It was, however, restored, and became in the latter part of
                    the century one of the most celebrated of the universities of Italy. In the year
                    1474 its circle of studies comprised all the existing faculties, and it numbered
                    no less than fifty-one professors or lecturers. In later times Ferrara has been
                    noted chiefly as a school of medicine.</p>
                <p>Of the universities modelled on that of Paris, Oxford would appear to have been
                    the earliest, and the manner of its development was probably similar. Certain
                    schools, opened within the precincts of the dissolved nunnery of St Frideswyde
                    and of Oseney abbey, are supposed to have been the nucleus round which the
                    university grew up. In the year 1133 one Robert Pullen, a theologian of
                    considerable eminence (but whether an Englishman or a Breton is uncertain),
                    arrived from Paris, and delivered lectures on the Bible. He was followed a few
                    years later by Vacarius, a native of Lombardy, who as a student at Bologna had
                    inherited the tradition of the teaching of Irnerius. Although both the pope and
                    King Stephen regarded the civil law at this time with considerable distrust,
                    Vacarius maintained his ground, and the study became one of the recognized
                    faculties at Oxford. Towards the close of the 12th century Giraldus Cambrensis
                    describes the town as a place “where the clergy in England chiefly flourished
                    and excelled in clerkly lore.” In one respect, indeed, Oxford was more favoured
                    than even Paris, for the town authorities could not pretend to assert any right
                    of interference with the university such as that to which the French monarch and
                    the court frequently laid claim. In the 13th century mention first occurs of
                    university “chests.” especially the Frideswyde chest, which were benefactions
                    designed as funds for the assistance of poor students. Halls, or places of
                    licensed residence, for students, also began to be established. In the year
                    1257, when the bishop of Lincoln, as diocesan, had trenched too closely on the
                    liberties of the community, the deputies from Oxford, when preferring their
                    appeal to the king at St Albans, could venture to speak of the university as
                    “schola secunda ecclesiae,” or second only to Paris. Its numbers about this time
                    were probably some three thousand; but it was essentially a fluctuating body,
                    and whenever plague or tumult led to a temporary dispersion a serious diminution
                    in its numerical strength generally ensued for some time after. Against such
                    vicissitudes the foundation of colleges proved the most effectual remedy. Of
                    these the three earliest were University College, founded in 1249 by William of
                    Durham; Balliol College, founded about 1263 by John Balliol, the father of the
                    king of Scotland of the same name; and Merton College, founded in 1264. The
                    last-named is especially notable as associated with a new conception of
                    university education, namely, that of collegiate <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n875/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0875-0838"/> discipline for the secular clergy, instead of for
                    any one of the religious orders, for whose sole benefit all similar foundations
                    had hitherto been designed. The statutes given to the society by Walter de
                    Merton are not less noteworthy, as characterized not only by breadth of
                    conception, but also by a careful and discriminating attention to detail, which
                    led to their adoption as the model for later colleges, not only at Oxford but at
                    Cambridge. Of the service rendered by these foundations to the university at
                    large we have significant proof in the fact that, although representing only a
                    small numerical minority in the academic community at large, their members soon
                    obtained a considerable preponderance in the administration of affairs.</p>
                <p>The university of Cambridge, although it rose into existence somewhat later than
                    Oxford, may reasonably be held to have had its origin in the same century. There
                    was probably a certain amount of educational work carried on by the canons of
                    the church of St Giles, which gradually developed into the instruction belonging
                    to a regular studium. In the year 1112 the canons crossed the river and took up
                    their residence in the new priory in Barnwell, and their work of instruction
                    acquired additional importance. Then, as early as the year 1224, the Franciscans
                    established themselves in the town, and, somewhat less than half a century
                    later, were followed by the Dominicans. At both the English universities, as at
                    Paris, the Mendicants and other religious orders were admitted to degrees, a
                    privilege which, until the year 1337, was extended to them at no other
                    university. Their interest in and influence at these three centres was
                    consequently proportionably great. In the years 1231 and 1233 certain royal and
                    papal letters afford satisfactory proof that by that time the university of
                    Cambridge was already an organized body with a chancellor at its head; and in
                    1229 and 1231 its numbers were largely augmented by migrations from Paris and
                    from Oxford. Cambridge, however, in its turn suffered from emigration; while in
                    the year 1261, and again in 1322, the records of the university were wantonly
                    burnt by the townsmen. Throughout the 13th century, indeed, the university was
                    still only a very slightly and imperfectly organized community. Its endowments
                    were of the most slender kind; it had no systematic code for the government of
                    its members; the supervision of the students was very imperfectly provided for.
                    An important step in the direction of reform in this last respect was, however,
                    made in the year 1276, when an ordinance was passed requiring that every one who
                    claimed to be recognized as a scholar should have a fixed master within fifteen
                    days after his entry into the university. But the feature which most served to
                    give permanence and cohesion to the entire community was, as at Oxford, the
                    institution of colleges. The earliest of these was Peterhouse, first founded as
                    a separate institution by Hugh Balsham, bishop of Ely, in the year 1286, with a
                    code which was little more than a transcript of that given by Walter de Merton
                    to his scholars at Oxford. About forty years later was founded Michaelhouse, and
                    at nearly the same time (1326) Edward II. instituted his foundation of “king’s
                    scholars,” afterwards forming the community of King’s Hall. Both these societies
                    in the 16th century were merged in Trinity College. To those succeeded Pembroke
                    Hall (1347) and Gonville Hall (1348). All these colleges, although by no means
                    conceived in a spirit of hostility to either the monastic or the Mendicant
                    orders, were expressly designed for the benefit of the secular clergy. The
                    foundation of Trinity Hall (1350) by Bishop Bateman, on the other hand, as a
                    school of civil and canon law was probably designed to further ultramontane
                    interests. That of Corpus Christi (1352), the outcome of the liberality of a
                    guild of Cambridge townsmen, was conceived with the combined object of providing
                    a house of education for the clergy, and at the same time securing the regular
                    performance of masses for the benefit of the souls of departed members of the
                    guild. But both Trinity Hall and Corpus Christi College, as well as Clare Hall,
                    founded in 1359, were to a great extent indebted for their origin to the ravages
                    caused among the clergy by the great plague of 1349.</p>
                <p>Turning to France, or rather to the territory included within the boundaries of
                    modern France, we find Montpellier a recognized school of medical science as
                    early as the 12th century. William VIII., lord of Montpellier, in the year 1181
                    proclaimed it a school of free resort, where any teacher of medical science,
                    from whatever country, might give instruction. Before the end of the century it
                    possessed also a faculty of jurisprudence, a branch of learning for which it
                    afterwards became famed. The university of medicine and that of law continued,
                    however, to be totally distinct bodies with different constitutions. Petrarch
                    was sent by his father to Montpellier to study the civil law. On 26th October
                    1289 Montpellier was raised by Nicholas IV. to the rank of a “studium generate,”
                    a mark of favour which, in a region where papal influence was so potent,
                    resulted in a considerable accession of prosperity. The university also now
                    included a faculty of arts; and there is satisfactory evidence of the existence
                    of a faculty of theology before the close of the 14th century, although not
                    formally recognized by the pope before the year 1421. In the course of the same
                    century several colleges for poor students were also founded. The university of
                    Toulouse is to be noted as the first founded in any country by virtue of a papal
                    charter. It took its rise in the efforts of Rome for the suppression of the
                    Albigensian heresy, and its foundation formed one of the articles of the
                    conditions of peace imposed by Louis IX. on Count Raymond of Toulouse. In the
                    year 1233 it first acquired its full privileges as a “studium generale” by
                    virtue of a charter given by Gregory IX. This pontiff watched over the
                    university with especial solicitude, and through his exertions it soon became a
                    noted centre of theological and especially of Dominican teaching. As a school of
                    arts, jurisprudence, and medicine, although faculties of each existed, it never
                    attained to any reputation. The university of Orleans had a virtual existence as
                    a studium generate as early as the first half of the 13th century, but in the
                    year 1305 Clement V. endowed it with new privileges, and gave its teachers
                    permission to form themselves into a corporation. The schools of Orleans had an
                    existence, it is said, as early as the 6th century, and subsequently supplied
                    the nucleus for the foundation of a university at Blois; but of this university
                    no records now exist.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Paris</hi> (1200-1875).</p></note> Orleans, in its organization, was modelled
                    mainly on Paris, but its studies were complementary rather than in rivalry to
                    the older university. The absorbing character of the study of the civil law, and
                    the mercenary spirit in which it was pursued, had led the authorities at Paris
                    to refuse to recognize it as a faculty. The study found a home at Orleans, where
                    it was cultivated with an energy which attracted numerous students. In January
                    1235 we find the bishop of Orleans soliciting the advice of Gregory IX. as to
                    the expediency of countenancing a study which was prohibited in Paris. Gregory
                    decided that the lectures might be continued; but he ordered that no beneficed
                    ecclesiastic should be allowed to devote himself to so eminently secular a
                    branch of learning. Orleans subsequently incorporated a faculty of arts, but its
                    reputation from this period was always that of a school of legal studies, and in
                    the 14th century its reputation in this respect was surpassed by no other
                    university<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n876/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0876-0839"/> in Europe. Prior to the 13th century it had been
                    famed for its classical learning; and Angers, which received its charter at the
                    same time, also once enjoyed a like reputation, which, in a similar manner, it
                    exchanged for that of a school for civilians and canonists. The roll of the
                    university forwarded in 1378 to Clement VII. contains the names of 8 professors
                    <hi rend="italic">utriusque juris,</hi> 2 of civil and 2 of canon law, 72
                    licentiates, 284 bachelors of both the legal faculties, and 190 scholars. The
                    university of Avignon was first recognized as a “studium generale” by Boniface
                    VIII. in the year 1303, with power to grant degrees in jurisprudence, arts, and
                    medicine. Its numbers declined somewhat during the residence of the popes, owing
                    to the counter attractions of the “studium” attached to the curia; but after the
                    return of the papal court to Rome it became one of the most frequented
                    universities in France, and possessed at one time no less than seven colleges.
                    The university of Cahors enjoyed the advantage of being regarded with especial
                    favour by John XXII. In June 1332 he conferred upon it privileges identical with
                    those already granted to the university of Toulouse. In the following October,
                    again following the precedent established at Toulouse, he appointed the <hi
                    rend="italic">scholasticus</hi> of the cathedral chancellor of the university.
                    In November of the same year a bull, couched in terms almost identical with
                    those of the Magna Charta of Paris, assimilated the constitution of Cahors to
                    that of the oldest university. The two schools in France which, down to the
                    close of the 14th century, most closely resembled Paris were Orleans and Cahors.
                    The civil immunities and privileges of the latter university were not, however,
                    acquired until the year 1367, when Edward III. of England, in his capacity as
                    duke of Aquitaine, not only exempted the scholars from the payment of all taxes
                    and imposts, but bestowed upon them the peculiar privilege known as <hi
                    rend="italic">privilegium,</hi><hi rend="italic">fori.</hi> Cahors also received
                    a licence for faculties of theology and medicine, but, like Orleans, it was
                    chiefly known as a school of jurisprudence. It was as a “studium generale” in
                    the same three faculties that Grenoble, in the year 1339, received its charter
                    from Benedict XII. The university never attained to much importance, and its
                    annals are for the most part involved in obscurity. At the commencement of the
                    16th century it had ceased altogether to exist, was reorganized by Francis of
                    Bourbon in 1542, and in 1565 was united to the university of Valence. The
                    university of Perpignan, founded, according to Denifle, in 1379 by Clement VII.
                    (although tradition had previously ascribed its origin to Pedro IV. of Aragon),
                    and that of Orange, founded in 1365 by Charles IV., were universities only by
                    name and constitution, their names rarely appearing in contemporary chronicles,
                    while their very existence becomes at times a matter for reasonable doubt.</p>
                <p>To some of the earlier Spanish universities—such as Palencia, founded about the
                    year 1214 by Alfonso VIII.; Huesca, founded in 1354 by Pedro IV.; and Lerida,
                    founded in 1300 by James II.—the same description is applicable; and their
                    insignificance is probably indicated by the fact that they entirely failed to
                    attract foreign students. Valladolid, founded in .1346 by Pope Clement VI.,
                    attained, however, to some celebrity; and the foreign teachers and students
                    frequenting the university became so numerous that in 1373 King Henry II. caused
                    an enactment to be passed for securing to them the same privileges as those
                    already accorded to the native element. But the total number of the students in
                    1403 was only 116, and grammar and logic, along with jurisprudence (which was
                    the principal study), constituted the sole curriculum. Whatever reputation,
                    indeed, was enjoyed by Spain for nearly five centuries after the commencement of
                    the university era, centred mainly in Salamanca, to which Seville, in the south,
                    stood in the relation of a kind of subsidiary school, having been founded in
                    1254 by Alfonso the Wise, simply for the study of Latin and of the Semitic
                    languages, especially Arabic. Salamanca was founded in 1243 by Ferdinand III. of
                    Castile as a “studium generale” in the three faculties of jurisprudence, the
                    arts, and medicine. Ferdinand extended his special protection to the students,
                    granting them numerous privileges and immunities. Under his son Alfonso (above
                    named) the university acquired a further development, and eventually included
                    all the faculties save that of theology. But the main stress of its activity, as
                    was the case with all the earlier Spanish universities, excepting only Palencia
                    and Seville, until the commencement of the 15th century, was laid on the civil
                    and the canon law. But, notwithstanding the favour with which Salamanca was
                    regarded alike by the kings of Castile and by the Roman see, the provision for
                    the payment of its professors was at first so inadequate and precarious that in
                    1298 they by common consent suspended their lectures, in consequence of their
                    scanty remuneration. A permanent remedy for this difficulty was thereupon
                    provided, by the appropriation of a certain portion of the ecclesiastical
                    revenues of the diocese for the purpose of augmenting the professors’ salaries.
                    The earliest of the numerous colleges founded at Salamanca was that of St
                    Bartholomew, long noted for its ancient library and valuable collection of
                    manuscripts, which now form part of the royal library in Madrid.</p>
                <p>The one university possessed by Portugal had its seat in mediaeval times
                    alternately in Lisbon and in Coimbra, until, in the year 1537, it was
                    permanently attached to the latter city. Its formal foundation took place in
                    1309, when it received from King Diniz a charter, the provisions of which were
                    mainly taken from those of the charter given to Salamanca. In 1772 the
                    university was entirely reconstituted.</p>
                <p>Of the German universities, Prague, which existed as a “studium” in the 13th
                    century, was the earliest, and was at first frequented mainly by students from
                    Styria and Austria, countries at that time ruled by the king of Bohemia. On 26th
                    January 1347, at the request of Charles IV., Pope Clement VI. promulgated a bull
                    authorizing the foundation of a “studium generale” in all the faculties. In the
                    following year Charles himself issued a charter for the foundation. This
                    document, which, if original in character, would have been of much interest, has
                    but few distinctive features of its own, its provisions being throughout adapted
                    from those contained in the charters given by Frederick II. for the university
                    of Naples and by Conrad for Salerno,—almost the only important feature of
                    difference being that Charles bestows on the students of Prague all the civil
                    privileges and immunities which were enjoyed by the teachers of Paris and
                    Bologna. Charles had himself been a student in Paris, and the organization of
                    his new foundation was modelled on that university, a like division into four
                    “nations” (although with different names) constituting one of the most marked
                    features of imitation. The numerous students—and none of the mediaeval
                    universities attracted in their earlier history a larger concourse—were drawn
                    from a gradually widening area, which at length included, not only all parts of
                    Germany, but also England, France, Lombardy, Hungary, and Poland. Contemporary
                    writers, with the exaggeration characteristic of mediaeval credulity, even speak
                    of thirty thousand students as present in the university at one time, —a
                    statement for which Denifle proposes to substitute two thousand as a more
                    probable estimate. It is certain, however, that Prague, prior to the foundation
                    of Leipsic, was one of the most frequented centres of learning in Europe, and
                    Paris suffered a considerable diminution in <pb break="no"

                    the great studium of Slavonia.</p>
                <p>The university of Cracow in Poland was founded in May 1364, by virtue of a
                    charter given by King Casimir the Great, who bestowed on it the same privileges
                    as those possessed by the universities of Bologna and Padua. In the following
                    September Urban V., in consideration of the remoteness of the city from other
                    centres of education, constituted it a “studium generale” in all the faculties
                    save that of theology. It is, however, doubtful whether these designs were
                    carried into actual realization, for it is certain that, for a long time after
                    the death of Casimir, there was no university whatever. Its real commencement
                    must accordingly be considered to belong to the year 1400, when it was
                    reconstituted, and the papal sanction was given for the incorporation of a
                    faculty of theology. From this time its growth and prosperity were continuous;
                    and with the year 1416 it had so far acquired a European reputation as to
                    venture upon forwarding an expression of its views in connexion with the
                    deliberations of the council of Constance. Towards the close of the 15th century
                    the university is said to have been in high repute as a school of both
                    astronomical and humanistic studies.</p>
                <p>The Avignonese popes appear to have regarded the establishment of new faculties
                    of theology with especial jealousy; and when, in 1364, Duke Rudolph IV. founded
                    the university of Vienna, with the design of constituting it a “studium
                    generale” in all the faculties, Urban V. refused his assent to the foundation of
                    a theological school. Owing to the sudden death of Duke Rudolph, the university
                    languished for the next twenty years, but after the accession of Duke Albert
                    III., who may be regarded as its real founder, it acquired additional
                    privileges, and its prosperity became marked and continuous. Like Prague, Vienna
                    was for a long time distinguished by the comparatively little attention bestowed
                    by its teachers on the study of the civil law.</p>
                <p>No country in the 14th century was looked upon with greater disfavour at Rome
                    than Hungary. It was stigmatized as the land of heresy and schism. When,
                    accordingly, in 1367 King Louis applied to Urban V. for his sanction of the
                    scheme of founding a university at Fünfkirchen, although theological learning
                    was in special need of encouragement in those regions, Urban would not consent
                    to the foundation of a faculty of theology; he even made it a condition of his
                    sanction for a “studium generale” that King Louis should first undertake to
                    provide for the payment of the professors. We hear but little concerning the
                    university after its foundation, and it is doubtful whether it survived for any
                    length of time the close of the century, having been about that period absorbed
                    in all probability in the university of Ofen. The foundation of this university
                    is also involved in considerable obscurity, and its original charter is lost. We
                    only know that it was granted by Boniface IX., at the request of King Sigismund,
                    in the year 1389. In the first half of the 15th century it ceased for a long
                    period to exist, but was revived, or rather founded afresh, by King Mathias
                    Corvinus, an eminent patron of learning, in the last quarter of the century.
                    “The extreme east of civilized continental Europe in mediaeval times,” observes
                    Denifle, “can be compared, so far as university education is concerned, only
                    with the extreme west and the extreme south. In Hungary, as in Portugal and in
                    Naples, there was constant fluctuation, but the west and the south, although
                    troubled by yet greater commotions than Hungary, bore better fruit. Among all
                    the countries possessed of universities in mediaeval times, Hungary occupies the
                    lowest place—a state of affairs of which, however, the proximity of the Turk
                    must be looked upon as a main cause.”</p>
                <p>The university of Heidelberg received its charter (23d October 1385) from Urban
                    VI. as a “studium generale” in all the recognized faculties save that of the
                    civil law,— the form and substance of the document being almost identical with
                    those of the charter granted to Vienna. It was granted at the request of the
                    elector palatine, Rupert I., who conferred on the teachers and students, at the
                    same time, the same civil privileges as those which belonged to the university
                    of Paris. In this case the functionary invested with the power of bestowing
                    degrees was nonresident, the licences being conferred by the provost of the
                    cathedral at Worms. But the real founder, as he was also the organizer and
                    teacher, of the university was Marsilius of Inghen, to whose ability and energy
                    Heidelberg was indebted for no little of its early reputation and success. The
                    omission of the civil law from the studies licensed in the original charter
                    would seem to show that the pontiff’s compliance with the elector’s request was
                    merely formal, and Heidelberg, like Cologne, included the civil law among its
                    faculties almost from its first creation. No mediaeval university achieved a
                    more rapid and permanent success. Regarded with favour alike by the civil and
                    ecclesiastical potentates, its early annals were singularly free from crises
                    like those which characterize the history of many of the mediaeval universities.
                    The number of those admitted to degrees from the commencement of the first
                    session (19th October 1386 to 16th December 1387) amounted to 579.<note

                <p>Owing to the labours of the Dominicans, Cologne had gained a reputation as a seat
                    of learning long before the founding of its university; and it was through the
                    advocacy of some leading members of the Mendicant orders that, at the desire of
                    the city council, its charter as a “studium generale” (21st May 1388) was
                    obtained from Urban VI. It was organized on the model of the university of
                    Paris, as a school of theology and canon law, and “any other recognized
                    faculty,”—the civil law being incorporated as a faculty soon after the
                    promulgation of the charter. In common with the other early universities of
                    Germany—Prague, Vienna, and Heidelberg—Cologne owed nothing to imperial
                    patronage, while it would appear to have been, from the first, the object of
                    special favour with Rome. This circumstance serves to account for its distinctly
                    ultramontane sympathies in mediaeval times and even far into the 16th century.
                    In a report transmitted to Gregory XIII. in 1577, the university expressly
                    derives both its first origin and its privileges from the Holy See, and
                    professes to owe no allegiance save to the Roman pontiff. Erfurt, no less noted
                    as a centre of Franciscan than was Cologne of Dominican influence, received its
                    charter (16th September 1379) from the anti-pope Clement VII. as a “studium
                    generale” in all the faculties. Ten years later (4th May 1389) it was founded
                    afresh by Urban VI., without any recognition of the act of his pretended
                    predecessor. In the 15th century the number of its students was larger than that
                    at any other German university—a fact attributable partly to the reputation it
                    had acquired as a school of jurisprudence, and partly to the ardour with which
                    the philosophic controversies of the time were debated in its midst.</p>
                <p>The collegiate system is to be noted as a feature common to all these early
                    German universities; and, in nearly all, the professors were partly remunerated
                    by the appropriation of certain prebends, appertaining to some neighbouring
                    church, to their maintenance.</p>
                <p>Throughout the 15th century the relations of the Roman pontiffs to the
                    universities continued much the same, although the independent attitude assumed
                    at the great councils of Constance and Basel by the deputies from the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n878/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0878-0841"/> universities, and especially by those from Paris,
                    could not fail to excite their apprehensions. Their bulls for each new
                    foundation begin again to indicate a certain jealousy with respect to the
                    appropriation of prebends by the founders. Where such appropriations are made,
                    and more particularly in France, a formal sanction of the transfer generally
                    finds a place in the bull authorizing the foundation; while sometimes the
                    founder or founders are themselves enjoined to provide the endowments requisite
                    for the establishment and support of the university. In this manner the control
                    of the pontiff over each newly-created seat of learning assumed a more real
                    character, from the fact that his assent was accompanied by conditions which
                    rendered it no longer a mere formality. The imperial intervention, on the other
                    hand, was rarely invoked in Germany,—Greifswald, Freiburg, and Tübingen being
                    the only instances in which the emperor’s confirmation of the foundation was
                    solicited.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Meíners, <hi

                    increasing intervention was more than counteracted by those other tendencies
                    which came into operation in the second half of the century. These were of a
                    twofold character :—the first directly modifying the studies themselves, as the
                    results of the discovery of printing and the new spirit awakened by the teaching
                    of the humanists; the second affecting the external conditions, such as the
                    multiplication of schools, and the growing demand for skilled physicians and
                    learned civilians, —circumstances which afforded increased employment for the
                    services of men of academic training. In northern Germany and in the
                    Netherlands, the growing wealth and prosperity of the different states
                    especially favoured the formation of new centres of learning. In the flourishing
                    duchy of Brabant the university of Louvain (1426) was to a great extent
                    controlled by the municipality; and their patronage, although ultimately
                    attended with detrimental results, long enabled Louvain to outbid all the other
                    universities of Europe in the munificence with which she rewarded her
                    professors. In the course of the next century the “Belgian Athens,” as she is
                    styled by Lipsius, ranked second only to Paris in numbers and reputation. In its
                    numerous separate foundations and general organization—it possessed no less than
                    twenty-eight colleges—it closely resembled the English universities; while its
                    active press afforded facilities to the author and the controversialist of which
                    both Cambridge and Oxford were at that time almost destitute. It embraced all
                    the faculties, and no degrees in Europe stood so high as guarantees of general
                    acquirements. Erasmus records it as a common saying, that “no one could graduate
                    at Louvain without knowledge, manners, and age.” Sir William Hamilton speaks of
                    the examination at Louvain for a degree in arts as “the best example upon record
                    of the true mode of such examination, and, until recent times, in fact, the only
                    example in the history of universities worthy of consideration at all.” He has
                    translated from Vernulaeus the order and method of this examination.<note

                    faculties of jurisprudence, medicine, and philosophy were removed to Brussels,
                    and in 1797 the French suspended the university altogether. When Belgium was
                    formed into an independent state in 1831, the university was refounded as a
                    Roman Catholic foundation.</p>
                <p>The circumstances of the foundation of the university of Leipsic are especially
                    noteworthy, it having been the result of the migration of almost the entire
                    German element from the university of Prague. This element comprised (1)
                    Bavarians, (2) Saxons, (3) Poles (this last-named division being drawn from a
                    wide area, which included Meissen, Lusatia, Silesia, and Prussia), and, being
                    represented by three votes in the assemblies of the university, while the
                    Bohemians possessed but one, had acquired a preponderance in the direction of
                    affairs which the latter could no longer submit to. Religious differences,
                    again, evoked mainly by the preaching of John Huss, further intensified the
                    existing disagreements; and eventually, in the year 1409, King Wenceslaus, at
                    the prayer of his Bohemian subjects, issued a decree which exactly reversed the
                    previous distribution of votes,—three votes being assigned to the Bohemian
                    nation and only one to all the rest. The Germans took deep umbrage, and seceded
                    to Leipsic, where, a bull having been obtained from Alexander V. (9th September
                    1409), a new “studium generale” was founded by the landgrave of Thuringia and
                    the margraves of Meissen. The members were divided into four nations—composed of
                    natives of Meissen, Saxony, Bavaria, and Poland. Two colleges were founded, a
                    greater and a smaller, but designed, not for poor students, but for masters of
                    arts,—twelve being admitted on the former and eight on the latter foundation.
                    The first university of northern Germany was that of Rostock, founded by the
                    dukes John and Albert of Mecklenburg, the scheme receiving the sanction of
                    Martin V. in a bull dated 13th February 1419 as that of a “studium generale” in
                    all the faculties excepting theology. The faculty of theology was added in the
                    year 1432. Two colleges were also founded, with the same design and on the same
                    scale as at Leipsic.</p>
                <p>No little illustration is afforded by the circumstances attending the foundation
                    of the French universities of the struggle that was going on between the crown
                    and the Roman see. The earliest foundation in the 15th century was that of
                    Poitiers. It was instituted by Charles VII. in 1431, almost immediately after
                    his accession, with the special design of creating a centre of learning less
                    favourable to English interests than Paris had at that time shown herself to be.
                    Eugenius IV. could not refuse his sanction to the scheme, but he endeavoured
                    partially to defeat Charles’s design by conferring on the new “studium generale”
                    only the same privileges as those possessed by Toulouse, and thus placing it at
                    a disadvantage in comparison with Paris. Charles rejoined by an extraordinary
                    exercise of his own prerogative, conferring on Poitiers all the privileges
                    collectively possessed by Paris, Toulouse, Montpellier, Angers, and Orleans, and
                    at the same time placing the university under special royal protection. The
                    foundation of the university of Caen, in the diocese of Bayeux, was attended by
                    conditions almost exactly the reverse of those which belonged to the foundation
                    of that at Poitiers. It was founded under English auspices during the short
                    period of the supremacy of the English arms in Normandy in the 15th century. Its
                    charter (May 1437) was given by Eugenius IV., and the bishop of Bayeux was
                    appointed its chancellor. The university of Paris had by this time completely
                    forfeited the favour of Eugenius by its attitude at the council of Basel, and
                    Eugenius inserted in the charter for Caen a clause of an entirely novel
                    character, requiring all those admitted to degrees to take an oath of fidelity
                    to the see of Rome, and to bind themselves to attempt nothing prejudicial to her
                    interests. To this proviso the pragmatic sanction of Bourges was the reply given
                    by Charles in the following year. On 18th May 1442 we find King Henry VI.
                    writing to Eugenius, and dwelling with satisfaction on the rapid progress of the
                    new university, to which, he says, students had flocked from all quarters, and
                    were still daily arriving.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    30th October 1452 its charter was given afresh by Charles in terms which left
                    the original charter unrecognized; both teachers and learners were made subject
                    to the civil authorities of the city, while all privileges conferred in the
                    former charter <pb break="no"

                    this time the university of Caen was distinguished by its loyal spirit and firm
                    resistance to ultramontane pretensions; and, although swept away at the French
                    Revolution, it was afterwards restored, owing to the sense of the services it
                    had thus once rendered to the national cause.<note anchored="true"

                    characterize the foundation of the university of Bordeaux (1441) or that of
                    Valence (1452), but that of Nantes, which received its charter from Pius II. in
                    1463, is distinguished by the fact that it did not receive the ratification of
                    the king of France, and the conditions under which its earlier traditions were
                    formed thus closely resemble those of Poitiers. It seems also to have been
                    regarded with particular favour by Pius IL, a pontiff who was at once a ripe
                    scholar and a writer upon education. He gave to Nantes a notable body of
                    privileges, which not only represent an embodiment of all the various privileges
                    granted to universities prior to that date, but afterwards became, with their
                    copious and somewhat tautological phraseology, the accepted model for the great
                    majority of university charters, whether issued by the pope or by the emperor,
                    or by the civil authority. The bishop of Nantes was appointed head of the
                    university, and was charged with the special protection of its privileges
                    against all interference from whatever quarter.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Meiners, i. 368.</p></note> The bull for the
                    foundation of the university of Bourges was given in 1465 by Paul II. at the
                    request of Louis XL and his brother. It confers on the community the same
                    privileges as those enjoyed by the other universities of France. The royal
                    sanction was given at the petition of the citizens; but, from reasons which do
                    not appear, they deemed it necessary further to petition that their charter
                    might also be registered and enrolled by the parlement of Paris.</p>
                <p>In Germany, the first of the universities representing the new influences above
                    referred to is that of Greifswald. A wealthy burgomaster, who had graduated as a
                    master of arts at Rostock, was the chief mover; and, his proposal being
                    cordially seconded by the city council, the duke of the province, and certain
                    abbots of neighbouring monasteries, the necessary bull was obtained from
                    Calixtus III. (29th May 1456). The first session was commenced in October of the
                    same year. Three colleges were at the same time founded,—two for masters of
                    arts, as at Leipsic and Rostock, and a third for jurists. The chairs in the
                    different faculties were distributed as follows: theology 3, jurisprudence 5,
                    medicine 1, arts 4,—the number of jurists showing that the study of the civil
                    law still obtained a certain preponderance. The university of Freiburg was
                    founded by the archduke Albert, brother of the emperor Frederick III.,—the papal
                    bull being given 20th April 1455, and the imperial ratification in the following
                    year. The first session was opened in 1460, under the presidency of Matthew
                    Hummel, a privy councillor, and the original numbers soon received considerable
                    additions by secessions from Vienna and from Heidelberg. The endowment was
                    further augmented by an annual allowance from the city council, and by certain
                    canonries and livings attached to neighbouring parishes. In the same year, and
                    probably in a spirit of direct rivalry, was opened the university of Basel. The
                    cathedral school in that ancient city, together with others attached to the
                    monasteries, afforded a sufficient nucleus for a “studium,” and Pius IL, who, as
                    Aeneas Sylvius, had been a resident in the city, was easily prevailed upon to
                    grant the charter (12th November 1459). In the character of its endowments, and
                    in the relative importance attached to the study of the civil law, Basel much
                    resembled Greifswald, but its success throughout the 15th century was marred by
                    the languid character of the support afforded it by the civic authorities.
                    Before he had signed the bull for the foundation of the university of Basel,
                    Pius IL, at the request of duke William of Bavaria, had issued another bull for
                    the foundation of a university at Ingolstadt (7th April 1459). But it was not
                    until 1472 that the work of teaching was actually commenced there. Some
                    long-existing prebends, founded by former dukes of Bavaria, were appropriated to
                    the endowment, and the chairs in the different faculties were distributed as
                    follows :—theology 2, jurisprudence 3, medicine 1, arts 6, —arts in conjunction
                    with theology thus obtaining the preponderance. As at Caen, twenty-two years
                    before, an oath of fidelity to the Roman pontiff was imposed on every student
                    admitted to a degree.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Paulsen, in speaking of this proviso as one “die weder vorher noch nachher’
                    sonst verkommt,” would consequently seem to be not quite accurate. See <hi
                    rend="italic">Die Gründung der deutschen Universitäten,</hi> p. 277.</p></note>
                    That this proviso was not subsequently abolished, as at Caen, is a feature in
                    the history of the university of Ingolstadt which was attended by important
                    results. Nowhere did the Reformation meet with more stubborn resistance, and it
                    was at Ingolstadt that the Counter-Reformation was commenced. In 1556 the
                    Jesuits made their first settlement in the university.</p>
                <p>The next two universities took their rise in the archiépiscopal seats of Treves
                    and Mainz. That at Treves received its charter as early as 1450; but the first
                    academical session did not commence until 1473. Here the ecclesiastical
                    influences appear to have been unfavourable to the project. The archbishop
                    demanded 2000 florins as the price of his sanction. The cathedral chapter threw
                    difficulties in the way of the appropriation of certain livings and canonries to
                    the university endowment; and so obstinate was their resistance that in 1655 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> they succeeded in altogether rescinding the gift on
                    payment of a very inadequate sum. It was not until 1722 that the assembly of
                    deputies, by a formal grant, relieved the university from the difficulties in
                    which it had become involved. The university of Mainz, on the other hand, was
                    almost entirely indebted to the archbishop Diether for its foundation. It was at
                    his petition that Sixtus IV. granted the charter, 23d November 1476; and
                    Diether, being himself an enthusiastic humanist, thereupon circulated a letter,
                    couched in elegant Latinity, addressed to students throughout his diocese,
                    inviting them to repair to the new centre, and dilating on the advantages of
                    academic studies and of learning. The rise of these two universities, however,
                    neither of which attained to much distinction, represents little more than the
                    incorporation of certain already existing institutions into a homogeneous whole,
                    the power of conferring degrees being superadded. But the university of
                    Tübingen, founded by charter of Sixtus IV. (9th November 1476), represents an
                    entirely new creation. Its real founder was Mathilda, the mother of Count
                    Eberhard of Würtemberg, who appropriated five livings and eight prebends to the
                    endowment. Of the chairs, 3 were for theology, 3 for the canon and 2 for the
                    civil law, 2 for medicine, and 4 for arts. The general financial condition of
                    this university in the year 1541-42, and the sources from whence its revenues
                    were derived, have been illustrated by Hoffmann in a short paper which shows the
                    fluctuating character of the resources of a university in those days,— liable to
                    be affected, as they were, both by the seasons and the markets.<note

                <p>Nearly contemporaneous with these foundations were those of Upsala (1477) and
                    Copenhagen (1479), which, although lying without the political boundaries of
                    Germany, reflected her influence. The charter for Copenhagen was given by Sixtus
                    IV. as early as 1475. The students <pb break="no"

                    within the radius of the university of Cologne, and its statutes were little
                    more than a transcript of those of the latter foundation.</p>
                <p>The electorates of Wittenberg and Brandenburg were now the only two considerable
                    German territories which did not possess a studium generale, and the university
                    founded at Wittenberg by Maximilian I. (6th July 1502) is notable as the first
                    established in Germany by virtue of an imperial as distinguished from a papal
                    decree. Its charter is, however, drawn up with the traditional phraseology of
                    the pontifical bulls, and is evidently not conceived in any spirit of antagonism
                    to Rome. Wittenberg is constituted a “studium generale” in all the four
                    faculties,— the right to confer degrees in theology and canon law having been
                    sanctioned by the papal legate some months before, 2d February 1502. The
                    endowment of the university with church revenues duly received the papal
                    sanction,—a bull of Alexander VI. authorizing the appropriation of twelve
                    canonries attached to the castle church, as well as of eleven prebends in
                    outlying districts— <hi rend="italic">ut sic per</hi><hi rend="italic">omnem

                    of the attention of Europe at its commencement. And it was its distinguishing
                    merit that it was the first academic centre north the Alps where the antiquated
                    methods and barbarous Latinity of the scholastic era were overthrown. The last
                    university founded in Germany prior to the Reformation was that of
                    Frankfort-on-the-Oder. The design, first conceived by the elector John of
                    Brandenburg, was carried into execution by his son Joachim, at whose request
                    Pope Julius II. issued a bull for the foundation, 15th March 1506. An imperial
                    charter, identical in its contents with the papal bull, followed on 26th
                    October. The university received an endowment of canonries and livings similar
                    to that of Wittenberg, and some houses in the city were assigned for its use by
                    the elector.</p>
                <p>The first university in Scotland was that of St Andrews, founded in 1411 by Henry
                    Wardlaw, bishop of that see, and modelled chiefly on the constitution of the
                    university of Paris. It acquired all its three colleges—St Salvator’s, St
                    Leonard’s, and St Mary’s—before the Reformation,— the first having been founded
                    in 1456 by Bishop James Kennedy; the second in 1512 by the youthful archbishop
                    Alexander Stuart (natural son of James IV.) and John Hepburn, the prior of the
                    monastery of St Andrews; and the third, also in 1512, by the Beatons, who in the
                    year 1537 procured a bull from Pope Paul III. dedicating the college to the
                    Blessed Virgin Mary of the Assumption, and adding further endowments. The most
                    ancient of the universities of Scotland, with its three colleges, was thus
                    reared in an atmosphere of mediaeval theology, and undoubtedly designed as a
                    bulwark against heresy and schism. But “by a strange irony of fate,” it has been
                    observed, “two of these colleges became, almost from the first, the foremost
                    agents in working the overthrow of that church which they were founded to
                    defend.” St Leonard’s more especially, like St John’s or Queens’ at Cambridge,
                    became a noted centre of intellectual life and Reformation principles. That he
                    “had drunk at St Leonard’s well” became a current expression for implying that a
                    theologian had imbibed the doctrines of Protestantism. The university of Glasgow
                    was founded as a “studium generale” in 1453, and possessed two colleges. Prior
                    to the Reformation it acquired but little celebrity; its discipline was lax, and
                    the number of the students but small, while the instruction was not only
                    inefficient but irregularly given; no funds were provided for the maintenance of
                    regular lectures in the higher faculties; and there was no adequate executive
                    power for the maintenance of discipline. The university of Aberdeen, which was
                    founded in 1494, at first possessed only one college,—namely, King’s. Marischal
                    College, founded in 1593 by George Keith, fifth Earl Marischal, was constituted
                    by its founder independent of the university in Old Aberdeen, being itself both
                    a college and a university, with the power of conferring degrees. Bishop
                    Elphinstone, the founder both of the university and of King’s College (1505),
                    had been educated at Glasgow, and had subsequently both studied and taught at
                    Paris and at Orleans. To the wider experience which he had thus gained we may
                    probably attribute the fact that the constitution of the university of Aberdeen
                    was free from the glaring defects which then characterized that of the
                    university of Glasgow.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Fasti Aberdοnenses,</hi> Pref. p. xvi.</p></note> But in
                    all the mediaeval universities of Germany, England, and Scotland, modelled as
                    they were on a common type, the absence of adequate discipline was, in a greater
                    or less degree, a common defect. In connexion with this feature we may note the
                    comparatively small percentage of matriculated students proceeding to the
                    degrees of B.A. and M.A. when compared with later times. Of this disparity the
                    following table, exhibiting the relative numbers in the university of Leipsic
                    for every ten years from the year 1427 to 1552, probably affords a fair average
                    illustration,—the remarkable fluctuations probably depending quite as much upon
                    the comparative healthiness of the period (in respect of freedom from epidemic)
                    and the abundance of the harvests as upon any other cause :—</p>

                <p>The German universities in these times seem to have admitted for the most part
                    their inferiority in learning to older and more favoured centres; and their
                    consciousness of the fact is shown by the efforts which they made to attract
                    instructors from Italy, and by the frequent resort of the more ambitious
                    students to schools like Paris, Bologna, Padua, and Pavia. That they took their
                    rise in any spirit of systematic opposition to the Roman see (as Meiners and
                    others have contended), or that their organization was something external to and
                    independent of the church, is sufficiently disproved by the foregoing evidence.
                    Generally speaking, they were eminently conservative bodies, and the new
                    learning of the humanists and the new methods of instruction that now began to
                    demand attention were alike for a long period unable to gain admission within
                    academic circles. Reformers such as Hegius, John Wessel, and Rudolphus Agricola
                    carried on their work at places like Deventer remote from university influences.
                    That there was a considerable amount of mental activity going on in the
                    universities themselves is not to be denied; but it was mostly of that
                    unprofitable kind which, while giving rise to endless controversy, turned upon
                    questions in connexion with which the implied postulates and the terminology
                    employed rendered all scientific investigation<pb break="no"

                    Greifswald, and Prague (after 1209) being the principal exceptions—the so-called
                    Realists and Nominalists represented two great parties occupied with an
                    internecine struggle. At Paris, owing to the overwhelming strength of the
                    theologians, the Nominalists were indeed under a kind of ban; but at Heidelberg
                    they had altogether expelled their antagonists. It was much the same at Vienna
                    and at Erfurt,—the latter, from the ready reception which it gave to new
                    speculation, being styled by its enemies “novorum omnium portus.” At Basel,
                    under the leadership of the eminent Johannes a Lapide, the Realists w ith
                    difficulty maintained their ground. Freiburg, Tübingen, and Ingolstadt, in the
                    hope of diminishing controversy, arrived at a kind of compromise, each party
                    having its own professor, and representing a distinct “nation.” At Mainz the
                    authorities adopted a manual of logic which was essentially an embodiment of
                    Nominalistic principles.</p>
                <p>In Italy, almost without exception, it was decided that these controversies were
                    endless, and that their effects were pernicious. It was resolved, accordingly,
                    to expel logic, and allow its place to be filled by rhetoric. It was by virtue
                    of this decision, which was of a tacit rather than a formal character, that the
                    expounders of the new learning in the 15th century, men like Emmanuel
                    Chrysoloras, Guarino, Leonardo Bruni, Bessarion, Argyropulos, and Valla, carried
                    into effect that important revolution in academic studies which constitutes a
                    new era in university learning, and largely helped to pave the way for the
                    Reformation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For an

                    controversial spirit, continued as it was in relation to theological questions
                    after the Reformation, obtained for the Italian universities a fortunate
                    immunity from dissensions like those which, as we shall shortly see, distracted
                    the centres of learning in Germany. The professorial body also attained to an
                    almost unrivalled reputation. It was exceptionally select, only those who were
                    in receipt of salaries being permitted, as a rule, to lecture; it was also famed
                    for its ability, the institution of concurrent chairs proving an excellent
                    stimulus. These chairs were of two kinds—“ordinary” and “extraordinary,”—the
                    former being the more liberally endowed and fewer in number. For each subject of
                    importance there were thus always two and sometimes three rival chairs, and a
                    powerful and continuous emulation was thus maintained among the teachers. “From
                    the integrity of their patrons, and the lofty standard by which they were
                    judged,” says Sir W. Hamilton, “the call to a Paduan or Pisan chair was deemed
                    the highest of all literary honours. The status of professor was in Italy
                    elevated to a dignity which in other countries it has never reached; and not a
                    few of the most illustrious teachers in the Italian seminaries were of the
                    proudest nobility of the land. While the universities of other countries had
                    fallen from Christian and cosmopolite to sectarian and local schools, it is the
                    peculiar glory of the Italian that, under the enlightened liberality of their
                    patrons, they still continued to assert their European universality. Creed and
                    country were in them no bar,—the latter not even a reason of preference.
                    Foreigners of every nation are to be found among their professors; and the most
                    learned man in Scotland (Dempster) sought in a Pisan chair that theatre for his
                    abilities which he could not find at home.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The Reformation represents the great boundary line in the history of the
                    mediaeval universities, and also, for a long time after, the main influence in
                    the history of those new foundations which subsequently arose in Protestant
                    countries. Even in Catholic countries its secondary effects were scarcely less
                    perceptible, as they found expression in connexion with the Counter-Reformation.
                    In Germany the Thirty Years’ "War was attended by consequences which were felt
                    long after the 17th century. In France the Revolution of 1789 resulted in the
                    actual uprooting of the university system.</p>
                <p>The influences of the New Learning, and the special character which it assumed as
                    it made its way in Germany in connexion with the labours of scholars like
                    Erasmus, John Reuchlin, Ulrich von Hutten, and Melanchthon, augured well for the
                    future. It was free from the frivolities, the pedantry, the immoralities, and
                    the scepticism which characterized so large a proportion of the corresponding
                    culture in Italy. It gave promise of resulting at once in a critical and
                    enlightened study of the masterpieces of classical antiquity, and in a reverent
                    and yet rational interpretation of the Scriptures and the fathers. The fierce
                    bigotry and the ceaseless controversies evoked by the promulgation of Lutheran
                    or Calvinistic doctrine dispelled, however, this hopeful prospect, and converted
                    what might otherwise have become the tranquil abodes of the Muses into gloomy
                    fortresses of sectarianism. Of the manner in which it affected the highest
                    culture, the observation of Henke in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Calixtus</hi>
                    (i. 8), that for a century after the Reformation the history of Lutheran
                    theology becomes almost identified with that of the German universities, may
                    serve as an illustration.</p>
                <p>The first Protestant university was that of Marburg, founded by Philip the
                    Magnanimous, landgrave of Hesse, 30th May 1527. Expressly designed as'a bulwark
                    of Lutheranism, it was mainly built up out of the confiscation of the property
                    of the religious orders in the Hessian capital. The house of the Dominicans, who
                    had fled on the first rumour of spoliation, was converted into lecturerooms for
                    the faculty of jurisprudence. The church and convent of the order known as the
                    “Kugelherrn” was appropriated to the theological faculty. The friary of the
                    Barefooted Friars was shared between the faculties of medicine and philosophy.
                    The university, which was the object of the margrave’s peculiar care, rapidly
                    rose to celebrity; it was resorted to by students from remote countries, even
                    from Greece, and its professors were of distinguished ability. How much,
                    however, of this popularity depended on its theological associations is to be
                    seen in the fact that after the year 1605, when, by the decree of Count Maurice,
                    its formulary of faith was changed from Lutheran to Calvinistic, its numbers
                    greatly declined. This dictation of the temporal power now becomes one of the
                    most notable features in academic history in Protestant Germany. The
                    universities, having repudiated the papal authority, while that of the episcopal
                    order was at an end, now began to pay especial court to the temporal ruler, and
                    sought in every way to conciliate his goodwill, representing with peculiar
                    distinctness the theory,— <hi rend="italic">cujus regio, ejus religio.</hi> This
                    tendency was further strengthened by the fact that their colleges, bursaries,
                    and other similar foundations were no longer derived from or supported by
                    ecclesiastical institutions, but were mainly dependent on the civil power.</p>
                <p>The Lutheran university of Königsberg was founded 17th August 1544 by Albert
                    III., margrave of Brandenburg, and the first duke of Prussia, and his wife
                    Dorothea, a Danish princess. In this instance, the religious character of the
                    foundation not having been determined at the commencement, the papal and the
                    imperial sanction were both applied for, although not accorded. King Sigismund
                    of Poland, however, which kingdom exercised at that time a protectorate over the
                    Prussian duchy, ultimately gave the necessary charter (29th September 1561), at
                    the same time ordaining that all students who graduated as masters in the
                    faculty of philosophy should rank as nobles of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n882/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0882-0845"/> Polish kingdom. When Prussia was raised to the
                    rank of a kingdom (1701) the university was made a royal foundation, and the
                    “collegium Fridericianum,” which was then erected, received corresponding
                    privileges. In 1862 the university buildings were rebuilt, and the number of the
                    students is now nearly one thousand.</p>
                <p>The Lutheran university of Jena had its origin in a gymnasium founded by John
                    Frederick the Magnanimous, elector of Saxony, during his imprisonment, for the
                    express purpose of promoting Evangelical doctrines and repairing the loss of
                    Wittenberg, where the Philippists had gained the ascendency. Its charter, which
                    the emperor Charles V. refused to grant, and which was obtained with some
                    difficulty from his brother, Ferdinand I., eventually enabled the authorities to
                    open the university, 2d February 1558. Distinguished for its vehement assertion
                    of Lutheran doctrine, its hostility to the teaching of Wittenberg was hardly
                    less pronounced than that with which both centres regard Roman Catholicism. For
                    a long time it was chiefly noted as a school of medicine, and in the 17th and
                    18th centuries it was in bad repute for the lawlessness of its students, among
                    whom duelling prevailed to a scandalous extent. The beauty of its situation and
                    the eminence of its professoriate have, however, generally attracted a
                    considerable proportion of students from other countries. Its numbers in 1885
                    were 566.</p>
                <p>The Lutheran university of Helmstadt, founded by Duke Julius (of the house of
                    Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel), and designated after him in its official records as
                    “Academia Julia,” received its charter, 8th May 1575, from the emperor
                    Maximilian II. No university in the 16th century commenced under more favourable
                    auspices. It was munificently endowed by the founder and by his son; and its
                    “Con victorium,” or college for poor students, expended in the course of thirty
                    years no less than 100,000 thalers, an extraordinary expenditure for an
                    institution of such a character in those days. Beautifully and conveniently
                    situated in what had now become the well-peopled region between the Weser and
                    the lower Elbe, and distinguished by its comparatively temperate maintenance of
                    the Lutheran tenets, it attracted a considerable concourse of students,
                    especially from the upper classes, not a few being of princely rank. Throughout
                    its history, until suppressed in 1809, Helmstadt enjoyed the special and
                    powerful patronage of the dukes of Saxony.</p>
                <p>The “Gymnasium Aegidianum” of Nuremberg, founded in 1526, and removed in 1575 to
                    Altdorf, represents the origin of the university of Altdorf. A charter was
                    granted in 1578 by the emperor Rudolph IL, and the university was formally
                    opened in 1580. It was at first, however, empowered only to grant degrees in
                    arts; but in 1623 the emperor Ferdinand II. added the permission to create
                    doctors of law and medicine, and also to confer crowns on poets; and in 1697 its
                    faculties were completed by the permission given by the emperor Leopold I. to
                    create doctors of theology. Like Louvain, Altdorf was nominally ruled by the
                    municipality, but in the latter university this power of control remained
                    practically inoperative, and the consequent freedom enjoyed by the community
                    from evils like those which brought about the decline of Louvain is thus
                    described by Hamilton :—“The decline of that great and wealthy seminary
                    (Louvain) was mainly determined by its vicious patronage, both as vested in the
                    university and in the town. Altdorf, on the other hand, was about the poorest
                    university in Germany, and long one of the most eminent. Its whole endowment
                    never rose above £800 a year; and, till the period of its declension, the
                    professors of Altdorf make at least as distinguished a figure in the history of
                    philosophy as those of all the eight universities of the British empire
                    together. On looking closely into its constitution the anomaly is at once
                    solved. The patrician senate of Nuremberg were too intelligent and patriotic to
                    attempt the exercise of such a function. The nomination of professors, though
                    formally ratified by the senate, was virtually made by a board of four curators;
                    and what is worthy of remark, as long as curatorial patronage was a singularity
                    in Germany, Altdorf maintained its relative pre-eminence, losing it only when a
                    similar mean was adopted in the more favoured universities of the empire.”<note

                <p>The conversion of Marburg into a school of Calvinistic doctrine gave occasion to
                    the foundation of the universities of Giessen and of Rinteln. Of these the
                    former, founded by the margrave of Darmstadt, Louis V., as a kind of refuge for
                    the Lutheran professors from Marburg, received its charter from the emperor
                    Rudolph IL, 19th May 1607. When, however, the margraves of Darmstadt acquired
                    possession of Marburg in 1625, the university was transferred thither; in 1650
                    it was moved back again to Giessen. The number of matriculated students at the
                    commencement of the century was about 250; in 1887 it was 484. In common with
                    the other universities of Germany, but with a facility which obtained for it a
                    specially unenviable reputation, Giessen was for a long time wont to confer the
                    degree of doctor <hi rend="italic">in absentia</hi> in the different faculties
                    without requiring adequate credentials. This practice, however, which drew forth
                    an emphatic protest from the eminent historian Mommsen, has within the last few
                    years been entirely abandoned. The university of Rinteln was founded 17th July
                    1621 by the emperor Ferdinand II. Almost immediately after its foundation it
                    became the prey of contending parties in the Thirty Years’ War, and its early
                    development was thus materially hindered. It never, however, attained to much
                    distinction, and in 1819 it was suppressed. The university of Strasburg was
                    founded in 1621 on the basis of an already existing academy, to which the
                    celebrated John Sturm stood, during the latter part of his life, in the relation
                    of “rector perpetuus,” and of which we are told that in 1578 it included more
                    than a thousand scholars, among whom were 200 of the nobility, 24 counts and
                    barons, and three princes. It also attracted students from all parts of Europe,
                    and especially from Portugal, Poland, Denmark, France, and England. The method
                    of Sturm’s teaching became the basis of that of the Jesuits, and through them of
                    the public school instruction in England. In 1621 Ferdinand II. conferred on
                    this academy full privileges as a university; in the language of the charter,
                    “in omnibus facultatibus, doctores, licentiatos, magistros, et baccalaureos,

                <p>The university of Dorpat (now Russian) was founded by Gustavus Adolphus in 1632,
                    and reconstituted by the emperor Alexander I. in 1802. A special interest
                    attaches to this university from the fact that it has for a long time been the
                    scene of the contending influences of Teutonism and Slavonianism. Situated in
                    Livonia, which at the time of its foundation represented a kind of debateable
                    land between Russia and Poland, its gradual monopoly by the former country has
                    not been without resistance and protests on the part of that Teutonic element
                    which was at one time the more potent in its midst. The study of the Slavonic
                    languages has here received considerable stimulus, and by a decree in May 1887
                    the use of the Russian language having been made obligatory in all places of
                    instruction through the Baltic provinces, Russian has now taken the place of
                    German as the language of the lecture-room. Dorpat possesses a fine library of
                    over 80,000 volumes, and is also noted for its admirable botanical collection.

                    J. Baudouin de Courtenay). The general influence of the university has been
                    rapidly extending during the last few years far beyond the Baltic provinces. The
                    number of students, which in 1879 was 1106, in 1886 was 1751.<note

                    having commenced its separate career in the winter session of 1882-83. The

                <p>The repudiation on the part of the Protestant universities of both papal and
                    episcopal authority evoked a counter-demonstration among those centres which
                    still adhered to Catholicism, while their theological intolerance gave rise to a
                    great reaction, under the influence of which the mediaeval Catholic universities
                    were reinvigorated and reorganized (although strictly on the traditional lines),
                    while new and important centres were created. It was on the tide of this
                    reaction, aided by their own skill and sagacity, that the Jesuits were borne to
                    that commanding position which made them for a time the arbiters of education in
                    Europe. The earliest university whose charter represented this reaction was that
                    of Bamberg, founded by the prince-bishop Melchior Otto, after whom it was named
                    “Academia Ottoniana.” It was opened 1st September 1648, and received both from
                    the emperor Frederick III. and Pope Innocent X. all the civil and ecclesiastical
                    privileges of a mediaeval foundation. At first, however, it comprised only the
                    faculties of arts and of theology; to these was added in 1729 that of
                    jurisprudence, and in 1764 that of medicine. In this latter faculty Dr Ignatius
                    Dollinger (the father of the historian) was for a long time a distinguished
                    professor. The university of Innsbruck was founded in 1672 by the emperor
                    Leopold I., from whom it received its name of “Academia Leopoldina.” In the
                    following century, under the patronage of the empress Maria Theresa, it made
                    considerable progress, and received from her its ancient library and bookshelves
                    in 1745. In 1782 the university underwent a somewhat singular change, being
                    reduced by the emperor Joseph II. from the status of a university to that of a
                    lyceum, although retaining in the theological faculty the right of conferring
                    degrees. In 1791 it was restored to its privileges by the emperor Leopold IL,
                    and since that time the faculties of philosophy, law, and medicine have been
                    represented in nearly equal proportions. In 1886 the number of professors was
                    74, and of students 869. The foundation of the university of Breslau was
                    contemplated as early as the year 1505, when Ladislaus, king of Hungary, gave
                    his sanction to the project, but Pope Julius IL, in the assumed interests of
                    Cracow, withheld his assent. Nearly two centuries later, in 1702, under
                    singularly altered conditions, the Jesuits prevailed upon the emperor Leopold I.
                    to found a university without soliciting the papal sanction. When Frederick the
                    Great conquered Silesia in 1741, he took both the university and the Jesuits in
                    Breslau under his protection, and when in 1774 the order was suppressed by
                    Clement XIV. he established them as priests in the Royal Scholastic Institute,
                    at the same time giving new statutes to the university. In 1811 the university
                    was considerably augmented by the incorporation of that at Frankfort-onthe-Oder.
                    At the present time it possesses both a Catholic and a Lutheran faculty. Its
                    medical faculty is in high repute. The total number of students in 1887 was
                    1347.</p>
                <p>In no country was the influence of the Jesuits on the universities more marked
                    than in France. The civil wars in that country during the thirty years which
                    preceded the close of the 16th century told with disastrous effects upon the
                    condition of the university of Paris, and with the commencement of the 17th
                    century its collegiate life seemed at an end, and its forty colleges stood
                    absolutely deserted. To this state of affairs the obstinate conservatism of the
                    academic authorities not a little contributed. The statutes by which the
                    university was still governed were those which had been given by the cardinal
                    D’Estouteville, the papal legate, in 1452, and remained entirely unmodified by
                    the influences of the Renaissance. In 1579 the edict of Blois promulgated a
                    scheme of organization for all the universities of the realm (at that time
                    twenty-one in number),—a measure which, though productive of unity of teaching,
                    did nothing towards the advancement of the studies themselves. The eminent
                    lawyers of France, unable to find chairs in Paris, distributed themselves among
                    the chief towns of the provinces. The Jesuits did not fail to profit by this
                    immobility and excessive conservatism on the part of the university, and during
                    the second half of the 16th century and the whole of the 17 th they had
                    contrived to gain almost a complete monopoly of both the higher and the lower
                    education of provincial France. Their schools arose at Toulouse and Bordeaux, at
                    Auch, Agen, Rhodez, Périgueux, Limoges, Le Puy, Aubenas, Béziers, Tournon, in
                    the colleges of Flanders and Lorraine, Douai and Pont-à-Mousson,—places beyond
                    the jurisdiction of the parlement of Paris or even of the crown of France. Their
                    banishment from Paris itself had been by the decree of the parlement alone, and
                    had never been confirmed by the crown. “Lyons,” says Pattison, “loudly demanded
                    a Jesuit college, and even the Huguenot Lesdiguières, almost king in Dauphiné,
                    was preparing to erect one at Grenoble. Amiens, Rheims, Rouen, Dijon, and
                    Bourges were only w aiting a favourable opportunity to introduce the Jesuits
                    within their walls.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    The university was rescued from the fate which seemed to threaten it only by the
                    excellent statutes given by Richer in 1598, and by the discerning protection
                    extended to it by Henry IV.</p>
                <p>The “college of Edinburgh” was founded by charter of James VI., dated 14th April
                    1582. This document contains no reference to a studium generale, nor is there
                    ground for supposing that the foundation of a university was at that time
                    contemplated. In marked contrast to the three older centres in Scotland, the
                    college rose comparatively untrammelled by the traditions of mediaevalism, and
                    its creation was not effected without some jealousy and opposition on the part
                    of its predecessors. Its first course of instruction was commenced in the Kirk
                    of Field, under the direction of Robert Rollock, who had been educated at St
                    Andrews under Andrew Melville, the eminent Covenanter. “He began to teach,” says
                    Craufurd, “in the lower hall of the great lodging, there being a great concourse
                    of students allured with the great worth of the man; but diverse of them being
                    not ripe enough in the Latin tongue, were in November next put under the charge
                    of Mr Duncan Name,. . . who, upon Mr Rollock’s recommendation, was chosen second
                    master of the college.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    condition of the German universities, resulting in not a few instances in the

                    method of study, combined with a passionate dogmatism in matters of religious
                    belief, and a rude contempt for the amenities of social intercourse, became the
                    leading characteristics, and lasted throughout the 17 th century. But in the
                    year 1693 the foundation of the university of Halle opened up a career to two
                    very eminent men, whose influence, widely different as was its character, may be
                    compared for its effects with that of Luther and Melanchthon, and served to
                    modify the whole current of German philosophy and German theology. Halle has
                    indeed been described as “the first real modern university.” It was really
                    indebted for its origin to a spirit of rivalry between the -conservatism of
                    Saxony and the progressive tendencies of the house of Brandenburg, but the
                    occasion of its rise was the removal of the ducal court from Halle to Magdeburg.
                    The archbishopric of the 1atter city having passed into the possession of
                    Brandenburg in 1680 was changed into a dukedom, and the city itself was selected
                    as the ducal residence. This change left unoccupied some commodious buildings in
                    Halle, which it was decided to utilize for purposes of education. A
                    “Ritterschule” for the sons of the nobility was opened, and in the course of a
                    few years it was decided to found a university. Saxony endeavoured to thwart the
                    scheme, urging the proximity of Leipsic; but her opposition was overruled by the
                    emperor Leopold L, who granted (19th October 1693) the requisite charter, and in
                    the following year the work of the university commenced. Frankfort-on-the-Oder
                    had by this time become a centre of the Reformed party, and the primary object
                    in founding a university in Halle was to create a centre for the Lutheran party,
                    but its character, under the influence of its two most notable teachers,
                    Christian Thomasius and A. H. Francke, soon expanded beyond the limits of this
                    conception to assume a highly original form. Thomasius and Francke had both been
                    driven from Leipsic owing to the disfavour with which their liberal and
                    progressive tendencies were there regarded by the academic authorities, and on
                    many points the two teachers were in agreement. They both regarded with contempt
                    alike the scholastic philosophy and the scholastic theology; they both desired
                    to see the rule of the civil power superseding that of the ecclesiastical power
                    in the seats of learning; they were both opposed to the ascendency of classical
                    studies as expounded by the humanists—Francke regarding the Greek and Roman
                    pagan writers with the old traditional dislike, as immoral, while Thomasius
                    looked upon them with contempt, as antiquated and representing only a standpoint
                    which had been long left behind; both again agreed as to the desirability of
                    including the elements of modern culture in the education of the young. But here
                    their agreement ceased. It was the aim of Thomasius, as far as possible, to
                    secularize education, and to introduce among his countrymen French habits and
                    French modes of thought; his own attire was gay and fashionable, and he was in
                    the habit of taking his seat in the professorial chair adorned with gold chain
                    and rings, and with his dagger by his side. Francke, who became the leader of
                    the Pietists, regarded all this with even greater aversion than he did the
                    lifeless orthodoxy traditional in the universities, and was shocked at the
                    worldly tone and disregard for sacred things which characterized his brother
                    professor. Both, however, commanded a considerable following among the students.
                    Thomasius was professor in the faculty of jurisprudence, Francke in that of
                    theology. And it was a common prediction in those days with respect to a student
                    who proposed to pursue his academic career at Halle, that he would infallibly
                    become either an atheist or a Pietist. But the services rendered by Thomasius to
                    learning were genuine and lasting. He was the first to set the example, soon
                    after followed by all the universities of Germany, of lecturing in the
                    vernacular instead of in the customary Latin; and the discourse in which he
                    first departed from the traditional method was devoted to the consideration of
                    how far the German nation might with advantage imitate the French in matters of
                    social life and intercourse. His more general views, as a disciple of the
                    Cartesian philosophy and founder of the modern Rationalismus, exposed him to
                    incessant attacks; but by the establishment of a monthly journal (at that time
                    an original idea) he obtained a channel for expounding his views and refuting
                    his antagonists which gave him a great advantage. On the influence of Francke,
                    as the founder of that Pietistic school with which the reputation of Halle
                    afterwards became especially identified, it is unnecessary here to dilate.<note

                    assertor of the new culture, was driven from Halle by the accusations of the
                    Pietists, who declared that his teaching was fraught with atheistical
                    principles. In 1740, however, he was recalled by Frederick IL, and reinstated in
                    high office with every mark of consideration and respect. Throughout the whole
                    of the 18th century Halle was the leader of academic thought and culture in
                    Protestant Germany, although sharing that leadership, after the middle of the
                    century, with Göttingen. The university of Göttingen (named after its founder
                    “Georgia Augusta ”) was endowed with the amplest privileges as a university by
                    George II. of England, elector of Hanover, 7th December 1736. The imperial
                    sanction of the scheme had been given three years before (13th January 1733),
                    and the university was formally opened 17th September 1737. The king himself
                    assumed the office of “rector magnificentissimus,” and the liberality of the
                    royal endowments (doubling those of Halle), and the not less liberal character
                    of the spirit that pervaded its organization, soon raised it to a foremost place
                    among the schools of Germany. Halle had just expelled Wolf; and Göttingen,
                    modelled on the same lines as Halle, but rejecting its Pietism and disclaiming
                    its intolerance, appealed with remarkable success to the most enlightened
                    feeling of the time. It included all the faculties, and two of its first
                    professors—Mosheim, the eminent theologian, from Helmstadt, and Böhmer, the no
                    less distinguished jurist, from Halle—together with Gesner, the man of letters,
                    at once established its reputation. Much of its early success was also due to
                    the supervision of its chief curator (there were two),—Baron Miinchausen,
                    himself a man of considerable attainments, who by his sagacious superintendence
                    did much to promote the general efficiency of the whole professoriate. Not least
                    among its attractions was also its splendid library, located in an ancient
                    monastery, and now containing over 200,000 volumes and 5000 MSS. In addition to
                    its general influence as a distinguished seat of learning, Göttingen may claim
                    to have been mainly instrumental in diffusing a more adequate conception of the
                    importance of the study of history. Before the latter half of the 18th century
                    the mode of treatment adopted by university lecturers was singularly wanting in
                    breadth of view. Profane history was held of but little account, excepting so
                    far as it served to illustrate ecclesiastical and sacred history, while this,
                    again, was invariably treated in the narrow spirit of the polemic, intent mainly
                    on the defence of his own confession, according as he represented the Lutheran
                    or the Reformed Church. The labours of the professors at Göttingen, especially
                    Putter, Gatterer, Schlözer, and Spittier, combined with those of Mascov at
                    Leipsic, did much towards promoting both a more catholic treatment and a wider
                    scope. Not less beneficial was the example set at Göttingen of securing the
                    appointment of its professors by a less prejudiced and partial body than a
                    university <pb break="no"

                    Münchausen,’ says an illustrious professor of that seminary, 'allowed our

                    little as the right of free election; for he was taught by experience that,

                    to supply their vacant chairs, <hi rend="italic">they are seldom or never

                    identical with that which had already been instituted in the universities of the
                    Netherlands by Douza (see <hi rend="italic">infra,</hi> p. 850). The university
                    of Erlangen, a Lutheran centre, was founded by Frederick, margrave of Baireuth.
                    Its charter was granted by the emperor Charles VII., 21st February 1743, and the
                    university was formally constituted, 4th November. From its special guardian,
                    Alexander, the last margrave of Ansbach, it was styled “Academia Alexandrina.”
                    In 1791, Ansbach and Baireuth having passed into the possession of Prussia,
                    Erlangen became subject to the Prussian Government. The number of the students,
                    which at the commencement of the century was under 300, was 880 in 1887.</p>
                <p>On comparison with the great English universities, the universities of Germany
                    must be pronounced inferior both in point of discipline and of moral control
                    over the students. The superiority of the former in these respects is partly to
                    be attributed to the more systematic care which they took, from a very early
                    date, for the supervision of each student, by requiring that within a certain
                    specified time after his entry into the university he should be registered as a
                    pupil of some master of arts, who was responsible for his conduct, and
                    represented him generally in his relations to the academic authorities. Marburg
                    in its earliest statutes (those of 1529) endeavoured to establish a similar
                    rule, but without success.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    was very much of the same character (Koch. <hi rend="italic">Gcsch. des

                    Although again, as in the German universities, feuds were not unfrequent,
                    especially those between “north” and “south” (the natives of the northern and
                    southern counties), the fact that in elections to fellowships and scholarships
                    only a certain proportion were allowed to be taken from either of these
                    divisions acted as a considerable check upon the possibility of any one college
                    representing either element exclusively. In the German universities, on the
                    other hand, the ancient division into nations, which died out with the 15th
                    century, was revived under another form by the institution of national colleges,
                    which largely served to foster the spirit of rivalry and contention. The
                    demoralization induced by the Thirty Years’ War and the increase of duelling
                    intensified these tendencies, which, together with the tyranny of the older over
                    the younger students, known as “Pennalismus,” were evils against which the
                    authorities contended, but ineffectually, by various ordinances. The institution
                    of “Burschenthum,” having for its design the encouragement of good fellowship
                    and social feeling irrespective of nationality, served only as a partial check
                    upon these excesses, which again received fresh stimulus by the rival
                    institution of “Landsmannschaften,” or societies of the same nationality. The
                    latter proved singularly provocative of duelling, while the arrogant and even
                    tyranni cal demeanour of their members towards the unassociated students gave
                    rise to a general combination of the latter for the purposes of self-defence and
                    organized resistance. At all the great German universities both these forms of
                    association are to be found existing at the present day.</p>
                <p>The political storms which marked the close of the last and the commencement of
                    the present century gave the death-blow' to not a few of the ancient
                    universities of Germany. Mainz and Cologne ceased to exist in 1798; Bamberg,
                    Dillingen, and Duisberg in 1804; Rinteln and Helmstadt in 1809; Salzburg in
                    1810; Erfurt in 1816. Altdorf was united to Erlangen in 1807,
                    Frankfort-onthe-Oder to Breslau in 1809, and Wittenberg to Halle in 1815. The
                    university of Ingolstadt was first moved in 1802 to Landshut, and from thence in
                    1826 to Munich, where it was united to the academy of sciences which was founded
                    in the Bavarian capital in 1759. Of those of the above centres which altogether
                    ceased to exist but few, however, were much missed or regretted,—that at Mainz,
                    which had numbered some six hundred students, being the one notable exception.
                    The others had for the most part fallen into a perfunctory and 1ifeless mode of
                    teaching, and, with wasted or diminished revenues and declining numbers, had
                    long ceased worthily to represent the functions of a university. Whatever loss
                    may have attended their suppression has been far more than compensated by the
                    activity and influence of the three great German universities which have risen
                    in the present century. Munich has become a distinguished centre of study in all
                    the faculties; and its numbers, allowing for the two great wars, have been
                    continuously on the increase. The number of its professors in 1887 was over
                    ninety, and that of its students at the commencement of the session 1886-87
                    3209.</p>
                <p>The university of Berlin, known as the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm university, was
                    founded in 1809, immediately after the peace of Tilsit, when Prussia had been
                    reduced to the level of a third-rate power. Under the guiding influence of
                    Wilhelm von Humboldt, however, the principles which were adopted in connexion
                    with the new seat of learning not only raised it to a foremost place among the
                    universities of Europe, but also largely conduced to the regeneration of
                    Germany. A notable characteristic in the university of Berlin at the time of its
                    foundation was its entire repudiation of attachment to any particular creed or
                    school of thought, and professed subservience only to the interests of science
                    and learning. “Each of the eminent teachers with whom the university began its
                    life—F. A. Wolf, Fichte, Savigny, Reil—represented only himself, the path of
                    inquiry or the completed theory which he had himself propounded. Its subsequent
                    growth was astonishing. In 1813 Berlin had only 36 teachers altogether; in 1860
                    there were 173 in all,—97 professors, 66 privatdocenten, and 7 lecturers.” Iτi
                    1886 there were 296 teachers and 5357 students; and among the former a large
                    proportion of the names are already of world-wide reputation, while its
                    classical school stands unrivalled in Europe.</p>
                <p>The university of Bonn, founded in 1818, and known as the Rhenish Friedrich
                    Wilhelm university, has 88 professors and 1125 students. Equally distinguished
                    as a school of philosophy and a school of theology, it is notable for the manner
                    in which it combines the opposed schools of theological doctrine,—that of the
                    Evangelical (or Lutheran) Church and that of the Roman Catholic Church here
                    standing side by side, and both adorned by eminent names. This combination
                    (which also exists at Tübingen and at Breslau) has been attended with complete
                    success and (according to Dr Dollinger) with unmistakable advantages. When
                    tried, however, a generation before, at Erfurt and at Heidelberg, its failure
                    was not less conspicuous, and Erfurt was ruined by the experiment.</p>

                <p>Dr Conrad, professor of political science at Halle, lias recently made the
                    statistics relating to the German universities the subject of a careful
                    investigation and analysis, which offer some interesting results. The total cost
                    of the universities of the German empire is shown to be much smaller than the
                    total revenues of the English universities and colleges, although the number
                    both of professors and students is much larger, and although 42 per cent, of the
                    total expenditure is upon establishments, such as hospitals, museums, and so
                    forth. But in Germany 72 per cent, of the cost of the universities is defrayed
                    by the state, the students paying, in the shape of fees, only 9 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 3 per cent. To a great extent, how ever, the German
                    universities are to be looked upon as professional schools, giving an education
                    which directly fits a man to earn his bread as a clergyman, a lawyer, a judge, a
                    physician, a schoolmaster, a chemist, an engineer, or an agriculturist.
                    Notwithstanding the rapid growth in the numbers of the students, the growth of
                    the professoriate has fully kept pace with it. In 1880 there were 1809 teachers
                    at work in the German universities, more than half of whom (967) were full
                    professors (“ordinarii”),—the proportion of teachers to students being 1 to 11.
                    This is a much higher proportion than that of Oxford and Cambridge, although in
                    them there is a large staff of college lecturers, which is practically more
                    important than the university staff. It is higher again than the proportion of
                    the Scottish universities, where there are only some 105 professors to between
                    5000 and 6000 students, a proportion of 1 to between 50 and 60 students. The
                    increase in Germany has taken place partly by adding on fresh teachers for the
                    old subjects, such as Latin and Greek, but still more by founding new chairs for
                    new subjects, such as Oriental and Romance languages, geography, and
                    archaeology, and by subdividing departments which have been recently developed,
                    such as those connected with political economy, political science, physiology,
                    and biology. Owing to the great development of natural science, the faculty of
                    philosophy has at some centres increased to such an extent as to equal in
                    numbers all the other faculties put together. This inconvenience has been
                    differently met at different universities. In those of Switzerland, no further
                    remedy has been devised than that of appointing separate syndicates or boards of
                    management for the two main divisions,—the philosophico-historic and the
                    mathematical and natural-scientific; at Dorpat, Tübingen, and Strasburg, on the
                    other hand, these divisions have been represented by the formation of two
                    distinct faculties; while Tübingen, Munich, and Würzburg have created, in
                    addition, a third faculty under which are grouped the several subjects of
                    political economy, statistics, and finance.</p>
                <p>The following table (taken from Conrad) exhibits the average of the total number
                    of matriculated students at the German universities for every five years from
                    1831 to 1884; it brings the tendency to form large centres very forcibly before
                    the view. The three largest centres—Berlin, Leipsic, Munich—even in the first
                    quinquennium appear as absorbing no less than 35 per cent, of the students, and
                    in the last as many as 42 per cent. At the same time, there has lately been a no
                    less notable increase among the centres of second magnitude. A quarter of a
                    century ago only two universities had more than a thousand students; at present
                    there are nine.</p>

                <p>In 1878 a comparison of the numbers of the students in the different faculties in
                    the Prussian universities with those for the year 1867 showed a remarkable
                    diminution in the faculty of theology, amounting in Lutheran centres to more
                    than one-half, and in Catholic centres to nearly three-fourths. In jurisprudence
                    there was an increase of nearly two-fifths, in medicine a decline of a third,
                    and in philosophy an increase of one-fourth. During the last few years, however,
                    the faculties of theology have made some progress towards regaining their former
                    numbers.</p>
                <p>The universities of the United Provinces, like those of Protestant Germany, were
                    founded by the state as schools for the maintenance of the principles of the
                    Reformation and the education of the clergy, and afforded in the 16 th and 17th
                    centuries a grateful refuge to not a few of those Huguenot or Port-Royalist
                    scholars whom persecution compelled to flee beyond the boundaries of France, as
                    well as to the Puritan clergy who were driven from England. The earliest, that
                    of Leyden, founded in 1575, commemorated the gallant and successful resistance
                    of the citizens to the Spanish fleet under Requesens. Throughout the 17th
                    century Leyden was distinguished by its learning, the ability of its professors,
                    and the shelter it afforded to the more liberal thought associated at that
                    period with Arminianism. Much of its early success was owing to the wise
                    provisions and the influence of the celebrated James Douza
                    :—“Douza’sprinciples,” says Hamilton, “were those which ought to regulate the
                    practice of all academical patrons; and they were those of his successors. He
                    knew that at the rate learning was seen prized by the state in the academy would
                    it be valued by the nation at large. . . . . He knew that professors wrought
                    more even by example and influence than by teaching, that it was theirs to pitch
                    high or low the standard of learning in a country, and that, as it proved easy
                    or arduous to come up with them, they awoke either a restless endeavour after an
                    even loftier attainment, or lulled into a self-satisfied conceit.” Douza was,
                    for Leyden and the Dutch, what Münchausen afterwards was for Göttingen and the
                    German universities. “But with this difference: Leyden was the model on which
                    the younger universities of the republic were constructed; Göttingen the model
                    on which the older universities of the empire were reformed. Both Münchausen and
                    Douza proposed a high ideal for the schools founded under their auspices; and
                    both, as first curators, laboured with paramount influence in realizing this
                    ideal for the same long period of thirty-two years. Under their patronage Leyden
                    and Göttingen took the highest place among the universities of Europe; and both
                    have only lost their relative supremacy by the application in other seminaries
                    of the same measures which had at first determined their superiority.” The
                    appointment of the professors at Leyden was vested in three (afterwards five)
                    curators, one of whom was selected from the body of the nobles, while the other
                    two were appointed by the states of the province,—the office being held for nine
                    years, and eventually for life. With these was associated the mayor of Leyden
                    for the time being. The university of Franeker was founded in 1585 on a somewhat
                    less liberal basis than Leyden, the professors being required to declare their
                    assent to the rule of faith embodied in the Heidelberg Catechism and the
                    confession of the “Belgian Church.” Its four faculties were those of theology,
                    jurisprudence, medicine, and “the three languages and the liberal arts.”<note

                    been driven by Bancroft from Cambridge and from England. His fame and ability
                    are said to have attracted to Franeker students from Hungary, Poland, and
                    Russia.</p>

                    Orange, and establishment of the kingdom of the Netherlands (23d March 1815),
                    was followed by important changes in connexion with the whole kingdom. The
                    universities of Franeker and Harderwijk were suppressed, while their place was
                    taken by the newly-founded centres at Ghent (1816) and Liège (1816). A uniform
                    constitution was given both to the Dutch and Belgian universities. It was also
                    provided that there should be attached to each a board of curators, consisting
                    of five persons, “distinguished by their love of literature and science and by
                    their rank in society.” These curators were to be nominated by the king, and at
                    least three of them chosen from the province in which the university was
                    situated, while the other two were to be chosen from adjacent provinces. After
                    the redivision of the kingdom in 1831, Ghent and Liège were constituted state
                    universities, and each received a subsidy from the Government (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Belgium).</hi> The university of Brussels, on the other hand,
                    founded in 1834, is an independent institution, supported by the liberal party;
                    while the reconstituted university at Louvain represents the party of Roman
                    Catholicism, and is almost exclusively a theological school for the education of
                    the Catholic clergy. The universities of Belgium are, however, somewhat
                    heterogeneous bodies, and present in their organization a singular combination
                    of French and German institutions. In Holland, the foundation of the university
                    of Amsterdam (1877) has more than repaired the loss of Franeker and Harderwijk,
                    and the progress of this new centre during the ten years of its existence has
                    been remarkably rapid, so that it bids fair to rival, if not to outstrip, both
                    Utrecht and Leyden. The higher education of women has made some progress in the
                    Netherlands; and in 1882-83 there were eighteen women studying at Amsterdam,
                    eleven at Groningen, four at Leyden, and seven at Utrecht.</p>
                <p>In Sweden the university of Lund, founded in 1668 and modelled on the same plan
                    as its predecessor at Upsala, has adhered to its antiquated constitution with
                    remarkable tenacity. At both these universities the mediaeval division into
                    “nations” is still in force among the students, the number at Upsala being no
                    less than thirteen. The professoriate at both centres is much below the modern
                    requirements in point of numbers. The university of Christiania in Norway,
                    founded in 1811, and the Swedish universities are strongly Lutheran in
                    character; and all alike are closely associated with the ecclesiastical
                    institutions of the Scandinavian kingdoms. The same observation applies to
                    Copenhagen,—where, however, the labours of Rask and Madvig have done much to
                    sustain the reputation of the university for learning. The university of Kiel
                    (1665), on the other hand, has come much more under Teutonic influences, and is
                    now a distinguished centre of scientific teaching.</p>
                <p>In France the fortunes of academic learning were even less happy than in Germany.
                    The university of Paris was distracted, throughout the 17th century, by
                    theological dissensions,—in the first instance owing to the struggle that ensued
                    after the Jesuits had effected a footing at the Collège de Clermont, and
                    subsequently by the strife occasioned by the teaching of the Jansenists. Its
                    studies, discipline, and numbers alike suffered. Towards the close of the
                    century a certain revival took place, and a succession of illustrious
                    names—Pourchot, Rollin, Grenan, Coffin, Demontempuys, Crevier, Lebeau—appear on
                    the roll of its teachers. But this improvement was soon interrupted by the
                    controversies excited by the promulgation <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n888/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0888-0851"/> of the bull Unigenitus in 1713, condemning the
                    tenets of Quesnel, when Rollin himself, although a man of singularly pacific
                    disposition, deemed it his duty to head the opposition to Clement XI. and the
                    French episcopate. At last, in 1762, the parlement of Paris issued a decree
                    (August 6) placing the colleges of the Jesuits at the disposal of the
                    university, and this was immediately followed by another for the expulsion of
                    the order from Paris. Concurrently with this measure the prospects of the
                    university assumed a more favourable character, the curriculum of its studies
                    was extended, and both history and natural science began to be cultivated with a
                    certain success. These better prospects were, however, soon obscured by the
                    outbreak of the Revolution; and on the 15th September 1793 the universities and
                    colleges throughout France, together with the faculties of theology, medicine,
                    jurisprudence, and arts, were abolished by a decree of the Convention. The
                    College de France, when restored in 1831, was reconstituted mainly as a school
                    of adult instruction, for the most part of a popular character, and entirely
                    dissociated from the university. It now numbers thirty-nine chairs, among which
                    is one of the Slavonic languages and literature. The university of France (which
                    succeeded to that of Paris) is at present little more than an abstract term,
                    signifying the whole of the professional body under state control, and
                    comprising various faculties at different centres—Paris, Montpellier, Nancy,
                    &amp;c., together with twenty-seven academical rectorales. Each of these rectors
                    presides over a local “conseil d’enseignement,” in conjunction with which he
                    elects the professors of lycées and the communal schoolmasters, whose formal
                    appointment is then made by the minister of public instruction. There are
                    ecclesiastics in some of the conseils d’enseignement, but the rectors are all
                    laymen who have graduated in one of the faculties. The great schools have also
                    in no small measure supplemented the work of the universities by their advance
                    in the direction of scientific instruction. Among the number the “École Pratique
                    des Hautes Études” in Paris (31st July 1868) and the “École Polytechnique,”
                    which traces its origin as far back as the year 1794, are especially
                    distinguished. The course of instruction at the former is divided into five
                    sections—(1) mathematics, (2) physics and chemistry, (3) natural history and
                    physiology, (4) history and philology, (5) economic science. At the latter the
                    instruction is conceived solely with regard to the application of scientific
                    principles to all branches of the public service, but more especially the
                    military and mercantile. In 1875 the National Assembly passed an Act which
                    enabled the Roman Catholic body to establish free universities of their own, and
                    to confer degrees which should be of the same validity as those of the state
                    university. At Lille and Angers such centres have been already organized. The
                    university of Strasburg, which in the latter part of the last century had been
                    distinguished by an intellectual activity which became associated with the names
                    of Goethe, Herder, and others, was also swept away by the Revolution. It was,
                    however, restored 1st May 1872, after the city had reverted to Germany, and was
                    remodelled entirely on German principles. Since then its success has been marked
                    and continuous.</p>
                <p>In Switzerland all the higher education is supported mainly by the German and
                    Protestant cantons. The four universities of Basel, Bern, Zurich, and Geneva
                    have an aggregate of some 1400 or 1500 students, and all possess faculties of
                    philosophy, jurisprudence, theology, and medicine. Basel is, however, the chief
                    centre for theology, as is Bern for jurisprudence and Zurich for philosophy. At
                    Geneva the famous academy of the 16th and 17th centuries, long distinguished as
                    a centre of Calvinistic teaching, is now represented by a university (first
                    formed in 1876), where the instruction is given (mainly in the French language)
                    by a staff of forty-one professors, and where there is a rising school of
                    science. Switzerland almost takes the lead in connexion with female education on
                    the Continent, and in 1882-83 there were 52 women at the university of Geneva,
                    36 at Bern, and 24 at Zurich.</p>
                <p>In Spain the universities at present existing are those of Barcelona, Granada,
                    Madrid (transferred in 1837 from Alcala), Oviedo, Salamanca, Santiago, Seville,
                    Valencia, Valladolid, and Zaragoza. They are all, with the exception perhaps of
                    Madrid, in a lamentably depressed condition, and mainly under the influence of
                    French ideas and modelled on French examples. But in Portugal, Coimbra, which
                    narrowly escaped suppression in the 16th century as a suspected centre of
                    political disaffection, is now a flourishing school. Its instruction is given
                    gratis; but, as all members of the higher courts of judicature and
                    administration in the realm are required to have graduated at the university, it
                    is at the same time one of the most aristocratic schools in Europe. There are
                    five faculties, viz., theology, jurisprudence, medicine, mathematics, and
                    philosophy. Of these, that of law is by far the most flourishing, the number of
                    students in this faculty nearly equalling the aggregate of all the rest. There
                    is a valuable library, largely composed of collections formerly belonging to
                    suppressed convents. As a school of theology Coimbra is distinctly
                    anti-ultramontane, and the progressive spirit of the university is shown by the
                    fact that the rector has been instructed by the government to devise a scheme
                    for the admission of women.</p>
                <p>In Italy the universities are numerically much in excess of the requirements of
                    the population, there being no less than sixteen state universities and four
                    free universities. Very few of these possess theological faculties, and in no
                    country are theological studies less valued. Education for the church is almost
                    entirely given at the numerous “seminaries,” where it is of an almost entirely
                    elementary character. In 1875 a laudable effort was made by Bonghi, the minister
                    of education, to introduce reforms and to assimilate the universities in their
                    organization and methods to the German type. His plans were, however, to a great
                    extent reversed by his successor, Coppino.</p>
                <p>In Austria the universities, being modelled on the same system as that of
                    Prussia, present no especially noteworthy features. Vienna is chiefly
                    distinguished for its school of medicine, which enjoyed in the last century a
                    reputation almost unrivalled in Europe. The other faculties were, however,
                    suffered to languish, and throughout the first half of the present century the
                    whole university was in an extremely depressed state. From this condition it was
                    in a great measure restored by the exertions of Count Thun. The number of the
                    matriculated students in 1887 was 4893, and that of the professors 138; among
                    the latter the names of Zschokke, Maassen, Sickel, Jellinek, and Büdinger are
                    some of the most widely known. The university of Olmütz, founded in 1581, was
                    formerly in possession of what is now the imperial library, and contained also a
                    valuable collection of Slavonic works which were carried off by the Swedes and
                    ultimately dispersed. It was suppressed in 1853, and is now represented on!y by
                    a theological faculty. The university of Graz, the capita! of Styria, was
                    founded in 1586, and is now one of the most flourishing centres, containing some
                    1200 students. The university of Salzburg, founded in 1623, was suppressed in
                    1810; that of Lemberg, founded in 1784 by the emperor Joseph II., was removed in
                    1805 to Cracow and united to that university. In 1816 it was opened on an
                    independent basis. In the bombardment of the town in 1848 the university
                    buildings were burnt down, and the site was changed to what was formerly a
                    Jesuit convent The fine library and natural history museum were at the same time
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n889/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0889-0852"/> almost entirely destroyed. The university at the
                    present time numbers over a thousand students. The most recent foundation is
                    that of Czernowitz, founded in 1875, and numbering about 300 students. The
                    universities of the Hungarian kingdom are three in number :—Budapest, originally
                    founded at Tyrnau in 1635, now possessing four faculties—theology,
                    jurisprudence, medicine, and philosophy (number of professors in 1885 180,
                    students 3117); Kolozsvar (Klausenburg), now the chief Magyar centre, founded in
                    1872 and also comprising four faculties, but where mathematics and natural
                    science supply the place of theology (number of professors in 1877 64, students
                    391); Zágráb (Agram), the Slovack university, in Croatia, founded in 1869 but
                    not opened until 1874, with three faculties, viz., jurisprudence, theology, and
                    philosophy. The chief centre of Protestant education is the college at
                    Debreczin, founded in 1531, which in past times was not unfrequently subsidized
                    from England. It now numbers over 2000 students, and possesses a fine
                    library.</p>
                <p>Russia possesses, besides Dorpat <hi rend="italic">(supra,</hi> p. 845), seven
                    other universities. (1) Helsingfors, in Finland, was originally established by
                    Queen Christina in Âbo (1640), and removed in 1826 to Helsingfors, where the
                    original charter, signed by the celebrated Oxenstierna, is still preserved. It
                    has four faculties, 38 professors, and 700 students. (2) Moscow is really the
                    oldest Russian university, having been founded in 1755; it includes the
                    faculties of history, physics, jurisprudence, and medicine; the professors are
                    69 in number, the students about 1660. (3) The university of St Vladimir at
                    Kieff, originally founded at Vilna in 1803, was removed from thence to Kieff in
                    1833; the students number about 900, and the library contains 107,000 volumes.
                    (4) Kazan (1804) includes the same faculties as Moscow; the students are about
                    450 in number, and it has a library containing 80,000 volumes. (5) Kharkoff
                    (1804) numbers 600 students, and its library 55,000 volumes. (6) St Petersburg
                    (1819) includes the four faculties of history, physics, jurisprudence, and
                    Oriental languages, and numbers 1500 students. (7) Odessa, founded in 1865,
                    represents the university of New Russia. Generally speaking, the universities of
                    Russia are not frequented by the aristocratic classes; they are largely
                    subsidized by the Government, and the annual fees payable by students are less
                    than &lt;£7 a head. In 1863 the statutes of all the universities were
                    remodelled; and since that time there has been a tendency to impress upon them a
                    more national character, as distinguished from mere imitation of those in
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>The university of Athens (founded 22d May 1837) is modelled on the university
                    systems of northern Germany, on a plan originally devised by Professor Brandis.
                    It includes four faculties, viz., theology, jurisprudence, medicine, and
                    philosophy. The professors (ordinary and extraordinary) are upwards of 60 in
                    number, the students about 1500. There is also a school of pharmacy, chemistry,
                    and anatomy, and a library of 130,000 volumes, with 800 manuscripts.</p>
                <p>The history of the two English universities during the 16 th and following
                    centuries has presented, for the most part, features which contrast strongly
                    with those of the Continental seats of learning. Both suffered severely from
                    confiscation of their lands and revenues during the period of the Reformation,
                    but otherwise have generally enjoyed a remarkable immunity from the worst
                    consequences of civil and political strife and actual warfare. Both long
                    remained centres chiefly of theological teaching, but their intimate connexion
                    at once with the state and with the Church of England, as “by law established,”
                    and the modifications introduced into their constitutions, prevented their
                    becoming arenas of fierce polemical contentions like those which distracted the
                    Protestant universities of Germany.</p>
                <p>The influence of the Renaissance, and the teaching of Erasmus, who resided for
                    some time at both universities, exercised a notable effect alike at Oxford and
                    at Cambridge. The names of Colet, Grocyn, and Linacre illustrate this influence
                    at the former centre; those of Bishop Fisher, Sir John Cheke, and Sir Thomas
                    Smith at the latter. The labours of Erasmus at Cambridge, as the author of a new
                    Latin version of the New Testament, with the design of placing in the hands of
                    students a text free from the errors of the Vulgate, were productive of
                    important effects, and the university became a centre of Reformation doctrine
                    some years before the writings of Luther became known in England. The foundation
                    of Christ’s College (1505) and St John’s College (1511), through the influence
                    of Fisher with the countess of Richmond, also materially aided the general
                    progress of learning at Cambridge. The Royal Injunctions of 1535, embodying the
                    views and designs of Thomas Cromwell, mark the downfall of the old scholastic
                    methods of study at both universities; and the foundation of Trinity College,
                    Cambridge, in 1546 (partly by an amalgamation of two older societies),
                    represents the earliest conception of such an institution in England in complete
                    independence of Roman Catholic traditions. Trinity (1554) and St John’s (1555)
                    at Oxford, on the other hand, founded during the reactionary reign of Mary,
                    serve rather as examples of a transitional period.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Elizabeth Cambridge became the centre of another great
                    movement—that of the earlier Puritanism, St John’s and Queens’ being the
                    strongholds of the party led by Cartwright, Walter Travers, and others.
                    Whitaker, the eminent master of St John’s, although he sympathized to some
                    extent with these views, strove to keep their expression within limits
                    compatible with conformity to the Church of England. But the movement continued
                    to gather strength; and Emmanuel College, founded in 1584, owed much of its
                    early prosperity to the fact that it was a known school of Puritan doctrine.
                    Most of the Puritans objected to the discipline enforced by the university and
                    ordinary college statutes—especially the wearing of the cap and the surplice and
                    the conferring of degrees in divinity. The Anglican party, headed by such men as
                    Whitgift and Bancroft, resorted in defence to a repressive policy, of which
                    subscription to the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity, and the Elizabethan
                    statutes of 1570 (investing the “caput” with larger powers, and thereby creating
                    a more oligarchical form of government), were the most notable results. Oxford,
                    although the Puritans were there headed by Leicester, the chancellor, devised at
                    the same time a similar scheme, the rigid discipline of which was further
                    developed in the Laudian or Caroline statutes of 1636. It was under these
                    respective codes—the Elizabethan statutes of 1570 and the Laudian statutes of
                    1636—that the two universities were governed until the introduction of the new
                    codes of 1858. During the Commonwealth the Puritan occupation and
                    administration, at either university, were accompanied by little injury to the
                    colleges, and were far less prejudicial to learning than the Royalist writers of
                    the Restoration would lead us to suppose. William Dell, who was master of Caius
                    College from 1649 to 1660, advocated the formation of schools of higher
                    instruction in the large towns, a proposal which was then looked upon as one of
                    but faintly masked hostility to the older centres.</p>
                <p>During the 17th century Cambridge became the centre <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> of another movement, a reflex of the influence of the Cartesian
                    philosophy, which attracted for a time considerable attention. Its leaders,
                    known as the Cambridge <pb break="no"

                    whichcote were especially conspicuous, were men of high character and great
                    learning, although too much under the influence of an ill-restrained enthusiasm
                    and purely speculative doctrines. The spread of the Baconian philosophy, and the
                    example of a succession of eminent scientific thinkers, among whom were Isaac
                    Barrow, master of Trinity (1673-77), the two Lucasian professors, Isaac Newton
                    (prof. 1669-1702) and his successor william Whiston (prof. 1702-11), and Roger
                    Cotes (Plumian prof. 1707-16), began to render the exact sciences more and more
                    an object of study, and the institution of the tripos examinations in the course
                    of the first half of the 18th century established the reputation of Cambridge as
                    a school of mathematical science. At Oxford, where no similar development took
                    place, and where the statutable requirements with respect to study and exercises
                    were suffered to fall into neglect, the degeneracy of the whole community as a
                    school of academic culture is attested by evidence too emphatic to be gainsaid.
                    The moral tone at both universities was at this time singularly low; and the
                    rise of Methodism, as associated with the names of the two Wesleys and
                    Whitefield at Oxford and that of Berridge at Cambridge, operated with greater
                    effect upon the nation at large than on either of the two centres where it had
                    its origin. With the advance of the present century, however, a perceptible
                    change took place. The labours of Simeon at Cambridge, in connexion with the
                    Evangelical party, and the far more celebrated movement known as Tractarianism,
                    at Oxford, exercised considerable influence in developing a more thoughtful
                    spirit at either university. At both centres, also, the range of studies was
                    extended: written examinations took the place of the often merely formal <hi
                    rend="italic">viva voce</hi> ceremonies; at Cambridge classics were raised in
                    1824 to the dignity of a new tripos. The number of the students at both
                    universities was largely augmented. Further schemes of improvement were put
                    forward and discussed. And in 1850 it was decided by the Government to appoint
                    commissioners to inquire what additional reforms might advantageously be
                    introduced. Their recommendations were not all carried into effect, but the main
                    results were as follows :—“The professoriate was considerably increased,
                    reorganized, and re-endowed, by means of contributions from colleges. The
                    colleges were emancipated from their mediaeval statutes, were invested with new
                    constitutions, and acquired new legislative powers. The fellowships were almost
                    universally thrown open to merit, and the effect of this was not merely to
                    provide ample rewards for the highest academical attainments, but to place the
                    governing power within colleges in the hands of able men, likely to promote
                    further improvements. The number and value of scholarships was largely
                    augmented, and many, though not all, of the restrictions upon them were
                    abolished. The great mass of vexatious and obsolete oaths was swept away; and,
                    though candidates for the M.A. degree and persons elected to fellowships were
                    still required to make the old subscriptions and declarations, it was enacted
                    that no religious test should be imposed at matriculation or on taking a
                    bachelor’s degree.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In 1869 a statute was enacted at Cambridge admitting students as members of the
                    university without making it imperative that they should be entered at any hall
                    or college, but simply be resident either with their parents or in duly licensed
                    lodgings.</p>
                <p>The entire abolition of tests followed next. After several rejections in
                    parliament it was eventually carried as a Government measure, and passed the
                    House of Lords in 1871.</p>
                <p>In 1877 the reports of two new commissions were followed by further changes, the
                    chief features of which were the diversion of a certain proportion of the
                    revenues of the colleges to the uses of the university, especially with a view
                    to the encouragement of studies in natural science; the enforcement of general
                    and uniform regulations with respect to the salaries, selection, and duties of
                    professors, lecturers, and examiners; the abolition (with a few exceptions) of
                    all clerical restrictions on headships or fellowships; and the limitation of
                    fellowships to a uniform amount.</p>
                <p>That these successive and fundamental changes have, on the whole, been in unison
                    with the national wishes and requirements may fairly be inferred from the
                    remarkable increase in numbers during the last quarter of a century, and
                    especially at Cambridge, where the number of undergraduates, which in 1862 was
                    1526, was in 1887 no less than 2979. In the academic year 1862-63 the number of
                    matriculations was 448, and in 1886-87 1009.</p>
                <p>Scarcely less influential, as a means of recovering for the two universities a
                    truly national character, has been the work which both have been carrying on and
                    aiding by the institution of local examinations and of university extension
                    lectures. Of these two schemes, the former was initiated by both Oxford and
                    Cambridge in the year 1858; the latter had its origin at Cambridge, having been
                    suggested by the success attending a course of lectures to women delivered by Mr
                    (now Professor) James Stuart, in 1867, in Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, and
                    Leeds. By the former the standard of education throughout the country has been
                    raised, both in public and in private schools. By the latter, instruction of the
                    character and method which characterize university teaching has been brought
                    within the reach of students of all classes and ages throughout the land.</p>
                <p>So long ago as the year 1640 an endeavour had been made to bring about the
                    foundation of a northern university for the benefit of the counties remote from
                    Oxford and Cambridge. Manchester and York both petitioned to be made the seat of
                    the new centre. Cromwell, however, rejected both petitions, and decided in
                    favour of Durham. Here he founded the university of Durham (1657), endowing it
                    with the sequestered revenues of the dean and chapter of the cathedral, and
                    entitling the society “The Mentor or Provost, Fellows, and Scholars of the
                    College of Durham, of the foundation of Oliver, &amp;c.” This scheme was
                    cancelled at the Restoration, and not revived until the present century; but on
                    the 4th July 1832 a bill for the foundation of a university at Durham received
                    the royal assent, the dean and chapter being thereby empowered to appropriate an
                    estate at South Shields for the establishment and maintenance of a university
                    for the advancement of learning. The foundation was to be directly connected
                    with the cathedral church, the bishop of the diocese being appointed visitor,
                    and the dean and chapter governors; while the direct control was vested in a
                    warden, a senate, and a convocation. A college, modelled on the plan of those at
                    the older universities, and designated University College, Durham, was founded
                    in 1837, Bishop Hatfield’s Hall in 1846, and Bishop Cosin’s Hall (which no
                    longer exists) in 1851. The university includes all the faculties, and in 1865
                    there was added to the faculty of arts a school of physical science, including
                    pure and applied mathematics, chemistry, geology, mining, engineering, &amp;c.
                    In 1871 the corporation of the university, in conjunction with some of the
                    leading landed proprietors in the adjacent counties, gave further extension to
                    this design by the foundation of a college of physical science at
                    Newcastle-upon-Tyne, designed to teach scientific principles in their
                    application to engineering, mining, manufactures, and agriculture.</p>

                <p>Students who had passed the required examinations were made admissible as
                    associates in physical science of the university. There is also a medical
                    college which stands in similar relations to Durham, of which university
                    Codrington College, Barbados, and Fourah Bay College, Sierra Leone, are likewise
                    affiliated colleges.</p>
                <p>The university of London had its origin in a movement initiated in the year 1825
                    by Thomas Campbell, the poet, in conjunction with Henry (afterwards Lord)
                    Brougham, Mr (afterwards Sir) Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, Joseph Hume, and some
                    influential Dissenters, most of them connected with the congregation of Dr Cox
                    of Hackney. The scheme was originally suggested by the fact that Dissenters were
                    practically excluded from the older universities; but the conception, as it took
                    shape, was distinctly non-theological. The first council, appointed December
                    1825, comprised names representative of nearly all the religious denominations,
                    including (besides those above mentioned) Zachary Macaulay, George Grote, James
                    Mill, William Tooke, Lord Dudley and Ward, Dr Olinthus Gregory, Lord Lansdowne,
                    Lord John Russell, and the duke of Norfolk. On 11th February 1826 the deed of
                    settlement was drawn up; and in the course of the year seven acres, constituting
                    the site of University College, were purchased, the foundation stone of the new
                    buildings being laid by the duke of Sussex 30th April 1827. The course of
                    instruction was designed to include “languages, mathematics, physics, the mental
                    and the moral sciences, together with the laws of England, history, and
                    political economy, and the various branches of knowledge which are the objects
                    of medical education.” In October 1828 the college was opened as the university
                    of London. But in the meantime a certain section of the supporters of the
                    movement, while satisfied as to the essential soundness of the primary design as
                    a development of national education, entertained considerable scruples as to the
                    propriety of altogether dissociating such an institution from the national
                    church. This feeling found expression in the foundation and incorporation of
                    King’s College (14th August 1829), opened 8th October 1831, and designed to
                    combine with the original plan instruction in “the doctrines and duties of
                    Christianity, as the same are inculcated by the United Church of England and
                    Ireland.” This new phase of the movement was so far successful that in 1836 it
                    was deemed expedient to dissociate the university of London from University
                    College as a “teaching body,” and to limit its action simply to the institution
                    of examinations and the conferring of degrees,—the college itself receiving a
                    new charter, and being thenceforth designated as University College, London,
                    while the rival institution was also incorporated with the university, and was
                    thenceforth known as King’s College, London. In the charter now given to the
                    university it was stated that the king “deems it to be the duty of his royal
                    office to hold forth to all classes and denominations of his faithful subjects,
                    without any distinction whatsoever, an encouragement for pursuing a regular and
                    liberal course of education.” The charters of the university of London and of
                    University College, London, were signed on the same day, 28th November 1836. In
                    1869 both the colleges gave their adhesion to the movement for the higher
                    education of women which had been initiated elsewhere, and in 1880 ladies were
                    for the first time admitted to degrees.</p>
                <p>The Victoria University took its origin in the institution known as the Owens
                    College, Manchester,—so called after a wealthy citizen of that name to whom it
                    owed its foundation. The college was founded 12 th March 1851, for the purpose
                    of affording to students who were unable, on the ground of expense, to resort to
                    Oxford or Cambridge an education of an equally high class with that given at
                    those centres. The institution was, from the first, unsectarian in character. In
                    July 1877 a memorial was presented to the privy council praying for the grant of
                    a charter to the college, conferring on it the rank of a university, to be
                    called the “university of Manchester.” The localization implied in this title
                    having met with opposition from the Yorkshire College at Leeds, it was resolved
                    that the university should be called the “Victoria University.” Under this name
                    the foundation received its charter 20th April 1880. “The characteristic
                    features of the Victoria University, as compared with other British
                    universities, are these:—(a) it does not, like London, confer its degrees on
                    candidates who have passed certain examinations only, but it also requires
                    attendance on prescribed courses of academic study in a college of the
                    university; (ά) the constitution of the university contemplates its (ultimately)
                    becoming a federation of colleges; but these colleges will not be situated, like
                    those of Oxford and Cambridge, in one town, but wherever a college of adequate
                    efficiency and stability shall have arisen. University College, Liverpool, and
                    the Yorkshire College, Leeds, having fulfilled these requirements, have become
                    affiliated with the university. The university, like the older bodies in England
                    and Scotland, is at once a teaching and an examining body, and there is an
                    intimate <hi rend="italic">rapport</hi> between the teaching and the examining
                    functions. To give it a general or national character, the governing body
                    consists partly of persons nominated by the crown and partly of representatives
                    of the governing and teaching bodies of the colleges and of the graduates of the
                    university. External examiners are appointed, who conduct the examinations in
                    conjunction with examiners representing the teaching body. The graduates of the
                    university meet its teachers in convocation to discuss the affairs of the
                    university. Convocation will elect future chancellors, and a certain number of
                    representatives on the court” (Thompson, <hi rend="italic">The Owens
                    College,</hi> &amp;c., p. 548). Like the Johns Hopkins University in America,
                    the Victoria University has instituted certain fellowships (styled the Berkeley
                    fellowships) for the encouragement of research.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the chief change to be noted in connexion with the university of St
                    Andrews is the appropriation in 1579 of the two colleges of St Salvator and St
                    Leonard to the faculty of philosophy, and that of St Mary to theology. In 1747
                    an Act of Parliament was obtained for the union of the two former colleges into
                    one. Glasgow, in the year 1577, received a new charter, and its history from
                    that date down to the Restoration was one of almost continuous progress. The
                    restoration of Episcopacy, however, in volved the alienation of a considerable
                    portion of its revenues, and the consequent suspension of several of its chairs.
                    In 1864 the old university buildings were sold and, a Government grant having
                    been obtained, together with private subscriptions, the present new buildings
                    were erected from the joint fund. The faculties now recognized at Glasgow are
                    those of arts, theology, jurisprudence, and medicine. At Aberdeen an
                    amalgamation, similar to that at St Andrews, took place, by virtue of the
                    Universities Act of 1858, of the two universities of King’s College and
                    Marischal College. In conjunction with Glasgow, this university returns a member
                    to parliament. The peculiar constitution of the college at Edinburgh, as defined
                    by its charter (the government being vested entirely in the lord provost,
                    magistrates, and council, as patrons and guardians), involved the senate in
                    frequent collisions with the town council. The latter, being a strictly
                    representative body, included elements with which the senate of the university
                    sometimes found it difficult to work harmoniously, and its disposition to
                    dictate was strongly resented by the distinguished metaphysician and professor
                    Sir William Hamilton. On the other hand, the council sometimes <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n892/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0892-0855"/> exercised a beneficial discretion by appointing
                    professors of ability whom the senate might have regarded as ineligible on the
                    ground of their religious tenets. The Disruption of 1843 emancipated the lay
                    professors from subscription to the Established Church of Scotland, and resulted
                    in many of the important changes which were subsequently introduced in the
                    Universities Act of 1858. On the 28th October 1859 the town council,
                    notwithstanding that their powers were already terminated by the provisions of
                    the Act, availed themselves of a technical right to appoint a principal,—their
                    choice falling upon Sir David Brewster. The great landmark in the history of the
                    Scottish as in that of the English universities is represented by the remodel-
                    1ing of the several constitutions of these bodies in the year 1858. The
                    commissioners of 1858-62 left the university of Edinburgh in the possession of
                    constitutional autonomy, with its studies and degrees regulated by ordinances.
                    The students also received the rectorial franchise, but were not, as at Glasgow
                    and Aberdeen, divided into nations. In arts the B.A. degree was abolished, the
                    M.A. representing the only degree in this faculty, as at the other Scottish
                    universities. The course of study was divided into three departments:—(1)
                    classics; (2) mathematics, including natural philosophy; (3) mental science and
                    English literature. In each department it was required that there should be an
                    additional examiner besides the professor, so that the candidates should not be
                    entirely examined by their own teachers. It was also provided that, instead of
                    one examination for the degree at the end of a student’s course, examinations in
                    each of the departments might be passed separately. In the twenty years
                    beginning with 1863, 1400 M.A. degrees have been conferred, as against 250 in
                    the twenty years preceding. In the faculty of medicine, the original single
                    degree of doctor of medicine gave place to three classes—bachelor of medicine
                    (M.B.), master in surgery (C.M.), and doctor of medicine (M.D.). In 1866 it was
                    further laid down that theses should no longer be demanded from candidates for
                    the lower degrees of M.B. and C.M., and, on the other hand, that the degree of
                    M.D. should not be conferred on persons not showing any evidence of medical
                    study after leaving the university, but that a thesis should be invariably
                    required. Since the enactment of these ordinances the number of the medical
                    students has increased from about 500 to over 1700. In the faculty of law the
                    title of the degree was to be LL.B., and it was to be conferred only on those
                    who had already graduated as M.A. But the minor degree, that of “bachelor of
                    law” (B.L.), might be conferred if the candidate had attended one course of
                    lectures in the faculty of arts, and passed a preliminary examination in (1)
                    Latin, (2) Greek, French or German, and (3) any two of the three subjects—logic,
                    moral philosophy, and mathematics. The chair of public law, which had fallen
                    into abeyance in 1832, was reconstituted, and the chair of universal civil
                    history was converted into a professorship of history and constitutional law.
                    The degree of doctor of laws was left, as before, a purely honorary degree.
                    Chairs of Sanskrit, engineering, geology, commercial and political economy,
                    education, fine art, and the Celtic languages have also been founded. By the
                    Representation of the People (Scotland) Act, 1868, the universities of Edinburgh
                    and St Andrews were empowered to return jointly a member to the House of
                    Commons.</p>
                <p>A parliamentary return for the ten years ending 30th March 1883 showed that the
                    sums voted annually by parliament or chargeable on the Consolidated fund to the
                    four universities had amounted dûring that period to .£65,821 for Aberdeen,
                    £85,906 for Edinburgh, £66,182 for Glasgow, and £38,111 for St Andrews. In
                    addition to these sums Edinburgh had received £80,000 and Glasgow £20,000 in the
                    form of special grants in aid.</p>
                <p>Trinity College, Dublin, was founded in 1591, under the auspices of Sir John
                    Perrot, the Irish viceroy. A royal charter nominated a provost and a minimum
                    number of three fellows and three scholars as a body corporate, empowered to
                    establish among themselves “whatever laws of either of the universities of
                    Cambridge or Oxford they may judge to be apt and suitable; and especially that
                    no other persons should teach or profess the liberal arts in Ireland without the
                    queen’s special licence.” The first five provosts of Trinity College were all
                    Cambridge men, and under the influence of Archbishop Loftus, the first provost,
                    and his successors, the foundation received a strongly Puritan bias. Prior to
                    the year 1873 the provostship, fellowships, and foundation scholarships could be
                    held only by members of the Church of Ireland; but all such restrictions were
                    abolished by Act 36 Vict. c. 21, whereby the requirement of subscription to any
                    article or formulary of faith was finally abrogated. As at present constituted,
                    the ordinary government is in the hands of the provost and senior fellows in
                    conjunction with the visitors and council,—the supreme authority being the
                    crown, except so far as limited by Act of Parliament.</p>
                <p>The first departure in Ireland from the exclusive system of education formerly
                    represented by the foundation at Dublin, dates from the creation of the Queen’s
                    University, incorporated by royal charter 3d September 1850. By this charter the
                    general legislation of the university, together with its government and
                    administration, was vested in the university senate. In 1864 the charter of 1850
                    was superseded by a supplementary charter, and the university reconstituted “in
                    order to render more complete and satisfactory the courses of education to be
                    followed by students in the colleges ”; and finally, in 1880, by virtue of the
                    Act of Parliament known as the University Education (Ireland) Act, 1879, the
                    Queen’s University gave place to the Royal University of Ireland, which was
                    practically a reconstitution of the former foundation, the dissolution of the
                    Queen’s University being decreed so soon as the newly constituted body should be
                    in a position to confer degrees; at the same time all graduates of the Queen’s
                    University were recognized as graduates of the new university with corresponding
                    degrees, and all matriculated students of the former as entitled to the same
                    status in the latter. The university confers degrees in arts (B.A., M.A.,
                    D.Litt.), science, engineering, music, medicine, surgery, obstetrics, and law.
                    The preliminary pass examinations in arts are held at annually selected
                    centres,—those chosen in 1885 being Dublin, Belfast, Carlow, Cork, Ga1way,
                    Limerick, and Londonderry. All honour examinations and all examinations in other
                    faculties are held in Dublin. The Queen’s Colleges at Belfast, Cork, and Galway
                    were founded in December 1845, under an Act of Parliament “to enable Her Majesty
                    to endow new colleges for the advancement of learning in Ireland,” and were
                    subsequently incorporated as colleges of the university. Their professors were
                    at the same time constituted professors in the university, and conducted the
                    examinations. But in the reconstruction of 1880 the chief share in the conduct
                    of the examinations and advising the senate with respect to them was vested in a
                    board of fellows, elected by the senate in equal numbers from the
                    non-denominational colleges and the purely Catholic institutions. The colleges
                    retain, however, their independence, being in no way subject to the control of
                    the university senate except in the regulations with respect to the requirements
                    for degrees and other academic distinctions. On the other hand, the obligation
                    formerly imposed of a preliminary course of study at one or other of the
                    colleges before admission to degrees was abolished at the foundation of the
                    Royal University, the examinations being now open, like those of the university
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n893/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0893-0856"/> of London, to all matriculated students on
                    payment of certain fees.</p>
                <p>There is at present no university of Wales, although the bestowal of a royal
                    charter before long is confidently anticipated. The oldest college, that of St
                    David’s at Lampeter, possesses the right of conferring degrees. It was founded
                    in 1822 for the purpose of educating clergymen in the principles of the
                    Established Church of England and Wales, mainly for the supply of the Welsh
                    dioceses. The number of the professors in 1887 was 8, and the number of the
                    students 120. The next college in order of foundation is Aberystwith. It was
                    founded 9th October 1872, but possesses no charter, and is mainly supported by
                    the Dissenting bodies. The staff of professors numbers 13, and the students
                    number 150. The University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire at Cardiff
                    was founded in 1883. The number of professors in 1887 was 9, lecturers 4,
                    demonstrators 2; number of students 140. The University College of North Wales
                    at Bangor received its charter 4th June 1885, its object being to “provide
                    instruction in all the branches of a liberal education except theology.” Its
                    staff consists of a principal, 8 professors or lecturers, and 2 demonstrators;
                    the number of the students is 127. There is also a hall of residence for women
                    students. At each of these three last-named colleges students proceeding to
                    degrees have to go through either a London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, or Dublin course
                    of study, but at Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Dublin a certain proportion of the term
                    of residence ordinarily required is remitted in their favour.</p>
                <p>In India, the three older universities all date from 1857,—that of Calcutta
                    having been incorporated January 24, Bombay July 18, Madras September 5, in that
                    year. At these three universities the instruction is mainly in English. “A
                    university in India is a body for examining candidates for degrees, and for
                    conferring degrees. It has the power of prescribing text-books, standards of
                    instruction, and rules of procedure, but is not an institution for teaching. Its
                    governance and management are vested in a body of fellows, some of whom are <hi
                    rend="italic">ex offirio,</hi> being the chief European functionaries of the
                    state. The remainder are appointed by the Government, being generally chosen as
                    representative men in respect of eminent learning, scientific attainment,
                    official position, social status, or personal worth. Being a mixed body of
                    Europeans and natives, they thus comprise all that is best and wisest in that
                    division of the empire to which the university belongs, and fairly represent
                    most of the phases of thought and philosophic tendencies observable in the
                    country. The fellows in their corporate capacity form the senate. The affairs of
                    the university are conducted by the syndicate, consisting of a limited number of
                    members elected from among the fellows. The faculties comprise arts and
                    philosophy, law, medicine, and civil engineering. A degree in natural and
                    physical science has more recently been added” (Sir R. Temple, <hi rend="italic"
                    >India in 1880,</hi> p. 145). The Punjab university Λvas incorporated in
                    1883,—the Punjab University College, prior to that date, having conferred titles
                    only and not degrees. The main object of this university is the encouragement of
                    the study of the Oriental languages and literature, and the rendering accessible
                    to native students the results of European scientific teaching through the
                    medium of their own vernacular. The Oriental faculty is here the oldest, and the
                    degree of B.O.L. (bachelor of Oriental literature) is given as the result of its
                    examinations. At the Oriental College the instruction is given wholly in the
                    native languages. In 1887 the senate at Cambridge (mainly on the representations
                    of Mr C. P. Ilbert, formerly vice-chancellor of the university of Calcutta)
                    adopted resolutions whereby some forty-nine collegiate institutions already
                    affiliated to the latter body were affiliated to the university of Cambridge,
                    their students thus becoming entitled to the remission of one year in the
                    ordinary statutable requirements with respect to residence at Cambridge. It is
                    at these institutions, and the colleges of the first or second grade in the
                    other presidencies, that the instruction is given.</p>
                <p>In Australia, the university of Sydney was incorporated by an Act of the colonial
                    legislature which received the royal assent 9th December 1851, and on 27th
                    February 1858 a royal charter was granted conferring on graduates of the
                    university the same rank, style, and precedence as are enjoyed by graduates of
                    universities within the United Kingdom. Sydney is also one of the institutions
                    associated with the university of London from which certificates of having
                    received a due course of instruction may be received with a view to admission to
                    degrees. There are four faculties, viz., arts, law, medicine, and science. The
                    design of the university is to supply the means of a liberal education to all
                    ordersand denominations, without any distinction whatever. An Act for the
                    purpose of facilitating the erection of colleges in connexion with different
                    religious bodies was, however, passed by the legislature during the session of
                    1884, and since that time colleges representing the Episcopalian, Presbyterian,
                    and Roman Catholic Churches have been founded. In 1885 the total number of
                    students attending lectures in the university λvas 206. The university of
                    Melbourne, in the colony of Victoria, was incorporated and endowed by royal Act
                    22d January 1853. This Act was amended 7th June 1881. Here also no religious
                    tests are imposed on admission to any degree or election to any office. The
                    council is empowered, after due examination, to confer degrees in all the
                    faculties (excepting divinity) which can be conferred in any university within
                    the British dominions. It is also authorized to affiliate colleges; and Trinity
                    College (Church of England) was accordingly founded in 1870 and Ormond College
                    (Presbyterian) in 1879. The founding of a university for Queensland is at the
                    present time in contemplation. The university of Adelaide in South Australia
                    (founded mainly by the exertions and munificence of Sir Walter Watson Hughes)
                    was incorporated by an Act of the colonial legislature in 1874, in which year it
                    was further endowed by Sir Thomas Elder. In 1881 letters patent were granted by
                    the English crown whereby degrees conferred by the university were constituted
                    of equal validity with those of any university of the United Kingdom. The
                    faculties in the university are those of arts, medicine, law, science, and
                    music. The number of matriculations since the foundation amounted in 1886 to
                    284, the number of undergraduates in that year being 90.</p>
                <p>The university of New Zealand, founded in 1870, and reconstituted in 1874 and
                    1875, is empowered by royal charter to grant the several degrees of bachelor and
                    master of arts, and bachelor and doctor in law, medicine, and music. Women are
                    admitted to degrees. To this the Auckland University College, Nelson College,
                    Canterbury College, and the university of Otago stand in the relation of
                    affiliated institutions. This last-named institution was founded in 1869 by an
                    order of the provincial council, with the power of conferring degrees in arts,
                    medicine, and law, and received as an endowment 100,000 acres of pastoral land.
                    It was opened in 1871 with a staff of three professors, all in the faculty of
                    arts. In 1872 the provincial council further subsidized it by a grant of a
                    second 100,000 acres of land, and the university was now enabled to make
                    considerable additions to the staff of professors and lecturers, to establish a
                    lectureship in law, and to lay the foundations of a medical school. In 1874 an
                    agreement was made between the university of New Zealand and that of Otago,
                    whereby the functions of the former were restricted to the examination of
                    candidates for matriculation, for scholarships, and for degrees; while the
                    latter bound itself to become affiliated to the university of New Zealand, to
                    hold in abeyance its power of granting degrees, and to waive the claim which it
                    had advanced to a royal charter. As the result of this arrangement, the
                    university of Otago became possessed of 10,000 acres of land which had been set
                    apart for university purposes in the former province of Southland. In 1877 a
                    school of mines was established in connexion with the university.</p>
                <p>In Canada the M ’ Gill College and University at Montreal was founded by royal
                    charter in 1821 (amended in 1852) on the foundation of the Honourable James M
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Gill, who died at Montreal 19th December 1813. A
                    number of colleges and schools throughout the province stand in the relation of
                    affiliated institutions. The university is Protestant but undenominational. It
                    includes the faculties of arts, applied sciences, medicine, and law. In 1885 the
                    total number of students, including women, was 526. The university of Toronto
                    was originally established by royal charter in 1827, under the title of King’s
                    College, with certain religious restrictions, resembling those at that time in
                    force at the English universities, but in 1834 these restrictions were
                    abolished, and in 1849 the designation of the university was changed into that
                    of the university of Toronto. In 1873 further amendments were made in the
                    constitution of the university. The chancellor was made elective for a period of
                    three years by convocation, which was at the same time reorganized so as to
                    include all graduates in law, medicine, and surgery, all masters of arts, and
                    bachelors of arts of three years standing, all doctors of science, and bachelors
                    of science of three years standing. The powers of the senate were also extended
                    to all branches of literature, science, and the arts, to granting certificates
                    of proficiency to women, and to affiliating colleges. The work of instruction is
                    performed by University College, which is maintained out of the endowment of the
                    provincial university, and governed by a council composed of the residents and
                    the professors. Its several chairs include classical literature, logic and
                    rhetoric, mathematics and natural philosophy, chemistry and experimental
                    philosophy, history and English literature, mineralogy and geology, metaphysics
                    and ethics, meteorology and natural history, and lectureships on Oriental
                    literature, German, and French. Other universities and colleges with power to

                    (1836), supported by the Methodist Church of Canada; Queen’s University,
                    Kingston (1841), representing the Presbyterian body; and the university of
                    Trinity College, Toronto, founded in 1851 on the suppression of the faculty of
                    divinity in King’s College. Lennoxville is a centre for university instruction
                    in conformity with Church of England principles.</p>
                <p>In Africa, an Act for the incorporation of the university of the Cape of Good
                    Hope received the royal assent 26th June 1873, the council being empowered to
                    grant degrees in arts, law, and medicine.</p>
                <p>In the United States of America university education has received a great
                    extension, without, however, exercising in Europe that reflex influence
                    discernible in so many other relations. The report of the commissioners of
                    education for 1883-84 gives a list of no less than 370 degree-giving
                    universities or colleges; but of these a large proportion are sectarian, others
                    represent only a single faculty, and nearly nine-tenths have been founded within
                    the last thirty-five years. Although a higher education has unquestionably been
                    thus very widely diffused, the undue multiplication of centres has, in some
                    provinces, lowered the standard of attainment and led to a consequent
                    depreciation in the value of university degrees. This tendency it was sought to
                    counteract in the State of Ohio, some twenty-five years ago, by an organization
                    of the different colleges. The instruction given is, in most cases, almost
                    gratuitous, the charge to each student being less than 30 dollars a year. This
                    cheapening of a higher education is not, however, attended with quite the same
                    results as in Germany (where lads with little aptitude for a professional career
                    are thus attracted to the professions), the rapidly increasing population and
                    the wider scope for mechanical or agricultural pursuits probably exercising a
                    beneficial counteracting influence. The distinguishing characteristics which
                    belong to these numerous centres are described by the president of the Johns
                    Hopkins University, in an address delivered at Harvard in 1886, as suggestive of
                    four different classes of colleges,—(1) those which proceed from the original
                    historic colleges, (2) those established in the name of the State, (3) those
                    avowedly ecclesiastical, (4) those founded by private benefactions. To the first
                    class belong Harvard College and Yale College with their offshoots. Of these
                    two, the former was founded in 1638 at Cambridge, Massachusetts, by a former
                    fellow of Emmanuel College at Cambridge in England, and represented the Puritan
                    tenets for which the parent society was at that time noted; the latter was
                    founded in 1701 by the combined action of a few of the ministers of the State, a
                    charter being given in the same year by the colonial legislature. It was for a
                    long time chiefly supported by the Congregationalists, but is now unsectarian.
                    The total number of students at Harvard in 1882 was 988, at Yale 692. The
                    university of Pennsylvania was founded in 1751 by Thomas Penn and Richard Penn,
                    on the lines of a scheme drawn up by Benjamin Franklin, and was from the first
                    placed on a basis comprising all denominations. It is distinguished by the
                    liberality with which it has opened its courses of instruction to the
                    inhabitants of the city generally; the degree of Ph.D. is conferred on all
                    comers after due examination. At Haverford and Lafayette Colleges, and also at
                    the Lehigh university, “advanced degrees” are offered “only for higher study,
                    prolonged beyond the collegiate course,” instead of being conferred as a matter
                    of routine after a certain term of years. The Johns Hopkins University, also an
                    unsectarian body, was founded at Baltimore in 1867, and is already a school of
                    established reputation, and especially resorted to by those designing to follow
                    the profession of teachers. It is also distinguished by the possession of
                    fellowships, to be held only by students intending to pursue some especial line
                    of original research. Other steadily growing centres are Columbia College in New
                    York, founded in 1754; the Cornell University, also unsectarian, recently
                    enriched by the acquisition of a considerable endowment; Brown’s University in
                    Providence; and those of Princeton, Michigan, Virginia, and California. At
                    Amherst College, where the number of students in 1882 was 339, the experiment
                    has recently been made of partially dispensing with examinations during the
                    course of</p>

                    Considerable modifications have also taken place in the courses of study, nearly
                    all the colleges having now adopted the system of “parallel courses,” and the
                    principle of selection between these. Female education has received in America
                    an extension which it has attained in no other country, and one of the colleges
                    (that of Wellesley) numbers several· hundred students. Since the war of 1861 a
                    greatly increased attention has been given throughout the universities to
                    physical training and athletic exercises, and excellent gymnasia, constructed on
                    German models, have been erected.</p>
