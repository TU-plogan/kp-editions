                <p><label type="entry">UNITARIANISM</label>. The term Unitarianism in its widest
                    sense includes certain lines of the great religious and theological movement or
                    revolution of the Reformation in the 16th century, when this is regarded as the
                    commencement of the process of the humanization of theology and ethics on the
                    basis of the autonomy of the human mind. In another sense the term stands for a
                    set of theological opinions, more or less variable, and yet in their general
                    drift connected, some of them as old as Christianity, and one section of which
                    only is indicated by the term when used as synonymous with Antitrinitarianism.
                    But there is another meaning of the term, a still narrower one, and to
                    Unitarianism in this sense this article must be confined. We must limit
                    ourselves to a brief account of Unitarianism as it appears in ecclesiastical
                    organizations in separation from the orthodox churches. This treatment of the
                    subject is of course incomplete, and would be misleading were the incompleteness
                    not expressly announced. For a marked feature of the late history of the
                    Unitarian churches is the growing tendency they exhibit of working out to their
                    logical results some of the wider principles of the Reformation to which they
                    ultimately owe their origin, rather than the design of formulating and
                    propagating systems of theology. To not a few modern Unitarian leaders the bond
                    which connects them with a specifically Unitarian organization is the spirit and
                    tendency of the larger movement for which it happens to provide freer play than
                    the orthodox churches, while they repudiate the imputation of belonging to a
                    dogmatic sect. Modern Unitarians have also, both in Europe and America,
                    emphatically and successfully resisted the inclination of some of their number
                    to lay down, though in the most general terms, a creed of Unitarianism. Indeed,
                    in opposing this inclination, it might sometimes seem as if the only essential
                    article of Unitarianism were the maintenance of free inquiry in religion,—an
                    impression, however, which a careful study of the history of Unitarian thought
                    would remove. In the same way such a study would show that Unitarian churches
                    are in agreement on many points of doctrine with early and recent theologians of
                    all churches and sects.</p>
                <p>This brief sketch of Unitarianism, as it has appeared in organized religious
                    societies, takes us into but a few countries, and covers but a limited space of
                    time. Poland, Transylvania, England, and America are the only countries in which
                    Unitarian congregations have existed in any numbers or for any length of time.
                    Elsewhere, either the law of the land has rendered their existence impossible,
                    or they have been unnecessary in consequence of the substantial adoption by the
                    existing churches of their principles and doctrines. The former was the case in
                    Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and England in the 16th and 17 th centuries, the
                    latter to a certain extent in England in the 18th century, still more in Germany
                    in the 18th and 19th centuries, and in Holland in the present century, as also
                    to a large extent in France in the Reformed Church.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Poland</hi> (1565-1658).—The Unitarians, under the names of
                    Arians, Samosatenians, Pinczowians, were formed into a separate church in 1565
                    by their exclusion as Antitrinitarians from the synods of the Trinitarian
                    Protestants. Very early in the progress of the Reformation in Poland individuals
                    had arrived at heterodox opinions on baptism and the Trinity, very much under
                    the influence of the heterodox Italian refugees in Switzerland, some of whom
                    visited Poland (Lelio Sozzini, 1551 and 1558; Paul Alciati, 1561; G. V. Gentile,
                    1561; Biandrata, 1555). Gonesius and Gregory Pauli were the first to openly
                    preach Antitrinitarian doctrine. After their separation from the orthodox, the
                    Polish Unitarians developed divergent views as to the nature of Christ, as to
                    the lawfulness of paying divine worship to Him, as to the subjects of baptism
                    (infants or adults), and as to the relation of Christians to the state. On the
                    first point some were Arians and others Humanitarians, while those who claimed
                    divine worship for Christ were called <hi rend="italic">Adorantes</hi> and those
                    of the opposite view <hi rend="italic">Nσnadorantes.</hi> An epoch in the
                    history of the party was made by the arrival of Fausto Sozzini at Cracow in 1579
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Socinus).</hi> He succeeded in converting the great
                    majority of the churches to his views and in silencing the dissentients.
                    Henceforth the Polish Unitarians adopted the Socinian practice of paying worship
                    to Christ, the Socinian view of the necessity of baptism and of the Christian’s
                    duty towards the state. They rapidly became a numerous and powerful body in
                    Poland, distinguished by the rank of their adherents, the ability and learning
                    of their scholars, the excellence of their schools, and the superiority and wide
                    circulation of their theological literature. Racow, the theological centre of
                    the Socinians, with its school and printing presses, obtained a world-wide fame.
                    It was there that the <hi rend="italic">Racovian Catechism</hi> was published
                    (1605 in the Polish language, 1608 in German, and 1609 in Latin). ' But before
                    the death of Fausto Sozzini (1604) the situation of the Unitarians became more
                    difficult, and in 1611 the Jesuits obtained their first open triumph over them.
                    In the rapid course of the Catholic reaction, which was not resisted by the
                    orthodox Protestants as long as the Socinian heretics only suffered, the church
                    and school at Lublin, the most important place next to Racow, were first put
                    down (1627), and Racow, with its church, school, and printing-press suffered the
                    same fate in 1638. The final blow to the whole body followed in 1658, when all
                    adherents of “the Arian and Anabaptist sect” were commanded to quit the kingdom
                    within two years. A few renounced their faith, but the large majority fled into
                    Transylvania, Prussia, Silesia, Holland, and England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Transylvania</hi> (1568-1887).—Next to Poland Transylvania was
                    the most important seat of Unitarianism. It was there the name was first used by
                    the sect as its own designation, and it is there only that the sect has had a
                    continuous existence down to our own time. It is generally considered that the
                    Italian refugee Biandrata was the founder of Transylvanian Unitarianism, but the
                    present representatives of the body claim for it a nobler and domestic origin.
                    Biandrata attended John Sigismund as a physician in 1563, and under his
                    influence Unitarianism made rapid progress. In 1568 its professors, favoured by
                    the king and many magnates,’after separating from the orthodox church,
                    constituted themselves a distinct body under the distinguished man Francis
                    David, who is now regarded as the apostle of true Transylvanian Unitarianism.
                    Their principal centre was Klausenburg (Kolozsvár), w here they had a large
                    church, a college, and a printing-press. But the same conflict between a more
                    radical and a more conservative tendency which appeared amongst the Unitarians
                    of Poland greatly disturbed the churches of Transylvania, particularly with
                    regard to the worship of Christ. On the side of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adorantes</hi> was Biandrata, and on that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nonadorantes</hi> David. The party of David succumbed to force and fraud, and
                    he himself died in prison a martyr to his convictions. Gradually the Socinian
                    view prevailed, though in 1618 an old order to worship Christ required
                    reinforcement. In the latter half of the 18th century the more logical view of
                    David entirely disappeared. Under the Austrian dynasty the Unitarians <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n751/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0751-0726"/> were often exposed to great trials, until Joseph
                    IL secured to them their rights and privileges. An official confession of faith
                    of the year 1787 remains, with some modifications, essentially Socinian. But of
                    late years the Transylvanian Unitarians have been in close relation with their
                    co-religionists in England and America, some of the ministers having been
                    educated at Manchester New College, and in consequence their theology is
                    becoming essentially modern. The number of members was 32,000 in 1789, in 1847
                    40,000, distributed in 104 parishes with 120 pastors. Their present number is
                    63,539 in 106 parishes. Their chief centres are Kolozsvár, Thorda, and
                    Keresztur, where they have excellent schools.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">England</hi> (1773-1887).—For two and a half centuries previous
                    to the rise of organized Unitarianism in England, opinions commonly called by
                    this name found numerous individual advocates and some martyrs. John Bidle
                    (1615-62) published catechisms of Unitarian doctrine, translated Socinian works,
                    and publicly discussed and {&gt;reached an English form of Socinianism. But the
                    severity of the aw against Antitrinitarians, coupled with the gradual growth of
                    free opinion in the Established Church and amongst the Presbyterian
                    congregations, made the formation of separate Unitarian churches impossible,
                    and, as was felt, less necessary for another hundred years. The adoption of a
                    completely Humanitarian view of Christ’s person by a few solitary individuals
                    (Lardner 1730, Priestley 1767, Lindsey 1773), assisted by the awakened
                    earnestness of the time, led to their formation. Lindsey resigned a valuable
                    living in Yorkshire, and gathered the first professedly Unitarian church in
                    London. Other clergymen followed his example, and amongst the Presbyterians
                    several ministers, like Joseph Priestley, exchanged their Arian for Humanitarian
                    views. This process went on with deep permanent effects in some of the
                    Dissenting academies. In the year 1791 was formed the Unitarian Book Society for
                    the distribution of literature, and several provincial associations originated
                    about the same time. Ini806 the Unitarian Fund Society was established, with the
                    object of promoting Unitarian Christianity by direct mission work. In 1818 arose
                    another society for protecting the civil rights of Unitarians. These various
                    societies were consolidated in 1825 under the name of the British and Foreign
                    Unitarian Association, which has now its headquarters in the building formerly
                    used as Lindsey’s chapel and residence in Essex Street, London. Early in this
                    century nearly the whole of the old Presbyterian congregations, which, unlike
                    those of the Baptists and Independents, had undogmatic trust-deeds, passed
                    through the stages of Arminianism and various forms of Arianism into Socinianism
                    in its peculiar English and mainly Priestleian form. The penal laws against
                    Antitrinitarianism, which had long been obsolete, were repealed in 1813, and in
                    1844 the right of Unitarians to the chapels which they held in succession from
                    their Presbyterian forefathers was legally secured to them by the Dissenters’
                    Chapels Act without altering their undogmatic trust-deeds. Though these
                    congregations, popularly known as Unitarian, on principle declined to restrict
                    the progress of thought by imposing on either their ministers or members any
                    dogmatic statements of belief, the generality of them adopted with some
                    modifications the theological system of Priestley, which was a combination of
                    Locke’s philosophy with the crudest rationalistic supernaturalism. With the rise
                    of a more spiritual philosophy in Germany, which bore fruit in England and
                    America before the close of the second decade of the century, the theology of
                    English Unitarianism underwent a radical change, very much in the first instance
                    under the influence of Dr Channing’s writings. Without at all sacrificing its
                    critical and rational bent, a deeper emotional and spiritual element was
                    introduced into it, which gradually, at the cost of some years of internal
                    conflict, dispossessed the purely external and super-naturalistic Socinian and
                    Priestleian legacy. English Unitarian theology was thereby brought into close
                    sympathy with modem scientific theology in Germany and elsewhere. This great and
                    saving transformation was mainly due directly to James Martineau, J. J. Tayler,
                    and J. H. Thom, aided by the writings of Channing and then of Theodore Parker.
                    One consequence of the greater substantial agreement of the present theology of
                    the larger number of the Unitarian churches with the scientific theology of the
                    century is that not a few representatives of these churches disclaim the name
                    Unitarian as one tending to perpetuate divisions which have really no right to
                    continued existence. The main reason for continued separation from the larger
                    liberal churches, whether Established or Dissenting, earnestly urged by many
                    Unitarians of this class, is the use in those churches of theological
                    formularies which modern theology regards as of historic interest only. The
                    number of congregations in England and Wales generally described as Unitarian is
                    about 300, nearly half of which date from between 1662 and 1750, and nearly all
                    of which have undogmatic trust-deeds. Their constitution is purely
                    congregational. For the education of their ministers they have Manchester New
                    College, London (strictly undenominational), the Unitarian Home Missionary
                    Board, Manchester, and Carmarthen College, supported and managed by the
                    Presbyterian Board in London, but practically Independent and Unitarian. The
                    organs of the body are <hi rend="italic">The Inquirer, The Christian Life, The
                    Uni</hi><hi rend="italic">tarian Herald</hi> (weeklies), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Christian Reformer</hi> (monthly). In Scotland there are 7 Unitarian
                    congregations and 2 Universalist, the latter being, as in America, Unitarian in
                    doctrine. In Ireland the number is about 40, being nearly all Presbyterian in
                    constitution. They are much stronger in the north than in the south of Ireland.
                    In the north Antitrinitarian views began to spread about 1750; but the first
                    congregation at Dublin traces its Unitarianism back to Thomas Emlyn, who was
                    imprisoned for his Arian opinions in 1702 at the instigation of orthodox
                    Dissenters.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States</hi> (1815-1887).—In the United States
                    Unitarianism had no organized existence previous to 1815, and as in England at
                    the present time the name has always covered great différences of opinion within
                    a common outline of belief or common drift of religious thought. Historical
                    American Unitarianism represents ‘‘ the liberal wing of the Congregational
                    body.” Of the existing 370 churches 120 or more were originally the parish
                    churches founded by the Puritan Congregationalists, which, like the Presbyterian
                    congregations in England, passed gradually from Calvinism through Arminianism to
                    Unitarianism, of which Harvard College became the spiritual centre. In 1812
                    there was but one church in America professedly Unitarian (that of King’s
                    Chapel, Boston), though the ministers of Boston generally held Unitarian views.
                    In 1815 Belsham’s account of the “State of the Unitarian Churches in America”
                    (in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Lindsey,</hi> London, 1812) led to a
                    controversy, the issue of which was the distinct avowal of Unitarian principles
                    on the part of the liberal clergy of New England. Dr Channing came forward as
                    the prophet and champion of American Unitarianism, though the older he grew the
                    more emphatically he repudiated sectarianism in every form. The Congregational
                    body was thereby split into two sections, one of which styled themselves
                    Unitarian Congregationalists. In 1825 the American Unitarian Association was
                    formed, mainly for the diffusion of Unitarian literature and the support of poor
                    congregations. At that time the Unitarian churches numbered about 122. Twenty
                    years later they were some 280, while now they are about 370. The theological
                    colleges of the body are the Divinity School of Harvard University, which is,
                    like Manchester New College, undenominational, and the Theological School of
                    Meadville. As in England so in America the theology of Unitarians has passed
                    through marked changes, which have been attended by conflicts more or less
                    acute. From 1815 to about 1836 a Biblical, semi-rationalistic
                    semi-super-naturalistic theology prevailed, in the heart of which Channing’s
                    elevated ethical ideas were fermenting and slowly preparing a new birth. From
                    1836 forces such as Biblical criticism, Carlyle and Emerson’s
                    “transcendentalism,” and Theodore Parker’s “absolute religion” opened the era of
                    modern theology, bringing American Unitarianism into living touch with the
                    philosophy and theology of Germany. An effort in 1865 to bring the right and
                    left wings of the body into a closer confederation with a more pronounced
                    profession of Christianity led to the formation of a Free Religious Association
                    on the broad basis of the love of truth and goodness. In the Western States the
                    same controversy as to the basis of religious association has been raging for
                    more than ten years. In May 1886 a resolution was passed by the Western
                    Unitarian Conference by a majority of more than three-fourths adopting a purely
                    ethical and non-theological basis. This led to a split in the body, and the
                    formation of a new Western Association on a distinctly Christian platform. The
                    left wing of American Unitarians show greater sympathy with recent scientific
                    speculation and less fear of pantheistic theories than is the case with English
                    Unitarians. The organs of the body are <hi rend="italic">The Unitarian
