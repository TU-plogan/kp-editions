                    >Umbri).</hi> The early Greeks applied the name <hi rend="italic">'Oμβpικη</hi>
                    to all central and northern Italy. Herodotus (iv. 49) speaks of it somewhat
                    vaguely, as if it extended up to the Alps. The Umbrians probably extended across
                    central Italy from sea to sea down as far as Latium. Pliny (iii. 13, 19) tells
                    us that the Umbri were considered the most ancient nation of Italy (antiquissima
                    gens Italiae), by which he probably means, of the Italian stock. The Greek
                    writers included under the name of Umbria the district known in later times as
                    Picenum. Pseudo-Scylax makes Umbria march with Samnium, and describes Ancona as
                    a city of Umbria. The Umbrians seem to have found the Siculi and Liburni in
                    occupation of the land into which they advanced, the former holding the parts
                    lying towards the interior, the latter people the district along the Adriatic.
                    The Umbrians were one of the chief peoples of that branch of the Indo-European
                    family which had entered Italy from the north and driven out and absorbed the
                    older inhabitants. They were more closely connected with the Samnites and Oscans
                    than with the Latin stock, as is shown by their language. Their possession of
                    the fertile regions of upper Italy exposed them to the constant assaults of
                    fresh bodies of invaders, pressing on over the Alps, and perhaps likewise from
                    the seaboard. Their force was extended over a wide area, and thus too weak to
                    withstand the attacks from various sides to which they were exposed. Thus their
                    extensive territory was gradually reduced by the successive encroachments of
                    other peoples. First came the Etruscans, who according to Herodotus (i. 94) were
                    Lydians, who established themselves in the land of the Umbrians. From which side
                    of Italy they made their invasion, whether from the mouth of the Po or from the
                    western coast of what later became Etruria, or whether from both, we have no
                    means of determining. That the Umbrians did not yield without a struggle we
                    cannot doubt. It was only after three hundred of their towns had been captured
                    by the Etruscans that they succumbed. Nevertheless they still retained
                    considerable influence in upper Italy, which, according to Strabo (v. 216),
                    continued down to the time of the Roman conquest. For he says that there was a
                    large Umbrian element in the Roman colonies in the region of the Po, as also
                    some Etruscan. For, according to him, the Umbrians and Etruscans lived in a
                    continual rivalry for the preeminence, so that if the one people made an
                    expedition northwards, the other determined not to be outdone. So when the
                    Etruscans had marched against the barbarians who dwelt near the Po, and had soon
                    again been expelled owing to their effeminacy, the Umbrians in turn marched
                    against the conquerors of the Etruscans. In consequence of this alternating
                    struggle for these regions they planted many colonies, ⅛me Etruscan, others
                    Umbrian. Most of the colonies were Umbrian because the Umbrians lay closer to
                    the disputed territory. Thus, even though they lost the sovereignty, the Umbrian
                    race probably continued to form a considerable portion of the population of a
                    wide extent of country. At all events, at the time of the Gaulish inroad the
                    Etruscans seem to be in possession of the mouth of the Po. At this time,
                    therefore, Umbria as a state consisted of the region bounded on the W. by the
                    Tiber, on the S. by the Sabines, on the E. by Picenum and the Adriatic, while on
                    the N. it extended close up to the southern or Spinetic mouth of the Po. Scylax
                    describes the Etruscans as extending from the Tyrrhenian Sea to the Adriatic,
                    and represents them as in possession of the ancient Greek town of Spina. How
                    much farther south the Etruscan sway had once reached we cannot determine, but
                    that they had once held this region, as far as Ravenna at least, is rendered
                    probable by the tradition that Ravenna had been founded by a colony of
                    Thessalians who, not brooking the insulting treatment which they received from
                    the Etruscans, gladly admitted some Umbrians, who thus became the possessors of
                    the city. When the great Gaulish inroad took place at the beginning of the 4th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Etruscans and Umbrians alike suffered
                    severely. Some of the Celtic tribes crossed the Po and formed permanent
                    settlements. The Ananes settled in the Apennines, the Boii between the former
                    and the Adriatic; next came the Lingones; and finally the Senones occupied the
                    seaboard of the Adriatic as far as the Rubicon. This region in Roman times was
                    known as the Ager Gallicus (Polybius, ii. 16). But it was not only in the north
                    and west that the Umbrians had been driven back. The early Greeks had included
                    under the name of Umbria the district along the Adriatic, afterwards known as
                    Picenum. This consisted of a fertile region, extending from beyond Ancona to the
                    river Matrino. It is not improbable that the Picentes issued from the Sabine
                    region. Tradition alleged <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n749/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0749-0724"/> that the Picentes, led by the woodpecker <hi
                    rend="italic">(picus)</hi> of Mars, marched forth to occupy what is now the
                    March of Ancona. But it was probably only after a long struggle that this
                    conquest was effected, for from another tradition we learn that the Sabines,
                    after carrying on war against the Umbrians for a long time, at length vowed a
                    sacred spring, and dedicated all the produce of the year to the gods. Then at
                    length they became victorious (Strabo, v. 250). Thus, by the advance of the
                    Gauls from the north and the Picentes from the south, the Umbrians were shut off
                    from the seaboard, and confined to the district known as Umbria in historical
                    times. When Rome began the consolidating of Italy, Umbria consisted of the
                    region bounded by the Ager Gallicus on the N., by Etruria (the Tiber) on the W.,
                    by Picenum on the E., and by the Sabines on the S. The Umbrians kept a desperate
                    hold of this district, which lies between the two arms of the Apennines. This
                    position indicates of itself that they had been driven before stronger foes.
                    Henceforward they play but an insignificant part in Italian history. This is
                    explained by the physical formation of their country. It is an extremely
                    mountainous region, with a few small plains between, which were noted for their
                    fertility. Hence arose a number of small but thriving communities, none of which
                    had the capacity of developing into a leading state such as Rome became for the
                    Latins. Their want of seaports likewise excluded them from trade, the mouths of
                    all the rivers which flowed from their country being in the hands of their
                    enemies.</p>
                <p>Of the. Umbrians’ political· and municipal organization little is known. In
                    addition to the city <hi rend="italic">{tota)</hi> they seem to have had a
                    larger territorial division in the <hi rend="italic">tribus</hi> (trifu, acc.)
                    as we gather from Livy (xxxi. 2, per Umbriam quam tribum Sapiniam vocant; <hi
                    rend="italic">cf.</hi> xxxiii. 37) and from the Eugubine Tables (trifor
                    Tarsinates, vi. B. 54). From the fertility of their land their communities were
                    very prosperous. The olive and vine flourished in their valleys; they grew spelt
                    abundantly; and the boars of Umbria were famous. Ancient authors describe the
                    Umbrians as leading effeminate lives, and as closely resembling their Etruscan
                    enemies in their habits (Theopompus, fragm. 142; Pseudo-Scymnus, 366-8). It is
                    almost certain that each race influenced and modified the other to a large
                    extent. Mommsen has pointed out that the names of many towns in Etruria are
                    Umbrian, a fact which shows how persistent even after conquest was their
                    influence in that region. On the other hand, we have conclusive proof of strong
                    Etruscan influences in Umbria. For instance, they undoubtedly borrowed their
                    alphabet and the art of writing from the Etruscans. Their writing runs from
                    right to left The alphabet consists of nineteen letters. It has no separate
                    symbols for O, G, Q; the aspirates <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">χ</hi> are wanting; on the other hand, it possesses forms for Z
                    and V, and has likewise the Etruscan <hi rend="italic">f</hi> ( 8 ). It also has
                    a symbol d peculiar to itself for expressing the sound of palatal <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> when followed by either <hi rend="italic">e</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">i.</hi> It is also very probable that they borrowed the art of
                    coining money from Etruria. Two towns are known to have issued coins, which
                    consist entirely of bronze, and belong almost entirely to the series of <hi
                    rend="italic">aes grave.</hi> The most important is that of Tuder (Todi), which
                    must have been a place of some note. It was a strong fortress on the left bank
                    of the Tiber on the confines of Etruria. Iguvium (Gubbio), which struck coins
                    after the standard of Tuder, was a strong place likewise on the western or
                    Etruscan side of the Apennines. The fact that it is only in towns on the side
                    next Etruria that a coinage is found indicates that it was from the Etruscans
                    they borrowed the art. The Umbrians counted their day from noon to noon. But
                    whether they borrowed this likewise from the Etruscans we do not know (Pliny,
                    ii. 77). In their measuring of land they employed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >versus,</hi> a measure common to them and the Oscans (Frontinus, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Limit.,</hi> p. 30), 3⅜ of which went to the Roman <hi
                    rend="italic">jugerum.</hi> When the Romans undertook the conquest of Italy, the
                    most feeble resistance of all was offered to them by the Umbrians. In the great
                    struggle between the Samnite confederacy and Rome Umbria played an insignificant
                    part. It is probable that all through the Second Samnite War their sympathies
                    were altogether on the side of their Samnite kinsmen, and that some assistance
                    was afforded by individual communities. It is not unlikely therefore that it was
                    with a view to keep the Umbrians in check that the Romans planted a colony at
                    Nequinum on the Nar, whose inhabitants were known as Nartes Interamnates, and
                    who are included with the Etruscans, Iapydes, and Tadinates in the list of
                    persons who were forbidden to be Îresent at the sacred rites of Iguvium. At
                    length in 308 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the</p>
                <p>'mbrians made a vigorous effort to aid the Samnites, which, had it taken place
                    earlier in the war, might have had the most important influence on the issue of
                    the struggle. As it was, it came too late; the Etruscans had already laid down
                    their arms. The Umbrians, who threatened to march on Rome, were intercepted by
                    Rullianus with the Roman army from Samnium on the upper Tiber, a step which the
                    Samnites now broken could not prevent; and this was sufficient to disperse the
                    Umbrian levies. When the Third Samnite War broke out, the Umbrians took no
                    active part in its operations; but how their sympathies lay is evident from
                    their affording a ready passage to the Samnite army under Gellius Egnatius on
                    its march to Etruria, 296 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> When the battle of
                    Sentinum (295) finally crushed the Samnites and Etruscans, Umbria remained in
                    the hands of the Romans. Henceforward the process of Latinizing went on
                    steadily, for by the 1st century B.C. we find them employing the Latin alphabet
                    in copies of the ancient sacerdotal ritual of Iguvium (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Eugubine Tables).</hi> We know that the Oscan language only finally expired in
                    the 1st century of our era, and there is no reason for believing that the
                    Umbrian had disappeared much earlier. When the Romans conquered the' Senones,
                    280 B.C., the Ager Gallicus was restored to Umbria, and both together formed
                    under the empire the sixth region of Italy.</p>
                <p>Strabo (v. 227) regards Ravenna as the boundary of Umbria. The Via Flaminia
                    passed up through it from Ocriculum to Ariminum, along which lay the important
                    towns of Narnia (Nami) Carsulae (Carsigliano), Mevania (Bevagna), Forum
                    Flaminii, Nuceria, and Forum Sempronii. To the east lay Interamna (Terni), the
                    probable birthplace of Tacitus, Spoletium (Spoleto), and the most important town
                    of Camerinum on the side of the Apennines towards ricenum. On the side towards
                    Etruria lay Tuder (Todi), Iguvium, which occupied a very advantageous position
                    close to the main pass through the Apennines, Ameria ( Amelia), and Hispellum
                    (Spello); on the Clitumnus (Clitunno) was Assisium (Assisi), the birthplace of
                    Propertius, whilst far to the north lay Sarsina, the birthplace of Plautus. For
                    the position of the country in the time of Augustus, see vol. xiii. Plate V.</p>
