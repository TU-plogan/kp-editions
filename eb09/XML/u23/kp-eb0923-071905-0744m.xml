                    Gothic race, and, through his translation of the Scriptures into Gothic, the
                    father of Teutonic literature, was born among the Goths of the trans-Danubian

                    that his ancestors were Christian captives from Sadagolthina in Cappadocia, who
                    had been carried off to the lands beyond the Danube in the Gothic raid of 267;
                    but the evidence on which this rests is inadequate. An authoritative record of
                    the outlines of his life has only been discovered within the last fifty years,
                    in a writing of Auxentius, his pupil and companion.</p>
                <p>At an early age Ulfilas was sent, either as an envoy or as a hostage for his
                    tribe, to Constantinople, probably on the occasion of the treaty arranged in
                    332. During the preceding century Christianity had been planted sporadically
                    among the Goths beyond the Danube, through the agency in part of Christian
                    captives, many of whom belonged to the order of clergy, and in part of merchants
                    and traders. Ulfilas may therefore have been a convert to Christianity when he
                    reached Constantinople. But it was here probably that he came into contact with
                    the Arian doctrines which gave the form to his later teaching, and here that he
                    acquired that command over the Greek and Latin tongues which equipped him for
                    his labours as a translator. For some time before 341 he worked as a “lector” or
                    reader of the Scriptures, probably among his own countrymen in Constantinople,
                    or among those attached as <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi> to the imperial
                    armies in Asia Minor. From this work he was called to return as missionary
                    bishop to his own country, being ordained by Eusebius of Nicomedia and “the
                    bishops who were with him” in 341. This ordination of Ulfilas as missionary
                    bishop by the chiefs of the semi-Arian party is at once an indication of their
                    determination to extend their influence by active missionary enterprise and
                    evidence that Ulfilas was now, if he had not been before, a declared adherent of
                    the Arian or semi-Arian party. He was now thirty years of age, and his work as
                    “bishop among the Goths” covered the remaining forty years of his life. For
                    seven of these years he wrought among the Visigoths beyond the Danube, till the
                    success which attended his labours, and the growing numbers of his flock, drew
                    down the persecution of the still pagan chief of the tribe. This “sacrilegus
                    judex” has been identified with Athanaric, a later persecutor, probably without
                    sufficient ground. The persecution was so severe that, to save his flock from
                    extinction or dispersion, Ulfilas decided to withdraw both himself and his
                    people from its range. With the consent of the emperor Constantius, he led them
                    across the Danube, “a great body of the faithful,” and settled in Maesia at the
                    foot of the range of Haemus, and near the site of the modern Tirnova (348). Here
                    they developed into a peace-loving pastoral people.</p>
                <p>The life of Ulfilas during the following thirty-three years is marked only by one
                    recorded incident, his visit to Constantinople in 360, to attend the council
                    convened by the Arian or Homoian party. His work and influence were not,
                    however, confined to his own immediate flock, but radiated by means of his
                    writings (homilies and treatises), and through the disciples he despatched as
                    missionaries, among all the tribes of the Gothic stock beyond the Danube. By
                    this time probably he had made some progress with his version of the Scriptures,
                    and copies of parts of it would begin to circulate. Thus the church beyond the
                    Danube, which had not been extinguished on Ulfilas’s withdrawal, began to grow
                    once more in numbers and importance, and once more had to undergo the fires of
                    persecution. Catholic missionaries had not been wanting in the meanwhile, and in
                    the indiscriminate persecution by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n745/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0745-0720"/> Athanaric between 370 and 375 Catholics and
                    Arians stood and fell side by side. The religious quarrel either accentuated, or
                    was accentuated by, political differences, and the rival chiefs, Athanaric and
                    Frithigern, appeared as champions of Paganism and Christianity respectively.
                    Then followed the negotiations with the emperor Valens, the general adhesion of
                    the Visigoths under Frithigern to Arian Christianity, the crossing of the Danube
                    by himself and a host of his followers, and the troubles which culminated in the
                    battle of Adrianople and the death of Valens (378). The part played by Ulfilas
                    in these troublous times cannot be ascertained with certainty. It may have been
                    he who, as a “presbyter Christiani ritus” conducted negotiations with Valens
                    before the battle of Adrianople; but that he headed a previous embassy asking
                    for leave for the Visigoths to settle on Roman soil, and that he then, for
                    political motives, professed himself a convert to the Arian creed, favoured by
                    the emperor, and drew with him the whole body of his countrymen,—these and other
                    similar stories of the orthodox church historians appear to be without
                    foundation. The death of Valens, followed by the succession and the early
                    conversion to Catholicism of Theodosius, dealt a fatal blow to the Arian party
                    within the empire. Ulfilas lived long enough to see what the end must be.
                    Hardships as well as years must have combined to make him an old man, when in
                    381 he was sent for to Constantinople. The emperor had summoned him, for what
                    purpose cannot be clearly ascertained. A split seems to have taken place among
                    the Arians at Constantinople. Party riots were too familiar there, and a fierce
                    dispute over a theological dogma, however abstruse, placed the peace of the
                    city, if not the security of the palace, in jeopardy. Ulfilas was summoned to
                    meet the innovators, and either by argument or by influence to induce them to
                    surrender the opinion which caused the dispute. His pupil Auxentius describes
                    how, “in the name of God,” he set out upon his way, hoping to prevent the
                    teaching of these new heretics from reaching “the churches of Christ by Christ
                    committed to his charge.” No sooner had he reached Constantinople than he fell
                    sick, “having pondered much about the council,” and before he had put his hand
                    to the task which had brought him he died, probably in January 381. A few days
                    later there died, also in Constantinople, his old enemy and persecutor,
                    Athanaric.</p>
                <p>The Arianism of Ulfilas was a fact of pregnant consequence for his people, and
                    indirectly for the empire. It had been his lifelong faith, as we learn from the
                    opening words of his own testament— “Ego Ulfilas semper sic credidi.” If, as
                    seems probable from the circumstances of his ordination, he was a Semi-Arian and
                    a follower of Eusebius in 341, at a later period of his life he departed from
                    this position, and vigorously opposed the teaching of his former leader. He
                    appears to have joined the Homoian party, which took shape and acquired
                    influence before the council of Constantinople in 360, where he adhered with the
                    rest of the council to the creed of Ariminum, with the addendum that in future
                    the terms <hi rend="italic">i∏r0στa&lt;rιs</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >oi&gt;&lt;rla</hi> should be excluded from Christological definitions. Thus we
                    learn from Auxentius that he condemned Homoousians and Homoiousians alike,
                    adopting for himself the Homoian formula, “filium similem esse patri suo.” This
                    Arian form of Christianity was imparted by Ulfilas and his disciples to most of
                    the tribes of the Gothic stock, and persisted among them, in spite of the
                    persecution, hatred, and political disasters it involved, for two centuries.</p>
                <p>The other legacy bequeathed by U lfilas was of less questionable value. His
                    version of the Scriptures (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gothic Language,</hi> vol.
                    X. p. 852) is his greatest monument as a way-breaker and a scholar. By it he
                    became the first to raise a barbarian tongue to the dignity of a literary
                    language; and the skill, knowledge, and adaptive ability it displays make it the
                    crowning testimony of his powers as well as of his devotion to his work.</p>
                <p>The personal qualities of the man may be inferred from his pupil’s description of
                    him as “of most upright conversation, truly a confessor of Christ, a teacher of
                    piety, and a preacher of truth,—a man whom I am not competent to praise
                    according to his merit, yet altogether keep silent I dare not”</p>
