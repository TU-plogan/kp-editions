                    Nile. The country bordering the lake and to the north-west is mountainous, the
                    mountains being arranged in low parallel chains. The hills, covered with
                    splendid timber and abundant underwood, rise to a height of 400 feet above their
                    valleys, through which sluggish streams flow to the lake. Farther north the
                    country becomes a plain, and the eastern portion of Uganda, between Rubaga and
                    the Nile, consists of undulating country, varied by deep narrow valleys. The
                    geological formation of the country is volcanic or metamorphic; two or three
                    feet of rich black alluvial soil form the upper strata, covering a bed of red
                    sandy clay, often 30 feet thick. In some places porcelain earth is found, as
                    well as large masses of mica. Ironstone is present in considerable quantities,
                    but as yet no other metals have been discovered. The climate is mild, and the
                    temperature remarkably uniform throughout the year; the thermometric range is
                    from 50° to 90° F.; but the mean annual variation is only 20°. The annual
                    rainfall is 50 inches, the greatest amount of rain occurring in March, April,
                    May, and September, October, and November, when rain falls nearly every day,
                    thunderstorms being frequent.</p>
                <p>The population of Uganda is about five millions. The men are tall and well-built,
                    and have good features and dark chocolate-coloured skin, with woolly hair. The
                    women in their youth are goodlooking. The country is divided into three
                    provinces—Uddu in the south, Singo in the west, and Changwe in the east, to
                    which must be added about 400 islands in the lake. The government of the country
                    is feudal, the king being nominally supreme. Succession to the throne is
                    hereditary, but the successor is usually a minor <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0743-0718"/> chosen by three hereditary chiefs, who with the
                    young king’s mother carry on the government until he is of age. The reigning
                    family in Uganda is descended from the Wahuma tribe; the late king Mtesa
                    professed to trace back his descent to Kintu (or Ham), the founder of the
                    dynasty. The country is ruled by the king, three hereditary chiefs/ and a
                    council of minor chiefs,—two hereditary chiefs and a certain proportion of the
                    others being continually in residence at Rubaga, the capital of the country. The
                    laws are strict, and the administration of justice is conducted in an orderly
                    manner. There is no real taxation, but the people are compelled to render feudal
                    service to all their superiors. The Waganda may be divided into four classes,
                    the lowest class being the slave population, consisting of prisoners taken in
                    war and their descendants; next come the “bachopi” or peasants, who form the
                    mass of the population; the third class are the “batongoli,” or chiefs, who are
                    recruited from the bachopi, but whose honours are not hereditary; they receive
                    their rank for distinguished bravery in the field or for services rendered to
                    the state, and they are the governros of the villages. The highest class is that
                    of the “bakungu,” a superior grade of chiefs, all belonging to the “luchiko” or
                    state council, and being governors of large districts of land. The three great
                    hereditary chiefs belong to this class, and they are supreme governors of the
                    three great districts into which Uganda is divided. The Waganda are very
                    warlike; all adult males are compelled to serve in the army when required, and
                    the military organization, having its headquarters at the capital, ramifies
                    throughout the whole land. Game is very plentiful: elephants, buffaloes, zebras,
                    rhinoceroses, wild boars, twelve species of antelopes, lions, leopards, jackals,
                    foxes, hyaenas, hares, chimpanzees, and several species of monkeys inhabit the
                    forest. Snakes are numerous; hippopotami, crocodiles, and otters abound in the
                    lake and in the Nile, as also many water-rats. The principal birds are parrots,
                    guinea-fowl, owls, vultures, adjutants, goatsuckers, kites, eagles, ducks,
                    geese, storks, cranes, herons, gulls, scarlet flamingos, darters, the sacred and
                    glossy ibis, and brilliantly coloured honey-birds. The principal insects are
                    mosquitos, fleas, locusts, white and driver ants, and butterflies of many
                    species. The domestic animals are cows, goats, and a few sheep and dogs. The
                    Waganda live chiefly upon a vegetable diet, the banana forming the staple food;
                    it grows everywhere, and requires little or no cultivation. The sweet potato is
                    the chief vegetable cultivated, but coffee, sugar-cane, cassava, maize, sesame,
                    millet, tullabone, several species of beans, and two or three kinds of pumpkins
                    are grown to a small extent. The principal fruits are the mpafu and a species of
                    amomum. Strangers have introduced wheat, rice, guavas, papaws, pomegranates,
                    tomatoes, onions, and radishes. Wine is made from the banana tree, and is a
                    staple drink. Butter and cheese are also made. A good deal of manufacture is
                    carried on, for the people are ingenious and clever workmen, and their work is
                    tasteful, neat, and exact. Two kinds of pottery, a coarse and a fine variety,
                    are manufactured in considerable quantities. The basket work is extremely good,
                    and the metalwork far superior to any seen among the neighbouring tribes. The
                    manufacture of bark-cloths, in which most of the people are clothed, is very
                    extensively carried on, and their wood-work and boat-building are of very
                    superior quality. Tanning, dyeing, and bead-work employ numbers of the people.
                    There is not very much home trade in Uganda; it is limited to the barter of
                    native manufactures. Several times a year caravans aιτive from Zanzibar,
                    bringing calico, guns, powder, files, knives, &amp;c. The standard value of any
                    article is reckoned by 100 cowries or an arm’s length of calico and beads; hoes,
                    salt, and fish are also employed as mediums of exchange. The language spoken in
                    Uganda belongs to the great Bantu family, and is very rich in words. It has ten
                    classes of nouns, the noun being the most important part of speech. Grammatical
                    inflexions are formed by prefixes; the inflexions of verbs, adjectives, and
                    pronouns vary according to the class of the governing noun. Adjectives agree
                    with the substantive in number and case, and always follow the noun. There are
                    personal, possessive, relative, demonstrative, and interrogative pronouns, and
                    several forms of verbs. The VVaganda are very good arithmeticians. The root of
                    all multiples is ten; tallies are used as aids to the memory. The people are
                    very musical; their voices are clear and melodious, and of considerable range.
                    They have a great variety of tunes,— orchestral, dance, and vocal music having
                    distinct characteristics. Their musical instruments consist of harmonicons,
                    rattles, drums, horns, whistles, flutes, and harps. The Waganda have no images
                    or outward symbols of their gods; and they think that the world is ruled by
                    spirits or demons, to whom Katonga, the great creator, has deputed his power.
                    They worship Mukasa, the god of the lake; Naduala, the god of small-pox; Chiwuka
                    and Nenda, the gods of war; and several of the former monarchs of Uganda, who
                    are believed to be demi-gods. A thunder spirit is also invoked. The gods of war
                    are supposed to inhabit certain trees, and offerings are made to them before
                    entering the war-path; like offerings are also made to the god of the lake
                    before commencing a voyage upon its waters.</p>
                <p>The Waganda are courteous, cleanly, given to hospitality, but drunken, and to a
                    certain extent indolent. Their standard of morality, even judged by that of the
                    surrounding tribes, is not high. Human life is little respected; they are
                    untruthful and indecent. Unless moved by passion, they are not cruel;
                    passionate, they are not revengeful. Children are well treated, as are the aged
                    men. On account of the extensive prevalence of polygamy, women occupy a somewhat
                    low social grade.</p>
                <p>Uganda was first visited by Speke and Grant in 1860, and the country has since
                    been visited by numerous Europeans, chiefly missionaries. The Church Missionary
                    Society and the Roman Catholics have mission stations in the country. In 1886
                    some forty of their converts were burnt at the stake, and in the same year
                    Bishop Hannington was murdered on the borders of the country by the orders of
                    King Mwanga.</p>
