                    comprised the four islands of Zanzibar, Pemba, Lamu, and Mafia (Monfia),
                    together with the adjacent seaboard from about 3° N. to 10° S. lat., with
                    undefined limits towards the interior. But by the Anglo-German convention,
                    signed in London on 29th October 1886, the territory on the mainland was
                    restricted to the strip of coastlands ten nautical miles broad, stretching from
                    the mouth of the Miningani river at the bay of Tunghi, just south of Cape
                    Delgado, northwards to Kipini at the mouth of the Tana, together with the
                    isolated stations of Kisimayu (Kismayu), Brava, Merka, and Magdoshu (Magadoxo)
                    on the Somal coast, each with a land circuit of ten nautical miles, and
                    Warsheikh on the same coast, with a land circuit of five nautical miles. Since
                    then, however, further changes have taken place. The sultan’s officers have been
                    replaced in the seaports of Dar-es-Salaam and Pangani on the Zanzibar coast
                    proper by commissioners of the German East African Association, to whom the
                    customs of those places have been farmed; the port of Tunghi below Cape Delgado
                    has been claimed and forcibly occupied (1887) by the Portuguese; the island of
                    Pemba appears to have been ceded (May 1888) to the <pb break="no"

                    lastly, the station of Kisimayu on the Somal coast is claimed (June 1888) by
                    Italy in reparation of an affront offered to the Italian consul at Zanzibar.
                    But, as defined by the above-mentioned convention, the reduced dominions of the
                    sultan have areas (in square miles) and estimated populations (1887) as under:—

                <p>The political and commercial, as well as the geographical, centre of the state is
                    the fertile and densely peopled island of Zanzibar, which lies at a mean
                    distance of 20 miles from the Swahili coast, between 5° 40' and 6° 30' S. lat.
                    With the neighbouring Pemba (to the north) and the more distant Mafia (to the
                    south) it forms an independent geological system, resting on a foundation of
                    coralline reefs, and constituting a sort of outer coast-line, which almost
                    everywhere presents a rocky barrier to the fury of the waves rolling in from the
                    Indian Ocean. All three are disposed parallel to the adjacent seaboard, from
                    which they are separated by shallow waters, mostly under thirty fathoms, and
                    strewn with numerous reefs dangerous to navigation, especially in the Mafia
                    channel opposite the Rufiji delta.</p>
                <p>Mafia itself is low and fertile, and extensively planted with cocoa-nut palms. It
                    is continued southwards by an extensive reef, on which stands the chief village,
                    Chobe, the residence of the governor and of a few Arab and Hindu (Banyan)
                    traders. Chobe stands on a shallow creek inaccessible to shipping.</p>
                <p>Zanzibar, the Unguya of the natives, is not exclusively of coralline formation,
                    but also presents several heights of a reddish ferruginous clay, rising in
                    gentle slopes above the central plains. In the south these heights nowhere
                    exceed 400 or 450 feet; but on the north-west coast they develop a chain of
                    hills disposed parallel to the shore and attaining an elevation of a little over
                    1000 feet. The forests by which the island was formerly covered have mostly
                    disappeared, and the greater part of the rich soil is carefully cultivated,
                    yielding two annual crops of corn, and four of manioc, the staple food of the
                    people. There are extensive cocoa-nut groves, and from India and Malaysia have
                    been introduced the mangosteen, guava, durian, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, all
                    of which thrive well. The soil seems specially suited for the clove, which,
                    although nearly destroyed by the terrific cyclone of 1872, has already recovered
                    from that disaster, and the annual export of this spice now exceeds £10,000 in
                    value. Although the fauna is almost exclusively continental, Zanzibar till
                    recently possessed a distinct variety of <hi rend="italic">Colobus (C.
                    kirkii)</hi> which appears to be now extinct.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>H. H. Johnston, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Kilima-Njarο Expedition,</hi> p. 38.</p></note> Some years ago a hippopotamus
                    visited the island from the mainland; but no carnivora are now found larger than
                    the serval and wild cat.</p>
                <p>On the east side of the island there still survive a few groups of Wa-Hadimu
                    Bantus, who represent the aboriginal stock. But elsewhere, and especially in the
                    capital (for which, see below), the population is of an extremely heterogeneous
                    character, including full-blood and half-caste Arabs, Indian “Canarians” (that
                    is, half-caste Portuguese from Kanara on the Malabar Coast of India), Swahili of
                    every shade, slaves or freedmen from all parts of East Africa, Europeans, and
                    Americans, (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Swahili.)</hi></p>
                <p>The neighbouring island of Pemba, intersected by 5° S. lat., is even more
                    fertile, but much less cultivated, than Zanzibar. From the luxuriant vegetation
                    which everywhere clothes the cliffs to their summits it takes the name of the
                    “Green.” The land is exclusively owned by great Arab proprietors, who work their
                    plantations with scarcely disguised slave labour and export considerable
                    quantities of cloves, which here also find a congenial home. The capital,
                    Shaki-Shaki, which lies at the head of a shallow creek on the west side, is
                    inaccessible to shipping. But at Kishi-Kashi, at the north-west extremity, there
                    is a deep and well-sheltered harbour, though of somewhat difficult approach.
                    Here resides the chief of the Arab landed aristocracy, who has hitherto been
                    more of a vassal than a subject of the sultan, and whose allegiance has lately
                    been transferred to the British East African Association.</p>
                <p>Lamu also, the fourth member of the sultan’s former insular possessions, has
                    ceased to fly the Zanzibar flag. It is a small flat island lying close to the
                    mainland above the mouth of the Ozi branch of the Tana delta, and appears to be
                    now incorporated in the adjacent German territory of Vitu land. Lamu, its
                    capital, with a reported population of 15,000, has a fine harbour, formed by a
                    long deep channel separating it from the neighbouring island of Manda.</p>
                <p>The Zanzibar seaboard (now more generally known as the Swahili coast) is a
                    low-lying swampy and alluvial region, rising gently from the sea towards the
                    first terraced escarpments of the continental plateau. Owing to the numerous
                    streams reaching the coast along this seaboard —Rovuma, Ukeredi, Umbi-Kuru,
                    Rufiji, Rufu, Wami, Umba, and others—a great part of the surface consists of
                    rich alluvial soil, densely covered with a tropical vegetation. Here the warm
                    currents setting landwards from the Indian Ocean bring both moisture and heat,
                    so that this coast has a higher temperature and heavier rainfall than the
                    Atlantic seaboard under the same parallels of latitude.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mean temperature of the West and East Coasts
                    72 and 80 Fahr. respectively; average annual rainfall at Zanzibar 60 inches; at
                    Loanda (Atlantic side) 36 inches; rainfall at Zanzibar in 1859 (exceptional) 170
                    inches.</p></note> Thanks to these conditions, while the climate is oppressive
                    and malarious, the vegetation is extremely luxuriant, assuming about the marshy
                    deltas the aspect of an impenetrable jungle of mangroves, reeds, and tall
                    grasses, growing to a height of 12 or 14 feet. A characteristic plant is the <hi
                    rend="italic">msandarusi</hi> or copal-tree of the lower Rufiji valley, which
                    yields the best gum known to commerce. Other economic plants more or less
                    extensively cultivated are rice, maize, millet, the cocoa-nut and oil palm,
                    besides several European species already acclimatized at Bagamoyo and other
                    stations. But nearly the whole of this region is well suited for raising
                    tropical produce, such as sugar, coffee, cotton, indigo, cinnamon, cloves, and
                    other spices.</p>
                <p>Besides Dar-es-Salaam and Pangani, surrendered to the Germans (see above), the
                    chief stations and seaports, going northwards, are Lindi, Kilwa (Quiloa),
                    Bagamoyo, Mombasa (Mombas), and Malindi (Melinda). Of these Bagamoyo is at
                    present the most important, as the starting-point of travellers and traders for
                    the interior. Here are also the headquarters of the French Roman Catholic
                    missions in east equatorial Africa, with training schools, extensive
                    plantations, and gardens of acclimatization. Kilwa, Mombasa, and Malindi, great
                    and flourishing emporiums under the Zenj empire, are now almost abandoned. This
                    remark applies also to Magdoshu, the chief isolated station on the Somal coast
                    belonging to Zanzibar.</p>
                <p>From the earliest times of which there is any authentic record the whole of the
                    seaboard from the Somal coast to an unknown distance southwards was comprised
                    within the dominions of the Zenj (Zang) potentates, who for centuries claimed
                    and vindicated the title of “sovereign of the sea.” From them the seaboard <pb

                    Arabs, a term which thus corresponds to the Hindu-bar, or “land of the Hindu,”
                    formerly applied to the west coast of India on the opposite side of the
                    intervening Arabian Sea. By Ibn Batuta and other Arab writers the Zenj people
                    themselves are spoken of in a general way as Mohammedan Negroes; and they are no
                    doubt still represented by the semi-civilized and highly intelligent Mohammedan
                    Bantus now collectively known as the Swahili or “coast people.” Their empire
                    began to decline soon after the appearance of the Portuguese in the eastern
                    waters towards the close of the 15th century. To them fell in rapid succession
                    the great cities of Kilwa with its 300 mosques (1505), Mombasa the “Magnificent”
                    (1505), and soon after Malindi and Magdoshu the “Immense” (Ibn Batuta). On the
                    rains of the Portuguese power in the 17th century was built up that of the imams
                    of Muscat, who ruled over a great part of south Arabia and the whole of the
                    Zanzibar coast for over a century and a half down to 1856. On the death of the
                    imam, or rather the “sayyid,” Said of Muscat in that year his dominions were
                    divided between his two sons, the African section falling to Majid, who was
                    succeeded in 1870 by his younger brother Bargash ibn Said, commonly known as
                    sultan of Zanzibar. He lived long enough to witness the recent dismemberment of
                    his dominions, and in March 1888 left to his son and successor, Sayyid Khalif, a
                    mere fragment of the former powerful Mohammedan empire on the East-African
                    seaboard. The administration of the “ten-mile zone” on the mainland, although
                    reserved to the sultan by the Anglo-German convention of 1886, was practically
                    surrendered to the Germans in August 1888 when the German East African Company
                    hoisted their flag jointly with the sultan’s at fourteen ports along this
                    seaboard.</p>
