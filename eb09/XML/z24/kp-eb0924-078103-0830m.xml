                    waters of the Polytimetus. The present Russian province of Zerafshan, which is
                    densely peopled along the course of the river, has a length of nearly 250 miles
                    from west to east, a width of from 50 to 100 miles, and an area of 19,665 square
                    miles. It is bounded on the W. by Bokhara, on the N. by the Kizil-kum Desert of
                    Syr-Daria and the Russian province of Ferghana, on the E. by the Alai plateau,
                    and on the S. by the vassal khanates of Bokhara,—Karategin, Hissar,
                    Shahri-Syabs, and Karshi. High chains of mountains enclose the province on three
                    sides. To the north are the Turkestan Mountains, which separate the tributaries
                    of the Syr from those of the Amu, rising to 22,000 feet in their highest
                    snow-clad peaks, and crossed by but few passes, which themselves range from
                    10,000 to 13,000 feet. In the west the Turkestan Mountains are joined by the
                    Nura-tau Mountains, which have a north-westerly direction (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Turkestan).</hi> In the south-east the valley of the Zerafshan
                    is separated from that of the Surkhab by the grand snow-clad Hissar Range, which
                    runs from north-east to south-west, and by several chains parallel to it, while
                    farther west a series of mountains, partly running also towards the south-west
                    and partly towards the north-west, separate it from the Bokhara plains of the
                    Amu. The lowest passes across these chains have altitudes of not less than 7000
                    feet. But the valley of the Zerafshan lies broadly open towards the steppes in
                    the west, and has supplied an easy route for the railway from the Caspian by
                    Merv to Samarkand.</p>
                <p>Granites and all kinds of crystalline slates are widely developed in the
                    mountains which enclose Zerafshan. Carboniferous limestones are met with in the
                    west; but the great bulk of the deposits which overlie the crystalline slates,
                    and are raised to the greatest heights in the highlands, belong to a more recent
                    geological time, namely, to the Secondary—chiefly Chalk—and Tertiary periods.
                    The Zerafshan valley owes its fertility to the thick terraces of loess which
                    surround the base of the mountains and sometimes reach a thickness of 100
                    feet.</p>
                <p>The Zerafshan river, which owes its name(“gold-spreading”)probably more to the
                    fertility it brings than to the gold which is found in very small quantities in
                    its sands, rises under the name of Matchi from a large glacier, fed by the high
                    peaks which rise at the junction (improperly called Kok-su) of the Turkestan
                    Mountains with the Alai Range. The altitude of the glacier is about 9000 feet,
                    and thence the Zerafshan flows due west in a narrow valley, with a fall of not
                    less than 40 feet per mile. Several villages are scattered over the slopes of
                    the mountains; and some thirty bridges, made of poplar trees felled across the
                    river and swaying under the weight of the foot passenger, furnish means of
                    communication. After a course of nearly 100 miles in the mountains the Zerafshan
                    receives from the left the Fan, with the Yagnob, which flows in a high
                    longitudinal valley, separated from the main river by the lofty Zerafshan Range.
                    About Pendjakent it enters on its middle course along a broad valley from 20 to
                    50 miles wide. Large <hi rend="italic">aryks,</hi> or irrigation canals, one of
                    which is 50 miles in length and has all the appearance of a river, distribute
                    the waters of the Zerafshan over the valley, while the river itself divides into
                    two great branches, 10 to 12 miles apart, forming a large island, the Miankal,
                    which is the most fertile part of the province. A dam keeps up the water in the
                    southern branch, Kara-Daria, close by which is situated <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Samarkand</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> and five large <hi rend="italic"
                    >aryks</hi> distribute its water over the fields. Numberless canals drain off
                    its waters farther west in the neighbourhood of the city of Bokhara, so that,
                    after carrying an insignificant volume of water to the small Lake Kara-kul, it
                    stops its course there, some 30 miles from the Amu-Daria, of which it formerly
                    was an affluent.</p>
                <p>The population of Zerafshan was reckoned at 351,900 in 1883. The bulk of the
                    inhabitants are Uzbegs and Tajiks, the remainder consisting of a few thousand
                    Persians, Hindus, and Jews respectively; the Russians are mainly military, civil
                    functionaries, merchants, and a few peasant settlers. Wheat, barley, rice, and
                    other cereals, as also lucerne, are widely cultivated, and the gardens <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0831-0782"/> of Zerafshan are beautiful. A variety of petty
                    trades are carried on in the towns and villages.</p>
                <p>Zerafshan is divided into three districts, the chief towns of which are Samarkand
                    (36,000 inhabitants), now connected by rail with Bokhara, Merv, and Mikhailovsk
                    on Krasnovodsk Bay in the Caspian Sea; Katty-Kurgan (4425), close by the
                    frontier of Bokhara; and Pendjakent (1880), chief town of the mountain district
                    of the upper Zerafshan, known as Kohistan.</p>
