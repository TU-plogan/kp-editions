                    by the <hi rend="smallcaps">Parsees</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> as their
                    bible and prayer book. The name “Zend-Avesta” has been current in Europe since
                    the time of Anquetil Duperron (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 1771), but the Parsees
                    themselves call it simply <hi rend="italic">A vesta,— Zend (i.e.,</hi>
                    “interpretation ”) being specially employed to denote the translation and
                    exposition of a great part of the Avesta which exists in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pahlavi</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> Text and translation are often
                    spoken of together in Pahlavi books as <hi rend="italic">Aνistâk va Zand</hi>
                    (“Avesta and Zend”), whence (through a misunderstanding) our word Zend-Avesta.
                    The origin and meaning of the word “Avesta” (or in its older form <hi
                    rend="italic">Avistâk)</hi> are alike obscure; it cannot be traced further back
                    than the Sasanian period. The language of the Avesta is still frequently called
                    Zend; but, as already implied, this is a mistake. We possess no other document
                    written in it, and on this account modern Parsee scholars, as well as the older
                    Pahlavi books, speak of the language and the writing indifferently as Avesta. As
                    the original home of the language can only be very doubtfully conjectured, we
                    shall do well to follow the usage sanctioned by old custom and apply the word to
                    both. Although the Avesta is a work of but moderate compass (comparable, say, to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> taken
                    together), there nevertheless exists no single MS. which gives it in its
                    entirety. This circumstance alone is enough to reveal the true nature of the
                    book: it is a composite whole, a collection of writings as the Old Testament is.
                    It consists, as we shall afterwards see, of the last remains of the extensive
                    sacred literature in which the Zoroastrian faith was formerly set forth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Contents and Character.—</hi> As we now have it, the Avesta
                    consists of four parts,—the Yasna, the Vispered, the Vendidad, and the Khordah
                    Avesta.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Yasna,</hi> the principal liturgical book of the
                    Parsees, in 72 chapters (<hi rend="italic">hâiti</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >hâ),</hi> contains the texts that are read by the priest at the solemn Yasna
                    (Izeshne) ceremony. The arrangement of the chapters is purely liturgical,
                    although their matter in many cases has nothing to do with the liturgical
                    action. The kernel of the whole book, around which the remaining portions are
                    grouped, consists of the <hi rend="italic">Gâthâs</hi> or “hymns” of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Zoroaster (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.),</hi> the oldest and
                    most sacred portion of the entire canon. The Yasna accordingly falls into three
                    sections of about equal length. (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The introduction
                    (chaps. 1-27) for the most part is made up of long-winded, monotonous,
                    reiterated invocations. <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> The Gâthâs (chs. 28-54)
                    contain the discourses, exhortations, and revelations of the prophet, written in
                    a metrical style and an archaic language, different in many respects from that
                    ordinarily used in the Avesta. As to the authenticity of these hymns, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Zoroaster.</hi> The Gâthâs proper, arranged according to the
                    metres in which they are written, fall into five subdivisions (28-37, 43-46,
                    47-50, 51, 53). Between chap. 37 and chap. 43 is inserted the so-called
                    Seven-Chapter Yasna (<hi rend="italic">haptanghâiti),</hi> a number of small
                    prose pieces not far behind the Gâthâs in antiquity, (c) The so-called Later
                    Yasna (<hi rend="italic">Aparô Yasnô)</hi> (chaps. 54-72) has contents of
                    considerable variety, but consists mainly of invocations.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Vispered,</hi> a minor liturgical work in 24 chapters
                    <hi rend="italic">karde),</hi> is alike in form and substance completely
                    dependent on the Yasna; it is based upon the arrangement of the Yasna in its
                    present form, a circumstance proving its much later date as a whole. The name
                    Vispered, meaning “all the chiefs” (<hi rend="italic">vispê rataνô)</hi> has
                    reference to the spiritual heads of the religion of Ormuzd, invocations to whom
                    form the main contents of the book.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Vendidad ( Vîdaêvô Dâtem), i.e.,</hi> the law for the
                    “enemies of the devil,” contains in 22 chapters (<hi rend="italic">fargard)</hi>
                    a kind of dualistic account of creation (chap. 1), the legend of Yima and the
                    golden age (chap. 2), the praises of agriculture (chap. 3), and in the bulk of
                    the remaining chapters the circumstantial precepts of the religion <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n825/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0825-0776"/> with reference to purification and ecclesiastical
                    penance. It may with propriety be called the “priestly code” of the Parsees.</p>
                <p>The Yasna, Vispered, and Vendidad together constitute the Avesta in the stricter
                    sense of that word, and the reading of them appertains to the priest alone. For
                    liturgical purposes the separate chapters of the Vendidad and the Vispered are
                    sometimes inserted amongst those of the Yasna so as to form what is known as the
                    Vendidad Sâde, which then, accompanied by certain liturgical actions, is
                    publicly read in the Parsee worship. The reading of the Gâthâs and Vendidad in
                    this case may, when viewed according to the original intention, be taken as
                    corresponding in some sense to the sermon, while that of the Vispered and the
                    rest of the Yasna may be taken as corresponding to the hymns and prayers of
                    Christian worship.</p>
                <p>4. In marked contrast to the three already mentioned is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Khordah Avesta,</hi> or Little Avesta, which is designed equally for priesthood
                    and laity, and serves rather as a book of private devotion. Besides some short
                    prayers, such as the Nyâishes, the favourite daily prayers of the Parsees, it
                    contains the Yashts or songs of praise, twenty-one in number, addressed to the
                    Yazatas (Izads), the deities and angels of the Ormuzd creed.</p>
                <p>Over and above the four books just enumerated there are a considerable number of
                    fragments from other books, as well as quotations, glosses, and glossaries.</p>
                <p>In its present form, however, the Avesta is only a fragmentary remnant of the old
                    priestly literature of Zoroastrianism, a fact confessed by the learned tradition
                    of the Parsees themselves, according to which the number of Yashts was
                    originally thirty. The truth is that we possess but a trifling portion of a very
                    much larger original Avesta, if we are to believe native tradition, carrying us
                    back to the Sasanian period, which tells of an original Avesta in twenty-one
                    books called <hi rend="italic">nasks</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nosks,</hi> as to
                    the names, contents, and chapters of which we have several more or less detailed
                    accounts, particularly in the Pahlavi Dînkard and in the Rivayats. From the same
                    sources we learn that even then a considerable portion of the original Avesta
                    had been lost: we are told that of a number of nosks only a small portion was
                    found to be extant “after Alexander.” For example, of the seventh nosk, which
                    “before Alexander” had as many as fifty chapters, there then remained only
                    thirteen; and similar things are alleged about the eighth, ninth, tenth, and
                    other nosks. But even of the remains of the original Avesta, as these lay before
                    the authors referred to, only a small portion has survived to our time. Of all
                    the nosks one only, the nineteenth, has come down to us unimpaired and
                    intact,—the Vendidad. All the others, with the exception of slight traces, have
                    disappeared in the course of centuries.</p>
                <p>It would be rash to treat in an offhand way this old tradition about the
                    twenty-one nosks as pure invention. The number twenty-one indeed points to an
                    artificial arrangement of the material; for twenty-one is a sacred number, and
                    the most sacred prayer of the Parsees, the so-called Ahunô Vairyô (Honovar)
                    contains twenty-one words; and it is also true that in the enumeration of the
                    nosks we miss the names of the books we know—Yasna, Vispered, as well as the
                    Yashts and the Khordah Avesta. But either we must regard them as having been
                    included among the nosks, though under other names, or, what is even more
                    probable, we must assume that even at that early date special liturgical
                    manuals—the Yasna especially—distinct from the nosks had already been compiled
                    for the practical use of the priests. Further, the statements of the Dînkard and
                    other writings leave on one a very distinct impression that the authors actually
                    had before them the text of the nosks, or at all events of a large part of them.
                    And, besides, in other directions there are numerous indications that such books
                    had once really existed. In the Khordah Avesta as we now have it we find two
                    Srôsh Yashts; with regard to the first, it is expressly stated in old MSS. that
                    it was taken from the Hâdôkht nosk (the twentieth, according to the Dinkard).
                    From the same nosk also a considerable fragment (<hi rend="italic">Yt</hi>., 21
                    and 22 in Westergaard) has been taken. So also the extensive quotations from
                    Avesta texts in the <hi rend="italic">Niringistân,</hi> a Pahlavi book, are
                    probably the disjecta membra of the seventeenth (or Hûspâram) nosk. Lastly, the
                    numerous other fragments, the quotations in the Pahlavi translation, the many
                    references in the <hi rend="italic">Bundahish</hi> to passages of this Avesta
                    not now known to us, all presuppose the existence in the Sasanian period of a
                    much more extensive Avesta literature than the mere prayer book now in our
                    hands. The existence of an original Avesta is far from being a mere myth. But,
                    even granting that a certain obscurity still hangs undispelled over the problem
                    of the old Avesta, with its twenty-one nosks, we may well believe the Parsees
                    themselves, when they tell us that their sacred literature has passed through
                    successive stages of decay, the last of which is represented by the present
                    Avesta. There is evidence of this in the patchwork and fragmentary character of
                    some portions of the present Avesta; and, moreover, in the MS. evidence of
                    recent centuries we are able to observe with our own eyes the actual process of
                    abridgment gradually going on, and to trace the manner in which certain portions
                    of the present Avesta slowly passed out of currency. This holds good, in
                    particular, of the greater Yashts. The transcribers of the Khordah Avesta
                    satisfied themselves for the most part with those prayers which were currently
                    in use, such as the Nyâishes and one or two of the smaller and intermediate
                    Yashts. The great Yashts are not of very frequent occurrence: some of them
                    indeed are already met with but seldom, and MSS. containing all the Yashts are
                    of great rarity. Of the fifteenth, seventeenth, and nineteenth Yashts we might
                    even venture to predict that some centuries hence they may perhaps be found
                    defying the tooth of time in not more than a single manuscript copy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Origin and History.—</hi> While all that Herodotus (i. 132) has
                    got to say is that the Magi sang “the theogony” at their sacrifices, Pausanias
                    is able to add (v. 27, 3) that they read from a book. Hermippus in the 3d
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> affirmed that Zoroaster, the founder of
                    the doctrine of the Magi, was the author of twenty books, each containing
                    100,000 verses. According to the Arab historian Tabari, these were written on
                    1200 cowhides, a statement confirmed by Masudi, who writes, “Zartusht gave to
                    the Persians the book called Avesta. It consisted of twenty-one parts, each
                    containing 200 leaves. This book, in the writing which Zartusht invented and
                    which the Magi called the writing of religion, was written on 12,000 cowhides,
                    bound together by golden bands. Its language was the Old Persian, which no one
                    now understands.” These statements sufficiently establish the existence and
                    great bulk of the sacred writings. Parsee tradition adds a number of interesting
                    statements as to their history. According to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arda-Viraf-Nâma,</hi> stated to have been written during the Sasanian period,
                    the religion revealed through Zoroaster had subsisted in its purity for 300
                    years when Iskander Rumi (Alexander the Great) invaded and devastated Iran, and
                    burnt the Avesta which, written on cowhides with golden ink, was preserved in
                    the archives at Persepolis. According to the Dinkard, there were two copies, of
                    which one was burnt, while the second perished at the hands of the Greeks in
                    some other way. The Rivayats have it that Alexander burnt the greater part of
                    the twenty-one nosks, and go on to say that after his death the Zoroastrian
                    priests met, gathered the scattered fragments which had escaped the ravages of
                    war, and put together the present collection, which is but a small portion of
                    the original book. With regard to this editing the Dinkard gives various
                    details. It tells us that the collecting of the Avesta fragments, so far as
                    these were still extant, whether in writing or in oral tradition, began under
                    the last of the Arsacids at the command of King Vologeses. The first of the
                    Sasanians, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0826-0777"/> Ardeshîr Bâbagân, and his son Shapûr I. resumed
                    and continued the work, and proclaimed the new Avesta thus produced as
                    canonical. Finally, under Shapûr II. (309-380) a new revision and final
                    redaction were made by Adarbâd Mahraspand</p>
                <p>It is possible enough for historical criticism to regard this tradition in many
                    of its features as mere fiction, or as a perversion of facts made for the
                    purpose of transferring the blame for the loss of a sacred literature to other
                    shoulders than those really responsible for it. People may, if they choose,
                    absolve Alexander from the charge of vandalism of which he is accused; but the
                    fact nevertheless remains, that he suffered the palace at Persepolis to be burnt
                    (Diod., xvii. 72; Curt., v. 7). Even the statement as to the one or two complete
                    copies of the Avesta may be given up as the invention of a later day.
                    Nevertheless the essential elements of the tradition remain unshaken, viz., that
                    the original Avesta or old sacred literature, divided on account of its great
                    bulk and heterogeneous contents into many portions and a variety of separate
                    works, had an actual existence in numerous copies and also in the memories of
                    priests, that, although gradually diminishing in bulk, it remained extant during
                    the long period of foreign domination and ecclesiastical decay after the time of
                    Alexander, and that it served as a basis for the redaction subsequently made.
                    The kernel of this native tradition—the fact of a late collection of older
                    fragments—appears indisputable. The character of the book is entirely that of a
                    compilation.</p>
                <p>In its outward form the Avesta as we now have it belongs to the Sasanian period,
                    the last survival of the compilers’ work already alluded to. And it need hardly
                    be said that the collecting and arranging of the scattered fragments often
                    rendered necessary, or at least desirable, certain additions by the redactors’
                    own hands. But, broadly speaking, the materials out of which the compilers
                    reared their building belonged originally to older structures and are of very
                    various dates. Opinions differ greatly as to the precise age of the original
                    texts brought together by subsequent redactors: according to some, they are
                    pre-Achaemenian; according to Darmesteter, they were written in Media under the
                    Achaemenian dynasty; according to Eduard Meyer, they are on the whole of
                    Sasanian origin; according to some, their source must be sought in the east,
                    according to others, in the west, of Iran. But to search for a precise time or
                    exact locality is to deal with the question too narrowly; it is more correct to
                    say that the Avesta was worked at from the time of Zoroaster down to the
                    Sasanian period. Its oldest portions, the Gâthâs, proceed from Zoroaster
                    himself. This conclusion is inevitable for everyone to whom Zoroaster is an
                    historical personality, and who does not shun the labour of an unprejudiced
                    research into the meaning of those difficult texts (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Zoroaster).</hi> The rest of the Avesta, in spite of the opposite opinion of
                    learned Parsees, does not even claim to come from Zoroaster. As the Gâthâs
                    constitute the kernel of the Later Yasna, so they ultimately proved to be the
                    first nucleus of a religious literature at large. The language in which
                    Zoroaster taught, especially a later development of it,—an idiom indisputably
                    belonging to eastern Iran,—remained as the standard with the followers of
                    Zoroaster, and became the sacred language of the priesthood of the faith which
                    he had founded; as such it became, so to speak, absolved from the ordinary
                    conditions of time and space. Taught and acquired as an ecclesiastical language,
                    it was enabled to live an artificial life long after it had become extinct as a
                    vernacular,—in this respect comparable to the Latin of the Middle Ages or the
                    Hebrew of the rabbinical schools. The various texts themselves enable us to
                    trace its gradual paralysis, decay, and death. It is only from this point of
                    view that the language can be used as a criterion for the relative chronology of
                    these. Any more exact arrangement seems almost impossible; we have practically
                    no other tests to apply. The priests by whom the texts were edited gave them the
                    form intended to be valid once for all and refrained from any allusion to
                    ephemeral relations. The following conclusions may be stated in a general
                    way.</p>
                <p>The language of the Avesta travelled with the Zoroastrian religion and with the
                    main body of the priesthood, in all probability, that is to say, from east to
                    west; within the limits of Iran it became international. The Avesta texts must
                    have passed through a long process of development, which did not reach its close
                    till at a comparatively late period. Many portions are the result of repeated
                    redacting and compiling; older texts are removed from their original connexion,
                    and worked into new ones or made use of in these. In these operations the
                    revisers of the Sasanian epoch may be presumed to have had only the smallest
                    share; the texts they had before them were already for the most part in a
                    revised form. They were no longer in a position to give a relatively correct
                    text; what they still had in their power to some extent to perform is
                    approximately exhibited in such passages as <hi rend="italic">Yt.,</hi> 1, 12
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Yt</hi>., 2, 11 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.; Yt.,</hi> 10, 120 <hi rend="italic">sq.,—</hi> perhaps in part translated
                    back from the Pahlavi.</p>
                <p>The great Yashts and the Vendidad are the most instructive portions for the
                    history of the text. The original kernel of <hi rend="italic">Yashts</hi> 5, 8,
                    15, 17, 19 consists of the Iranian mythology of gods and heroes which had its
                    origin in the East, and there also was cast into a poetical form. Fragments of
                    it were worked into the framework of the great Yashts at a much later date. The
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Vend.,</hi> 2 used in a fragmentary way a poetic
                    version of the Yima legend. The redactor of <hi rend="italic">Vend.,</hi> 3,
                    judging from the monotonous and clumsy style of the opening sections, must have
                    been prosaic enough; yet from the twenty-fourth paragraph onwards we have a
                    bright and pleasant description of the blessings of agriculture, in a poetical
                    form, that contrasts singularly with what immediately precedes it, and must
                    certainly have been borrowed from an older source. In this way alone can we in
                    other instances also account for the numerous verses with which the prose is
                    often interspersed. Their function often was merely to set off and ornament the
                    later prose. Of “genuine” and “spurious” there can be in this connexion no
                    question, but only of “older” and “more recent.” However vague and obscure the
                    question may remain after all has been said, we can at least lay so much down as
                    fundamentally fixed, namely, that all that is metrical in the Avesta bears the
                    stamp of a higher antiquity than does the prose.</p>
                <p>As has been already stated, the Avesta now in our hands is but a small portion of
                    the book as edited under the Sasanians. The large part perished under the
                    devastating wave of persecution which broke over Iran with the Mohammedan
                    invasion, or under the still more fatal influences of the apathy and
                    forgetfulness of its proper guardians. The understanding of the older Avesta
                    texts was far from perfect even at the time when they were being edited and
                    revised. The need for a translation and interpretation became evident; and under
                    the later Sasanians the majority of the books, if not the whole of them, were
                    rendered into the current Pahlavi. A thorough use of this translation will not
                    be possible until we have it in good critical editions, and acquaintance with
                    its language ceases to be the monopoly of a few privileged individuals. For the
                    interpretation of the older texts it is of great value. The Parsee priest
                    Neryosangh subsequently translated a portion of the Pahlavi version into
                    Sanskrit.</p>
                <p>The MSS. of the Avesta are comparatively speaking of recent date. The oldest is
                    the Pahlavi Vispered in Copenhagen, of date <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n827/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0827-0778"/> 1258. Next come the four MSS. of the Herbad
                    Mihirâpân Kaî Khusro at Cambay (1323 and 1324), two Vendidads with Pahlavi in
                    London and Copenhagen, and two Yasnas with Pahlavi in Copenhagen and Bombay, in
                    the possession of Dastur Jamaspji Minocheherji, who of all the Parsees is
                    richest in old and good MSS. Generally speaking, the MSS. fall off in quality
                    and carefulness in proportion to their lateness; an honourable exception must be
                    made in favour of those proceeding from Kirman aud Yazd in Persia, mostly dating
                    from the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>
                <p>The first European scholar to direct attention to the Avesta was Hyde of Oxford,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Historia Religionis Veterum Persarum eorumque
                    Magorum</hi> (1700), which, however, failed to awaken any lasting interest in
                    the sacred writings of the Parsees. The merit of achieving this belongs to the
                    enthusiastic Orientalist Anquetil Duperron, the fruit of whose prolonged stay in
                    India (from 1754 to 1761) and his acquaintance with the Parsee priests was a
                    translation (certainly very defective) of the Zend-Avesta. The foundation of a
                    scientific exegesis was laid by Burnouf. The interpretation of the Avesta is one
                    of the most difficult problems of Oriental philology. To this very day no kind
                    of agreement has been reached by conflicting schools even upon some of the most
                    important points. The most salient contributions are those of Westergaard,
                    Spiegel, Darmesteter, Roth, and Bartholomae. Opinion is divided also as to the
                    significance of the Avesta in the literature of the world. The exaggerated
                    enthusiasm of Anquetil Duperron has been followed, especially since Spiegel’s
                    translation, by an excessive reaction. The future will doubtless be more just
                    with regard to the importance of the book for the history of religion in general
                    and even of Christianity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Editions.—</hi> The first complete editions were that by
                    Westergaard (Copenhagen, 1852-54) and that of the Avesta in the stricter sense,
                    along with the Pahlavi translation, by Spiegel (Vienna, 1853-58). A new and
                    complete edition by Geldner has been in course of publication since 1885. The
                    best translation is that by Darmesteter and Mills in <hi rend="italic">Sacred
