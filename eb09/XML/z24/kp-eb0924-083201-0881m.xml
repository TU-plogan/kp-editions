                    Margaret Meili, whose brother was abbot of the cloister of Fischingen in
                    Thurgau. The people of Wildhaus were in Zwingli’s time a self-ruled village
                    community. They had also bought from the abbots of St Gall the privilege of
                    electing their own pastor; and the first parish priest chosen by the votes of
                    the parishioners was Bartholomew Zwingli, the uncle of the Reformer, who
                    latterly became dean of Wesen. Zwingli thus came of a free peasant stock, and he
                    carried the marks of his origin all his life. When eight years old he was sent
                    to school at Wesen, where he lived with his uncle, the dean. Two years later he
                    was sent to Basel; and after a three years’ sojourn there he became a pupil in
                    the high school of Bern, where his master was Heinrich Wölflin, an accomplished
                    classical scholar, from whom Zwingli acquired that love of classical literature
                    which never left him. From Bern he went to Vienna (in 1500), and after two
                    years’ study there he returned to Basel. At Basel the celebrated Thomas
                    Wyttenbach was his master and friend, and taught him those Evangelical truths
                    which he afterwards so signally defended.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to avoid contrasting the joyous youth of Zwingli with the sad
                    childhood of Luther. Zwingli was full of love of family, of township, of
                    country, and of Christ. He had none of those dark religious experiences which
                    drove Luther to the convent, and which made him miserable there. He had never to
                    struggle alone in despair of soul, one step at a time, towards the gospel of
                    God’s free grace. Wyttenbach was very unlike those nominalist divines from whom
                    Luther learnt mediaeval theology. He foresaw many things which a later
                    generation discovered. Zwingli has assured us that Wyttenbach taught him that
                    the death of Christ, and not priests, masses, and pilgrimages, was a sufficient
                    ransom for the sins of the world; that he pointed out the errors of the
                    schoolmen and of Romish theology; and that he asserted that Holy Scripture, and
                    not ecclesiastical tradition, was the sole rule of faith. It cost Zwingli
                    nothing to break with the mediaeval church. He had been taught independence from
                    childhood, and shown how to think for himself while a student at Basel.</p>
                <p>When twenty-two years of age Zwingli was ordained by the bishop of Constance. He
                    preached his first sermon at Rapperswyl, and said his first mass among his own
                    people at Wildhaus. He was appointed (1506) to the parish of Glarus, where he
                    had leisure for study and began to read extensively and carefully in preparation
                    for future work. At Glarus too he gathered the boys of the district about him
                    (Aegidius Tschudi, the historian of Switzerland, among them) to teach them the
                    classics; and he set himself by a study of the masterpieces of ancient and
                    mediaeval rhetoric to learn the art of oratory. He tells us that at this time he
                    foresaw that a man who is called to be a preacher must know many things, two
                    things above all others—God, and how to speak. Meanwhile he tested every
                    doctrine in theology by the Word of God and took his stand firmly upon what it
                    taught him.</p>
                <p>The Swiss troops of Zwingli’s day were supposed to be the best in Europe, and
                    neighbouring states were glad to have their assistance in war. The Swiss were
                    accustomed to hire out. their soldiers for large sums of money to those states
                    who paid best. It was their custom also to send the parish priest of the
                    district from which the troops came as chaplain to the regiment. Zwingli went
                    twice, once in 1512 and again in 1515, with the men of Glarus. He saw the
                    demoralizing tendency of such mercenary warfare and ever afterwards denounced
                    the immoral traffic. In 1521 he persuaded the authorities of the canton of
                    Zurich to renounce it altogether.</p>
                <p>In 1516 Zwingli was transferred to Einsiedeln. It was then, and is still,
                    resorted to by thousands of pilgrims yearly, who come to visit the famous image
                    of the Virgin and Child which has been preserved there for at least a thousand
                    years. Zwingli denounced the superstition of pilgrimages. His sermons made a
                    great sensation and attracted attention in Rome. The papal curia had no wish to
                    quarrel with the Swiss, who furnished them with troops, and sought to silence
                    the Reformer by offers of promotion, which he refused. Soon afterwards he was
                    elected, after some opposition, to be preacher in the cathedral at Zurich, and
                    accepted the office (1518), having first obtained a pledge that his liberty to
                    preach the truth should not be interfered with. He began the fight almost on his
                    arrival. Bernhardin Samson, a pardon-seller like Tetzel, had been selling
                    indulgences in the Forest Cantons and proposed to come to Zurich. Zwingli
                    prevailed on the council to send the friar out of the country. In the beginning
                    of 1519 he began a series of discourses on the New Testament Scriptures,—on St
                    Matthew’s Gospel, on the Acts of the Apostles, and on the Pauline Epistles. The
                    sermons, preached “in simple Swiss language,” had a great effect. The
                    Reformation in Zurich was begun. The council of the canton was on Zwingli’s side
                    and protected their preacher. He began to preach against fasting and other Roman
                    practices; some of his followers put his precepts in practice and ate flesh in
                    Lent. The bishop of Constance accused them before the council of Zurich. Zwingli
                    was heard in their defence, and the accusation was abandoned. The victory on the
                    subject of fasting was followed by an attack on the doctrine of the celibacy of
                    the clergy. Pope Adrian VI. interfered, and asked the Zurichers to abandon
                    Zwingli. The Reformer persuaded the council to allow a public disputation, which
                    was held in 1523. Zwingli produced sixty-seven theses,<note anchored="true"

                    favour with such power that the council upheld the Reformer and separated the
                    canton from the bishopric of Constance. The Reformation, thus legally
                    established, went forward rapidly. The Latin language was discontinued in the
                    service; the incomes of chapters, convents, and monasteries were applied for
                    education; the celibacy of the clergy was abolished; monks and nuns were freed
                    from their vows; mass and image worship were declared to be idolatrous; and the
                    Eucharist in both kinds was celebrated by a solemn communion of all the Reformed
                    congregations on Maundy Thursday 1525.</p>

                <p>The progress of the Reformation in Zurich attracted the attention of all
                    Switzerland, and the Confederation became divided into two parties. The
                    Reformers found numerous supporters in the larger towns of Basel, Bern, and
                    Schaffhausen, and in the country districts of Glarus, Appenzell, and the
                    Grisons. The five Forest Cantons—Lucerne, Zug, Schwyz, Uri, and
                    Unterwalden—remained solidly opposed to all reforms. This anti-Reformation party
                    was also strong in the patrician oligarchies which drew papal pensions, and
                    enriched themselves by the nefarious blood traffic denounced by Zwingli. The
                    Zurichers felt it necessary to form a defensive league to prevent their
                    Reformation from being crushed by force. They were especially anxious to gain
                    Bern, and Zwingli challenged the Roman Catholics to a public disputation in that
                    city. No less than 350 ecclesiastics came to Bern from the various cantons to
                    hear the pleadings, which began on 2d January 1528 and lasted nineteen days.
                    Zwingli and his companions undertook to defend against all comers the following
                    ten propositions:— (1) That the Holy Christian Church, of which Christ is the
                    only Head, is born of the Word of God, abides therein, and does not listen to
                    the voice of a stranger; (2) that this church imposes no laws on the conscience
                    of people without the sanction of the Word of God, and that the laws of the
                    church are binding only in so far as they agree with the Word; (3) that Christ
                    alone is our righteousness and our salvation, and that to trust to any other
                    merit or satisfaction is to deny Him; (4) that it cannot be proved from the Holy
                    Scripture that the body and blood of Christ are corporeally present in the bread
                    and in the wine of the Lord’s Supper; (5) that the mass, in which Christ is
                    offered to God the Father for the sins of the living and of the dead, is
                    contrary to Scripture and a gross affront to the sacrifice and death of the
                    Saviour; (6) that we should not pray to dead mediators and intercessors, but to
                    Jesus Christ alone; (7) that there is no trace of purgatory in Scripture; (8)
                    that to set up pictures and to adore them is also contrary to Scripture, and
                    that images and pictures ought to be destroyed where there is danger of giving
                    them adoration; (9) that marriage is lawful to all, to the clergy as well as to
                    the laity; (10) that shameful living is more disgraceful among the clergy than
                    among the laity.</p>
                <p>These they defended to such purpose that the Bernese joined heartily in the
                    Reformation, and the enthusiasm of the people was fired by two burning sermons
                    preached by Zwingli from the minster pulpit to overflowing audiences. The two
                    parties henceforward faced each other in Switzerland. The country was in those
                    days a confederacy of republics, and yet was far from being a democracy. Most of
                    the cantons were ruled by aristocratic oligarchies who had pensions from foreign
                    Governments, and Zwingli’s appeal had always been from an oligarchy of pope,
                    bishops, and abbots to the congregation with the Bible in hand. He founded his
                    religious Reformation on the congregation, and this of itself suggested that the
                    state was nothing but the people. It so happened that those cantons which
                    remained firmly attached to Roman Catholicism were the least powerful, and yet
                    from historical position and the long custom of the Confederacy had the largest
                    legal influence in the country. The Forest Cantons had been the earliest to free
                    themselves. Isolated towns and districts after successful revolt had claimed the
                    protection of these little republics, and the Forest Cantons governed by means
                    of prefects a large number of places beyond their boundaries. This gave them
                    votes in the diet or federal council far beyond what they were entitled to by
                    their population and actual resources. These cantons felt that, if the
                    Reformation and the political ideas it suggested spread, their supremacy would
                    be overthrown and their rule confined within their own territories. Nor had they
                    in their upland valleys seen the worst abuses of the mediaeval church. They
                    dreaded the Reformation. They persecuted inquirers after truth, and imprisoned,
                    beheaded, and burnt the followers of Zwingli when they caught them within their
                    borders. Zwingli, alone among Protestant leaders, saw that the religious and the
                    political questions could not be decided separately, but were for practical
                    statesmanship one and the same problem. His policy was to reorganize the Swiss
                    constitution on the principles of representative democracy, to put an end to the
                    unnatural supremacy of the Forest Cantons by abolishing the prefects and their
                    jurisdiction, and by giving the larger cantons the influence in the diet which
                    was due to their resources and population, and to do this at once, and if
                    necessary by war. His counsels were overruled. Bern was anxious to treat the
                    religious question separately, and to negotiate for religious toleration,
                    leaving the political future to take care of itself. The course of history has
                    fully justified Zwingli. The views of the peace party triumphed, and a religious
                    truce was negotiated under the name of the first peace of Cappel, with
                    guarantees on paper that there was to be toleration in religious matters. But no
                    real securities were given. The provisions of the treaty were never carried out
                    in the Roman Catholic cantons, where authorities were secretly preparing for
                    war. Zwingli in vain proclaimed the danger and urged offensive measures. The
                    Protestant cantons remained heedless to the danger. At length the storm burst.
                    The Forest Cantons advanced (1531) secretly and rapidly on Zurich, with the
                    intention of overcoming the Protestant cantons one by one. The Zurichers met
                    their foes at Cappel, were outnumbered, and were defeated. Zwingli, who had
                    accompanied the troops as field chaplain, and had stood among the fighting men
                    to encourage them, had received two wounds on the thigh when a blow on the head
                    knocked him senseless. After the retreat of the Zurichers, when the victors
                    examined the field, Zwingli was found to be still living. He was not recognized,
                    and was asked if he wished a priest; when he refused, a captain standing near
                    gave him a deathstroke on the neck. Next day his body was recognized. “Then
                    there was a wonderful running to the spot the whole morning, for every man
                    wished to see Zwingli.” He had in death the same eager, courageous expression
                    which his hearers were accustomed to see on his face when he preached. A great
                    boulder, roughly squared, standing a little way off the road, marks the place
                    where Zwingli fell. It is inscribed with the words, “ ‘ They may kill the body
                    but not the soul ’: so spoke on this spot Ulrich Zwingli, who for truth and the
                    freedom of the Christian Church died a hero’s death, Oct. 11, 1531.”</p>
                <p>Zwingli’s theological views are expressed succinctly in the sixtyseven theses
                    published at Zurich in 1523, and at greater length in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >First Helvetic Confession,</hi> compiled in 1536 by a number of his
                    disciples.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Schaff, <hi

                    Lutheran doctrine. As opposed to Luther, Zwingli insisted more firmly on the
                    supreme authority of Scripture, and broke more thoroughly and radically with the
                    mediaeval church. Luther was content with changes in one or two fundamental
                    doctrines; Zwingli aimed at a reformation of government and discipline as well
                    as of theology. Zwingli never faltered in his trust in the people, and was
                    earnest to show that no class of men ought to be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >spiritual</hi> simply because they were selected to perform certain functions.
                    He thoroughly believed also that it was the duty of all in authority to rule in
                    Christ’s name and to obey His laws. He was led from these ideas to think that
                    there should be no government in the church separate from the civil government
                    which ruled the commonwealth. All rules and regulations about the public
                    worship, doctrines, and discipline of the church were made in Zwingli’s time,
                    and with his consent, by the council of Zurich, which was the supreme civil
                    authority in the state. This was the ground of his quarrel with the Swiss
                    Anabaptists, for the main idea in the minds of these greatly maligned men was
                    the modern thought of a free church in a free state. Like all the Reformers, he
                    was strictly Augustinian in theology, but he dwelt chiefly on the positive side
                    of predestination—the election to salvation—and he insisted upon the salvation
                    of infants and of the pious heathen. His most distinctive doctrine is perhaps
                    his theory of the sacrament, which involved him and his followers in a long and,
                    on Luther’s part, an acrimonious dispute with the German Protestants. His main
                    idea was that the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper <pb break="no"

                    that that sacrifice had been made once for all; and his deeper idea of faith,
                    which included in the act of faith a real union and communion of the faithful
                    soul with Christ, really preserved what was also most valuable in the
                    distinctively Lutheran doctrine. His peculiar theological opinions were set
                    aside in Switzerland for the somewhat profounder views of Calvin. The
