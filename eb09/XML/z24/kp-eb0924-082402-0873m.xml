                    long. The allusion is to the ring of white feathers round the eyes, which is

                    genus of birds founded by Vigors and Horsfield <hi rend="italic">(Trans. Linn.
                    Society, XV.</hi> p. 235) on an Australian species called by them <hi
                    rend="italic">Z. dorsalis,</hi> but subsequently shown to be identical with the
                    <hi rend="italic">Certhia caerulescens,</hi> and also with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sylvia lateralis,</hi> previously described by Latham. Latterly the name has
                    been Anglicized in the same sense, and, whether as a scientific or a vernacular
                    term, applied to a great number of species<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In 1883 Mr Sharpe (<hi rend="italic">Cat. B. Brit.
                    Museum,</hi> ix. pp. 146-203) admitted 85 species, besides 3 more which he had
                    not been able to examine.</p></note> of little birds which inhabit for the most
                    part the tropical districts of the Old World, from Africa to most of the islands
                    in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and northwards in Asia through India and China
                    to Amurland and Japan.</p>
                <p>The birds of this group are mostly of unpretending appearance, the plumage above
                    being generally either mouse-coloured or greenish olive; but some are
                    sufficiently varied by the white or bright yellow of their throat, breast, or
                    lower parts, and several have the flanks of a more or less lively bay. It is
                    remarkable that several islands are inhabited by two perfectly distinct species,
                    one belonging to the brown and the other to the green section, the former being
                    wholly insular. The greater number of species seem to be confined to single
                    islands, often of very small area, but others have a very wide distribution, and
                    much interest has been excited by the undoubted fact that the type-species, <hi
                    rend="italic">Z. caerulescens,</hi> has of late years largely extended its
                    range. First described from New South Wales, where it is very plentiful, it had
                    been long known to inhabit all the eastern part of Australia. In 1856 it was
                    noticed by naturalists as occurring in the South Island of New Zealand, when it
                    became known to the Maories by a name signifying “Stranger,” and to the English
                    settlers as the “Blight-bird,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>By most English-speaking people in various parts of the
                    world the prevalent species of <hi rend="italic">Zosterops</hi> is commonly
                    called “White-eye” or “Silver-eye” from the feature before mentioned.</p></note>
                    from its clearing the fruit-trees of a blight by which they had lately been
                    affected. It soon after appeared in the North Island, where it speedily became
                    common, and it has thence not only spread to the Chatham Islands, but, as Sir
                    Walter Buller states (<hi rend="italic">Birds N. Zealand,</hi> ed. 2, i. p. 79),
                    it has been met with in considerable numbers 300 miles from land, as though in
                    search of new countries to colonize. Yet this author believes it to be
                    indigenous to the west coast of the South Island, and Sir James Hector joins in
                    that opinion. If they be right, it is, however, pretty certain that until the
                    year before mentioned it must have been confined to an extremely small district,
                    and the only assignable cause of its spreading so rapidly, when it did extend
                    its range, is that of a large surplus population unable to find a living at
                    home. It is known to propagate at a high rate of increase, and at times numbers
                    have been found dead, apparently for want of food. In any case it is obvious
                    that this Zosterops must be a comparatively modern settler in New Zealand.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir W. Buller says that he
                    and Mr Gould were able to pick out New-Zealand examples from a series otherwise
                    made up of Australian specimens. Hence it would seem as if a slight amount of
                    differentiation had been set up; but the variation would doubtless have been
                    greater had the species been an ancient colonist.</p><p>It is a remarkable and,
                    if capable of explanation, would doubtless be an instructive fact that the
                    largest known species of the genus, <hi rend="italic">Z. albigularis,</hi>
                    measuring nearly 6 inches in length, is confined to so small a spot as Norfolk
                    Island, where also another, <hi rend="italic">Z. tenuirostris,</hi> not much
                    less in size, occurs; while a third, of intermediate stature, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Z. strenua,</hi> inhabits the still smaller Lord Howe’s Island. A fourth, <hi
                    rend="italic">Z. νatensis,</hi> but little inferior in bulk, is found on one of
                    the New Hebrides; but, after these giants of their kind, the rest fall off
                    considerably, being from one-fifth to one-third less in length, and some of the
                    smaller species hardly exceed 3⅜ inches from end to end.</p><p>The affinities of
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Zosterops</hi> are by no means clear. Placed by some
                    writers, if not systematists, with the <hi rend="italic">Paridae (cf.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Titmouse),</hi> by others among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meliphagidae (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Honey-Eater),</hi> and again by
                    others with the <hi rend="italic">Nectariniidae (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Sunbird),</hi> the structure of the tongue, as shown by Dr Gadow <hi
                    rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1883, pp. 63, 68, pl. xvi. fig. 2),
                    entirely removes it from the first and third, and from most of the forms
                    generally included among the second. On the whole it seems safest to regard the
                    genus, at least provisionally, as the type of a distinct Family— <hi
                    rend="italic">Zosteropidae—</hi> as Families go among Passerine birds; but,
                    whether the Australian genera <hi rend="italic">Melithreptus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Plectrorhamphus</hi> (otherwise <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plectrorhyncha)</hi> should be included under that heading, as has been done,
                    remains to be proved, and in the meanwhile may be reasonably doubted. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p></note></p>
