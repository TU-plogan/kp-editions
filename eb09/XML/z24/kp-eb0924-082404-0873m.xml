                    strolling players, but afterwards he attended the university of
                    Frankfort-on-the-oder, where, in 1792, he became a privat-docent. He created
                    much sensation by two extravagant plays, <hi rend="italic">Abällino, der grosse
                    Bandit</hi> (1794) and <hi rend="italic">Julius von Sassen</hi> (1796), the
                    success of which shows how urgent was the need for the elevating influence of

                    separate on the approach of the pairing season. They build nests, described as
                    being variously placed—sometimes suspended from a horizontal fork and sometimes
                    fixed in an upright crotch—and lay (so far as is known) pale blue, spotless
                    eggs, thereby differing wholly from several of the groups of birds to which they
                    have been thought allied. Though mainly insectivorous, the birds of this genus
                    will eat fruits of various kinds and in such quantities as to be at times
                    injurious. The habits of <hi rend="italic">Z. caerulescens</hi> have been well

                <p>to make him a full professor, Zschokke in 1795, after some time spent in travel,
                    settled in the Grisons, where, in association with the burgomaster Tscharner, he
                    conducted an educational institution in the castle of Reichenau. In recognition
                    of his services the authorities of the Grisons gave him the rights of a citizen,
                    and in 1798 he associated his name permanently with the country by the
                    publication of his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des Freistaats der drei Bünde in
                    Rhätien.</hi> The political disturbances of this year compelled him to close his
                    institution; but, being a man of great resource and energy, he was able, during
                    the revolutionary period which now began in Switzerland, to enter upon a new and
                    more important career. He was sent as a deputy to Aarau, where he was made head
                    of the educational department. Afterwards he was sent as Government commissioner
                    to Unterwalden, and his authority was ultimately extended over the cantons of
                    Uri, Schwyz, and Zug. In this high office Zschokke distinguished himself by the
                    vigour of his administration and by the enthusiasm with which he devoted himself
                    to the promotion of the interests of the poorer classes of the community. In
                    1800 he reorganized the institutions of the Italian cantons, and then he became
                    lieutenant-governor of the canton of Basel. Zschokke retired for a while from
                    public life when the central Government at Bern proposed to re-establish the
                    federal system, but after the changes effected by Bonaparte he entered the
                    service of the canton of Aargau, with which he remained connected. In 1801 he
                    attracted attention by his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte vom Kampfe und
                    Untergange der schweizerischen Berg-und Wald-Cantone.</hi> Through his <hi
                    rend="italic">Schweizerbote,</hi> the publication of which began in 1804, he
                    exercised a wholesome influence on public affairs; and the like may be said of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Miscellen der neuesten Weltkunde,</hi> issued from 1807 to
                    1813. In 1811 he also started a monthly periodical, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Erheiterungen.</hi> He wrote various historical works, the most important of
                    which is <hi rend="italic">Des Schweizerlandes Geschichte fur das
                    Schweizervolk,</hi> published in 1822. He was also the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Bilder aus der Schweiz,</hi> and of a series of popular tales
                    which greatly extended his reputation,— <hi rend="italic">Der Creole,
                    Alamontade, Jonathan Frock, Das Goldmacherdorf,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meister Jordan.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Stunden der Andacht,</hi> which was
                    widely read, he expounded in a rationalistic spirit what seemed to him the
                    fundamental principles of religion and morality. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Selbstschau</hi> is a kind of autobiography. Zschokke was not a great original
                    writer, but he secured for himself an eminent place in the literature of his
                    time by his enthusiasm for modern ideas in politics and religion, by the sound,
                    practical judgment displayed in his works, and by the energy and lucidity of his
                    style. He died on 27th June 1848.</p>
                <p>An edition of his selected works, in forty volumes, was issued in 1824-28. In
                    1851-54 an edition in thirty-five volumes was published. There are biographies
                    of Zschokke by Münch and by Emil Zschokke.</p>
