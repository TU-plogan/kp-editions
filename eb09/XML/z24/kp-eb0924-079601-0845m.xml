                    notice that the twilight seems to linger longer near where the sun sank below
                    the horizon, and that gradually a nebulous whitish band of light, broad towards
                    the horizon and narrowing first rapidly and then more slowly upwards, begins to
                    stand out clearly from the vanishing twilight, which spreads along a much wider
                    and nearly horizontally-topped arc of the horizon. This is the zodiacal light.
                    When seen on a perfectly clear night, it will be noticed that it fades
                    imperceptibly on both borders and towards the vertex, and that its light is
                    distinctly brighter towards the base than at greater altitudes. Its width and
                    brightness, and the height of the vertex, differ very much from time to time,
                    partly on account of actual variations, but much more from differences in the
                    transparency of the atmosphere. In England it is seldom observed except in the
                    months of March, April, and May shortly after sunset, or about October before
                    sunrise. This is due to no change in the light itself, but simply to the
                    circumstance that at other seasons the ecliptic makes so small an angle with the
                    horizon that a light lying in or near it does not rise sufficiently high above
                    the mists of the horizon to be seen after the twilight has vanished. In lower
                    latitudes, where the angle made with the horizon is greater, while the duration
                    of twilight is shorter, it can be easily seen at all seasons when there is a
                    clear sky and no moon, except when Venus is an evening star, in which case the
                    great brightness of that planet often almost completely obliterates the
                    comparatively faint zodiacal light, at least in its neighbourhood. The zodiacal
                    light has frequently been described as having a reddish yellow tint; but this
                    seems to be erroneous, for, when seen under favourable conditions, it is
                    distinctly white and very similar to that of the Milky Way. Any colour that may
                    have been observed is doubtless due to atmospheric causes.</p>
                <p>Among the Moslems, to whom it is important on ritual grounds to determine
                    accurately the moment of daybreak, at which during Ramadan the daily fast
                    begins, the morning zodiacal light appears to have been observed from an early
                    period, and is known as the “false dawn” or the “wolf’s tail” (Redhouse, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Journ. R. A. S.,</hi> July 1878). But in Christian Europe it seems
                    to have been first observed by Kepler, who described its appearance with
                    considerable accuracy and came to the conclusion that it was the atmosphere of
                    the sun. Descartes wrote about it in 1630 and Childrey in 1659; but the
                    attention of astronomers was first prominently called to it by Dominic Cassini,
                    who first saw it on 18th March 1683. It is to him that it owes the name which it
                    now bears. He explained it by supposing the existence of a flat, luminous ring
                    encircling the sun, nearly in the plane of his equator, and accounted for its
                    disappearance on the same principle as that which accounts for the vanishing of
                    Saturn’s ring. Mairan (1731), like Kepler, ascribed the light to the sun’s
                    atmosphere; and this explanation was generally accepted, till Laplace showed
                    that it was untenable, since no real solar atmosphere could extend to anything
                    like the distance from the sun which is reached by the zodiacal light. He
                    further showed that, even if the solar atmosphere did extend far enough, it
                    would not have the lenticular appearance ascribed by observers to the zodiacal
                    light, since the polar axis would be at least two-thirds of the equatorial axis.
                    Since then many observers have made a study of the subject, amongst whom may be
                    mentioned Jones, Piazzi Smyth, Jacob, Brorsen, Schmidt, Backhouse, Liais, and
                    Wright.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extent.—</hi> The way in which the light fades off gradually
                    towards the boundaries makes it extremely difficult to determine accurately the
                    true position of the light or its extent. Various observations show that at
                    times the base, at an elongation of about 20°, may have a width of from 25° to
                    30°, while at an elongation of 60° the breadth is frequently as much as 20°, but
                    usually much less. The distance of the vertex from the sun frequently exceeds
                    90°, and Mr Liais and others have recorded cases when the light has been traced
                    completely round from the western to the eastern horizon. This is very uncommon;
                    but it is not at all rare to find the light stretching nearly to the meridian
                    three hours after sunset, and several observers have recorded the existence of a
                    bright patch of light almost opposite to the position of the sun. This is known
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Gegenschein,</hi> and though it has been seen
                    comparatively seldom its existence must be accepted as proved; for its position
                    has been determined by actual measurement by several astronomers, and their
                    results agree with quite as great closeness as can be expected in the
                    determination of the position of such an object. A lengthened series of
                    observations was made on the zodiacal light by the Rev. G. Jones, chaplain of
                    the United States steam frigate “Mississippi,” in the China and Japan Seas in
                    1855. He charted the apparent position of the cone of light on a large number of
                    nights and mornings, and came to the somewhat startling conclusion that his
                    observations could be explained only by supposing the existence of a nebulous
                    ring round the earth within the orbit of the moon. He recorded that twice near
                    23° 28' N. lat., with the sun at the opposite solstice, he had seen “the
                    extraordinary spectacle of the zodiacal light, simultaneously at both the east
                    and west horizons from 11 to 1 <pb break="no"

                    reading this statement, Baron Humboldt communicated to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monatsberichte d. kön. preuss. Akad. d. Wiss.</hi> some unpublished
                    observations of his own on a similar phenomenon. These were to the effect that
                    on the 17th and 18th of March the light was very bright in the west, and “we
                    constantly perceived in the east (and this is beyond doubt a very striking
                    phenomenon) a whitish light which was also of a pyramidal form. The latter
                    augmented the brightness of the sky in a very striking manner.” The light in the
                    west was so conspicuous that “even the sailors were delighted with this double
                    light.” He noted, too, what is a very important fact, that the two lights set at
                    the same time; and there is much to be said in defence of his view that the
                    eastern light was the reflexion of the true zodiacal light in the west, just as
                    the eastern sunset glows are the reflexion of those in the west. The chief
                    obstacle in the way of accepting this view is that it is difficult to believe
                    that a light so faint as the zodiacal light could have a reflexion bright enough
                    to be seen, and even to be seen distinctly. On the other side must be set the
                    circumstance that the simultaneous glow at both horizons seems never to have
                    been observed from great altitudes. This is easily understood if the second glow
                    is a mere reflexion; whereas, if it comes from another source of light, it ought
                    to be more conspicuous at high than at low levels.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Position.—</hi> The exact position of the axis of the zodiacal
                    light relatively to the ecliptic has not yet been satisfactorily fixed. The
                    extreme haziness of outline and the excessive faintness of the light near the
                    vertex make it quite impossible to use a telescope for measuring its limits.
                    Most observers have tried to fix its position by tracing its outline on a star
                    chart, while Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth employed two sights mounted equatorially. But
                    even by these means no great accuracy can be attained, for the limits of the
                    light can be traced only when the eye is quite unfatigued and when the light is
                    looked at with averted vision. The difficulty experienced is well illustrated by
                    the wide divergencies between the results of different observers—divergencies
                    not only in the extent of the light, which would be quite natural, but even in
                    the direction of the axis of the cone. Thus, Captain Jacob, who observed in
                    Madras in 1856- 57-58, found that his evening observations placed the vertex of
                    the western cone in from 2° S. lat. to 6° N. lat., with an average of about 3°
                    N. lat. His morning observations were less numerous and gave positions for the
                    vertex of the eastern cone varying from ½ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> N. to
                    8° S., with an average of about 2° S. Mr Backhouse from 418 observations found a
                    mean deviation from the ecliptic of 2°∙06, while Captain Tupman, observing in
                    the Mediterranean in August and September, found an inclination of no less than
                    20°. He also found that the plane of the light did not pass through the sun. His
                    observations, however, differ somewhat widely from those of most other
                    observers. Mr A. Searle has made a very careful study of all the best published
                    records. In his first paper more than 650 observations by Jones, Heis, Schmidt,
                    and others are discussed, and he concludes that apparent changes in latitude are
                    mainly, if not entirely, produced by the effect of atmospheric absorption, which
                    affects the lower boundary more than the upper and to an extent depending on the
                    inclination of the axis of the light to the horizon. In a second paper he
                    discusses Jones’s observations alone and comes to the conclusion that, after
                    making allowance for the effects of absorption, there is some evidence that the
                    zodiacal light, as seen during the second half of the 19th century, has had a
                    more northern latitude near 180° long. than near 0° long. It seems somewhat
                    doubtful, however, whether the observations hitherto made are sufficiently
                    accurate to justify this conclusion, and all that can be confidently asserted is
                    that the observations made so far point to such a difference as being probable.
                    Similar variations in the greatest elongation, the breadth, and the brightness
                    have been asserted to exist. Thus Mr J. F. Julius Schmidt, as the result of
                    several years’ observations, finds a variation in the inclination of the axis of
                    the cone of light to the ecliptic from 4° 18' at the end of December to 0°
                    towards the end of March, a similar variation in the greatest elongation from
                    the sun from 120° in January to 70° in April, and a further similar variation in
                    breadth at corresponding elongations, with a minimum for all three about 30th
                    March. It may be pointed out that observations regarding the extent of the
                    visible light are absolutely valueless unless accompanied by careful records of
                    the clearness of the sky as evidenced by the visibility of faint objects, for
                    all observers of the zodiacal light must have noticed that a thin film of mist,
                    which hardly affects the colour of the sky or the visibility of the brighter
                    stars, may almost completely obliterate the zodiacal light. No accurate
                    photometric observations seem to have been made on the strength of the light and
                    observers have differed widely in their estimates. Some assert that it is much
                    brighter than the Milky Way, while others—and especially those who have observed
                    in the tropics— say that it is seldom so bright as the brighter parts of the
                    Milky Way. It is certainly often brighter than most of the Milky Way. Mr Searle
                    deduces from Sir W. Herschel’s and Celoria’s observations that the Milky Way is
                    about 2 magnitudes brighter than the mean brightness of the sky, and says that
                    on this estimate the brighter parts of the zodiacal light would be commonly 3 or
                    4 magnitudes brighter than the surrounding sky. This is almost certainly an
                    over-estimate. There seems to be very little doubt that the brightness undergoes
                    periodic fluctuations, but no estimate can as yet be made of the length of the
                    period. It is probable that the brightness has been below the average for the
                    last few years, but is now increasing. Most observers have also reported rapid
                    changes of brightness, or undulations, such as are seen in the aurora and in the
                    tails of some comets; but, as was pointed out by Others in 1833, these
                    undulations must be produced in the earth’s atmosphere. In this connexion it may
                    be mentioned that in observing the spectrum rapid flickerings, like waves moving
                    along the spectrum, are often very marked.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Moon’s Zodiacal Light.—</hi> Several observers have
                    recorded observations which appeared to show that the moon produced an
                    appearance very similar to that of the zodiacal light. Piazzi Smyth, however,
                    when observing on the Peak of Teneriffe, saw this appearance and showed by
                    actual measurement that the glow seen before moonrise does not lie near the
                    ecliptic, but is nearly vertical, and is due simply to refraction in the earth’s
                    atmosphere. This explanation will hardly account for an interesting observation
                    made by Mr L. Trouvelot, which if repeated would require to be very carefully
                    investigated. On a night when the zodiacal light was very bright and there were
                    magnetic disturbances followed by an auroral display, but when no aurora was
                    actually visible, he saw a conical light rising obliquely from the top of the
                    roof of a building behind which the moon, then about 15° or 20° above the
                    horizon, was concealed. The axis of the light coincided nearly with the ecliptic
                    and the light could be traced on both sides of the moon, when the moon itself
                    was concealed. The whole of the circumstances led Mr Trouvelot to conclude that
                    this light and the zodiacal light were phenomena of the same order, while this
                    and other observations, he considered, rendered it probable that there was some
                    connexion between the zodiacal light and auroras.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Constitution.—</hi> As has already been pointed out,
                    it is impossible to see the zodiacal light through a telescope, and this, taken
                    along with the extreme faintness of the light, renders it exceedingly difficult
                    to examine it satisfactorily with either the polariscope or the spectroscope.
                    Many attempts have been made to determine whether or not the light was to any
                    extent polarized, but with questionable results until Prof. A. W. Wright
                    attacked the problem, using a polariscope specially designed for studying very
                    faint lights. With this he was enabled to determine with certainty that the
                    light was partially polarized in a plane passing through the sun, and that the
                    amount of polarization was most probably as much as 15 per cent., but less than
                    20 per cent. Many attempts have been made to observe the spectrum. In 1867
                    Ångström, observing at Upsala in March, obtained the bright aurora line (W. L.
                    5567), and concluded that in the zodiacal light there was the same material as
                    is found in the aurora and in the solar corona, and probably through all space.
                    Upsala, however, is a place where the aurora spectrum can often be observed in
                    the sky even when no aurora is visible, and it has generally been believed that
                    what Ångström really saw was an auroral and not a zodiacal light spectrum. Señor
                    A. T. Acrimiz, observing at Cadiz, obtained a continuous but faint spectrum with
                    two bright lines—a yellowish line, probably an aurora line, and a line in the
                    blue, more refrangible than F, which he could not identify, but which in all
                    probability was another auroral line. The fact that he saw this spectrum with a
                    five-prism spectroscope attached to an equatorial seems conclusive evidence that
                    it was not the zodiacal light spectrum that he was observing. The most
                    satisfactory observations hitherto published seem to be those of Prof: Piazzi
                    Smyth and Prof. A. W. Wright. Both used spectroscopes specially designed for the
                    examination of faint lights, and their results agree completely with each other.
                    Prof. Smyth made his observations at Palermo and found a faint continuous
                    spectrum extending from about W. L. 5550 to W. L. 5000 (British inches scale),
                    with a maximum brightness at about W. L. 5350. In fact, the light was almost
                    exactly similar to that of faint diffused sunlight, such as is got in the last
                    traces of twilight. Prof. Wright’s conclusion was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n847/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0847-0798"/> that the spectrum differs from that of sunlight
                    only in intensity. Some recent unpublished observations made in the tropics
                    indicate that, while the spectrum is usually that described by Prof. Smyth,
                    there are times when a bright line is seen. Too much stress, however, must not
                    be laid on this, as the observations are by no means conclusive, and the
                    apparent line may in reality be only a part of the continuous spectrum which is
                    brighter than usual.</p>
                <p>The discussion of the real cause of the zodiacal light is rendered very difficult
                    by the want of agreement in the observations that have been made upon it, and by
                    the existence of a small number of apparently trustworthy observations of a very
                    abnormal extension of the light, as detailed above; but certain conclusions may
                    be safely arrived at. The theory that it is due to a ring of small bodies
                    surrounding the earth seems to be entirely negatived, as pointed out by Proctor
                    and others, by several of its features. The best observations leave no room for
                    the parallactic displacement which would be observed if there were such a ring
                    round the earth, and the absence of a large part of the luminous circle on
                    ordinary occasions would be inexplicable on any such hypothesis. There can
                    therefore be very little doubt that we must look for the cause of the light to
                    the existence of a mass of small bodies moving in orbits round the sun, and
                    that, as shown by the polarization and the spectrum, the light is chiefly, if
                    not entirely, reflected sunlight. To account for all the observations, Proctor
                    has shown that the bodies must travel in orbits of considerable eccentricity,
                    carrying them far beyond the limits of what we may term the zodiacal disk. Under
                    these conditions the constitution of the disk would become variable within
                    exceedingly wide limits, and all the recorded variations might be fairly
                    explained. The appearance of a complete arch, as seen by Liais and others, would
                    indicate an extension far beyond the earth’s orbit; but, at present at least,
                    this must be looked on as very exceptional. The spectroscopic evidence, so far
                    as it goes, confirms this theory, since it indicates that the light is mainly
                    reflected sunlight; and, even if further observations should confirm the opinion
                    that bright lines are sometimes present, this need in no way invalidate the
                    conclusions that have been arrived at. Indeed, it seems highly
                    probable—especially if Mr Lockyer’s views regarding meteorites are
                    confirmed—that bright lines should be seen in such a body of meteorites. Olbers
                    long ago suggested that the corona was the brightest part of the zodiacal light,
                    and there is nothing in recent observations to contradict this view, for all
                    observations go to show that the outer corona has no definite boundary, but
                    shades off imperceptibly and becomes invisible at a great distance from the sun.
                    Dr Huggins, while holding that the corona is most probably due to the ceaseless
                    outflow of extremely minute particles from the sun, thinks it not improbable
                    that the zodiacal light may be in some way connected with this outflow. Dr
                    Siemens, when discussing his theory of the conservation of solar energy, sought
                    for an explanation of the zodiacal light in the dust which he supposed to be
                    ejected from equatorial regions, rendered luminous partly by reflected sunlight,
                    partly by phosphorescence, and partly by electrical action.</p>
                <p>With the increasing number of observatories at high altitudes it may fairly be
                    hoped that before long astronomers will be put in possession of such definite
                    measurements as will enable some at least of the points still under discussion
                    to be finally settled, and that far more accurate observations will soon be
                    available on which to construct a satisfactory theory.</p>
