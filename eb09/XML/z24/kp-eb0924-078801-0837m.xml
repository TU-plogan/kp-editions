                    Zinzendorf and Pottendorf</hi></label> (1700-1760), religious reformer,
                    descended from an ancient family belonging to Lower Austria, was born on 26th
                    May 1700, at Dresden. His family had taken the Protestant side in the
                    Reformation struggle, and in consequence his grandfather, Max Erasmus, had
                    abandoned his Austrian estates to settle near Nuremberg. Max’s second son,
                    George Louis, was a member of the Saxon cabinet and a personal friend of the
                    Pietist Spener. George’s second wife, Charlotte Justine, the mother of Nicolaus,
                    who was an only son, was a daughter of Nicolas and Catherine von Gersdorf, who
                    were also Pietist. The boy was thus born into a Pietist circle; and Spener was
                    his godfather. He never knew his father, who died six weeks after he was born.
                    His mother married again when he was four years old, and he was educated under
                    the charge of his pious and gifted grandmother,<note anchored="true"

                    he was indebted for the absorbing and enthusiastic piety which characterized him
                    from childhood. His school days were spent at the paedagogium at Halle amidst
                    Pietist surroundings, and in 1716 he went to the university of Wittenberg, to
                    study law and fit himself for a diplomatic career. Three years later he was sent
                    to travel in Holland, in France, and in various parts of Germany. These two
                    years of wandering were employed by him in making the personal acquaintance of
                    men distinguished for practical piety and belonging to a variety of churches. On
                    his return he visited the branches of his family settled at Oberbirg and at
                    Castell. During a lengthened visit at Castell he fell in love with his cousin
                    Theodora; but the widowed countess, her mother, objected to the marriage, and
                    the lady afterwards became the wife of Count Henry of Reuss. Zinzendorf seems to
                    have considered this disappointment to be a call in providence to betake himself
                    to some special work for God. He had previously, in deference to his family, who
                    wished him to become a diplomatist, rejected the invitation of Francke to take
                    Count Canstein’s place in the Halle orphanage; and he now resolved to settle
                    down as a Christian landowner, spending his life on behalf of a pious tenantry.
                    He bought Berthelsdorf from his grandmother, and selected John Andrew Rothe for
                    pastor and John George Heiz for factor; he married Erdmute Dorothea, sister of
                    Count Henry of Reuss, and began living on his estate. His intention was to carry
                    out into practice the Pietist ideas of Spener. He did not mean to found a new
                    church or religious organization distinct from the Lutheranism of the land. Hé
                    meant to create a Christian association, the members of which by preaching, by
                    tract <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n838/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0838-0789"/> and book distribution, and by practical
                    benevolence might awaken the somewhat torpid religion of the Lutheran Church.
                    The “band of four brothers” (Rothe, pastor at Berthelsdorf; Schäffer, pastor at
                    Görlitz; Francis von Wattewille, a friend from boyhood; and himself) set
                    themselves by sermons, books, journeys, and correspondence to create a revival
                    of religion, and by frequent meetings for prayer to preserve in their own hearts
                    the warmth of personal trust in Christ. From the printing establishment at
                    Ebersdorf large quantities of books and tracts, catechisms, collections of
                    hymns, and cheap Bibles were issued; and a translation of Arndt’s <hi
                    rend="italic">True Christianity</hi> was published for circulation in France.
                    Dislike to the high and dry Lutheran orthodoxy of the period gave Zinzendorf
                    some sympathy with that side of the growing rationalism which was attacking
                    dogma, while he at the same time felt its lack of earnestness, and of a true and
                    deep understanding of religion and of Christianity, and endeavoured to
                    counteract its tendency by pointing men to the historical Christ, the revelation
                    of the Father. It is also more than probable that he began to doubt the wisdom
                    of Spener’s plan of not separating from the Lutheran Church, and that he began
                    to think that true Christianity could be best promoted by free association of
                    Christians, who in course of time might grow into churches with no state
                    connexion. These thoughts of his took a practical turn from his connexion with
                    the Bohemian or Moravian Brethren. Zinzendorf offered an asylum to a number of
                    persecuted wanderers from Moravia (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Moravian
                    Brethren),</hi> and built for them the village of Herrnhut on a corner of his
                    estate of Berthelsdorf. The refugees who came to this asylum—the first
                    detachment under Christian David in 1722—and continued coming from various
                    regions where persecution raged, for a succession of years (till 1732), belonged
                    to more than one Protestant organization. Persecution had made them cling
                    pertinaciously to the small peculiarities of creed, organization, and worship,
                    and they could scarcely be persuaded to live in peace with each other.
                    Zinzendorf devoted himself to them. He, with his wife and children, lived in
                    Herrnhut and brought Rothe with him. He had hard work to bring order out of the
                    confusion. He had to satisfy the authorities that his religious community could
                    be brought under the conditions of the peace of Augsburg; he had to quiet the
                    suspicions of the Lutheran clergy; and, hardest of all, he had to rule in some
                    fashion men made fanatical by persecution, who, in spite of his unwearied
                    labours for them, on more than one occasion, it is said, combined in his own
                    house to denounce him as the Beast of the Apocalypse, with Pastor Rothe as the
                    False Prophet. Patience had at last its perfect work, and gradually Zinzendorf
                    was able to organize his refugees into something like a <hi rend="italic"
                    >militia Christi,</hi> based not on monastic but on family life. He was able to
                    establish a common order of worship in 1727, and soon afterwards a common
                    organization, which has been described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Moravian Brethren.</hi> Zinzendorf took the deepest interest in the wonderful
                    missionary enterprises of the Brethren, and saw with delight the spread of this
                    Protestant family (not monastic) order in Germany, Denmark, Russia, and England.
                    He travelled widely in its interests, visiting America in 1741-42 and spending a
                    long time in London in 1750. Missionary colonies had by this time been settled
                    in the West Indies (1732), in Greenland (1733), amongst the North American
                    Indians (1735); and before Zinzendorf’s death the Brethren had sent from
                    Herrnhut missionary colonies to Livonia and the northern shores of the Baltic,
                    to the slaves of North Carolina, to Surinam, to the Negro slaves in several
                    parts of South America, to Travancore in the East Indies, to the Copts in Egypt,
                    and to the west coast of South Africa. The community in Herrnhut, from which
                    almost all these colonies had been sent out, had no money of its own, and its
                    expenses had been almost exclusively furnished by Zinzendorf. His frequent
                    journeyings from home made it almost impossible for him to look after his
                    private affairs; he was compelled from time to time to raise money by loans, and
                    about 1750 was almost reduced to bankruptcy. This led to the establishment of a
                    financial board among the Brethren, on a plan furnished by a lawyer, John
                    Frederick Köber, which worked well. In 1752 Zinzendorf lost his only son,
                    Christian Renatus, whom he had hoped to make his successor; and four years later
                    he lost his wife Erdmute, who had been his counsellor and confidante in all his
                    work, and without whose wise guidance he could never have accomplished what he
                    achieved. Zinzendorf remained a widower for one year, and then (June 1757)
                    contracted a second marriage with Anna Nitschmann, on the ground that a man in
                    his official position ought to be married. Three years later, overcome with his
                    labours, he fell ill and died (on 9th May), leaving John de Wattewille, who had
                    married his eldest daughter Benigna, to take his place at the head of the
                    community.</p>
