                <p><label type="entry">ZULULAND</label>, a territory of South Africa, lying to the
                    north of the colony of Natal, with a coast-line of about 130 miles (see vol. i.
                    pl. II.). It is occupied chiefly by Zulu tribes; but since its conquest by
                    England in 1879 a Boer republic, known as the New Republic, has been carved out
                    of it, which extends into the centre of the country from the Transvaal on its
                    north-west, and comprises an area equal to nearly one-half of the remaining
                    portion of Zululand. This portion is composed of a strip of country adjacent to
                    Natal, lying to the south of the Umhlatuzi river, and the district extending
                    along the coast to the north of that river for a distance inland varying from 50
                    to 70 miles. The former piece of country has been known since 1882 as the Zulu
                    Reserve. It is bounded on the south-west by the Tugela, Buffalo, and Blood
                    rivers, the last-named being one of the borders of the Transvaal Republic.</p>
                <p>Zululand presents very varied physical features: undulating country covered with
                    mimosa “bush,” in some parts very densely, alternates with wild and
                    fantastically broken scenery, and thickly-wooded precipices and ravines, and
                    these again with grass-clad hills. Two considerable forests exist in the
                    country,—one, the Ingome Forest, lying in northern Zululand, just within the
                    territory recently ceded to the Boers, the other upon the Natal border. These
                    produce the varieties of timber mentioned under <hi rend="smallcaps">Natal.</hi>
                    The wholesale destruction of woods for domestic purposes, which has robbed that
                    colony of much of its beauty, and is believed to have seriously affected its
                    rainfall, has not proceeded very far at present in Zululand. The mineral
                    resources of the country have yet to be investigated, but gold has been recently
                    found in the Reserve. The rivers, like those in Natal, are rapid streams of
                    small volume, running over rocky beds; the Tugela river is the most
                    considerable. The climate differs but little from that of Natal. The country is
                    very healthy for the most part; but horse sickness prevails in the valleys in
                    the hot season, and the swampy neighbourhood of St Lucia Bay, a lagoon lying at
                    the mouth of the Umfolosi river, is uninhabitable. Like the Natal natives, the
                    Zulus cultivate the ground very superficially, planting maize, gourds of several
                    kinds, and a grain from which a light beer is prepared. Cattle, the sole wealth
                    of the people, were at one time very numerous in the country, and also goats. A
                    few of the chiefs use horses.</p>
                <p>Long after big game had become scarce in Natal, Zululand offered excellent
                    opportunities to the sportsman. It still has antelopes of various kinds,
                    including a few koodoo, and, at the mouths of the more northern rivers,
                    hippopotamuses; but the buffalo and rhinoceros are not met with farther south
                    than the densely-wooded hills near the Umfolosi river. The lion is not seen
                    south of the Lebombo Mountains in the north of Zululand, but the leopard and
                    smaller carnivores are plentiful enough in the country. Its natural history is
                    similar to that of Natal; but indications are not wanting in its fauna and flora
                    of its closer proximity to the tropics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Language.—</hi> With the exception of the tongues spoken by the
                    Hottentot-Bushman tribes of the soutli-west, the languages of Africa from about
                    5° north of the equator southwards are now recognized as forming one great
                    family, for which the designation Bantu has been adopted, the word <hi
                        rend="italic">abantu</hi> in Zulu and other members of the group denoting
                    “people” (plural inflex <hi rend="italic">aba,</hi> root <hi rend="italic"
                        >ntu).</hi> The Zulu tongue, as that of a conquering and superior race,
                    extends beyond the river Zambesi, and is often understood even where another
                    language is the vernacular. In the kingdoms of Lobengula and Umzila it is the
                    language of the ruling classes. Philologists speak highly of the beauty and
                    flexibility of the Bantu languages, and of their grammatical structure. To the
                    student of comparative philology they offer a field of inquiry of the highest
                    importance, both on account of the vast domain occupied by them and of the deep
                    insight they afford into the structure and growth of human speech in general.
                    This great linguistic family occupies about one-half of Africa, extending from
                    near the Niger delta in the north-west, and from Lake Albert Nyanza farther
                    east, to the south-eastern extremity of the continent. It thus comprises such
                    widely separated peoples as the Ba-Farami and Ba-Kwiri of the Cameroons region
                    and the Zulu-Kaffres of the south-east coast on the one hand, and on the other
                    the Wa-Ganda of the Somerset Nile and the Ova-Herero of Damaraland on the
                    south-west coast. But, notwithstanding this widespread range, and although none
                    of the dialects have possessed any written standard till quite recent times,
                    being in fact everywhere spoken by peoples of low culture, the Bantu is
                    distinguished above all other great linguistic families, except perhaps the
                    Semitic, for its astonishing homogeneous character. So close is the resemblance
                    the different branches bear to each other that philologists have been able to
                    describe in broad traits the more salient features of the phonetic system,
                    structure, and syntax common alike to all. They speak unconsciously of the Bantu
                    language, as if it were everywhere essentially one, and this surprising
                    uniformity is reflected in the geographical, and especially the ethnological,
                    terminology of the southern half of the continent. Thus the national or tribal
                    place prefix in its various dialectic forms— <hi rend="italic">aba, ba, ama,
                        bua, vua, ova, wa, mu, ap,</hi> &amp;c.,—is of constant occurrence
                    throughout the whole of this region.</p>
                <p>Their close uniformity is further shown in their common phonetic system, which is
                    at once simple and harmonious, requiring all words to end in a vowel, rejecting
                    all consonantal juxtapositions, except a few characteristic nasal combinations,
                    such as <hi rend="italic">ng, mb, nd, nt, nw, mf, nk, ns,</hi> throwing the
                    accent as a rule on the first vowel of the stem (<hi rend="italic">méso</hi>),
                    and lastly repelling all harsh sounds, except the three intruding Hottentot
                    clicks in the Zulu-Kaffre group. Nearly all the consonantal sounds, ranging from
                    about eighteen to twenty, occur in English, while the vowel system everywhere
                    corresponds to that of Italian. But the most marked feature of the Bantu tongues
                    is their so-called <hi rend="italic">alliterative concord,</hi> which has been
                    compared both to the gender concordance of Aryan and the progressive vowel
                    harmony of Ural-Altaic. But it differs from the former inasmuch as it is initial
                    and not final, and extends to the verb as well as to noun, adjective,
                    participle, and pronoun, as if we should say in Latin, Domina mea pulchra, ama
                    eum. Thus, in the Kongo dialect, <hi rend="italic">e kintuku kiaku kiavididi
                        ezono kisolokele= "</hi> the coat you lost yesterday it turned up.” It
                    differs from the Ural-Altaic system inasmuch as the concordance is regulated,
                    not by the root vowel influencing those of the agglutinated postfixes (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Ural-Altaic),</hi> but by the prefixed particle, the true
                    nature of which has not yet been determined. But a comparative study of the
                    Bantu tongues shows that in the archaic language whence all descend each noun
                    had a proper prefix of its own, which prefix determined both the class to which
                    the noun belonged and the concordance of all words in the sentence dependent on
                    that noun. That such is the correct view is evident from the fact that, even
                    where the noun has lost its prefix, as sometimes happens, this prefix
                    nevertheless reappears in the dependent adjective, thus revealing its original
                    form. We see, for instance, that <hi rend="italic">nti=</hi> “tree” was
                    originally in the plural <hi rend="italic">mi-nti,</hi> because the following
                    adjective still takes <hi rend="italic">mi,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">nti
                        miandwelο</hi> = “small trees.” Bleek, the true founder of Bantu philology,
                    has determined in the organic language eighteen such prefixes which still
                    persist to a greater or less extent in the different branches, and have in some
                    even been added to, as <hi rend="italic">fi</hi>, for instance, in Kongo (W. H.
                    Bentley). The analogy of this alliterative concord with the so-called Aryan
                    grammatical gender is obvious, showing that the Aryan languages themselves were
                    originally non-gender languages and that their present gender agreement is
                    essentially a question of phonetic harmony and not of sex in any intelligible
                    sense of the term. Hence also the extraordinary phenomenon of sex in this system
                    apparently applied to inanimate objects.</p>
                <p>Another remarkable feature of Bantu grammar is the wonderful development of
                    verbal inflexion, which is both final and initial. The final, which in some
                    groups yields as many as 300 distinct forms, each conjugated throughout, belongs
                    to the verb itself in its various active, passive, middle, negative, repetitive,
                    reciprocal, causative, and other meanings. The initial expresses mood, tense,
                    person, number, and alliterative concord, and the whole system is immensely
                    complicated by the fact that, as in Basque, the Caucasian, American, and some
                    Ural-Altaic languages, the verb incorporates the direct pronominal object. Thus:
                        <hi rend="italic">ikuntala=</hi> “I-see him <hi rend="italic">tukutala=
                        “</hi> we-see-you ;” <hi rend="italic">bekwatala=</hi> “they-see-them;” and
                    so on. Hence the form <hi rend="italic">kuntonda=</hi> “to-see-her,” for
                    instance, will be conjugated throughout, the result being a luxuriant growth of
                    verbal forms fully comparable to that of the richest Ural-Altaic languages.</p>
                <p>Bleek has subjected to a comparative study twenty-five members of the family,
                    selected from almost every region that had been explored up to his time (1862).

                    would consequently be premature, the subjoined table, based on geographical

                    Zulu-Kaffre group, are given under <hi rend="smallcaps">Kaffraria.</hi> Here it
                    will suffice to add that since the establishment of the Zulu military ascendency
                    early in the 19th century various Zulu hordes have successively invaded and
                    overrun a great part of southeast Africa, as far as and even beyond the Lake
                    Nyassa district. Throughout these regions they are variously known as Ma-Zitu,
                    Ma-Ravi, Ma-Ngone (Umgone), Matebele (Ama-Ndebeli), Ma-Viti, and Aba-Zanzi. Such
                    is the terror inspired by these fierce warriors that many of the conquered
                    tribes, such as the Wa-Nindi of Mozambique, have adopted the very name of their
                    conquerors or oppressors. Hence the impression that the true Zulus are far more
                    numerous north of the Limpopo than has ever been the case. In most places they
                    have already become extinct or absorbed in the surrounding populations. But they
                    still hold their ground as the ruling element in the region between the Limpopo
                    and the lower Zambesi, which from them takes the name of Matebeleland, and
                    which, like Zululand itself, has recently (1888) become a British
                    protectorate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Laws and, Customs. —</hi> The Zulus possess an elaborate system
                    of laws regulating the inheritance of personal property (which consists chiefly
                    of cattle), the complexity arising from the practice of polygamy and the
                    exchange of cattle made upon marriage. The giving of cattle in the latter case
                    is generally referred to as a barter and sale of the bride, from which indeed it
                    is not easily distinguishable. But it is regarded in a different light by the
                    natives themselves. The kraal is under the immediate rule of its headman, who is
                    a patriarch responsible for the good behaviour of all its members. Over the
                    headman, whose authority may extend to more than one kraal, is the tribal chief.
                    The exercise by some of the principal chiefs, during the reigns of mPande and
                    his son, of the power of life and death could not always be controlled by the
                    central authority. Several of the Zulu customs resemble those of the Jews, such
                    as the Feast of First Fruits, held upon the ripening of the maize, when the
                    whole nation gathers at the king's kraal, and the custom of raising up seed to a
                    deceased brother. By the custom of <hi rend="italic">ukuh-lonipa</hi> a woman
                    carefully avoids the utterance of any word which occurs in the names of the
                    principal members of her husband’s family: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> if she
                    have a brother-in-law named uNkomo, she would not use the Zulu for “cow,” <hi
                        rend="italic">inkomo,</hi> but would invent some other word for it. The
                    employment of “witch doctors” for “smelling out” criminals or <hi rend="italic"
                        >abatagati</hi> (usually translated “wizards,” but meaning evildoers of any
                    kind, such as poisoners) is still common in Zululand, as in neighbouring
                    countries, although it was discouraged by Cetshwayo, who established “kraals of
                    refuge” for the reception of persons rescued by him from condemnation as <hi

                    time of the late war regarded as less densely inhabited than the colony of
                    Natal. The Zulu army was estimated to contain twenty-three regiments, of 40,400
                    men in all, and, although the enrolment was voluntary, it may be assumed that it
                    comprised nearly all the able-bodied men of the nation. In addition to the heavy
                    mortality sustained by the Zulus in the war many lives have been lost in
                    subsequent conflicts in which they have engaged amongst themselves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The earliest record of contact between Europeans
                    and the Zulu race is probably the account of the wreck of the “Doddington” in
                    1756. The survivors met with hospitable treatment at the hands of the natives of
                    Natal, and afterwards proceeded up the coast to St Lucia Bay, where they landed.
                    They describe the natives as “very proud and haughty, and not so accommodating
                    as those lately left.” They differed from the other natives in the superior
                    neatness of their method of preparing their food, and were more cleanly in their
                    persons, bathing every morning, apparently as an act of devotion. Their chief
                    pride seemed to be to keep their hair in order. It is added that they watched
                    strictly over their women.</p>
                <p>In 1780 the Zulu tribe inhabited the valley of the White Umfolosi river under the
                    chieftainship of Senzangakona. At that time the Zulus numbered some few
                    thousands only, being subject to the paramount chief Dingiswayo, who ruled over
                    the mTetwa tribe, which inhabited the country to the north-east of the Tugela.
                    Dingiswayo is represented as having been very much in advance of other chiefs in
                    those parts in enlightenment and intelligence. He opened up a trade with the
                    Portuguese, bartering ivory and oxen for beads and brass. He was also very
                    warlike, and introduced a strict military organization among his people, by
                    means of which he obtained the ascendency over neighbouring tribes, including
                    that of the Zulus. Upon the death of Senzangakona at the beginning of the 19th
                    century he was succeeded by a son named Tshaka, who had served as an officer in
                    the army of Dingiswayo, whose favour he won through his force of character and
                    talents. Dingiswayo having been killed in battle, the mTetwa tribe sought the
                    protection of Tshaka, who lost no time in further developing the new military
                    organization, and very soon became master of nearly the whole of south-eastern
                    Africa from the Limpopo to Cape Colony, including the settlement of Natal,
                    Basutoland, a large part of the Orange Free State, and the Transvaal Republic.
                    The terror of the Zulu arms was, moreover, carried far into the interior through
                    the revolt of a Zulu chief, Mzilikazi (Moselekatse), who conquered a vast
                    territory towards the north-west.</p>
                <p>Tshaka’s strict discipline and mode of attack, in which the long missile weapon
                    of the other tribes was replaced by a short stabbing assegai, was such that
                    nothing in the mode of warfare of those opposed to him could withstand him. He
                    overran the district of Natal with his armies in 1820; but crowds of the
                    northern tribes driven before his onslaught passed through the country about
                    1812.</p>
                <p>In 1825 an English naval officer, Lieutenant Farewell, visited Tshaka with the
                    object of obtaining leave to establish a settlement in what is now the district
                    of Natal. He found the king at Umgun-gindhlovu, “surrounded by a large number of
                    chiefs, and about 8000 or 9000 armed men, observing a state and ceremony in our
                    introduction that we little expected.” The king showed his visiter much
                    friendliness, making him a grant of land in that neighbourhood. Lieutenant
                    Farewell took formal possession of the territory he had received, which he
                    described as nearly depopulated and not containing more than 300 or 400
                    inhabitants, on 27th August 1825. The Zulu monarch, being anxious to open a
                    political connexion with the Cape and English Governments, entrusted in 1828 one
                    of his principal chiefs, Sotobi, and a companion to the care of Lieutenant King,
                    to be conducted on an embassage to Cape Town, Sotobi being commissioned to
                    proceed to the king of England. From causes which are not now certainly known
                    these people were not allowed to proceed beyond Port Elizabeth, and were soon
                    sent back to Zululand. On 23d September 1828 Tshaka was murdered by his brother,
                    Mhlangana, and a few days afterwards Mhlangana was killed by another brother,
                    Dingane. Tshaka’s reign had involved an immense sacrifice of human life, but he
                    had set before himself the aim of establishing a great kingdom, and, having
                    succeeded in that, his home rule had been relieved by acts of generosity and
                    statesmanship.</p>
                <p>What is recorded of. Dingane’s reign shows him in the light of a bloodthirsty and
                    cruel monster without a redeeming feature. The attempts made by the emigrant
                    Dutch Boers under Piet Retief to establish friendly relations with him, and
                    obtain a cession of the district of Natal, ended in the massacre of the whole
                    party of seventy of their leading men at the king’s kraal (February 1838), and
                    of all members of their families left behind in Natal who could not be collected
                    into fortified camps. Two unsuccessful attempts were made to avenge the deaths
                    of the emigrant Boers. A Dutch command under Pieter Uys invaded the Zulu
                    country, but was compelled to retreat, leaving their leader behind them, while a
                    considerable force, composed of English settlers, Boers, and natives, entered
                    Zululand at the mouth of the Tugela, and was completely annihilated, after
                    inflicting very great loss on the Zulus. A detachment of the Zulu army on this
                    occasion entered Natal and compelled the settlers at the port to take refuge on
                    board a ship. After a further attack by Dingane the emigrant Boers and settlers
                    again invaded Zululand in December 1838, and after a severe <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0878-0829"/> engagement defeated the Zulu army with great
                    slaughter on the banks of the Blood river, which owes its name to the results of
                    the victory. In 1840 the Boers agreed to support Dingane’s brother mPande in
                    rebellion against him. The movement was completely successful, several of
                    Dingane’s regiments going over to mPande. Dingane passed into Swaziland in
                    advance of his retreating forces, and was there murdered, while mPande was
                    crowned king of Zululand by the Boers, who received in exchange for their
                    services the much-coveted district of Natal. During the next sixteen years of
                    mPande’s reign nothing occurred to disturb the peaceful relations between the
                    Zulus and the Natal Government. In 1856 a civil war broke out between two of
                    mPande’s sons, Cetshwayo and Umbulazi, who were rival claimants for the
                    succession. A bloody battle was fought between them on the banks of the Tugela
                    in December 1856, in which Umbulazi and many of his followers were slain. The
                    Zulu country continued, however, excited and disturbed, until the Government of
                    Natal in 1861 obtained the formal nomination of a successor to mPande; and
                    Cetshwayo was appointed. mPande died in October 1872, but practically the
                    government of Zululand had been in Cetshwayo’s hands since the victory of 1856,
                    owing both to political circumstances and the failing health of his father. In
                    1873 the Zulu nation appealed to the Natal Government to preside over the
                    installation of Cetshwayo as king; and this request was acceded to. The rule of
                    mPande was in earlier years a severe one, the executions ordered by him being so
                    numerous in 1859 as to evoke remonstrances from Cetshwayo, who warned the king
                    that he would drive all the people over into Natal. In 1856 and for some years
                    afterwards a considerable exodus of refugees did take place into the colony, but
                    by 1871 the tide appeared to be turning the other way. In 1854 the native
                    population in Natal was reckoned at from 100,000 to 120,000. By 1873, owing
                    largely to the influx of refugees from Zululand, it had risen to 282,783; but
                    five years later it had not increased to more than 290,035, some hundreds of
                    heads of families having returned to Zululand.</p>
                <p>The encroachments of the Transvaal Boers upon the borders of Zululand having for
                    many years exposed the British Government to urgent appeals on the part of the
                    Zulus for its intervention, a second attempt was made by the Government of
                    Natal, and this time with success, to induce the Boers to submit the boundary
                    disputes between them and their neighbours to arbitration. A commission was
                    appointed, composed of three British officers, who in June 1878 pronounced a
                    decision substantially in favour of the Zulus. But the high commissioner, Sir
                    Bartle Frere, had determined upon measures for re-modelling the Zulu nation with
                    a view to the confederation of the South African colonies and states. The
                    invasion of Zululand took place in January 1879, and the war was ended by the
                    capture of the king at the end of August. Cetshwayo having been conveyed to Cape
                    Town, the Zulu country was portioned out among eleven Zulu chiefs, a white
                    adventurer, and a Basuto chief who had done good service in the war. This
                    arrangement was productive of much bloodshed and disturbance, and in 1882 the
                    British Government determined to restore Cetshwayo again to power. In the
                    meantime, however, the deepest blood feuds had been engendered between the
                    chiefs Zibebu and Hamu on the one side and the neighbouring tribes who supported
                    the ex-king and his family on the other. These people suffered severely at the
                    hands of the two chiefs, who were assisted by a band of white freebooters.
                    Zibebu, having created a formidable force of well-armed and trained warriors,
                    was left in independence on the borders of Cetshwayo’s territory, while the
                    latter was restrained by the conditions of his restoration from any military
                    enterprise or defensive measures. A collision very soon took place; but in the
                    conflicts that followed Zibebu’s forces were victorious, and on 22d July 1883,
                    led by a troop of mounted whites, he made a sudden descent upon Cetshwayo’s
                    kraal at Ulundi, which he destroyed, massacring such of the inmates of both
                    sexes as could not save themselves by flight. The king escaped, though wounded,
                    into the Reserve, which had been placed under British rule; there he died in
                    1884. He left a son, Dinuzulu, who sought the assistance of some of the
                    Transvaal Boers against Zibebu, whom he defeated and drove into the Reserve.
                    These Boers, not a large number, claimed as a stipulated reward for their
                    services the cession of the greater part, and the more valuable part, of central
                    Zululand. The Government of Natal has recently attempted to mediate on behalf of
                    the Zulus and has accepted on their behalf, in spite of their protests, a line
                    which roughly divides central Zululand into two equal portions. Of these the
                    northwestern has been created into the independent Boer state already mentioned.
                    The rest of central Zululand is administered, with the Reserve, as a British
                    protectorate.</p>
