                <p><label type="entry">ZODIAC</label> (ό <hi rend="italic">ζωδιακός κύκλος,</hi>
                    from ζ <hi rend="italic">ώδιοv</hi>, “a little animal ”), an imaginary zone of
                    the heavens within which lie the paths of the sun, moon, and principal planets.
                    It is bounded by two circles equidistant from the ecliptic, about eighteen
                    degrees apart; and it is divided into twelve signs, and marked by twelve
                    constellations. The signs— the Greek <hi rend="italic">δωδεκaτημόρια—</hi> are
                    geometrical divisions thirty degrees in extent, counted from the spring equinox
                    in the direction of the sun’s progress through them. The whole series
                    accordingly shifts westward through the effect of precession by about one degree
                    in seventy-two years. At the moment of crossing the equator towards the north
                    the sun is said to be at the first point of Aries; some thirty days later it
                    enters Taurus, and so on through Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio,
                    Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Astronomy,</hi> vol. ii. p. 771). The constellations bearing the same names
                    coincided approximately in position, when Hipparchus observed them at Rhodes,
                    with the divisions they designate. The discrepancy now, however, amounts to the
                    entire breadth of a sign, the sun’s path in Aries lying among the stars of
                    Pisces, in Taurus among those of Aries, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The twelvefold division of the zodiac was evidently suggested by the occurrence
                    of twelve full moons in successive parts of it in the course of each year. This
                    approximate relation was first systematically developed by the early inhabitants
                    of Mesopotamia, and formed the starting-point for all their divisions of time.
                    As the year separated, as it were of itself, into twelve months, so the day was
                    divided into twelve “double hours,” and the great cosmical period of 43,200
                    years into twelve “sars.” Each sar, month, and hour was represented at once
                    visibly and symbolically by a twelfth part of the “furrow” drawn by the solar
                    Bull across the heavens. The idea of tracing the sun’s path among the stars was,
                    when it occurred to Chaldaean astronomers, an original and, relatively to their
                    means, a recondite one. We owe to its realization by them the constitution and
                    nomenclature of the twelve signs of the zodiac. Assyrian cylinders and
                    inscriptions indicate for the familiar series of our text-books an antiquity of
                    some four thousand years. Ages before Asurbanipal reigned at Nineveh the eighth
                    month (Marchesvan) was known as “the month of the star of the Scorpion,” the
                    tenth (Tebet) belonged to the “star of the Goat,” the twelfth (Adar) to the
                    “star of the Fish of Hea.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Lenormant, <hi rend="italic">Origines de l'Histoire,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    236.</p></note> The motive underlying the choice of symbols is in a few cases
                    obvious, but in most remains conjectural. The attributes of the deities
                    appointed to preside over the months and signs were to some extent influential.
                    Two of them, indeed, took direct possession of their respective portions of the
                    sky. The zodiacal Virgo is held to represent the Assyrian Venus, Ishtar, the
                    ruling divinity of the sixth month, and Sagittarius the archer-god Nergal, to
                    whom the ninth month was dedicated. But no uniform system of selection was
                    pursued; <hi rend="italic">or</hi> rather perhaps the results of several,
                    adopted at various epochs, and under the influence of varying currents of ideas,
                    became amalgamated in the final series.</p>
                <p>This, there is reason to believe, was the upshot of a prehistoric reform. So far
                    as positive records go, Aries was always the first sign. But the arrangement is,
                    on the face of it, a comparatively modern one. None of the brighter stars of the
                    constellation could be said even roughly to mark the equinox much before 1800
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi> during a long stretch of previous time the
                    leading position belonged to the stars of Taurus.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The possibility should not, however, be
                    overlooked that the “stars of the months” were determined by their heliacal
                    risings (see Bosanquet and Sayce on Babylonian astronomy, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monthly Notices Roy. Astr. Soc.,</hi> vol. xl. p. 117). This would give a
                    further extension backwards of over 1000 years, during which the equinox might
                    have occurred in the month of the Ram.</p></note> Numerous indications
                    accordingly point to a corresponding primitive zodiac. Setting aside as doubtful
                    evidence derived from interpretations of cuneiform inscriptions, we meet, in
                    connexion with Mithraic and Mylittic legends, reminiscences of a zodiac and
                    religious calendar in which the Bull led the way.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lajard, <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur le

                <p>Candidus auratis aperit cum cornibus annum Taurus perpetuates the tradition. And
                    we shall see presently that the Pleiades, not only were originally, but
                    continued to be until well within historical memory, the first asterism of the
                    <hi rend="italic">lunar</hi> zodiac.</p>
                <p>In the Chaldaean signs fragments of several distinct strata of thought appear to
                    be embedded. From one point of view, they shadow out the great epic of the
                    destinies of the human race; again, the universal solar myth claims a share in
                    them; hoary traditions were brought into <hi rend="italic">ex. post facto</hi>
                    connexion with them; or they served to commemorate simple meteorological and
                    astronomical facts.</p>
                <p>The first Babylonian month Nisan, dedicated to Anu and Bel, was that of
                    “sacrifice”; and its association with the Ram as the chief primitive object of
                    sacrifice is thus intelligible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Sayce, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Society of Biblical
                    Archaeology,</hi> vol. iii. p. 162.</p></note> According to an alternative
                    explanation, however, the heavenly Ram, placed as leader in front of the flock
                    of the stars, merely embodied a spontaneous figure of the popular imagination.
                    An antique persuasion, that the grand cycle of creation opened under the first
                    sign, has been transmitted to modern cognizance by Dante <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Inf,</hi> i. 38). The human race, on the other hand, was supposed to have come
                    into being under Taurus. The solar interpretation of the sign goes back to the
                    far-off time when the year began with Taurus, and the sun was conceived of as a
                    bull entering upon the great furrow of heaven as he ploughed his way among the
                    stars. In the third month and sign the building of the first city and the
                    fratricidal brothers—the Romulus and Remus of Roman legend— were brought to
                    mind. The appropriate symbol was at first indifferently a pile of bricks or two
                    male children, always on early monuments placed feet to feet. The retrograde
                    movement of a crab typified, by an easy association of ideas, the retreat of the
                    sun from his farthest northern excursion, and Cancer was constituted the sign of
                    the summer solstice. The Lion, as the symbol of fire, represented the
                    culmination of the solar heat. In the sixth month, the descent of Ishtar to
                    Hades in search of her lost husband Tammuz was celebrated, and the sign of the
                    Virgin had thus a purely mythological signification.</p>
                <p>The history of the seventh sign is somewhat complicated. The earlier Greek
                    writers,—Eudoxus, Eratosthenes, Hipparchus,—knew of only eleven zodiacal
                    symbols, but made one do double duty, extending the Scorpion across the seventh
                    and eighth divisions. The Balance, obviously indicating the equality of day and
                    night, is first mentioned as the sign of the autumnal equinox by Geminus and
                    Varro, and obtained, through Sosigenes of Alexandria, official recognition in
                    the Julian calendar. Nevertheless, Virgil <hi rend="italic">(Georg.,</hi> i. 32)
                    regarded the space it presided over as so much waste land, provisionally
                    occupied by the “Claws” of the Scorpion, but readily available for the <pb

                    invention. Ptolemy, who himself chiefly used the “Claws” (X <hi rend="italic"
                    >ηλαί</hi>), speaks of it as a distinctively Chaldaean sign;<note

                    asterism in the Chinese sphere. An ancient Chinese law, moreover, prescribed the
                    regularization of weights and measures at the <hi rend="italic">spring</hi>
                    equinox.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    system.</p></note> No representation of the seventh sign has yet been discovered
                    on any Euphratean monument; but it is noticeable that the eighth is frequently
                    doubled,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lenormant, <hi
                    rend="italic">Origines,</hi> vol. i. p. 267.</p></note> and it is difficult to
                    avoid seeing in the pair of zodiacal scorpions carved on Assyrian cylinders the
                    prototype of the Greek scorpion and claws. Both Libra and the sign it eventually
                    superseded thus owned a Chaldaean birthplace. The struggle of rival systems of
                    nomenclature, from which our zodiacal series resulted, is plainly visible in
                    their alternations; and the claims of the competing signs were long sought to be
                    conciliated by representing the Balance as held between the claws of the
                    Scorpion.</p>
                <p>The definitive decline of the sun’s power after the autumnal equinox was typified
                    by placing a Scorpion as the symbol of darkness in the eighth sign. Sagittarius,
                    figured later as a Centaur, stood for the Babylonian Mars. Capricornus, the sign
                    of the winter solstice, is plausibly connected with the caprine nurse of the
                    young solar god in Oriental legends, of which that of Zeus and Amalthea is a
                    variant.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Leo. The eleventh month was known in Euphratean regions as that of “want and
                    rain.” The deluge was traditionally associated with it. It was represented in
                    zodiacal symbolism by the god Ramman, crowned with a tiara and pouring water
                    from a vase, or more generally by the vase and water without the god. The
                    resumption of agricultural labours after the deluge was commemorated in the
                    twelfth month, and a mystical association of the fishes, which were its sign,
                    with the life after death is evident in a monument of Assyrian origin described
                    by M. Clermont-Ganneau, showing a corpse guarded by a pair of fish-gods.<note

                    year of 360 days was supplemented once in six years by a thirteenth month, a

                <p>The cyclical meaning of the succession of zodiacal signs, though now obscured by
                    interpolations and substitutions, was probably once clear and entire. It is
                    curiously reflected in the adventures of the Babylonian Hercules, the solar hero

                    correlation with the twelve divisions of the sun’s annual course. Izdubar’s
                    conquest of the winged bull Heabani was placed under Taurus; his slaying of the
                    tyrant Houmbaba (the prototype of Geryon) in the fifth month typified the
                    victory of light over darkness, represented in plastic art by the group of a

                    with two scorpion men, guardians of the rising and the setting sun, under
                    Scorpio. The eleventh tablet narrates the deluge; the twelfth associates the
                    apotheosis of Heabani (the Babylonian Chiron) with the zodiacal emblems of the
                    resurrection.</p>
                <p>In the formation of the constellations of the zodiac very little regard was paid
                    to stellar configurations. The Chaldaeans chose three stars in each sign to be

                    of the ecliptic and ten days of the year were presided over by each. The college
                    of the decans was conceived as moving, by their annual risings and settings, in
                    an “eternal circuit” between the infernal and supernal regions. Our modern

                    Fleece; two Sprouting Plants, typifying equality or resemblance, stood for
                    Gemini; Cancer was re-named Scarabaeus; Leo was converted, from the axe-like
                    configuration of its chief stars, into the Knife; Libra into the Mountain of the
                    Sun, a reminiscence, apparently, of the Euphratean association of the seventh
                    month with a “holy mound,” designating the Biblical tower of Babel. A Serpent
                    was the Egyptian equivalent of Scorpio; the Arrow only of Sagittarius was
                    retained; Capricornus became “Life,” or a Mirror as an image of life; Aquarius
                    survived as Water; Taurus, Virgo, and Pisces remained unchanged.<note

                    substitutions was to avoid the confusion which must have ensued from the
                    duplication of previously existing native asterisms; thus, the Egyptian and
                    Greek Lions were composed of totally different stars. Abstractions in other
                    cases replaced concrete objects, with the general result of effacing the
                    distinctive character of the Greek zodiac as a “circle of living things.”</p>
                <p>Early Zoroastrian writings, though impregnated with star-worship, show no traces
                    of an attempt to organize the heavenly array. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bundehish,</hi> however (9th century), the twelve “Akhtârs,” designated by the
                    same names as our signs, lead the army of Ormuzd, while the seven “Awakhtârs” or
                    planets (including a meteor and a comet) fight for Ahriman. The knowledge of the
                    solar zodiac thus turned to account for dualistic purposes was undoubtedly
                    derived from the Greeks. By them, too, it was introduced into Hindustan.
                    Aryabhata, about the beginning of our era, reckoned by the same signs as
                    Hipparchus. They were transmitted from India by Buddhist missionaries to China,
                    but remained in abeyance until the Jesuit reform of Chinese astronomy in the
                    17th century.</p>
                <p>The native zodiacal system was of unexampled complexity. Besides divisions into

                    celestial equator.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Biot,

                    Projected upon the ecliptic, these were, of course, considerably unequal, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">tse</hi> accordingly differed essentially from the
                    Chaldaean and Greek signs. Their use was chiefly astrological, and their highly
                    figurative names—“Great Splendour,” “Immense Void,” “Fire of the Phoenix,”
                    &amp;c. —had reference to no particular stars. They became virtually merged in
                    the European series, stamped with official recognition upwards of two centuries
                    ago. The twenty-four <hi rend="italic">tsieki</hi> or demi- <hi rend="italic"
                    >tse</hi> were probably invented to mark the course of weather changes
                    throughout the year. Their appellations are purely meteorological.</p>
                <p>The characteristic Chinese mode of dividing the “yellow road” of the sun was,
                    however, by the twelve “cyclical animals,”—Rat, Ox, Tiger, Hare, Dragon or
                    Crocodile, Serpent, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Hen, Dog, Pig. The opening sign
                    corresponds to our Aquarius, and it is remarkable that the rat is, in the far
                    East, frequently used as an ideograph for “water.” But here the agreement
                    ceases. For the Chinese series has the strange peculiarity of proceeding in a
                    retrograde direction or <hi rend="italic">against</hi> the course of the sun.
                    Thus, the second sign (of the Ox) occupies the position of Capricorn, the third
                    that of Sagittarius, and so on. The explanation of this seeming anomaly is to be
                    found in the primitive destination of the “animals” to the purposes of an
                    “horary zodiac.” Their succession, established to mark the hours of day and
                    night, was not unnaturally associated with the diurnal revolution of the sphere
                    from east to west.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    “zodiac of hunters and shepherds,” and he adds that the presence in it of a
                    tiger gives it an exclusively Asiatic character. It appears never to have been
                    designed for astronomical employment. From the first it served to characterize
                    the divisions of time. The nomenclature not only of the hours of the day and of
                    their minutest intervals was supplied by it, but of the months of the year, of
                    the years in the Oriental sixty-year cycle, and of the days in the “little
                    cycle” of twelve days. Nor has it yet fallen into desuetude. Years “of the Rat,”
                    “of the Tiger,” “of the Pig,” still figure in the almanacs of Central Asia,
                    Cochin China, and Japan.</p>

                    Seven of the twenty days constituting the Aztec month bore names evidently
                    borrowed from those of the Chinese horary signs. The Hare (or Rabbit), Monkey,
                    Dog, and Serpent reappeared without change; for the Tiger, Crocodile, and Hen,
                    unknown in America, the Ocelot, Lizard, and Eagle were substituted as

                    from the 7th century; but the zodiacal tradition embodied by it was doubtless
                    much more ancient. Of the zodiac in its true sense of a partitioned belt of the
                    sphere there was no aboriginal knowledge on the American continent. Mexican
                    acquaintance with the signs related only to their secondary function as dies (so
                    to speak) with which to stamp recurring intervals of time.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">synodical</hi> revolution of the moon laid down the lines
                    of the solar, its <hi rend="italic">sidereal</hi> revolution those of the lunar
                    zodiac. The first was a circlet of “full moons”; the second marked the diurnal
                    stages of the lunar progress round the sky, from and back again to any selected
                    star. The moon was the earliest “measurer” both of time and space; but its
                    services can scarcely have been rendered available until stellar “milestones”
                    were established at suitable points along its path. Such were the Hindu <hi
                    rend="italic">nakshatras,</hi> a word originally signifying stars in general,
                    but appropriated to designate certain small stellar groups marking the divisions
                    of the lunar track. They exhibit in an exaggerated form the irregularities of
                    distribution visible in our zodiacal constellations, and present the further
                    anomaly of being frequently reckoned as twenty-eight in number, while the
                    ecliptical arcs they characterize are invariably twenty-seven. Now, since the
                    moon revolves round the earth in 27⅓ days, hesitation between the two full
                    numbers might easily arise; yet the real explanation of the difficulty appears
                    to be different. The superfluous asterism, named <hi rend="italic">Abhijit,</hi>
                    included the bright star α Lyrae, under whose influence the gods had vanquished
                    the Asuras. Its invocation with the other <hi rend="italic">nakshatras,</hi>
                    remoteness from the ecliptic notwithstanding, was thus due (according to Prof.

                    Acquaintance with foreign systems of twenty-eight lunar divisions tended
                    doubtless to fix its position, which remained, nevertheless, always

                    Alternately admitted into or rejected from the series, it was finally, some six
                    or seven centuries ago, eliminated by the effects of precession in reversing the
                    order of culmination of its limiting stars.</p>
                <p>The notion of a twenty-seven-fold division of the zodiac was deeply rooted in
                    Hindu tradition. The number and the name were in early times almost synonymous.
                    Thus, a <hi rend="italic">nakshatra-mālā</hi> denoted a necklace of twenty-seven
                    pearls;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Max Miiller, <hi

                    the parts was figured in an ancient legend, by the compulsion laid upon King
                    Soma (the Moon) to share his time impartially between all his wives, the
                    twenty-seven daughters of Pra-jápati. Everything points to a native origin for
                    the system of <hi rend="italic">nakshatras.</hi> Some were named after
                    exclusively Vedic deities; they formed the basis of the sacrificial calendar of
                    the Brahmans; the old Indian names of the months were derived from them; their
                    existence was presupposed in the entire structure of Hindu ritual and

                <p>Positive proof of the high antiquity of the Hindu lunar zodiac is nevertheless
                    afforded by the undoubted fact that the primitive series opened with Krittikā
                    (the Pleiades) as the sign of the vernal equinox. The arrangement would have
                    been correct about 2300 B.c.; it would scarcely have been possible after 1800

                    presiding deity, continued to be the first sign. Hindu astronomy received its
                    first definite organization in the 6th century, with results embodied in the <hi

                    the lunar zodiac form two essentially distinct systems. The ecliptic is divided

                    800' each. But the <hi rend="italic">nakshatras</hi> are twenty-eight, and are

                    ascertainment of which was of great astrological importance) were fixed by means
                    of their conjunctions with the <hi rend="italic">yogātāras.</hi> These, however,

                    known intervention. The “three footprints of Vishnu,” for ex ample, unmistakably
                    gave its name to the Mexican day Ollin, signifying the “track of the sun”; and

                <p>Relationship of a more intimate kind connects the Hindu lunar mansions with those
                    of the Arabs and Chinese. The resemblance between the three systems is indeed so
                    close that it has been assumed, almost as axiomatic, that they must have been
                    framed from a single model; and the question of their origin has been debated
                    with all the resources of varied erudition by scholars such as Biot, Weber,
                    Whitney, and Max Müller. As the upshot of the controversy it appears
                    nevertheless to have become tolerably clear that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nakshatras</hi> were both native to India, and the <hi rend="italic">sieu</hi>
                    to China, but that the <hi rend="italic">manāzil</hi> were mainly of Indian
                    derivation. The assertion, paradoxical at first sight, that the twenty-eight
                    “hostelries” of the Chinese sphere had nothing to do with the moon’s daily
                    motion seems to convey the actual fact. Their number, as a multiple of four, was
                    prescribed by the quaternary partition of the heavens, fundamental in Chinese
                    astronomy. It was considered by Biot to have been originally twenty-four, but to
                    have been enlarged to twenty-eight about 1100 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> by
                    the addition of determinants for the solstices and equinoxes of that

                    divisions. They were measured by the meridian-passages of the limiting stars,
                    and varied in amplitude from 2° 42' to 30° 24'.<note anchored="true"

                    reference for the movements of sun, moon, and planets. They served, in fact, and
                    still serve (though with astrological ends in view), the precise purpose of
                    “fundamental stars” in European astronomy. All that is certainly known about the
                    antiquity of the <hi rend="italic">sieu</hi> is that they were well established
                    in the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Their initial point at the
                    autumnal equinox marked by Kio (Spica Virginis) suits a still later date; and
                    there is no valid evidence that the modern series resulted from the
                    rectification of an older superannuated arrangement, analogous to the Krittikā
                    sequence of <hi rend="italic">nakshatras.</hi> The Hindu zodiacal constellations
                    belong then to an earlier epoch than the Chinese “stations,” such as they have
                    been transmitted to our acquaintance. Yet not only were the latter an
                    independent invention, but it is almost demonstrable that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nakshatras,</hi> in their more recent organization, were, as far as possible,
                    assimilated to them. The whole system of junction stars was doubtless an
                    imitation of the <hi rend="italic">sieu;</hi> the choice of them by the Hindu

                    different intent Where they varied from it, some intelligible reason can
                    generally be assigned for the change. Eight junction stars lie quite close to,
                    seven others are actually identical with, Chinese determinants;<note

                    to both. Twenty-four out of twenty-eight were formed, at least in part, of <hi

                    equinox; the first Arab sign Sharatān was strictly equivalent to the Hindu

                    which, in a complete form, removes all difficulty in accounting for the various
                    foreign influences brought to bear upon them. They were first enumerated by
                    Alfar-ghāni early in the 9th century, when the Arabs were in astronomy the
                    avowed disciples of the Hindus. But, although they then received perhaps their
                    earliest quasi-scientific organization, the mansions of the moon had for ages
                    previously figured in the popular lore of the Bedouin. A set of twenty-eight
                    rhymes associated their heliacal risings with the changes of season and the
                    vicissitudes of nomad life; their settings were of meteorological and
                    astrological import;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A.

                    indispensable for the reckoning of time. Yet even this intimate penetration into
                    the modes of thought of the desert may be explained by prehistoric Indian
                    communication. The alternative view, advocated by Weber, that the lunar zodiac
                    was primitively Chaldaean, rests on a very shadowy foundation. It is true that a
                    word radically identical with <hi rend="italic">manāzil</hi> occurs twice in the
                    Bible, under the forms <hi rend="italic">mazzaloth</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >mazzaroth</hi> (2 Kings xxiii. <hi rend="italic">5;</hi> Job xxxviii. 32); but
                    the heavenly halting-places which it seems to designate may be solar rather than
                    lunar. Euphratean exploration has so far brought to light no traces of
                    ecliptical partition by the moon’s diurnal motion, unless, indeed, zodiacal
                    associations be claimed for a set of twenty-eight deprecatory formulae against
                    evil spirits inscribed on a Ninevite tablet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The safest general conclusions regarding this disputed subject appear to be that
                    the <hi rend="italic">sieu,</hi> distinctively and unvaryingly Chinese, cannot
                    properly be described as divisions of a lunar zodiac, that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nahshatras,</hi> though of purely Indian origin, became modified by the
                    successive adoption of Greek and Chinese rectifications and supposed
                    improvements; while the <hi rend="italic">manazil</hi> constituted a frankly
                    eclectic system, in which elements from all quarters were combined. It was
                    adopted by Turks, Tartars, and Persians, and forms part of the astronomical
                    paraphernalia of the <hi rend="italic">Bundehish.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >sieu,</hi> on the other hand, were early naturalized in Japan.</p>
                <p>The refined system of astrological prediction based upon the solar zodiac was
                    invented in Chaldaea, obtained a second home and added elaborations in Egypt,
                    and spread irresistibly westward about the beginning of our era. For
                    genethliacal purposes the signs were divided into six solar and six lunar, the
                    former counted onward from Leo, the “house” of the sun, the latter backward from
                    the moon’s domicile in Cancer. Each planet had two houses—a solar and a
                    lunar—distributed according to the order of their revolutions. Thus Mercury, as
                    the planet nearest the sun, obtained Virgo, the sign adjacent to Leo, with the
                    corresponding lunar house in Gemini; Venus had Libra (solar) and Taurus (lunar);
                    and so for the rest. A ram frequently stamped on coins of Antiochus, with head
                    reverted towards the moon and a star (the planet Mars), signified Aries to be
                    the lunar house of Mars. With the respective and relative positions in the
                    zodiac of the sun, moon, and planets, the character of their action on human
                    destiny varied indefinitely. The influence of the signs, though secondary, was
                    hence overmastering: Julian called them <hi rend="italic">θεoῶv

                    they were the objects of a corresponding veneration. Cities and kingdoms were

                    survived in rings and amulets, engraven with the various signs, and worn as a
                    kind of astral defensive armour. Many such, of the 14th and 15th centuries, have

                    the building it served to decorate. The Greek signs of the zodiac, including
                    Libra, are obvious upon both these monuments, which have thrown some useful
                    light upon the calendar system and method of stellar grouping of the ancient
                    Egyptians.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Riel’s

                    in its general plan the circular zodiac of Dendera. The decans are ranged on the
                    outermost of its five concentric zones; the planets and the Greek zodiac in
                    duplicate occupy the next three; while the inner circle is unaccountably
                    reserved for the Chinese cyclical animals. The relic was dug up on the Aventine
                    in 1705, and is now in the Louvre. It dates from the 2d or 3d century of our
                    era. The Tartar zodiac is not unfrequently found engraven on Chinese mirrors in
                    polished bronze or steel of the 7th century, and figured on the “plateau of the
                    twelve hours” in the treasury of the emperors of the Tang dynasty.<note

                    all the French cathedrals of the 12th and 13th centuries exhibit on their
                    portals a species of rural calendar, in which each month and sign has its
                    corresponding labour. The zodiac of Notre Dame of Paris, opening with Aquarius,
                    is a noted instance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    20.</p></note> A similar series, in which sculptured figures of Christ and the
                    Apostles are associated with the signs, is to be seen in perfect preservation on
                    the chief doorway of the abbey church at Vézelay. The cathedrals of Amiens,
                    Sens, and Rheims are decorated in the same way. In Italy the signs and works
                    survive fragmentarily in the baptistery at Parma, completely on the porch of the
                    cathedral of Cremona and on the west doorway of St Mark’s at Venice. They are
                    less common in England; but St Margaret’s, York, and the church of Iffley in
                    Oxfordshire offer good specimens. In the zodiac of Merton College, Oxford, Libra
                    is represented by a judge in his robes and Pisces by the dolphin of Fitzjames,
                    warden of the college, 1482-1507.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    frequently painted with zodiacal emblems; and some frescos in the cathedral of
                    Cologne contain the signs, each with an attendant angel, just as they were
                    depicted on the vault of the church at Mount Athos. Giotto’s zodiac at Padua was
                    remarkable (in its undisturbed condition) for the arrangement of the signs so as
                    to be struck in turns, during the corresponding months, by the sun’s rays.<note

                    hôtels by a “zodiac of pleasures,” in which hunting, hawking, fishing, and
                    dancing were substituted for hoeing, planting, reaping, and ploughing.<note

                <p>It is curious to find the same sequence of symbols employed for the same
                    decorative purposes in India as in Europe. A perfect set of signs was copied in
                    1764 from a pagoda at Verdapettah near Cape Comorin, and one equally complete
                    existed at the same period on the ceiling of a temple near Mindurah.<note

                <p>The hieroglyphs representing the signs of the zodiac in astronomical works are of

                    Their origin is unknown; but some, if not all of them, have antique
