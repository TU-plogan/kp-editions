                <p><label type="entry">ZIRCONIUM</label>, a rare element, closely allied to
                    titanium. Klaproth in 1789 analysed zircon and found it to contain a new earth,
                    which he called “zirconia.” Zircon is essentially a silicate of zirconia, ZrO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.SiO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. For the
                    extraction from it of zirconia the mineral is first of all heated and quenched
                    in water to render it brittle, and then reduced to a fine powder, which is fused
                    up with three to four parts of acid fluoride of potassium at a gentle heat in a
                    platinum crucible. When the mass fuses tranquilly and all the water is expelled,
                    the platinum crucible is placed in a Hessian crucible; the two crucibles are
                    then covered and kept for two hours at the highest temperature producible by
                    means of a wind-furnace. The porcelain-like fuse is powdered, boiled in water,
                    and acidified with hydrofluoric acid, and the residual fluosilicate of potassium
                    is filtered off. The filtrate on cooling deposits crystals of fluozircon-ate of
                    potassium, ZrF <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    which are purified by re-crystallization from hot water. The double fluoride is
                    decomposed with hot concentrated sulphuric acid; the mixed sulphate is dissolved
                    in water; and the zirconia is precipitated with ammonia in the cold. The
                    precipitate, being difficult to wash, is (after a preliminary washing)
                    re-dissolved in hydrochloric acid and re-precipitated with ammonia. Hydrated
                    zirconia, Zr(OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, as thus obtained, is quite
                    appreciably soluble in water and easily in mineral acids, with formation of
                    zirconic salts, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> ZrCl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>,
                    analogous to SnCl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. But, if the hydrate is
                    precipitated in the heat, it demands concentrated acids for its solution. The
                    hydrate readily loses its water at a dull red heat and passes into anhydride
                    with vivid incandescence. The anhydrous oxide, ZrO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    is with difficulty soluble even in hydrofluoric acid; but a mixture of two parts
                    of concentrated sulphuric acid and one of water dissolves it on continued
                    heating as Zr(SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.
                    Zirconia, when heated to whiteness remains unfused, and radiates out abundance
                    of white light. This property has been utilized for the construction of a new
                    kind of gas lamp, in which a colourless flame, produced by the combustion of a
                    mixture of gas and air, serves to heat a hollow cylinder of zirconia suspended
                    over it by means of platinum gauze. Zirconia, like oxide of tin and oxide of
                    titanium, unites not only with acids <pb break="no"

                    prepared, by igniting a mixture of zirconia and charcoal in a current of
                    chlorine, as a white sublimate. It has the exact vapour-density corresponding to
                    the formula. It dissolves in water with evolution of heat; on evaporation a
                    basic salt, 2ZrOCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 9H <hi rend="subscript">

                <p><hi rend="italic">Metallic zirconium</hi> is obtainable, by heating the double
                    fluoride of zirconium and potassium with metallic potassium, as an iron-grey
                    powder. Troost produced crystallized zirconium by fusing the double fluoride
                    with aluminium in a graphite crucible at the temperature of melting iron, and
                    extracting the aluminium from the fuse with hydrochloric acid. The crystals look
                    like antimony and are brittle; their specific gravity is 4∙15. The powdery metal
                    burns readily in air; the crystalline metal requires to be heated in an
                    oxyhydrogen flame if it is to catch fire. Mineral acids generally attack the
                    crystallized metal very little even in the heat; aqua regia, however, dissolves
                    it readily, and so does hydrofluoric acid. The spark spectrum of zirconium is
                    characterized by five lines, whose wave-lengths are as follows :—6127 in the
                    red, and 4815, 4771, 4738, 4709, and 4686 in the blue. The atomic weight is not
                    known exactly; according to Marignac and Deville, it lies near 90, if O =
