                    contraction son of Iddo, appeared as a prophet in Jerusalem along with <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Haggai</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> in the second year of
                    Darius Hystaspes (520 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), to warn and encourage the
                    Jews to address themselves at length to the restoration of the temple, which,
                    since their return from exile eighteen years before, had lain unaccomplished,
                    less through want of zeal than through the pressure of unfavourable
                    circumstances. Supported by the prophets, Zerubbabel and Joshua set about the
                    work, and the elders of Judah built and the work went forward (Ezra v. 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.,</hi> vi. 14). The first eight chapters of the book of
                    Zechariah exactly fit into this historical setting. They are divided by precise
                    chronological headings into three sections,— <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> chap. i.
                    1-6, in the eighth month of the second year of Darius; (ό) chap. i. 7-vi. 15, on
                    the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month of the same year; (c) chap.
                    vii.-viii., on the fourth day of the ninth month of the fourth year of Darius.
                    The first section is a preface containing exhortation in general terms. The main
                    section is the second, containing a series of night visions, the significant
                    features of which are pointed out by an angel who stands by the prophet and
                    answers his questions.</p>
                <p>i. 7-17. The divine chariots and horses that make the round of the world by
                    Jehovah’s orders return to the heavenly palace and report that there is still no
                    movement among the nations, no sign of the Messianic crisis. Seventy years have
                    passed, and Zion and the cities of Judah still mourn. Sad news! but Jehovah
                    gives a comfortable assurance of His gracious return to Jerusalem and the
                    rebuilding of His temple.</p>
                <p>i. 18-21 (Heb. ii. 1-4). Four horns, representing the hostile world-power that
                    oppresses Israel and Jerusalem, are routed by four smiths.</p>
                <p>ii. 1-13 (Heb. ii. 5-17). The new Jerusalem is laid out with the measuring line.
                    It is to have no walls, that its population may not be limited, and it needs
                    none, for Jehovah is its protection. The catastrophe of the nations is near to
                    come; then the exiles of Zion shall stream back from all quarters, the converted
                    heathen shall join them, Jehovah Himself will dwell in the midst of them, even
                    now He stirs Himself from His holy habitation.</p>
                <p>ii. 1-10. The high priest Joshua is accused before Jehovah by Satan, but is
                    acquitted and given rule in Jehovah’s house and courts, with the right of access
                    to Jehovah in priestly intercession. The restoration of the temple and its
                    service is a pledge of still higher things. The promised “branch” (or “shoot,”
                    עמח), the Messiah, will come: i.e., the Persian lordship has an end; the
                    national kingdom is restored in its old splendour; and a time of general
                    felicity dawns, when every man shall sit happy under his vine and under his fig
                    tree. As by rights the Messianic kingdom should follow immediately on the exile,
                    it is probable that the prophet designs to hint in a guarded way that
                    Zerubbabel, who in all other places is mentioned along with Joshua, is on the
                    point of ascending the throne of his ancestor David. The jewel with seven facets
                    is already there, only the inscription has still to be engraved on it (iii. 9).
                    The charges brought against the high priest consist simply in the obstacles that
                    have hitherto impeded the restoration of the temple and its service; and in like
                    manner the guilt of the land (iii. 9) is simply the still continuing domination
                    of foreigners.</p>
                <p>1v. 1-14. Beside a lighted golden candlestick of seven branches stand two olive
                    trees—Zerubbabel and Joshua, the two anointed ones—specially watched over by Him
                    whose seven eyes run through the whole earth. This explanation of the vision is
                    separated from the description by an animated dialogue, not quite clear in its
                    expression, in which it is said that the mountain of obstacles shall disappear
                    before Zerubbabel, and that, having begun the building of the temple, he shall
                    also bring it to an end in spite of those who now mock at the day of small
                    beginnings.</p>
                <p>v. 1-4. A written roll flies over the Holy Land; this is a concrete
                    representation of the curse which in future will fall of itself on all crime, so
                    that, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> no man who has suffered theft will have
                    occasion himself to pronounce a curse against the thief <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi> Jud. xvii. 2).</p>
                <p>v. 5-11. Guilt, personified as a woman, is cast into an epha-measure with a heavy
                    lid and carried from Judah to Chaldaea, where it is to have its home for the
                    future.</p>
                <p>vi. 1-8. The divine teams, four in number, again traverse the world toward the
                    four winds, to execute Jehovah’s commands. That which goes northward is charged
                    to wreak His anger on the north country. The series of visions has now reached
                    its close, returning to its starting-point in i. 7 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sqq.</hi></p>
                <p>An appendix follows (vi. 9-15). Jews from Babylon have brought gold and silver to
                    Jerusalem; of these the prophet must make a crown designed for the “branch” who
                    is to build Jehovah’s house and sit king on the throne, but retain a good
                    understanding with the high priest. Zerubbabel is certainly meant here, and, if
                    the received text names Joshua instead of him (vi. 11), this is only a
                    correction, made for reasons easy to understand, but which breaks the context
                    and destroys the sense and the reference of “them both” in verse 13.</p>
                <p>The third section (chaps. vii.-viii.), dated from the fourth year of Darius,
                    contains an inquiry whether the fast days that arose in the captivity are still
                    to be observed, with a comforting and encouraging reply of the prophet.</p>
                <p>Thus throughout the first eight chapters the scene is Jerusalem in the early part
                    of the reign of Darius. Zerubbabel and Joshua, the prince and the priest, are
                    the leaders of the community. But, while the spiritual head is in office, the
                    authority of the civil head is rather moral than official, and is not so much
                    actual as hoped for. The great concern of the time and the chief practical theme
                    of these chapters is the building of the temple; but its restoration is only the
                    earnest of greater things to follow, viz., the glorious restoration of David’s
                    kingdom. The horizon of these prophecies is everywhere limited by the narrow
                    conditions of the time, and their aim is clearly seen. The visions hardly veil
                    the thought, and the mode of expression is usually simple, except in the
                    Messianic passages, where the tortuousness and obscurity are perhaps
                    intentional. Noteworthy is the affinity between some notions evidently not
                    framed by the prophet himself and the prologue to Job,—the heavenly hosts that
                    wander through the earth and bring back their report to Jehovah’s throne, the
                    figure of Satan, the idea that suffering and calamity are evidences of guilt and
                    of accusations presented before God.</p>
                <p>Passing from chaps. i.-viii. to chaps. ix. <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> we at once
                    feel ourselves transported into a different world.</p>
                <p>Jehovah’s word is accomplished on Syria-Phoenicia and Philistia; and then the
                    Messianic kingdom begins in Zion, and the Israelites detained among the heathen,
                    Judah and Ephraim combined, receive a part in it. The might of the sons of Javan
                    is broken in battle against this kingdom (ch. ix.). After an intermezzo of three
                    verses (x. 1-3: “Ask rain of Jehovah, not of the diviners ”) a second and quite
                    analogous Messianic prophecy follows. The foreign tyrants fall; the lordship of
                    Assyria and Egypt has an end; the autonomy and martial power of the nation are
                    restored. The scattered exiles return as citizens of the new theocracy, all
                    obstacles in their way parting asunder as when the waves of the Red Sea gave
                    passage to Israel at the founding of the old theocracy (x. 3-12). Again there is
                    an interlude of three verses (xi. 1-3): fire seizes the cedars of Lebanon and
                    the oaks of Bashan, which the rabbins refer to the <pb break="no"

                    difficult passage about the shepherds follows.</p>
                <p>The shepherds (rulers) of the nation make their flock an article of trade aud
                    treat the sheep as sheep for the shambles. Therefore the inhabited world shall
                    fall a sacrifice to the tyranny of its kings, while Israel is delivered to a
                    shepherd who feeds the sheep for those who make a trade of the flock הצאז
                    ײבנענײxi∙ 7, 11 = “they that sell them,” ver. 5) and enters on his office with
                    two staves, “Favour” and “Union.” He destroys “the three shepherds” in one
                    month, but is soon weary of his flock and the flock of him. He breaks the staff
                    “Favour,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the covenant of peace with the nations,
                    and asks the traders for his hire. Receiving thirty pieces of silver, he casts
                    it into the temple treasury and breaks the staff “Union” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. He is succeeded by a
                    foolish shepherd, who neglects his flock and lets it go to ruin. At length
                    Jehovah intervenes; the foolish shepherd falls by the sword; two-thirds of the
                    people perish with him in the Messianic crisis, but the remnant of one-third
                    forms the seed of the new theocracy (xi. 4-17 taken with xiii. 7-9, according to
                    the necessary transposition proposed by Ewald). All this must be an allegory of
                    past events, the time present to the author and his hopes for the future
                    beginning only at xi. 17, xiii. 7-9. The general situation is clear: foreign
                    kings govern Israel through native princes. The details cannot be explained in
                    the absence of information as to the date and historical course of the events
                    described by the prophet in allegorical form. But those who seek to escape this
                    difficulty, by supposing that the word of the prophet was unintelligible to his
                    contemporaries, and gained a true meaning only in its New Testament
                    fulfilment,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Matt. xxvii.

                    wearies of his office and abandons the flock, while in the New Testament the
                    shepherd gives his life for the sheep, and that in Zech. xi. 12, 13 the price is
                    paid to the shepherd, but in the New Testament to the traitor.</p>
                <p>Chap. xii. presents a third variation on the Messianic promise. All heathendom is
                    gathered together against Jerusalem and perishes there. Jehovah first gives
                    victory to the countryfolk of Judah and then they rescue the capital. After this
                    triumph the noblest houses of Jerusalem hold, each by itself, a great
                    lamentation over a martyr “whom they have pierced” (or “whom men have pierced
                    ”). In xii. 10 אלי followed by עליו cannot be right. If את be deleted, we may
                    read אלי אשד , but not אליו אשד, which is not Hebrew. Yet it is very doubtful if
                    the deletion of את is justifiable or sufficient. It is taken for granted that
                    the readers will know who the martyr is, and the exegesis of the church applies
                    the passage to our Lord. Chap. xiii. 1-6 is a continuation of chap. xii.; the
                    dawn of the day of salvation is accompanied by a general purging away of
                    idolatry and the enthusiasm of false prophets. Yet a fourth variation of the
                    picture of the incoming of the Messianic deliverance is given in chap. xiv. The
                    heathen gather against Jerusalem and take the city, but do not utterly destroy
                    the inhabitants. Then Jehovah, at a time known only to Himself, shall appear
                    with all His saints on Mount Olivet and destroy the heathen in battle, while the
                    men of Jerusalem take refuge in their terror in the great cleft that opens where
                    Jehovah sets His foot. Now the new era begins, and even the heathen do homage to
                    Jehovah by bringing due tribute to the annual feast of tabernacles. All in
                    Jerusalem is holy down to the bells on the horses and the cooking-pots.</p>
                <p>There is a striking contrast between chaps. i.-viii. and chaps. ix.-xiv. The
                    former prophecy is closely tied to the situation and wants of the community of
                    Jerusalem in the second year of Darius I., and all that it aims at arises out of
                    the necessities of the time, and is of a practical and possible kind—the
                    restoration of the temple and perhaps the elevation of Zerubbabel to the throne
                    of David. The latter chapters, on the other hand, soar far above the field of
                    reality; the historical situation from which they start can hardly be
                    recognized; and the future hope has very little connexion with the present. The
                    fundamental difference between the two parts of the book lies, not in the
                    subject but in the nature of the prophecy,—in the first part realistic and
                    almost prosaic, in the second vague and fantastic. There are corresponding
                    differences in style and speech; and it is particularly to be noted that, while
                    the superscriptions in the first part name the author and give the date of each
                    oracle with precision, those in the second part (ix. 1, xii. 1) are without name
                    or date. That both parts do not belong to the same author must be ad mitted. But
                    most recent critics make the second part the older. Chaps. ix.-xi. are ascribed
                    to a contemporary of Amos and Hosea, about the middle of the 8th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> because Ephraim is mentioned as well as Judah, and
                    Assyria along with Egypt (x. 10), while the neighbours of Israel appear in ix. 1
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> in the same way as in Amos i.-ii. That chaps.
                    xii.-xiv. are also pre-exilic is held to appear especially in the attack on
                    idolatry and lying prophecy (xiii. 1-6); but, as this prophecy speaks only of
                    Judah and Jerusalem, it is dated after the fall of Samaria, and is assigned to
                    the last days of the Judaean kingdom on the strength of xii. 11, where an
                    allusion is seen to the mourning for King Josiah, slain in battle at Megiddo.
                    Some suppose that the author of ix.-xi. is the Zechariah, son of Jeberechiah, of
                    Isa. viii. 2, and Bunsen ascribes xii.-xiv. to the prophet Urijah, son of
                    Shemaiah (Jer. xxvi. 20 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> It is more likely that
                    chaps. ix.-xiv. go all together and are of much later date. These vague
                    predictions have no real spiritual affinity either with the prophecy of Amos,
                    Hosea, and Isaiah, or with that of Jeremiah, where we always feel the solid
                    ground of present reality under our feet. It was only after the exile that
                    prophecy lost its close connexion with history and ceased to be built on present
                    realities. The kind of eschatology which we find in Zech. ix.-xiv. was first
                    introduced by Ezekiel, who in particular is the author of the conception that
                    the time of deliverance is to be preceded by a joint attack of all nations on
                    Jerusalem, in which they come to final overthrow (Ezek. xxxviii. <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.·,</hi> Isa. lxvi. 18-24; Joel). The importance attached to the
                    temple service, even in Messianic times (Zech. xiv.), implies an author who
                    lived in the ideas of the religious commonwealth of post-exile times. A future
                    king is hoped for; but in the present there is no Davidic king, only a Davidic
                    family standing on the same level with other noble families in Jerusalem (xii.
                    7, 12). The “bastard” (mixed race) of Ashdod reminds us of Neh. xiii. 23 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqq.;</hi> and the words of ix. 12 (“to-day, also, do I declare
                    that I will render double unto thee ”) have no sense unless they refer back to
                    the deliverance from Babylonian exile. But the decisive argument is that in ix.
                    13 the sons of Javan, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Greeks, appear as the
                    representatives of the heathen world-power. The prophecy, therefore, is later
                    than Alexander; and indeed the hostility to the Jews implied in the passage just
                    cited dates only from the time when Palestine passed from the hands of the
                    Ptolemies to those of the Seleucids. Assyria and Egypt (x. 11) may well be the
                    Ptolemaic and Seleucid kingdoms, which together made up for the Jews the empire
                    of the sons of Javan. In ix. 1 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> (imitated from Amos
                    i.-ii.) Seleucid Syria is described as parcelled out into a number of small
                    principalities, some of which were at the time nearly independent. That the Jews
                    had reason enough to hate their neighbours, even in later times, appears, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in 1 Mac. v.; compare especially ix. 6, 7 with 1 Mac.
                    v. 68. The reference in ix. 8 would fit well with the Egyptian campaigns of
                    Antiochus IV. Epiphanes, when Jerusalem suffered so much on the outward march
                    and still more on the return of his troops. That the victory of Judah over the
                    heathens is to precede the deliverance of Jerusalem (xii. 5 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sqq.)</hi> is a remarkable feature, hardly to be explained except by the
                    history of the Maccabee wars. The complaint about idolatry also fits this
                    period; and that a new kind of prophecy then came up, in an age where it no
                    longer had a legitimate place, is far from unlikely.</p>
                <p>If this date is assumed for chaps. ix.-xiv., we must hold that, by the copious
                    use of phrases from older prophets and other means, the author sought to give
                    his oracles an archaic garb. That this is no unfair assumption appears
                    especially in xiv. 5, in the reference to the earthquake in the days of Uzziah,
                    which is natural only if the author addressed <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n824/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0824-0775"/> contemporaries of that catastrophe. This passage
                    is indeed a stronger argument for a date in the Assyrian period than anything
                    cited from chaps. ix.-xi. If, notwithstanding this, no commentator dates chap.
                    xiv. less than 150 years after Uzziah, it is illegitimate to protest against the
                    view that in chaps. ix. <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> Ephraim is an archaizing name
                    for the Diaspora (1 Mac. v. 23, 45, 53).</p>
                <p>How so late a piece was admitted among the prophetic writings, while Daniel,
                    written about the same time, is placed only among the hagiographa, is a question
                    not yet answered. We know too little about the history of the canon. A similar
                    case is that of Isa. xxiv.-xxvii. But it is not less difficult to explain how a
                    prophecy of the 8th century could have turned up in post-exile times and been
                    appended to the book of Zechariah.</p>
