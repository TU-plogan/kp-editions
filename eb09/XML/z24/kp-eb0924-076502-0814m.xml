                    Mossamba Mountains; and the Leeba river, from the marshy Lake Dilolo (4740
                    feet), situated between 10° and 12° S. lat. and 22° and 23° E. long. These three
                    rivers, reinforced by the Nhengo, unite to form the upper Zambesi (Leeambye),
                    which flows at first southwards and slightly eastwards through the Barotse
                    valley, then turns prominently to the east near its junction with the Chobe
                    (Chuando or Linianti), and passes over the Victoria Falls. Thence, as the middle
                    reach of the Zambesi, the river sweeps north-east towards Zumbo and the
                    Kebrabassa rapids above Tete, and finally forms the lower Zambesi, which curves
                    southwards until it reaches the Indian Ocean at 18° 50' S. lat. Fed chiefly from
                    the highland country which stretches from Lake Nyassa to inner Angola, its chief
                    tributaries are the Loangwa and the Shire, the last an important river draining
                    out of Lake Nyassa, and which in the dry season contains probably as great a
                    volume of water as the Zambesi, and is much more navigable. Except for an
                    interruption of 70 miles at the Murchison cataracts, the Shiré is open
                    throughout its entire length to the lake.</p>
                <p>On the whole the Zambesi has a gentle current, and flows through a succession of
                    wide fertile valleys and richly wooded plains; but, owing to the terrace-like
                    structure of the continent, the course of the river is interrupted from point to
                    point by cataracts and rapids. These form serious, and in some cases
                    insurmountable, hindrances to navigation. Those on the lower Zambesi begin with
                    its delta. The bar here was long held to be impassable, except to vessels of the
                    shallowest draught; but the difficulty was exaggerated partly through ignorance
                    and partly in the interests of the Portuguese settlement of Quilimane, which,
                    before the merits of the Kongone entrance were understood, had been already
                    established on the Qua-qua river, 60 miles to the north. The Zambesi is now
                    known to have four mouths, the Milambe to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n815/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0815-0766"/> west, the Kongone, the Luabo, and the Timbwe. The
                    best of these, the Kongone, has altered and the channel improved recently. There
                    are at least 18 feet of water on the bar at high water neap tides; and steamers
                    drawing 15 feet, and sailing vessels drawing 3 feet less, have no difficulty in
                    entering. The deep water continues only a short distance; and, after Mazaro (60
                    miles) is reached, where the river has already dwindled to the breadth of a
                    mile, the channel is precariously open in the dry season as far as Senna (120
                    miles from the mouth) for vessels drawing 4½ feet. Up to this point navigation
                    could only be successfully and continuously carried on by vessels of much
                    lighter draught—stern-wheelers for preference with a draught of little more than
                    18 inches. About 90 miles from Senna the river enters the Lupata gorge, the
                    impetuous current contracting between walls to a width of scarcely 200 yards.
                    Passing Tete (240 miles from the mouth with a smooth course), the channel
                    becomes dangerous at Kebrabassa, 90 miles farther on. From the Kebra-bassa
                    rapids upwards, and past the Victoria Falls, there are occasional stretches of
                    navigable water extending for considerable distances, while the upper Zambesi
                    with its confluents and their tributaries forms a really fine and extensive
                    waterway. Like the Nile, the Zambesi is visited by annual inundations, during
                    which the whole country is flooded and many of the minor falls and rapids are
                    then obliterated.</p>
                <p>The chief physical feature of the Zambesi is the Mosi-oa-tunya (“smoke sounds
                    there”) or Victoria Falls, admitted to be one of the noblest waterfalls in the
                    world. The cataract is bounded on three sides by ridges 300 or 400 feet high,
                    and these, along with the many islands dotted over the stream, are covered with
                    sylvan vegetation. The falls, according to Livingstone, are caused by a
                    stupendous crack or rent, with sharp and almost unbroken edges, stretching right
                    across the river in the hard black basalt which here forms the bed. The cleft is
                    360 feet in sheer depth and close upon a mile in length. Into this chasm, of
                    more than twice the depth of Niagara, the river rolls with a deafening roar,
                    sending up vast columns of spray, which are visible for a distance of 20 miles.
                    Unlike Niagara, the Mosi-oa-tunya does not terminate in an open gorge, the river
                    immediately below the fall being blocked at 80 yards distance by the opposing
                    side of the (supposed) cleft running parallel to the precipice which forms the
                    waterfall. The only outlet is a narrow channel cut in this barrier at a point
                    1170 yards from the western end of the chasm and some 600 from its eastern, and
                    through this the Zambesi, now only 20 or 30 yards wide, pours for 120 yards
                    before emerging into the enormous zig-zag trough which conducts the river past
                    the basalt plateau.</p>
                <p>The region drained by the Zambesi may be represented as a vast broken-edged
                    plateau 3000 or 4000 feet high, composed in the remote interior of metamorphic
                    beds and fringed with the igneous rocks of the Victoria Falls. At Shupanga, on
                    the lower Zambesi, thin strata of grey and yellow sandstones, with an occasional
                    band of limestone, crop out on the bed of the river in the dry season, and these
                    persist beyond Tete, where they are associated with extensive seams of coal.
                    Gold is also known to occur in several places.</p>
                <p>The higher regions of the Zambesi have only been visited by one or two explorers;
                    and the lower, though nominally in possession of the Portuguese since the
                    beginning of the 16th century, are also comparatively little known. The Barotse
                    valley or valley of the upper Zambesi is a vast pastoral plain, 3300 feet above
                    sea-level, about 189 miles in length and 30 to 35 broad. Though inundated in the
                    rainy season, it is covered with villages and supports countless herds of
                    cattle. The Lirinas who inhabit it' are clothed with skins, work neatly in
                    ivory, and live upon milk, maize, and sweet potatoes. In the neighbourhood of
                    the falls the tsetse fly abounds, so that the Batoka people who live there, and
                    who are the only arboriculturists in the country, live upon the products of
                    their gardens. Zumbo, on the north bank, and Chicova, opposite on the southern
                    side (500 miles above the delta), were the farthest inland of the Portuguese
                    East African settlements, and are well placed for commerce with the natives.
                    Founded by Pereira, a native of Goa, these settlements were ultimately allowed
                    to go to ruins; but Zumbo has been recently re-occupied. The once celebrated
                    gold mines of Parda Pemba are in the vicinity. The only other Portuguese
                    settlements on the Zambesi are Tete and Senna. Tete, formerly a large and
                    important place, now nearly in ruins, still possesses a fort and several good
                    tiled stone and mud houses. Thither Portuguese goods, chiefly wines and
                    provisions, are carried by means of canoes. The exports, which include ivory,
                    gold dust, wheat, and groundnuts, are limited owing to the difficulty of
                    transport; but this difficulty is not insurmountable, for Tete has been twice
                    visited by small steam vessels. Senna, farther down the river, a neglected and
                    unhealthy village, has suffered much from political mismanagement, and has
                    ceaseless troubles with the Landeens or Zulus, who own the southern bank of the
                    river and collect in force every year to exact a heavy tribute-money. The
                    industrial possibilities of the lower Zambesi, and indeed of the whole
                    river-system, are enormous. India-rubber, indigo, archil, beeswax, and calumba
                    root are plentiful, and oil seeds and the sugar-cane could be produced in
                    sufficient quantity to supply the whole of Europe.</p>
                <p>The Zambesi region was known to the mediaeval geographers as the empire of
                    Monomotapa, and the course of the river, as well as the position of Lakes N’gami
                    and Nyassa, was filled in with a rude approximation to accuracy in the earlier
                    maps. These were probably constructed from Arab information. The first European
                    to visit the upper Zambesi was Livingstone in his exploration from Bechuanaland
                    between 1851 and 1853. Two or three years later he descended the Zambesi to its
                    mouth and in the course of this journey discovered the Victoria Falls. In 1859,
                    accompanied by Dr Kirk (now Sir John Kirk), Livingstone ascended the river as
                    far as the falls, after tracing the course of its main tributary the Shire and
                    discovering Lake Nyassa. The mouths of the Zambesi were long claimed exclusively
                    by the Portuguese, but in 1888 the British Government opened negotiations with
                    Portugal to have the river declared free to all nations. (H. D.)</p>
