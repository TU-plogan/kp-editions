                <p>THF branch of science to which the name zoology is strictly applicable may be
                    defined as that portion of biology which relates to animals, as distinguished
                    from that portion which is concerned with plants.</p>
                <p>The science of biology itself has been placed by Mr Herbert Spencer in the group
                    of concrete sciences, the other groups recognized by that writer being the
                    “abstractconcrete” and the “abstract.” The abstract sciences are logic and
                    mathematics, and treat of the blank forms in which phenomena occur in relation
                    to time, space, and number. The abstract-concrete sciences are mechanics,
                    physics, and chemistry. The title assigned to them is justified by the fact
                    that, whilst their subject-matter is found in a consideration of varied concrete
                    phenomena, they do not aim at the explanation of complex concrete phenomena as
                    such, but at the determination of certain “abstract” quantitative relations and
                    sequences known as the “laws” of mechanics, physics, and chemistry, which never
                    are manifested in a pure form, but always are inferred by observation and
                    experiment upon complex phenomena in which the abstract laws are disguised by
                    their simultaneous interaction. The group of concrete sciences includes
                    astronomy, geology, biology, and sociology. These sciences have for their aim to
                    “explain” the concrete complex phenomena of (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the
                    sidereal system, (ό) the earth as a whole, (c) the living matter on the earth’s
                    surface, (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) human society, by reference to the
                    properties of matter set forth in the generalizations or laws of the
                    abstract-concrete sciences, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of mechanics, physics,
                    and chemistry.</p>
                <p>The classification thus sketched exhibits, whatever its practical demerits, the
                    most important fact with regard to biology, namely, that it is the aim or
                    business of those occupied with that branch of science to assign living things,
                    in all their variety of form and activity, to the one set of forces recognized
                    by the physicist and chemist. Just as the astronomer accounts for the heavenly
                    bodies and their movements by the laws of motion and the property of attraction,
                    as the geologist explains the present state of the earth’s crust by the
                    long-continued action of the same forces which at this moment are studied and
                    treated in the form of “laws” by physicists and chemists, so the biologist seeks
                    to explain in all its details the long process of the evolution of the
                    innumerable forms of life now existing, or which have existed in the past, as a
                    necessary outcome, an automatic product, of these same forces.</p>
                <p>Science may be defined as the knowledge of causes; and, so long as biology was
                    not a conscious attempt to ascertain the causes of living things, it could not
                    be rightly grouped with other branches of science. For a very long period the
                    two parallel divisions of biology,—botany and zoology,— were actually limited to
                    the accumulation of observations, which were noted, tabulated, and contemplated
                    by the students of these subjects with wonder and delight, but only to a limited
                    extent and in restricted classes of facts with any hope or intention of
                    connecting the phenomena observed with the great nexus of physical sequence or
                    causation. A vague desire to assign the forms and the activities of living
                    things in all their variety to general causes has always been present to
                    thoughtful observers from the earliest times of which we have record, but the
                    earlier attempts in this direction were fantastic in the extreme; and it is the
                    mere truth that, at the time when the phenomena of inorganic nature had been
                    recognized as the outcome of uniform and constant properties capable of analysis
                    and measurement, living things were still left hopelessly out of the domain of
                    explanation, the earlier theories having been rejected and nothing as yet
                    suggested in their place.</p>
                <p>The history of zoology as a science is therefore the history of the great
                    biological doctrine of the evolution of living things by the natural selection
                    of varieties in the struggle for existence,—since that doctrine is the one
                    medium whereby all the phenomena of life, whether of form or function, are
                    rendered capable of explanation by the laws of physics and chemistry, and so
                    made the subject-matter of a true science or study of causes. A history of
                    zoology must take account of the growth of those various kinds of information
                    with regard to animal life which have been arrived at in past ages through the
                    labours of a long series of ardent lovers of nature, who in each succeeding
                    period have more and more carefully and accurately tested, proved, arranged, and
                    tabulated their knowledge, until at last the accumulated lore of
                    centuries—almost without the consciousness of its latest heirs and
                    cultivators—took the form of the doctrine of descent and the filiation of the
                    animal series.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">History.</hi></p>
                <p>There is something almost pathetic in the childish wonder and delight with which
                    mankind in its earlier phases of civilization gathered up and treasured stories
                    of strange animals from distant lands or deep seas, such as are recorded in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Physiologus,</hi> in Albertus Magnus, and even at the present
                    day in the popular treatises of Japan and China. That omnivorous universally
                    credulous stage, which may be called the “legendary,” was succeeded by the age
                    of collectors and travellers, when many of the strange stories believed in were
                    actually demonstrated as true by the living or preserved trophies brought to
                    Europe by adventurous navigators. The possibility of verification established
                    verification as a habit; and the collecting of <hi rend="italic">things,</hi>
                    instead of the accumulating of <hi rend="italic">reports,</hi> developed a new
                    faculty of minute observation. The early collectors of natural curiosities were
                    the founders of zoological science, and to this day the naturalist-traveller and
                    his correlative, the museum curator and systematist, play a most important part
                    in the progress of zoology. Indeed, the historical and present importance of
                    this aspect or branch of zoological science is so great that the name “zoology”
                    has until recently been associated entirely with it, to the exclusion of the
                    study of minute anatomical structure and function which have been distinguished
                    as anatomy and physiology. It is a curious result of the steps of the historical
                    progress of the two divisions of biological science that, whilst the word
                    “botany” has always been understood, and is at the present day understood, as
                    embracing the study, not only of the external forms of plants, their systematic
                    nomenclature and classification, and their geographical distribution, but also
                    the study of their minute structure, their organs of nutrition and reproduction,
                    and the mode of action of the mechanism furnished by those organs, the word
                    “zoology” has been limited to such a knowledge of animals as the travelling
                    sportsman could acquire in making his collections of skins of beasts and birds,
                    of dried insects and molluscs’ shells, and such a knowledge ‘as the museum
                    curator could acquire by the examination and classification of these portable
                    objects. Anatomy and the study of animal mechanism, animal physics, and animal
                    chemistry, all of which form part of a true zoology, have been excluded from the
                    usual definition of the word by the mere accident that the zoologist of the last
                    three centuries has had his museum but has not had his garden of living
                    specimens as the botanist has had;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    anatomical and physiological study—only supplied within the past century by the
                    method of preserving animal bodies in alcohol—the demands of medicine for a
                    knowledge of the structure of the human animal have in the meantime brought into
                    existence a separate and special study of human anatomy and physiology.</p>
                <p>From these special studies of human structure the knowledge of the anatomy of
                    animals has proceeded, the same investigator who had made himself acquainted
                    with the structure of the human body desiring to compare with the standard given
                    by human anatomy the structures of other animals. Thus comparative anatomy came
                    into existence as a branch of inquiry apart from zoology, and it is only now, in
                    the latter part of the 19th century, that the limitation of the word “zoology”
                    to a knowledge of animals which expressly excludes the consideration of their
                    internal structure has been rejected by the general consent of those concerned
                    in the progress of science; it is now generally recognized that it is mere
                    tautology to speak of zoology <hi rend="italic">and</hi> comparative anatomy,
                    and that our museum naturalists must give attention as well to the inside as to
                    the outside of animals.</p>
                <p>The anatomy and physiology of plants have never been excluded from the attention
                    of botanists, because in contrast to the earlier zoologists they always were in
                    possession of the whole living plant, raised from seed if need be in a
                    hot-house, instead of having only a dried skin, skeleton, or shell. Consequently
                    the study of vegetable anatomy and physiology has grown up naturally and in a
                    healthy way in strict relation to the rest of botanical knowledge, whilst animal
                    anatomy and physiology have been external to zoology in origin, the product of
                    the medical profession and, as a consequence, subjected to a misleading
                    anthropocentric method.</p>
                <p>Whilst we may consider the day as gone by in which zoology could be regarded as
                    connoting solely a special museum knowledge of animals (as twenty-five years ago
                    was still the case), it is interesting to observe by the way the curious
                    usurpation of the word “physiology,” which, from having a wide connotation,
                    indicated by its etymology, —the <hi rend="italic">physiologus</hi> of the
                    Middle Ages being nothing more nor less than the naturalist or student of
                    nature,—has in these later days acquired a limitation which it is difficult to
                    justify or explain. Physiology to-day means the study of the physical and
                    chemical properties of the animal or vegetable body, and is even distinguished
                    from the study of structure and strictly confined to the study of function. It
                    would hardly be in place here to discuss at length the steps by which physiology
                    became thus limited, any more than to trace those by which the words “physician”
                    and “physicist” (which both mean one who occupies himself with nature) came to
                    signify respectively a medical practitioner and a student of the laws of
                    mechanics, heat, light, and electricity (but not of chemistry), whilst the word
                    “naturalist” is very usually limited to a lover and student of living things, to
                    the exclusion of the so-called physicist, the chemist, and the astronomer. It is
                    probable that physiology acquired its present significance, viz., the study of
                    the properties and functions of the tissues and organs of living things, by a
                    process of external attraction and spoliation which gradually removed from the
                    original <hi rend="italic">physiologus</hi> all his belongings and assigned them
                    to newly named and independently constituted sciences, leaving at last, as a <hi
                    rend="italic">residuum</hi> to which the word might still be applied, that
                    medical aspect of life which is concerned with the workings of the living
                    organism regarded as a piece of physico-chemical apparatus.</p>
                <p>Whatever may be the history of the word “physiology,” we find zoology, which
                    really started in the 16th century with the awakening of the new spirit of
                    observation and exploration, for a long time running a separate course
                    uninfluenced by the progress of the medical studies of anatomy and physiology.
                    The history of every branch of science involves a recognition of the history,
                    not only of other branches of science, but of the progress of human society in
                    every other relation. The century which destroyed the authority of the church,
                    witnessed the discovery of the New World, and in England produced the writings
                    of Francis Bacon is rightly regarded as the starting-point of the modern
                    knowledge of natural causes or science. The true history of zoology as a science
                    lies within the three last centuries; and, whilst the theories and fables which
                    were current in earlier times in regard to animal life and the various kinds of
                    animals form an important subject of study from the point of view of the history
                    of the development of the human mind, they really have no bearing upon the
                    history of scientific zoology. The great awakening of western Europe in the 16th
                    century led to an active search for knowledge by means of observation and
                    experiment, which found its natural home in the universities. Owing to the
                    connexion of medicine with these seats of learning, it was natural that the
                    study of the structure and functions of the human body and of the animals
                    nearest to man should take root there; the spirit of inquiry which now for the
                    first time became general showed itself in the anatomical schools of the Italian
                    universities of the 16th century, and spread fifty years later to Oxford.</p>
                <p>In the 17th century the lovers of the new philosophy, the investigators of nature
                    by means of observation and experiment, banded themselves into academies or
                    societies for mutual support and intercourse. It is difficult to exaggerate the
                    importance of the influence which has been exercised by these associations upon
                    the progress of all branches of science and of zoology especially. The essential
                    importance of academies is to be found, as Laplace, the great French astronomer,
                    has said, “in the philosophic spirit which develops itself in them and spreads
                    itself from them as centres over an entire nation and all relations. The
                    isolated man of science can give himself up to dogmatism without restraint; he
                    hears contradictions only from afar. But in a learned society the enunciation of
                    dogmatic views leads rapidly to their destruction, and the desire of each member
                    to convince the others necessarily leads to the agreement to admit nothing
                    excepting what is the result of observation or of mathematical calculation.”</p>
                <p>The first founded of surviving European academies, the Academia Naturae
                    Curiosorum (1651),<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Academia Secretorum Naturae was founded at Naples in 1560, but was suppressed by
                    the ecclesiastical authorities.</p></note> especially confined itself to the
                    description and illustration of the structure of plants and animals; eleven
                    years later (1662) the Royal Society of London was incorporated by royal
                    charter, having existed without a name or fixed organization for seventeen years
                    previously (from 1645). A little later the Academy of Sciences of Paris was
                    established by Louis XIV. The influence of these great academies of the 17th
                    century on the progress of zoology was precisely to effect that bringing
                    together of the museum-men and the physicians or anatomists which was needed for
                    further development. Whilst the race of collectors and systematizes culminated
                    in the latter part of the 18th century relation to real knowledge, but was part
                    of a peculiar and in itself highly interesting mysticism. A fantastic and
                    elaborate doctrine of symbolism existed which comprised all nature; witchcraft,
                    alchemy, and medicine were its practical expressions. Animals as well as plants
                    were regarded as “simples” and used in medicine, and a knowledge of them was
                    valued from this point of view. Plants were collected and cultivated for
                    medicinal use; hence the physic gardens and the botanist’s advantage.</p>

                <p>in Linnaeus, a new type of student made its appearance in such men as John Hunter
                    and other anatomists, who, not satisfied with the superficial observations of
                    the popular “zoologists,” set themselves to work to examine anatomically the
                    whole animal kingdom, and to classify its members by aid of the results of such
                    profound study. From them we pass to the comparative anatomists of the 19th
                    century and the introduction of the microscope as a serious instrument of
                    accurate observation.</p>

                    the 17th century cannot be better illustrated than by an examination of the
                    early records of the Royal Society of London. The spirit which animated the
                    founders and leaders of that society is clearly indicated in its motto “Nullius
                    in verba.” Marvellous narrations were not permitted at the meetings of the
                    society, but solely demonstrative experiments or the exhibition of actual
                    specimens. Definite rules were laid down by the society for its guidance,
                    designed to ensure the collection of solid facts and the testing of statements
                    embodying novel or remarkable observations. Under the influence of the
                    touchstone of strict inquiry set on foot by the Royal Society, the marvels of
                    witchcraft, sympathetic powders, and other relics of mediaeval superstition
                    disappeared like a mist before the sun, whilst accurate observations and
                    demonstrations of a host of new wonders accumulated, amongst which were numerous
                    contributions to the anatomy of animals, and none perhaps more noteworthy than
                    the observations, made by the aid of microscopes constructed by himself, of
                    Leeuwenhoek, the Dutch naturalist (1683), some of whose instruments were
                    presented by him to the society.</p>
                <p>It was not until the 19th century that the microscope, thus early applied by
                    Leeuwenhoek, Malpighi, Hook, and Swammerdam to the study of animal structure,
                    was perfected as an instrument, and accomplished for zoology its final and most
                    important service. The earlier half of the 19th century is remarkable for the
                    rise, growth, and full development of a new current of thought in relation to
                    living things, expressed in the various doctrines of development which were
                    promulgated, whether in relation to the origin of individual animals and plants
                    or in relation to their origin from predecessors in past ages. The perfecting of
                    the microscope led to a full comprehension of the great doctrine of
                    cell-structure and the establishment of the facts—(1) that all organisms are
                    either single corpuscles (so-called cells) of living material (microscopic
                    animalcules, &amp;c.) or are built up of an immense number of such units; (2)
                    that all organisms begin their individual existence as a single unit or
                    corpuscle of living substance, which multiplies by binary fission, the products
                    growing in size and multiplying similarly by binary fission; and (3) that the
                    life of a multicellular organism is the sum of the activities of the corpuscular
                    units of which it consists, and that the processes of life must be studied in
                    and their explanation obtained from an understanding of the chemical and
                    physical changes which go on in each individual corpuscle or unit of living
                    material or protoplasm (cell-theory of Schwann).</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the astronomical theories of development of the solar system
                    from a gaseous condition to its present form, put forward by Kant and by
                    Laplace, had impressed men’s minds with the conception of a general movement of
                    spontaneous progress or development in all nature; and, though such ideas were
                    not new but are to be found in some of the ancient Greek philosophers, yet now
                    for the first time they could be considered with a sufficient knowledge and
                    certainty as to the facts, due to the careful observation of the two preceding
                    centuries. The science of geology came into existence, and the whole panorama of
                    successive stages of the earth’s history, each with its distinct population of
                    strange animals and plants, unlike those of the present day and simpler in
                    proportion as they recede into the past, was revealed by Cuvier, Agassiz, and
                    others. The history of the crust of the earth was explained by Lyell as due to a
                    process of slow development, in order to effect which he called in no
                    cataclysmic agencies, no mysterious forces differing from those operating at the
                    present day. Thus he carried on the narrative of orderly development from the
                    point at which it was left by Kant and Laplace,—explaining by reference to the
                    ascertained laws of physics and chemistry the configuration of the earth, its
                    mountains and seas, its igneous and its stratified rocks, just as the
                    astronomers had explained by those same laws the evolution of the sun and
                    planets from diffused gaseous matter of high temperature.</p>
                <p>The suggestion that living things must also be included in this great development
                    was obvious. They had been so included by poet-philosophers in past ages; they
                    were so included by many a simple-minded student of nature who, watching the
                    growth of the tree from the seed, formed a true but unverified inference in
                    favour of a general process of growth and development of all things from simpler
                    beginnings. The delay in the establishment of the doctrine of organic evolution
                    was due, not to the ignorant and unobservant, but to the leaders of zoological
                    and botanical science. Knowing as they did the almost endless complexity of
                    organic structures, realizing as they did that man himself with all the mystery
                    of his life and consciousness must be included in any explanation of the origin
                    of living things, they preferred to regard living things as something apart from
                    the rest of nature, specially cared for, specially created by a Divine Being,
                    rather than to indulge in hypotheses which seemed to be beyond all possibility
                    of proof, and were rather of the nature of poets’ dreams than in accordance with
                    the principles of that new philosophy of rigid adherence to fact and
                    demonstration which had hitherto served as the mainsprings of scientific
                    progress. Thus it was that the so-called “Natur-philosophen” of the last decade
                    of the 18th century, and their successors in the first quarter of the 19th,
                    found few adherents among the working zoologists and botanists. Lamarck,
                    Treviranus, Erasmus Darwin, Goethe, and Saint-Hilaire preached to deaf ears, for
                    they advanced the theory that living beings had developed by a slow process of
                    transmutation in successive generations from simpler ancestors, and in the
                    beginning from simplest formless matter, without being able to demonstrate any
                    existing mechanical causes by which such development must necessarily be brought
                    about. They were met in fact by the criticism that possibly such a development
                    had taken place; but, as no one could show as a simple fact of observation that
                    it <hi rend="italic">had</hi> taken place, nor as a result of legitimate
                    inference that it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have taken place, it was quite as
                    likely that the past and present species of animals and plants had been
                    separately created or. individually brought into existence by unknown and
                    inscrutable causes, and (it was held) the truly scientific man would refuse to
                    occupy himself with such fancies, whilst ever continuing to concern himself with
                    the observation and record of indisputable facts. The critics did well; for the
                    “Natur-philosophen,” though right in their main conception, were premature.</p>
                <p>It was reserved for Charles Darwin, in the year 1859, to place the whole theory
                    of organic evolution on a new footing, and by his discovery of a mechanical
                    cause actually existing and demonstrable by which organic evolution must be
                    brought about to entirely change the attitude in regard to it of even the most
                    rigid exponents of the scientific method. Since its first publication in 1859
                    the history of Darwin’s theory has been one of continuous and decisive conquest,
                    so that at the present day it is universally accepted<pb break="no"

                    zoological and botanical science.</p>
                <p>Darwin succeeded in establishing the doctrine of organic evolution by the
                    introduction into the web of the zoological and botanical sciences of a new
                    science. The subjectmatter of this new science, or branch of biological science,
                    had been neglected: it did not form part of the studies of the collector and
                    systematist, nor was it a branch of anatomy, nor of the physiology pursued by
                    medical men, nor again was it included in the field of microscopy and the
                    cell-theory. The area of biological knowledge which Darwin was the first to
                    subject to scientific method and to render, as it were, contributory to the
                    great stream formed by the union of the various branches, the outlines of which
                    we have already traced, is that which relates to the breeding of animals and
                    plants, their congenital variations, and the transmission and perpetuation of
                    those variations. This branch of biological science may be called thremmatology
                    <hi rend="italic">(θρέμμa,</hi> “a thing bred”). Outside the scientific world an
                    immense mass of observation and experiment had grown up in relation to this
                    subject. From the earliest times the shepherd, the farmer, the horticulturist,
                    and the “fancier” had for practical purposes made themselves acquainted with a
                    number of biological laws, and successfully applied them without exciting more
                    than an occasional notice from the academic students of biology. It is one of
                    Darwin’s great merits to have made use of these observations and to have
                    formulated their results to a large extent as the laws of variation and
                    heredity. As the breeder selects a congenital variation which suits his
                    requirements, and by breeding from the animals (or plants) exhibiting that
                    variation obtains a new breed specially characterized by that variation, so in
                    nature is there a selection amongst all the congenital variations of each
                    generation of a species. This selection depends on the fact that more young are
                    born than the natural provision of food will support. In consequence of this
                    excess of births there is a struggle for existence and a survival of the
                    fittest, and consequently an ever-present necessarily-acting selection, which
                    either maintains accurately the form of the species from generation to
                    generation or leads to its modification in correspondence with changes in the
                    surrounding circumstances which have relation to its fitness for success in the
                    struggle for life.</p>
                <p>Darwin’s introduction of thremmatology into the domain of scientific biology was
                    accompanied by a new and special development of a branch of study which had
                    previously been known as teleology, the study of the adaptation of organic
                    structures to the service of the organisms in which they occur. It cannot be
                    said that previously to Darwin there had been any very profound study of
                    teleology, but it had been the delight of a certain type of mind—that of the
                    lovers of nature or naturalists <hi rend="italic">par excellence,</hi> as they
                    were sometimes termed—to watch the habits of living animals and plants, and to
                    point out the remarkable ways in which the structure of each variety of organic
                    life was adapted to the special circumstances of life of the variety or species.
                    The astonishing colours and grotesque forms of some animals and plants which the
                    museum zoologists gravely described without comment were shown by these
                    observers of living nature to have their significance in the economy of the
                    organism possessing them; and a general doctrine was recognized, to the effect
                    that no part or structure of an organism is without definite use and adaptation,
                    being <hi rend="italic">designed</hi> by the Creator for the benefit of the
                    creature to which it belongs, or else for the benefit, amusement, or instruction
                    of his highest creature—man. Teleology in this form of the doctrine of design
                    was never very deeply rooted amongst scientific anatomists and systematists. It
                    was considered permissible to speculate somewhat vaguely on the subject of the
                    utility of this or that startling variety of structure; but few attempts, though
                    some of great importance, were made to systematically explain by observation and
                    experiment the adaptation of organic structures to particular purposes in the
                    case of the lower animals and plants. Teleology had, however, an important part
                    in the development of what is called physiology, viz., the knowledge of the
                    mechanism, the physical and chemical properties, of the parts of the body of man
                    and the higher animals allied to him. The doctrine of organs and functions—the
                    organ designed so as to execute the function, and the whole system of organs and
                    functions building up a complex mechanism, the complete animal or plant—was
                    teleological in origin (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Physiology),</hi> and led to
                    brilliant discoveries in the hands of the physiologists of the last and the
                    preceding century. As applied to lower and more obscure forms of life, teleology
                    presented almost insurmountable difficulties; and consequently, in place of
                    exact experiment and demonstration, the most reckless though ingenious
                    assumptions were made as to the utility of the parts and organs of lower
                    animals, which tended to bring so-called comparative physiology and teleology
                    generally into disrepute. Darwin’s theory had as one of its results the
                    reformation and rehabilitation of teleology. According to that theory, every
                    organ, every part, colour, and peculiarity of an organism, must either be of
                    benefit to that organism itself or have been so to its ancestors: no peculiarity
                    of structure or general conformation, no habit or instinct in any organism, can
                    be supposed to exist for the benefit or amusement of another organism, not even
                    for the delectation of man himself. Necessarily, according to the theory of
                    natural selection, structures either are present because they are selected as
                    useful or because they are still inherited from ancestors to whom they were
                    useful, though no longer useful to the existing representatives of those
                    ancestors.</p>
                <p>The conception thus put forward entirely re-founded teleology. Structures
                    previously inexplicable were explained as survivals from a past age, no longer
                    useful though once of value. Every variety of form and colour was urgently and
                    absolutely called upon to produce its title to existence either as an active
                    useful agent or as a survival. Darwin himself spent a large part of the later
                    years of his life in thus extending the new teleology. A beginning only has as
                    yet been made in the new life of that branch of zoological and botanical
                    study.</p>
                <p>The old doctrine of types, which was used by the philosophically-minded
                    zoologists (and botanists) of the first half of the century as a ready means of
                    explaining the failures and difficulties of the doctrine of design, fell into
                    its proper place under the new dispensation. The adherence to type, the
                    favourite conception of the transcendental morphologist, was seen to be nothing
                    more than the expression of one of the laws of thremmatology, the persistence of
                    hereditary transmission of ancestral characters, even when they have ceased to
                    be significant or valuable in the struggle for existence, whilst the so-called
                    evidences of design which was supposed to modify the limitations of types
                    assigned to Himself by the Creator were seen to be adaptations due to the
                    selection and intensification by selective breeding of fortuitous congenital
                    variations, which happened to prove more useful than the many thousand other
                    variations which did not survive in the struggle for existence.</p>
                <p>Thus not only did Darwin’s theory give a new basis to the study of organic
                    structure, but, whilst rendering the general theory of organic evolution equally
                    acceptable and necessary, it explained the existence of low and simple forms of
                    life as survivals of the earliest ancestry of more highly complex forms, and
                    revealed the classifications of the <pb break="no"

                    the genealogical tree or pedigree of plants and animals. Finally, it brought the
                    simplest living matter or formless protoplasm before the mental vision as the
                    starting-point whence, by the operation of necessary mechanical causes, the
                    highest forms have been evolved, and it rendered unavoidable the conclusion that
                    this earliest living material was itself evolved by gradual processes, the
                    result also of the known and recognized laws of physics and chemistry, from
                    material which we should call not living. It abolished the conception of life as
                    an entity above and beyond the common properties of matter, and led to the
                    conviction that the marvellous and exceptional qualities of that which we call
                    “living” matter are nothing more nor less than an exceptionally complicated
                    development of those chemical and physical properties which we recognize in a
                    gradually ascending scale of evolution in the carbon compounds, containing
                    nitrogen as well as oxygen, sulphur, and hydrogen as constituent atoms of their
                    enormous molecules. Thus mysticism was finally banished from the domain of
                    biology, and zoology became one of the physical sciences, —the science which
                    seeks to arrange and discuss the phenomena of animal life and form as the
                    outcome of the operation of the laws of physics and chemistry.</p>

                    of zoology, that simple division of the science into morphology and physiology
                    which is a favourite one at the present day. No doubt the division is a logical
                    one, based as it is upon the distinction of the study of form and structure in
                    themselves (morphology) from the study of what are the activities and functions
                    of the forms and structures (physiology). Such logical divisions are possible
                    upon a variety of bases, but are not necessarily conducive to the ascertainment
                    and remembrance of the historical progress and present significance of the
                    science to which they are applied. As a matter of convenience and as the outcome
                    of historical events it happens that in the universities of Europe, whilst
                    botany in its entirety is usually represented by one chair, the animal side of
                    biology is represented by a chair of so-called zoology, which is understood as
                    the old-fashioned systematic zoology, a chair of human and comparative anatomy,
                    and a chair of physiology (signifying the mechanics, physics, and chemistry of
                    animals especially in relation to man). Fifty years ago the chairs of anatomy
                    and physiology were united in one. No such distinction of mental activities as
                    that involved in the division of the study of animal life into morphology and
                    physiology has ever really existed: the investigator of animal forms has never
                    entirely ignored the functions of the forms studied by him, and the experimental
                    inquirer into the functions and properties of animal tissues and organs has
                    always taken very careful account of the forms of those tissues and organs.</p>
                <p>A more instructive subdivision of the science of animal biology or zoology is one
                    which shall correspond to the separate currents of thought and mental
                    preoccupation which have been historically manifested in western Europe in the
                    gradual evolution of what is to-day the great river of zoological doctrine to
                    which they have all been rendered contributory. Such a subdivision of zoology,
                    whilst it enables us to trace the history of thought, corresponds very closely
                    with the actual varieties of mental attitude exhibited at the present day by the
                    devotees of zoological study, though it must be remembered that the gathering
                    together of all the separate currents by Darwin is certain sooner or later to
                    entail new developments and branchings of the stream.</p>
                <p>We accordingly recognize the following five branches of zoological study :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Morphography.—</hi> The work of the collector and
                    systematist: exemplified by Linnaeus and his predecessors, by Cuvier, Agassiz,
                    Haeckel.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Bionomics.—</hi> The lore of the farmer, gardener,
                    sportsman, fancier, and field-naturalist, including thremmatology, or the
                    science of breeding, and the allied teleology, or science of organic
                    adaptations: exemplified by the patriarch Jacob, the poet Virgil, Sprengel,
                    Kirby and Spence, Wallace, and Darwin.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Zoo-Dynamics, Zoo-Physics, Zoo-Chemistry. —</hi> The pursuit
                    of the learned physician,—anatomy and physiology: exemplified by Harvey, Haller,
                    Hunter, Johann Müller.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Plasmology.—</hi> The study of the ultimate corpuscles of
                    living matter, their structure, development, and properties, by the aid of the
                    microscope; exemplified by Malpighi, Hook, Schwann, Kowalewsky.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Zoology.—</hi> General conceptions with regard
                    to the relations of living things (especially animals) to the universe, to man,
                    and to the Creator, their origin and significance: exemplified in the writings
                    of the philosophers of classical antiquity, and of Linnaeus, Goethe, Lamarck,
                    Cuvier, Lyell, H. Spencer, and Darwin.</p>
                <p>It is true that it is impossible to assign the great names of the present century
                    to a single one of the subdivisions of the science thus recognized. With men of
                    an earlier date such special assignment is possible, and there would be no
                    difficulty about thus separating the minor specialists of modern times. But the
                    fact is that as we approach Darwin’s epoch we find the separate streams more and
                    more freely connected with one another by anastomosing branches; and the men who
                    have left their mark on the progress of science have been precisely those who
                    have been instrumental in bringing about such confluence, and have distinguished
                    themselves by the influence of their discoveries or generalizations upon several
                    lines of work. At last, in Darwin we find a name which might appear in each of
                    our subdivisions,—a zoologist to whose doctrine all are contributory, and by
                    whose labours all are united and reformed.</p>
                <p>We shall now briefly sketch the history of these streams of thought, premising
                    that one has (so far as the last three centuries are concerned) but little start
                    of another, and that sooner or later the influence of the progress of one branch
                    makes itself felt in the progress of another.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Morphography.</hi></p>
                <p>Under this head we include the systematic exploration and tabulation of the facts
                    involved in the recognition of all the recent and extinct kinds of animals and
                    their distribution in space and time. (1) The museum-makers of old days and
                    their modern representatives the curators and describers of zoological
                    collections, (2) early explorers and modern naturalist-travellers and writers on
                    zoo-geography, and (3) collectors of fossils and palaeontologists are the chief
                    varieties of zoological workers coming under this head. Gradually since the time
                    of Hunter and Cuvier anatomical study has associated itself with the more
                    superficial morphography until to-day no one considers a study of animal form of
                    any value which does not include internal structure, histology, and embryology
                    in its scope.</p>
                <p>The real dawn of zoology after the legendary period of the Middle Ages is
                    connected with the name of an Englishman, Wotton, born at Oxford in 1492, who
                    practised as a physician in London and died in 1555. He published a treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De Differentiis Animalium</hi> at Paris in 1552. In <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n853/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0853-0804"/> many respects Wotton was simply an exponent of
                    Aristotle, whose teaching, with various fanciful additions, constituted the real
                    basis of zoological knowledge throughout the Middle Ages. It was Wotton’s merit
                    that he rejected the legendary and fantastic accretions, and returned to
                    Aristotle and the observation of nature. The most ready means of noting the
                    progress of zoology during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries is to compare the
                    classificatory conceptions of successive naturalists with those which are to be
                    found in the works of Aristotle himself. Aristotle did not definitely and in
                    tabular form propound a classification of animals, but from a study of his
                    treatises <hi rend="italic">Historia Animalium, De Generatione Animalium,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">De Partibus Animalium</hi> the following classification
                    can be arrived at :—</p>
                <p>A. ΅Evαιμα, blood-holding animals ( = <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata).</hi></p>
                <p>1. Zωoτoκoῠvτα έ <hi rend="italic">v aύτοῖs,</hi> viviparous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Enaema</hi> ( = Mammals, including the Whale).</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">"Oρvιθεs</hi> ( = Birds).</p>
                <p>3. Τετράποδα ᾔ <hi rend="italic">ᾂποδα ώοτοκοΰντα,</hi> four-footed or legless
                    <hi rend="italic">Enaema</hi> which lay eggs ( = Reptiles and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphibia).</hi></p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">'Iχθύϵς</hi> ( = Fishes).</p>
                <p>B. "Αναιμα, bloodless animals ( = <hi rend="italic">Invertebrata).</hi></p>
                <p>1. Μαλάκια, soft-bodied <hi rend="italic">Anaema ( = Cephalopoda).</hi></p>
                <p>2. Μαλακόστρακα, soft-shelled <hi rend="italic">Anaema ( = Crustacea).</hi></p>
                <p>3. "Εντομα, insected <hi rend="italic">Anaema</hi> or Insects (= <hi
                    rend="italic">Arthropoda,</hi> exclusive of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crustacea).</hi></p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Όστρακοδέρματα,</hi> shell-bearing <hi rend="italic">Anaema
                    (=Echini, Gastropoda,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lamellibranchia. )</hi></p>
                <p>Wotton follows Aristotle in the division of animals into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Enaema</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Anaema,</hi> and in fact in the
                    recognition of all the groups above given, adding only one large group to those
                    recognized by Aristotle under the <hi rend="italic">Anaema,</hi> namely, the
                    group of <hi rend="italic">Zooρhyta,</hi> in which Wotton includes the <hi
                    rend="italic">Holothuriae,</hi> Star-Fishes, <hi rend="italic">Medusae,</hi>
                    Sea-Anemones, and Sponges. Wotton divides the viviparous quadrupeds into the
                    manytoed, double-hoofed, and single-hoofed. By the introduction of a method of
                    classification which was due to the superficial Pliny,—viz., one depending, not
                    on structure, but on the medium inhabited by an animal, whether earth, air, or
                    water,—Wotton is led to associate Fishes and Whales as aquatic animals. But this
                    is only a momentary lapse, for he broadly distinguishes the two kinds.</p>
                <p>Conrad Gesner (1516-1565), who was a physician and held professorial chairs in
                    various Swiss cities, is the most voluminous and instructive of these earliest
                    writers on systematic zoology, and was so highly esteemed that his <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia Animalium</hi> was republished a hundred years after his
                    death. His great work appeared in successive parts,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    Vivipara, Ovipara, Aves, Pisces, Serpentes et Scorpio,—</hi> and contains
                    descriptions and illustrations of a large number of animal forms with reference
                    to the lands inhabited by them. Gesner’s work, like that of John Johnstone (<hi
                    rend="italic">b.</hi> 1603), who was of Scottish descent and studied at St
                    Andrews, and like that of Ulysses Aldrovandi of Bologna (<hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi>. 1522), was essentially a compilation, more or less critical, of all
                    such records, pictures, and relations concerning beasts, birds, reptiles,
                    fishes, and monsters as could be gathered together by one reading in the great
                    libraries of Europe, travelling from city to city, and frequenting the company
                    of those who either had themselves passed into distant lands or possessed the
                    letters written and sometimes the specimens brought home by adventurous
                    persons.</p>
                <p>The exploration of parts of the New World next brought to hand descriptions and
                    specimens of many novel forms of animal life, and in the latter part of the 16th
                    century and the beginning of the 17th that careful study by “specialists” of the
                    structure and life-history of particular groups of animals was commenced which,
                    directed at first to common and familiar kinds, was gradually extended until it
                    formed a sufficient body of knowledge to serve as an anatomical basis for
                    classification. This minuter study had two origins, one in the researches of the
                    medical anatomists, such as Fabricius (1537-1619), Severinus (1580-1656), Harvey
                    (1578-1657), and Tyson (1649-1708), the other in the careful work of the
                    entomologists and first microscopists, such as Malpighi (1628-1694), Swammerdam
                    (1637-1680), and Hook (1635-1702). The commencement of anatomical investigations
                    deserves notice here as influencing the general accuracy and minuteness with
                    which zoological work was prosecuted, but it was not until a late date that
                    their full influence was brought to bear upon systematic zoology by Georges
                    Cuvier (1769- 1832).</p>
                <p>The most prominent name between that of Gesner and Linnaeus in the history of
                    systematic zoology is that of John <hi rend="smallcaps">Ray (</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.).</hi> Though not so extensive as that of Linnaeus, his work
                    is of the highest importance, and rendered the subsequent labours of the Swedish
                    naturalist far easier than they would otherwise have been. A chief merit of Ray
                    is to have limited the term “species” and to have assigned to it the
                    significance which it has until the Darwinian era borne, whereas previously it
                    was loosely and vaguely applied. He also made considerable use of anatomical
                    characters in his definitions of larger groups, and may thus be considered as
                    the father of modern zoology. Associated with Ray in his work, and more
                    especially occupied with the study of the Worms and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mollusca,</hi> was Martin Lister (1638-1712), who is celebrated also as the
                    author of the first geological map.</p>
                <p>After Ray’s death in London in 1705 the progress of anatomical knowledge, and of
                    the discovery and illustration of new forms of animal life from distant lands,
                    continued with increasing vigour. We note the names of Vallisnieri (1661-1730)
                    and Alexander Monro (1697-1767); the travellers Tournefort (1656-1708) and Shaw
                    (1692-1751); the collectors Rumphius (1637-1706) and Hans Sloane (1660-1753);
                    the entomologist Réaumur (1683-1757); Lhwyd (1703) and Linck (1674-1734), the
                    students of StarFishes; Peyssonel (b. 1694), the investigator of Polyps and the
                    opponent of Marsigli and Réaumur, who held them to be plants; Woodward, the
                    palaeontologist (1665- 1722),—not to speak of others of less importance.</p>
                <p>Two years after Ray’s death Carl <hi rend="smallcaps">Linnaeus (</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> q.v.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">)</hi> was born. Unlike
                    Jacob Theodore Klein (1685-1759), whose careful treatises on various groups of
                    plants and animals were published during the period between Ray and Linnaeus,
                    the latter had his career marked out for him in a university, that of Upsala,
                    where he was first professor of medicine and subsequently of natural history.
                    His lectures formed a new departure in the academic treatment of zoology and
                    botany, which, in direct continuity from the Middle Ages, had hitherto been
                    subjected to the traditions of the medical profession and regarded as mere
                    branches of “materia medica.” Linnaeus taught zoology and botany as branches of
                    knowledge to be studied for their own intrinsic interest. His great work, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Systema Naturae,</hi> ran through twelve editions during his
                    lifetime (1st ed. 1735, 12th 1768). Apart from his special discoveries in the
                    anatomy of plants and animals, and his descriptions of new species, the great
                    merit of Linnaeus was his introduction of a method of enumeration and
                    classification which may be said to have created systematic zoology and botany
                    in their present form, and establishes his name for ever as the great organizer,
                    the man who recognized a great practical want in the use of language and
                    supplied it. Linnaeus adopted Ray’s conception of species, but he made species a
                    practical reality by insisting that every species shall have a double Latin
                    name,—the first half to be the name of the genus common to several species, and
                    the second half to be the specific name. Previously to Linnaeus long many-worded
                    names had been used, sometimes with <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n854/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0854-0805"/> one additional adjective, sometimes with another,
                    so that no true <hi rend="italic">names</hi> were fixed and accepted. Linnaeus
                    by his binomial system made it possible to write and speak with accuracy of any
                    given species of plant or animal. He was, in fact, the Adam of zoological
                    science. He proceeded further to introduce into his enumeration of animals and
                    plants a series of groups, viz., genus, order, class, which he compared to the
                    subdivisions of an army or the subdivisions of a territory, the greater
                    containing several of the less, as follows :—</p>

                <p>Linnaeus himself recognized the purely subjective character of his larger groups;
                    for him species were, however, objective: “there are,” he said, “just so many
                    species as in the beginning the Infinite Being created.” It was reserved for a
                    philosophic zoologist of the 19th century (Agassiz, <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    Classification,</hi> 1859) to maintain dogmatically that genus, order, and class
                    were also objective facts capable of precise estimation and valuation. This
                    climax was reached at the very moment when Darwin was publishing the <hi
                    rend="italic">Origin of Species</hi> (1859), by which universal opinion has been
                    brought to the position that species, as well as genera, orders, and classes,
                    are the subjective expressions of a vast ramifying pedigree in which the only
                    objective existences are individuals, the apparent species as well as higher
                    groups being marked out, not by any distributive law, but by the purely
                    non-significant operation of human experience, which cannot transcend the
                    results of death and decay.</p>

                <p>Between Linnaeus and Cuvier there are no very great names; but under the stimulus
                    given by the admirable method and system of Linnaeus observation and description
                    of new forms from all parts of the world, both recent and fossil, accumulated.
                    We can only cite the names of Charles Bonnet (1720-1793), the entomologist, who
                    described the reproduction of <hi rend="italic">Aphis</hi>; Banks and Solander,
                    who accompanied Captain Cook on his first voyage (1768-1771); Thomas Pennant
                    (1726-1798), the describer of the English fauna; Peter Simon Pallas (1741-1811),
                    who specially extended the knowledge of the Linnaean <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vermes,</hi> and under the patronage of the empress Catherine explored Russia
                    and Siberia; De Geer (1720-1778), the entomologist; Lyonnet (1707-1789), the
                    author of the monograph of the anatomy of the caterpillar of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cossus ligniperdus</hi>; Cavolini (1756- 1810), the Neapolitan marine zoologist
                    and forerunner of Della Chiaje (fl. 1828); O. F. Müller (1730-1784), the
                    describer of freshwater <hi rend="italic">Oligoehaeta;</hi> Abraham Trembley
                    (1700-1784), the student of <hi rend="italic">Hydra ·,</hi> and Ledermüller
                    (1719- 1769), the inventor of the term <hi rend="italic">Infusoria.</hi> The
                    effect of the Linnaean system upon the general conceptions of zoologists was no
                    less marked than were its results in the way of stimulating the accumulation of
                    accurately observed details. The notion of a <hi rend="italic">scala
                    naturae,</hi> which had since the days of classical antiquity been a part of the
                    general philosophy of nature amongst those who occupied themselves with such
                    conceptions, now took a more definite form in the minds of skilled zoologists.
                    The species of Linnaeus were supposed to represent a series of steps in a scale
                    of ascending complexity, and it was thought possible thus to arrange the animal
                    kingdom in a single series,—the orders within the classes succeeding one another
                    in regular gradation, and the classes succeeding one another in a similar
                    rectilinear progression. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lamarck</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.)</hi> represents most completely, both by his development theory (to be
                    further mentioned below) and by his scheme of classification, the high-water
                    mark of the popular but fallacious conception of a <hi rend="italic">scala
                    naturae.</hi> His classification (1801 to 1812) is as follows :—</p>

                <p>The enumeration of orders above given will enable the reader to form some
                    conception of the progress of knowledge relating to the lower forms of life
                    during the fifty years which intervened between Linnaeus and Lamarck. The number
                    of genera recognized by Lamarck is more than ten times as great as that recorded
                    by Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>We have mentioned Lamarck before his great contemporary Cuvier because, in spite
                    of his valuable philosophical doctrine of development, he was, as compared with
                    Cuvier and estimated as a systematic zoologist, a mere enlargement and logical
                    outcome of Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>The distinctive merit of <hi rend="smallcaps">Cuvier</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.)</hi> is that he started a new view as to the relationships of animals,
                    which he may be said in a large measure to have demonstrated as true by his own
                    anatomical researches. He opposed the <hi rend="italic">scala naturae</hi>
                    theory, and recognized four distinct and divergent branches or <hi rend="italic"
                    >embranchemens,</hi> as he called them, in each of which he arranged a certain
                    number of the Linnaean classes, or similar classes. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >embranchemens</hi> were characterized each by a different type of anatomical
                    structure. Cuvier thus laid the foundation of that branching tree-like
                    arrangement of the classes and orders of animals which we now recognize as being
                    the necessary result of attempts to represent what is practically a genealogical
                    tree or pedigree. Apart from this, Cuvier was a keen-sighted and enthusiastic
                    anatomist of great skill and industry. It is astonishing how many good observers
                    it requires to dissect and draw and record over and over again the structure of
                    an animal before an approximately correct account of it is obtained. Cuvier
                    dissected many Molluscs and other animals which had not previously been
                    anatomized; of others he gave more correct accounts than had been given by
                    earlier writers. Skilful as he was, his observations are very frequently
                    erroneous. Great accuracy in work as well as great abundance of production has
                    only distinguished one amongst all the great names of zoology—that of Johann
                    Müller. It certainly did not <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n856/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0856-0807"/> distinguish Cuvier. Another special distinction
                    of Cuvier is his remarkable work in comparing extinct with recent organisms, his
                    descriptions of the fossil <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> of the Paris basin,
                    and his general application of the knowledge of recent animals to the
                    reconstruction of extinct ones, as indicated by fragments only of their
                    skeletons.</p>
                <p>It was in 1812 that Cuvier communicated to the Academy of Sciences of Paris his
                    views on the classification of animals. He says—</p>
                <p>"Si l'on considère le règne animal d’après les principes que nous venons de
                    poser, en se debarassant des préjugés établis sur les divisions anciennement
                    admises, en n’ayant égard qu’ à l’organisation et à la nature des animaux, et
                    non pas à leur grandeur, à leur utilité, au plus ou moins de connaissance que
                    nous en avons, ni à toutes les autres circonstances accessoires, on trouvera
                    qu’il existe quatre formes principales, quatre plans généraux, si l’on peut
                    s’exprimer ainsi, d’après lesquels tous les animaux semblent avoir été modelés
                    et dont les divisions ultérieures, de quelque titre que les naturalistes les
                    aient décorées, ne sont que des modifications assez légères, fondées sur le
                    développement, ou l’addition de quelques parties qui ne changent rien à
                    l’essence du plan.”</p>

                <p>The leading idea of Cuvier, his four <hi rend="italic">embranchemens,</hi> was
                    confirmed by the Russo-German naturalist Von Baer (1792-1876), who adopted
                    Cuvier’s divisions, speaking of them as the peripheric, the longitudinal, the
                    massive, and the vertebrate types of structure. Von Baer, however, has another
                    place in the history of zoology, being the first and most striking figure in the
                    introduction of embryology into the consideration of the relations of animals to
                    one another.</p>
                <p>Cuvier may be regarded as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> zoologist by whom anatomy
                    was made the one important guide to the understanding of the relations of
                    animals. But it should be noted that the belief, dating from Malpighi (1670),
                    that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a relationship to be discovered, and not
                    merely a haphazard congregation of varieties of structure to be classified, had
                    previously gained ground. Cuvier was familiar with the speculations of the
                    “Natur-philosophen,” and with the doctrine of transmutation and filiation by
                    which they endeavoured to account for existing animal forms. The noble aim of F.
                    W. J. Schelling, “das ganze System der Naturlehre von dem Gesetze der Schwere
                    bis zu den Bildungstrieben der Organismus als ein organisches Ganze
                    darzustellen,” which has ultimately been realized through Darwin, was a general
                    one among the scientific men of the year 1800. Lamarck accepted the development
                    theory fully, and pushed his speculations far beyond the realm of fact. The more
                    cautious Cuvier adopted a view of the relationships of animals which, whilst
                    denying genetic connexion as the explanation, recognized an essential identity
                    of structure throughout whole groups of animals. This identity was held to be
                    due to an ultimate law of nature or the Creator’s plan. The tracing out of this
                    identity in diversity, whether regarded as evidence of blood-relationship or as
                    a remarkable display of skill on the part of the Creator in varying the details
                    whilst retaining the essential, became at this period a special pursuit, to
                    which Goethe, the poet, who himself contributed importantly to it, gave the name
                    “morphology.” C. F. Wolff, Goethe, and Oken share the credit of having initiated
                    these views, in regard especially to the structure of flowering plants and the
                    Vertebrate skull. Cuvier’s doctrine of four plans of structure was essentially a
                    morphological one, and so was the single-scale doctrine of Buffon and Lamarck,
                    to which it was opposed. Cuvier’s morphological doctrine received its fullest
                    development in the principle of the “correlation of parts,” which he applied to
                    palaeontological investigation, namely, that every animal is a definite whole,
                    and that no part can be varied without entailing correlated and law-abiding
                    variations in other parts, so that from a fragment it should be possible, had we
                    a full knowledge of the laws of animal structure or morphology, to reconstruct
                    the whole. Here Cuvier was imperfectly formulating, without recognizing the real
                    physical basis of the phenomena, the results of the laws of heredity, which were
                    subsequently investigated and brought to bear on the problems of animal
                    structure by Darwin.</p>
                <p>Richard Owen<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Boni in 1804

                    foremost of Cuvier’s disciples. Owen not only occupied himself with the
                    dissection of rare animals, such as the Pearly Nautilus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lingula, Limulus, Protopterus, Apteryx,</hi> &amp;c., and with the description
                    and reconstruction of extinct Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals,—following the
                    Cuvierian tradition,—but gave precision and currency to the morphological
                    doctrines which had taken their rise in the beginning of the century by the
                    introduction of two terms, “homology” and “analogy,” which were defined so as to
                    express two different kinds of agreement in animal structures, which, owing to
                    the want of such “counters of thought,” had been hitherto continually confused.
                    <hi rend="italic">Analogous</hi> structures in any two animals compared were by
                    Owen defined as structures performing similar functions, but not necessarily
                    derived from the modification of one and the same part in the “plan” or
                    “archetype” according to which the two animals compared were supposed to be
                    constructed. <hi rend="italic">Homologous</hi> structures were such as, though
                    greatly differing in appearance and detail from one another, and though
                    performing widely different functions, yet were <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n857/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0857-0808"/> capable of being shown by adequate study of a
                    series of intermediate forms to be derived from one and the same part or organ
                    of the “plan-form” or “archetype.” It is not easy to exaggerate the service
                    rendered by Owen to the study of zoology by the introduction of this apparently
                    small piece of verbal mechanism; it takes place with the classificatory terms of
                    Linnaeus. And, though the conceptions of “archetypal morphology,” to which it
                    had reference, are now abandoned in favour of a genetic morphology, yet we
                    should remember, in estimating the value of this and of other speculations which
                    have given place to new views in the history of science, the words of the great
                    reformer himself. “Erroneous observations are in the highest degree injurious to
                    the progress of science, since they often persist for a long time. But erroneous
                    theories, when they are supported by facts, do little harm, since every one
                    takes a healthy pleasure in proving their falsity” (Darwin). Owen’s definition
                    of analogous structures holds good at the present day. His homologous structures
                    are now spoken of as “homogenetic” structures, the idea of community of
                    representation in an archetype giving place to community of derivation from a
                    single representative structure present in a common ancestor. Darwinian
                    morphology has further rendered necessary the introduction of the terms
                    “homoplasy” and “homoplastic” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> to express that
                    close agreement in <hi rend="italic">form</hi> which may be attained in the
                    course of evolutional changes by organs or parts in two animals which have been
                    subjected to similar moulding conditions of the environment, but have no genetic
                    community of origin, to account for their close similarity in form and
                    structure.</p>
                <p>The classification adopted by Owen in his lectures (1855) does not adequately
                    illustrate the progress of zoological knowledge between Cuvier’s death and that
                    date, but, such as it is, it is worth citing here.</p>

                <p>The real centre of progress of systematic zoology was no longer in France nor
                    with the disciples of Cuvier in England, but after his death moved to Germany.
                    The wave of morphological speculation, with its outcome of new systems and new
                    theories of classification, which were as numerous as the professors of
                    zoological science, <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> was necessarily succeeded in
                    the true progress of the science by a period of minuter study in which the
                    microscope, the discovery of embryological histories, and the all-important
                    cell-theory came to swell the stream of exact knowledge.</p>
                <p>We have already mentioned Von Baer in this connexion, and given a passing
                    reference to Johann <hi rend="smallcaps">Müller</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                    >q.v.</hi>), the greatest of all investigators of animal structure in the
                    present century. Müller (1801-1858) was in Germany the successor of Rathke
                    (1793-1860) and of Meckel (1781-1833) as the leader of anatomical investigation;
                    but his true greatness can only be estimated by a consideration of the fact that
                    he was a great teacher not only of human and comparative anatomy and zoology but
                    also of physiology, and that nearly all the most distinguished German zoologists
                    and physiologists of the period 1850 to 1870 were his pupils and acknowledged
                    his leadership. The most striking feature about Johann Müller’s work, apart from
                    the comprehensiveness of his point of view, in which he added to the anatomical
                    and morphological ideas of Cuvier a consideration of physiology, embryology, and
                    microscopic structure, was the extraordinary accuracy, facility, and
                    completeness of his recorded observations. He could do more with a single
                    specimen of a rare animal <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> in his memoir on <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> Berlin, 1844) in the way of making out its
                    complete structure than the ablest of his contemporaries or successors could do
                    with a plethora. His power of rapid and exhaustive observation and of accurate
                    pictorial reproduction was phenomenal. His most important memoirs, besides that
                    just mentioned, are those on the anatomy and classification of Fishes, on the
                    Coecilians, and on the developmental history of the Echinoderms.</p>
                <p>See Lankester, “On the Use of the Term Homology in Modem Zoology and the
                    Distinction between Homogenetic and Homoplastic Agreements,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist.</hi> 1870.</p>
                <p>See Agassiz, <hi rend="italic">Essay on Classification,</hi> 1859, for an account
                    of them.</p>
                <p>A name which is apt to be forgotten in the period between Cuvier and Darwin,
                    because its possessor occupied an isolated position in England and was not borne
                    up by any great school or university, is that of John Vaughan Thompson, who was
                    an army surgeon, and when past the age of forty, being district medical
                    inspector at Cork (1830), took to the study of marine <hi rend="italic"
                    >Invertebrate</hi> by the aid of the microscope. Thompson made three great
                    discoveries, which seem to have fallen in his way in the most natural and simple
                    manner, but must be regarded really as the outcome of extraordinary genius. He
                    showed that the organisms like <hi rend="italic">Flustra</hi> are not hydroid
                    Polyps, but of a more complex structure resembling Molluscs, and he gave them
                    the name <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa.</hi> He discovered the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pentacrinus europaeus,</hi> and showed that it was the larval form of the
                    Feather-Star <hi rend="italic">Antedon (Comatula).</hi> He upset Cuvier’s
                    retention of the Cirripedes among <hi rend="italic">Mollusca,</hi> and his
                    subsequent treatment of them as an isolated class, by showing that they begin
                    life as free-swimming <hi rend="italic">Crustacea</hi> identical with the young
                    forms of other <hi rend="italic">Crustacea.</hi> Vaughan Thompson is a type of
                    the marine zoologists, such as Dalyell, Michael Sars, P. J. Van Beneden,
                    Claparède, and Allman, who during the present century have approached the study
                    of the lower marine organisms in the same spirit as that in which Trembley and
                    Schäffer in the last century, and Swammerdam in the 17th, gave themselves to the
                    study of the minute freshwater forms of animal life.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to enumerate or to give due consideration to all the names in
                    the army of anatomical and embryological students of the middle third of this
                    century whose labours bore fruit in the modification of zoological theories and
                    in the building up of a true classification of animals. Their results are best
                    summed up in the three schemes of classification which follow below—those of
                    Rudolph Leuckart (b. 1823), Henri Milne-Edwards (1800-1884), and T. H. Huxley
                    (b. 1825), all of whom individually contributed very greatly by their special
                    discoveries and researches to the increase of exact knowledge.</p>
                <p>Contemporaneous with these were various schemes of classification which were
                    based, not on a consideration of the entire structure of each animal, but on the
                    variations of a single organ, or on the really non-significant fact of the
                    structure of the <hi rend="italic">egg.</hi> All such single-fact systems have
                    proved to be useless and in fact departures from the true line of growth of the
                    zoological system which was shaping itself year by year—unknown to those who so
                    shaped it— as a genealogical tree. They were attempts to arrive at a true
                    knowledge of the relationships of animals by “royal roads”; their followers were
                    landed in barren wastes.</p>

                <p>We now arrive at the period when the doctrine of organic evolution was
                    established by Darwin, and when naturalists, being convinced by him as they had
                    not been by the transmutationists of fifty years’ earlier date, were compelled
                    to take an entirely new view of the significance of all attempts at framing a
                    “natural” classification.</p>
                <p>Many zoologists—prominent among them in Great Britain being Huxley—had been
                    repelled by the airy fancies and assumptions of the “philosophical”
                    morphologists. The efforts of the best minds in zoology had been directed for
                    thirty years or more to ascertaining with increased accuracy and minuteness the
                    structure, microscopic and gross, of all possible forms of animals, and not only
                    of the adult structure but of the steps of development of that structure in the
                    growth of each kind of organism from the egg to maturity. Putting aside
                    fantastic theories, these observers endeavoured to give in their classifications
                    a strictly objective representation of the facts of animal structure and of the
                    structural relationships of animals to one another capable of demonstration. The
                    groups within groups adopted for this purpose were necessarily wanting in
                    symmetry: the whole system presented a strangely irregular character. From time
                    to time efforts were made by those who believed that the Creator must have
                    followed a symmetrical system in his production of animals to force one or other
                    artificial, neatly balanced <pb break="no"

                    world. The last of these was that of Louis Agassiz (<hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    Classification,</hi> 1859), who, whilst surveying all previous classifications,
                    propounded a scheme of his own, in which, as well as in the criticisms he
                    applies to other systems, the leading notion is that sub-kingdoms, classes,
                    orders, and families have a real existence, and that it is possible to ascertain
                    and distinguish characters which are of class value, others which are only of
                    ordinal value, and so on, so that the classes of one sub-kingdom should on

                    another sub-kingdom, and the orders of any one class similarly should be so
                    taken as to be of equal value with those of another class, and have been
                    actually so created.</p>
                <p>The whole position was changed by the acquiescence, which became universal, in
                    the doctrine of Darwin. That doctrine took some few years to produce its effect,
                    but it became evident at once to those who accepted Darwinism that <hi
                    rend="italic">the</hi> natural classification of animals, after which collectors
                    and anatomists, morphologists, philosophers, and embryologists had been so long
                    striving was nothing more nor less than a genealogical tree, with breaks and
                    gaps of various extent in its record. The facts of the relationships of animals
                    to one another, which had been treated as the outcome of an inscrutable law by
                    most zoologists and glibly explained by the transcendental morphologists, were
                    amongst the most powerful arguments in support of Darwin’s theory, since they,
                    together with all other vital phenomena, received a sufficient explanation
                    through it. It is to be noted that, whilst the zoological system took the form
                    of a genealogical tree, with main stem and numerous diverging branches, the
                    actual form of that tree, its limitation to a certain number of branches
                    corresponding to a limited number of divergencies in structure, came to be
                    regarded as the necessary consequence of the operation of the physico-chemical
                    laws of the universe, and it was recognized that the ultimate explanation of
                    that limitation is to be found only in the constitution of matter itself.</p>
                <p>The first naturalist to put into practical form the consequences of the new
                    theory, in so far as it affected zoological classification, was Ernst Haeckel of
                    Jena (b. 1834), who in 1866, seven years after the publication of Darwin’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Origin of Species,</hi> published his suggestive <hi rend="italic"
                    >Generelle Morphologie.</hi> Haeckel introduced into classification a number of
                    terms intended to indicate the branchings of a genealogical tree. The whole
                    “system” or scheme of classification was termed a genealogical tree (<hi
                    rend="italic">Stammbaum)</hi>; the main branches were termed “phyla,” their
                    branchings “subphyla”; the great branches of the sub-phyla were termed “cladi,”
                    and the “cladi” divided into “classes,” these into sub-classes, these into
                    legions, legions into orders, orders into sub-orders, sub-orders into tribes,
                    tribes into families, families into genera, genera into species. Additional
                    branchings could be indicated by similar terms where necessary. There was no
                    attempt in Haeckel’s use of these terms to make them exactly or more than
                    approximately equal in significance; such attempts were clearly futile and
                    unimportant where the purpose was the exhibition of lines of descent, and where
                    no natural equality of groups was to be expected <hi rend="italic">ex
                    hypothesi.</hi> Haeckel’s classification of 1866 was naturally enough only a
                    first attempt. In the edition of the <hi rend="italic">Natürliche
                    Schöpfungsgeschichte</hi> published in 1868, he made a great advance in his
                    genealogical classification, since he now introduced the results of the
                    extraordinary activity in the study of embryology which followed on the
                    publication of the <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species.</hi></p>
                <p>The pre-Darwinian systematists since the time of Von Baer had attached very great
                    importance to embryological facts, holding that the stages in an animal’s
                    development were often more significant of its true affinities than its adult
                    structure. Von Baer had gained unanimous support for his dictum, “Die
                    Entwickelungsgeschichte ist der wahre Lichtträger für Untersuchungen über
                    organische Körper.” Thus J. Müller’s studies on the larval forms of Echinoderms
                    and the discoveries of Vaughan Thompson were appreciated. But it was only after
                    Darwin that the cell-theory of Schwann was extended to the embryology of the
                    animal kingdom generally, and that the knowledge of the development of an animal
                    became a knowledge of the way in which the millions of cells of which its body
                    is composed take their origin by fission from a smaller number of cells, and
                    these at last from the single egg-cell. Kölliker <hi rend="italic">{Development
                    of Cephalopods,</hi> 1844), Remak <hi rend="italic">{Development of the
                    Frog,</hi> 1850), and others had laid the foundations of this knowledge in
                    isolated examples; but it was Kowalewsky, by his accounts of the development of
                    Ascidians and of <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> (1866), who really made
                    zoologists see that a strict and complete cellular embryology of animals was as
                    necessary and feasible a factor in the comprehension of their relationships as
                    at the beginning of the century the coarse anatomy had been shown to be by
                    Cuvier. Kowalewsky’s work appeared between the dates of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Generelle Morphologie</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Schöpfungsgeschichte.</hi>
                    Haeckel himself, with his pupil Miklucho-Maclay, had in the meantime made
                    studies on the growth from the egg of Sponges,—studies which resulted in the
                    complete separation of the unicellular or equicellular <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protozoa</hi> from the Sponges, hitherto confounded with them. It is this
                    introduction of the consideration of cell-structure and celldevelopment which,
                    subsequently to the establishment of Darwinism, has most profoundly modified the
                    views of systematists, and led in conjunction with the genealogical doctrine to
                    the greatest activity in research,—an activity which culminated in the work
                    (1873-82) of F. M. Balfour, and produced the profoundest modifications in
                    classification.</p>
                <p>Haeckel’s earlier pedigree is worth comparing with his second effort, as showing
                    the beginning of the influence just noted. The second pedigree is as follows

                <p>In representing pictorially the groups of the animal kingdom as the branches of a
                    tree, it becomes obvious that a distinction may be drawn, not merely between the
                    individual main branches, but further as to the level at which they are given
                    off from the main stem, so that one branch or set of branches may be marked off
                    as belonging to an earlier or lower level than another set of branches; and the
                    same plan may be adopted with regard to the clades, classes, and smaller
                    branches. The term “grade” was introduced by Lankester<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Notes on Embryology and Classification,” in
                    <hi rend="italic">Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci.,</hi> 1877.</p></note> to indicate
                    this giving off of branches at a higher or lower, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a
                    later or earlier, level of a main stem. The mechanism for the statement of the
                    genealogical relationships of the groups of the animal kingdom was thus
                    completed. Renewed study of every group was the result of the acceptance of the
                    genealogical idea and of the recognition of the importance of cellular
                    embryology. On the one hand, the true method of arriving at a knowledge of the
                    genealogical tree was recognized as lying chiefly in attacking the problem of
                    the genealogical relationships of the smallest twigs of the tree, and proceeding
                    from them to the larger branches. Special studies of small families or orders of
                    animals with this object in view were taken in hand by many zoologists. On the
                    other hand, a survey of the facts of cellular embryology which were accumulated
                    in regard to a variety of classes within a few years of Kowalewsky’s work led to
                    a generalization, independently arrived at by Haeckel and Lankester, to the
                    effect that a lower grade of animals may be distinguished, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protozoa</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Plastidozoa,</hi> which consist either of
                    single cells or colonies of equiformal cells, and a higher grade, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Metazoa</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Enterozoa,</hi> in which the
                    egg-cell by “cell division” gives rise to two layers of cells, the endoderm and
                    the ectoderm, surrounding a primitive digestive chamber, the archenteron. Of
                    these latter, two grades were further distinguished by Lankester,—those which
                    remain possessed of a single archenteric cavity and of two primary cell-layers
                    (the <hi rend="italic">Coelentera</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Diploblastica),</hi>
                    and those which by nipping off the archenteron give rise to two cavities, the
                    coelom or body-cavity and the metenteron or gut <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Coelomata</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Triploblastica).</hi> To the primitive
                    two-cell-layered form, the hypothetical ancestor of all <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metazoa</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Enterozoa,</hi> Haeckel gave the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Gastraea;</hi> the embryonic form which represents in the
                    individual growth from the egg this ancestral condition he called a “gastrula.”
                    The term “diblastula” has more recently been adopted in England for the gastrula
                    of Haeckel. The tracing of the exact mode of development, cell by cell, of the
                    diblastula, the coelom, and the various tissues of examples of all classes of
                    animals has been pursued during the last twenty years with immense activity and
                    increasing instrumental facilities, and is still in progress.</p>
                <p>Two names in connexion with post-Darwinian taxonomy and the ideas connected with
                    it require brief mention here. Fritz Miiller, by his studies on <hi
                    rend="italic">Crustacea (Für Darwin,</hi> 1864), showed the way in which
                    genealogical theory may be applied to the minute study of a limited group. He is
                    also responsible for the formulation of an important principle, called by
                    Haeckel “the biogenetic fundamental law,” viz., that an animal in its growth
                    from the egg to the adult condition tends to pass through a series of stages
                    which are recapitulative of the stages through which its ancestry has passed in
                    the historical development of the species from a primitive form; or, more
                    shortly, that the development of the individual (ontogeny) is an epitome of the
                    development of the race (phylogeny). Pre-Darwinian zoologists had been aware of
                    the class of facts thus interpreted by Fritz Müller, but the authoritative view
                    on the subject had been that there is a parallelism between <hi rend="italic"
                    >(a)</hi> the series of forms which occur in individual development, (δ) the
                    series of existing forms from lower to higher, and (c) the series of forms which
                    succeed one another in the strata of the earth’s crust, whilst an explanation of
                    this parallelism was either not attempted, or was illusively offered in the
                    shape of a doctrine of harmony of plan in creation. It was the application of
                    Fritz Müller’s law of recapitulation which gave the chief stimulus to recent
                    embryological investigations; and, though it is now recognized that
                    “recapitulation” is vastly and bewilderingly modified by special adaptations in
                    every case, yet the principle has served, and still serves, as a guide of great
                    value.</p>
                <p>Another important factor in the present condition of zoological knowledge as
                    represented by classification is the doctrine of degeneration propounded by
                    Anton Dohm. Lamarck believed in a single progressive series of forms, whilst
                    Cuvier introduced the conception of branches. The first post-Darwinian
                    systematists naturally and without reflexion accepted the idea that existing
                    simpler forms represent stages in the gradual progress of development,—are in
                    fact survivors from past ages which have retained the exact grade of development
                    which their ancestors had reached in past ages. The assumption made was that
                    (with the rare exception of parasites) all the change of structure through which
                    the successive generations of animals have passed has been one of progressive
                    elaboration. It is Dohrn’s merit to have pointed out<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ursprung der
                    Wïrbelthiere,</hi> Leipsic, 1875; and Lankester, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Degeneration,</hi> London, 1880.</p></note> that this assumption is not
                    warranted, and that degeneration or progressive simplification of structure may
                    have, and in many lines certainly has, taken place, as well as progressive
                    elaboration and continuous maintenance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo.</hi>
                    The introduction of this conception necessarily has had most important effect in
                    the attempt to unravel the genealogical affinities of animals. It renders the
                    task a more complicated one; at the same time it removes some serious
                    difficulties and throws a flood of light on every group of the animal
                    kingdom.</p>
                <p>One result of the introduction of the new conceptions dating from Darwin has been
                    a healthy reaction from that attitude of mind which led to the regarding of the
                    classes and orders recognized by authoritative zoologists as sacred institutions
                    which were beyond the criticism of ordinary men. That state of mind was due to
                    the fact that the groupings so recognized did not profess to be simply the
                    result of scientific reasoning, but were necessarily regarded as the expressions
                    of the “insight” of some more or less gifted persons into a plan or system which
                    had been arbitrarily chosen by the Creator. Consequently there was a tinge of
                    theological dogmatism about the whole matter. To deny the Linnaean, or later the
                    Cuvierian, classes was very much like denying the Mosaic cosmogony. At the
                    present time systematic zoology is entirely free from any such prejudices, and
                    the Linnaean taint which is annarent <pb break="no"

                    as finally expunged.</p>

                <p>We have now traced the history of the morphography of animals so as to show that
                    increasingly in successive epochs independent branches of knowledge have been
                    brought to bear on the consideration of the main problem, namely, the
                    discrimination of the kinds and the relations to one another of animal forms.
                    Before glancing at the history of the remaining branches of zoological science,
                    which have had an independent history whilst ultimately contributory to taxonomy
                    and morphography, it may be briefly pointed out that the accumulation of
                    knowledge with regard to the distribution of animal forms on the earth’s surface
                    and in the seas has progressed simultaneously with the discrimination of the
                    mere forms of the species themselves, as has also the knowledge derived from
                    fossilized remains as to the characters of former inhabitants of the globe. Both
                    these subdivisions of morphography have contributed to the establishment of
                    Darwinism,—the one (palaeontology) by direct evidence of organic evolution in
                    time, the other (zoo-geography) in a more indirect way.</p>
                <p>Alfred Russell Wallace stands prominently forward as a naturalist-traveller who
                    by his observations, chiefly on Lepidopterous Insects, in both South America and
                    the Malay Archipelago, was led to the conclusion that a production of new
                    species is actually going on, and that, too, by means of a process of natural
                    selection of favourable variations. Wallace and Darwin, who each recognized
                    cordially and fully the other’s work, laid their views before the Linnean
                    Society on the same day in 1859.</p>
                <p>The facts of the geographical distribution of animals were systematized, and
                    great zoo-geographical provinces first clearly recognized, by P. L. Sclater in
                    1857. The application of the Darwinian theory to the facts tabulated by Sclater,
                    combined with a knowledge of the distribution of animals in past geological
                    periods, has led to a full explanation of the migrations of terrestrial animals,
                    and has furnished a striking corroboration of the sufficiency of the doctrine of
                    organic evolution, as reformed by Darwin, to account for all the phenomena of
                    zoology.</p>
                <p>The study of the marine fauna by means of the dredge and trawl had been
                    enthusiastically prosecuted by British, French, and Scandinavian naturalists in
                    the two decades before Darwin’s book; the collection of forms, the discovery of
                    new species, and the recording of their bathymetrical and local distribution had
                    produced a great mass of knowledge through the labours of E. Forbes,
                    Gwyn-Jeffreys, Sars, Quatrefages, Norman, and others. The post-Darwinian
                    developments of this line of inquiry have been two. In the first place, dredging
                    and trawling have been extended by the aid of steamships of the Norwegian,
                    British, American, French, and Italian navies into greater depths than were
                    previously supposed to contain living things. New species and genera, and a vast
                    extension of knowledge as to distribution, have been the outcome of these
                    expeditions, connected with the names of G. O. Sars and Daniellsen in Norway, of
                    Alex. Agassiz in America, and of Carpenter and Wyville Thomson in Great Britain.
                    It is worthy of note that the practical demand for sounding the Atlantic in
                    connexion with the laying of the first deep-sea telegraphcable is what led to
                    these explorations, the first recognition of life at these great depths in the
                    ocean being due to Dr Wallich, who accompanied a sounding expedition in 1860 to
                    the North Atlantic, and to Prof. Fleeming Jenkin, who in the same year acted as
                    engineer in raising the submarine cable between Sardinia and Africa, upon which
                    living corals were found. In the second place, the study of marine zoology has,
                    since the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species,</hi> been
                    found to require more complete arrangements in the form of laboratories and
                    aquaria than the isolated vacation student could bring with him to the seaside.
                    Seaside laboratories have come into existence: the first was founded in France
                    by Coste (1859) at Concarneau (Brittany), again with a practical end in view,
                    viz., the study of food-fishes with an aim to pisciculture. The demand for a
                    knowledge of the embryology of all classes of animals, and for further facts as
                    to the structure and lifehistory of the minuter microscopic or very delicate
                    forms of marine life, is what has determined the multiplication of these marine
                    “stations.” The largest and best supported pecuniarily is that founded at Naples
                    by Anton Dohm in 1872; others exist at Trieste, Villefranche, Cette, and at New
                    Haven and Beaufort in the United States, whilst a large laboratory, on a scale
                    to compare with that at Naples, has this year (1888) been opened at Plymouth by
                    the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>Another result of the stimulus given to zoological research by Darwin’s work is
                    the undertaking of voyages to distant lands by skilled anatomists for the
                    purpose of studying on the spot, and with all the advantages of abundant and
                    living material, the structure, and especially the embryology, of rare and
                    exceptionally interesting forms of animal life. In the pre-Darwinian period of
                    this century zoologists who were convinced of the importance of anatomical and
                    embryological study were still content to study specimens immersed in spirit and
                    brought home, often imperfectly preserved, by unskilled collectors, or to
                    confine their attention to such species as could be procured in Europe. Before
                    Cuvier, as we have already pointed out, attention was, with rare exceptions,
                    limited to the dried skeletons and external forms of animals. Now, however, the
                    enterprising zoologist goes to the native land of an interesting animal, there
                    to study it as fully as possible. The most important of these voyages has been
                    that of W. H. Caldwell of Cambridge to Australia (1885-86) for the purpose of
                    studying the embryology of the <hi rend="italic">Monotrema</hi> and of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ceratodus,</hi> the fish-like <hi rend="italic">Dipnoon,</hi>
                    which has resulted in the discovery that the <hi rend="italic">Monotrema</hi>
                    are oviparous. Similarly Adam Sedgwick proceeded to the Cape in order to study
                    <hi rend="italic">Peripatus,</hi> Bateson to the coast of Maryland to study <hi
                    rend="italic">Balanoglossus,</hi> and the brothers Sarassin to Ceylon to
                    investigate the embryology of the <hi rend="italic">Coecilia.</hi></p>
                <p>The task of the zoologist has changed and developed in every succeeding period.
                    Pure morphography has long ceased to be a chief line of research; and now even
                    the preoccupation produced by the addition to it of the study of cellular
                    embryology is about to undergo a modification by the demand for knowledge of the

                <p>The development of that knowledge of the structure of the human body, and of the
                    chemical and physical processes going on in it, which is necessary for the
                    purposes of the medical art forms a distinct history, which has both influenced
                    and been influenced by that of other branches of zoology. The study of the
                    structure and composition of the body of man and of the animals nearest to him
                    was until fifty years ago one with the inquiry into the activities of those
                    parts, and indeed the separation of anatomy and physiology has never been really
                    carried out. For convenience of teaching, the description of the coarser anatomy
                    of the human body has been in modern universities placed in the hands of a
                    special professor, theoretically condemned to occupy himself with the mere
                    formal details of structure, whilst the professor of physiology has usually
                    retained what is called “microscopic anatomy,” and necessarily occupies himself
                    with as much structural anatomy as is required for a due description of the
                    functions of organs and the properties of tissues. It would seem that in our
                    medical schools and universities these arrangements<pb break="no"

                    should be re-united and subdivided as follows,—(1) physiology with anatomy in
                    relation to physiology, (2) anatomy in relation to surgery and medical
                    diagnosis,—the former being a science, the latter a piece of technical training
                    in rule of thumb.</p>
                <p>Physiological anatomy or anatomical physiology has its beginnings in Aristotle
                    and other observers of antiquity. The later Graeco-Roman and the Arabian
                    physicians carried on the traditional knowledge and added to it. Galen dominated
                    the Middle Ages. The modern development begins with Harvey and with the Italian
                    school in which he studied. Its great names are Fabricius of Acquapendente
                    (1537-1619), Vesalius (1514-1564), Eustachius (c. 1500- 1574), Riolan
                    (1577-1657), Severino (1580-1656). The history of the discovery of the
                    circulation of the blood and of the controversies connected with it gives an
                    interesting and sufficient presentation of the anatomico-physiological knowledge
                    of the period (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Harvey).</hi> The foundation of the
                    scientific academies and the records of their publications furnish thenceforward
                    a picture of the progress in this study. As an early anatomist Willis
                    (1621-1675), professor of physic in Oxford, deserves notice for his work on the
                    anatomy of the human brain, the plates for which were drawn by young Christopher
                    Wren, the prodigy of Oxford common-rooms, who later built St Paul’s Cathedral.
                    The Royal Society, in its early days when Wren was a fellow, met at Gresham
                    College whenever the professor of physic there could obtain a human body for
                    dissection, and amongst its earliest records are the memoirs of Tyson on the
                    anatomy of the Chimpanzee and the experiments on transfusion of blood,
                    extirpation of the spleen, and such like inquiries.</p>
                <p>Marcello Malpighi (1628-1694) and Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) were the
                    first to introduce the microscope into anatomical research. Malpighi first used
                    the injection of blood-vessels on a large scale, and moreover is to be credited
                    with having first conceived that there is a definite relation of the structure
                    of lower kinds of animals to that of higher and more elaborate kinds, and that
                    this relation is one of gradual transition, so that lower animals are not to be
                    regarded as isolated and arbitrary existences, but are really simpler
                    exhibitions of the same kind of structure and mechanism which occurs in higher
                    animals. It is this conception which later developed into the theory of an
                    actual transmutative development of lower into higher organisms. Leeuwenhoek
                    discovered the red blood corpuscles of Vertebrates, saw the circulation in the
                    capillaries of the Frog’s foot, described the fibrillar structure and
                    cross-striping of muscular fibre, the tubular structure of dentine, the scales
                    of the epidermis, the fibres of the lens, and the spermatozoa, these last having
                    been independently discovered at Leyden in 1677 by Ludwig Ham of Stettin. The
                    spermatozoa were regarded by the “animalculists” as the fully formed but minute
                    young which had to be received in the egg, in order to be nourished and increase
                    in size, and were hailed as a decisive blow to Harvey’s doctrine of epigenesis
                    and his dictum “omne vivum ex ovo.” Albrecht von Haller was the champion of the
                    so-called “evolutionists” in the 18th century, better called
                    “praeformationists.” Haller wrote, “There is no such thing as development! No
                    part of the animal body is made before another; all are simultaneously created.”
                    A corollary of this doctrine was that the germ contains the germs of the next
                    generation, and these of the next, and so <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum.</hi>
                    It was calculated that Eve at her creation thus contained within her 200,000
                    millions of human germs. This was the view of the “ovists,” who regarded the egg
                    as the true germ, whilst the “animalculists,” who regarded the spermatozoon as
                    the essential germ, would have substituted Adam for Eve in the above
                    calculation. These fanciful conceptions —containing as they do a share of
                    important truth—were opposed by Caspar Friedrich Wolff, who in his doctorate
                    dissertation (1759) maintained that the germ is a structureless particle, and
                    acquires its structure by “epigenesis” or gradual development. Wolff has proved
                    to be nearer the truth than Haller; but modern conceptions as to the molecular
                    structure of the egg-protoplasm point to a complexity as great as that imagined
                    by the evolutionists. Later it was maintained that the spermatozoa are parasitic
                    animalcules, and this view prevailed for 150 years, so that in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Physiology</hi> of Johann Müller (1842) we read, “Whether the
                    spermatozoa are parasitic animalcules or living parts of the animal in which
                    they occur cannot at present be stated with certainty.”</p>
                <p>Physiology in the 18th century could only proceed by means of inferences from
                    purely anatomical observation, aided by imaginative conceptions which had no
                    real basis. The explanation of the processes of life in the animal body was
                    waiting for that progress in the knowledge of physics and chemistry which at
                    last arrived, and gave a new impulse to investigation. Albrecht von Haller
                    (1708-1777) was the first to apply experimental methods to the determination of
                    the functions of the various organs made known by anatomists, and from him we
                    may trace a bifurcation in the tendencies of medical men who occupied themselves
                    with the study of the structure and functions of the animal organism. The one
                    class proceeded more and more in the direction of comparative anatomy, the other
                    in the direction of exact analysis and measurement of both the structure and
                    properties of the organs of Vertebrate animals allied to man and of man
                    himself.</p>
                <p>John Hunter (1728-1793) is the most striking figure of this epoch in the relation
                    of medicine to general zoological progress; the preservation of his museum in
                    Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London, by the combined action of the state and the Royal
                    College of Surgeons, is an abiding record of the historical progress of
                    biological science. Hunter collected, dissected, and described not only higher
                    but lower animals, with the view of arriving at a knowledge of the function of
                    organs by the most extensive and systematic survey of their modifications in all
                    kinds of animals. His purpose was that of the physiologist and medical man, but
                    he made great contributions to the general knowledge of animal structure. The
                    same class of investigations, when taken up by Cuvier from the point of view of
                    systematic zoology and morphology, led to a reconstruction of classification and
                    laid the foundation of anatomical zoology. Hunter was the younger brother of
                    William Hunter, who also formed an important museum, still preserved in Glasgow.
                    Hunter classified the organs of animals into those which subserve the
                    preservation of the individual, those which subserve the preservation of the
                    species, and those which are the means of relation with the outer world, and he
                    arranged his museum of dissections and preparations on this plan.</p>
                <p>The great progress of chemistry at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the
                    19th century was followed by an application of chemical laws and chemical
                    methods to the study of animal life. Curiously enough, as showing how deeply
                    interwoven are the various lines of scientific progress, Priestley in his
                    discovery of oxygen was as much concerned in the study of a chlorophyll-bearing
                    <hi rend="italic">Protozoon, Euglena viridis,</hi> as in that of the red oxide
                    of mercury; and the interest in “vital spirits” as a physiological factor was an
                    important stimulus to those researches which produced modern chemical
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p>The purely anatomical side of physiological progress is marked in the beginning
                    of the 19th century by the work <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0865-0816"/> of Bichat (1771-1802), who distinguished by
                    naked-eye characters the different structural materials of which the organs of
                    man and the higher animals are built, and thus founded in first outline the
                    science of histology. By the end of the first quarter of this century it had
                    become clear to the minds of the anatomico-physiological students of animal life
                    that the animal body was subject to the same physical laws as other matter,
                    although it was still held that some additional and mysterious agent—so-called
                    “vitality ”—was at work in living bodies. It had become clear that animal
                    material could be investigated chemically, and that the processes of digestion,
                    assimilation, respiration, and secretion were chemical processes.</p>
                <p>To a considerable extent the chemical composition and properties of the tissues,
                    and the chemical nature of the various changes of life and of putrefaction after
                    death, had been investigated, but one step was yet to be taken which brings the
                    study of ultimate structure, chemical activity, form, and the formation of form
                    to a single focus. This was taken by Theodore Schwann (1810-1881), who in 1839
                    published his epoch-making cell-theory. Schwann was a pupil of Johann Müller,
                    and there can be little doubt that the ideas of the pupil are to be credited in
                    some measure to the master. Schwann took up the thread of microscopic
                    investigation which had been sedulously pursued by a distinct line of students
                    since the days of Hook and Leeuwenhoek, and had resulted in a general doctrine
                    among botanists of the cellular structure of all the parts of plants. Schwann
                    showed not only that plants are uniformly built up by these corpuscular units
                    (of which Robert Browne in 1833 had described the peculiar nucleated structure),
                    but that all animal tissues are also so built up. That, however, was not
                    Schwann’s chief point. The cell-theory for which he is famous is this, that the
                    substance of the individual cell is the seat of those chemical processes which
                    seen <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> we call life, and that the differences in
                    the properties of the different tissues and organs of animals and plants depend
                    on a difference in the chemical and physical activity of the constituent cells,
                    resulting in a difference in the form of the cells and in a concomitant
                    difference of activity. Schwann thus pointed to the microscopic cell-unit as the
                    thing to be studied in order to arrive at a true knowledge of the processes of
                    life and the significance of form. In founding the study of cell-substance (or
                    protoplasm, as it was subsequently called by Max Schultze in 1861, adopting the
                    name used by botanists for vegetable cell-contents) Schwann united two lines of
                    inquiry, viz., that of minute investigation of structure and development and
                    that of zoochemistry and zoo-physics. He spent a large part of the next forty
                    years in an attempt to penetrate further into the structure of cell-substance;
                    he hoped to be able to find in cell-substance ultimate visible molecules, a
                    knowledge of the arrangement and characters of which would explain the varying
                    properties of protoplasm.</p>
                <p>It is not a little remarkable that Schwann, who thus brought about the union of
                    physiological and morphological study by his conception of cell-substance,
                    should also have been the initiator of that special kind of experimental
                    investigation of the physical properties of tissues by the exact methods used by
                    physicists which, by the aid of the kymographion, the thermo-electric pile, and
                    the galvanometer, has been so largely pursued during the last thirty years in
                    our physiological laboratories. It is perhaps less surprising that Schwann, who
                    had so vivid a conception of the activity and potentialities of the cell-unit,
                    should have been the discoverer of the immensely important fact that
                    putrefaction and fermentation are not the consequences of death but of life, and
                    that without the presence of living <hi rend="italic">Bacteria</hi> putrefaction
                    does not occur, whilst he also is the discoverer of the fact that the yeast
                    which causes alcoholic fermentation is a mass of unicellular living
                    organisms.</p>
                <p>From Schwann’s time onward the cell became more and more the point of observation
                    and experiment in the progress of both morphography and physiology. It was soon
                    shown, chiefly through Kölliker and Remak, that all cells originate by fission
                    from pre-existing cells,—a fact unknown to Schwann,—and the doctrine “omnis
                    cellula e cellula” was established. It was also demonstrated that the Mammalian
                    egg discovered by Von Baer was a typical nucleated cell, and that all animals,
                    and plants also (this generalization took thirty years to establish), take their
                    origin from an egg, which is in essence and in fact a single nucleated cell. The
                    doctrine of Harvey, “omne vivum ex ovo,” thus received its most ample
                    justification. The study of “growth from the egg” became necessarily a study of
                    the multiplication by fission of the egg-cell and its fission-products, their
                    arrangement in layers, and the chemical metamorphosis of their substance and
                    exudations. This study, as well as the allied investigation of the
                    cell-structure of the adult tissues, was immensely facilitated by methods of
                    hardening, staining, section-cutting, and clarifying which grew up after
                    Schwann’s time, and have their present highest development in the automatic
                    microtome of Caldwell, which can be worked by a motor, and delivers consecutive
                    sections of animal tissues or embryos <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi

                    ribbons, ready for examination with the microscope, at the rate of one hundred
                    or more per minute. Stricker of Vienna was the first to embed embryos in waxy
                    material for the purpose of cutting thin sections of them, about twenty-five
                    years ago, and R. Leuckart of Leipsic was subsequently the first to employ this
                    method in the study of the structure of small <hi rend="italic"
                    >Invertebrata.</hi></p>
                <p>The knowledge of the anatomical facts of cellular development and cellular
                    structure necessarily gave immensely increased precision to the notion of
                    gradation of structure in the animal series from simple to complex, and rendered
                    Darwin’s doctrine the more readily accepted. It was not, however, until after
                    Darwin’s date (1859) that the existence of unicellular animals was fully
                    admitted, and the general facts of cellular embryology established throughout
                    the animal kingdom.</p>
                <p>Similarly cellular physiology, by establishing the conception of a simple
                    optically homogeneous cell-substance as the seat of the activities which we call
                    “life,” rendered it possible to accept the suggestion of a simple “substance of
                    life” which might have been evolved from simpler nonliving matter by natural
                    processes depending on physical and chemical laws. It is noteworthy that Darwin
                    himself appears not to have been influenced directly by any such physiological
                    or chemico-physical doctrine as to “protoplasm” or cell-substance. Nevertheless
                    the way was prepared for the reception of Darwin’s theory by this state of
                    physiological knowledge.</p>
                <p>The word “protoplasm” requires a little further notice. Protoplasm was applied by

                    therein both the general thinner material and the nucleus. It is, as Roscoe
                    remarked at Manchester <hi rend="italic">(Brit. Ass. Address,</hi> 1887), a
                    structure and not a chemical body. Nevertheless gradually physiologists have
                    come to use the word “protoplasm” for <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the chemical
                    substances of which Schultze’s protoplasm is a structural mixture—namely, that
                    highest point in the chemical elaboration of the molecule which is attained
                    within the protoplasm, and up to which some of the chemical bodies present are
                    tending, whilst others are degradation products resulting from a downward
                    metamorphosis of portions of it. This intangible, unstable, all-pervading<pb

                    identified with any visibly separable part of the cell-substance, which consists
                    of a hyaline denser network of excessive tenuity, of a less dense hyaline
                    liquid, and of finest and less fine granules of varying chemical nature. This
                    “critical” substance, sometimes called “true protoplasm,” should assuredly be
                    recognized by a distinct name “plasmo-gen,” whilst protoplasm retains its

                <p>The serious and broadly-based study of bionomics which was introduced by Darwin,
                    and in his hands gave rise to the doctrine of natural selection, by which the
                    hypothesis of the origin of species by gradual transmutation in the natural
                    process of descent from ancestral forms was established as a scientific
                    doctrine, can hardly be said to have had any history. Buffon (1707-1788) alone
                    among the greater writers of the three past centuries emphasized that view of
                    living things which we call “bionomics.” Buffon deliberately opposed himself to
                    the mere exposition of the structural resemblances and differences of animals,
                    and, disregarding classification, devoted his treatise on natural history to a
                    consideration of the habits of animals and their adaptations to their
                    surroundings, whilst a special volume was devoted by him to the subject of
                    reproduction. In special memoirs on this or that animal, and in a subordinate
                    way in systematic works, material is to be found helping to build up a knowledge
                    of bionomics, but Buffon is the only prominent writer who can be accorded
                    historic rank in this study.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The main literary sources made use of by Darwin are the
                    magazines and treatises of horticulturists, farmers, pigeon-fanciers, and the
                    like, in fact what is comprised in the <hi rend="italic">Field</hi>
                    newspaper.</p></note> The special study of man in these relations—such as is
                    concerned with the statistics of population—must be considered as having
                    contributed very importantly to Darwin’s wider study of bionomics in general.
                    The work of Malthus <hi rend="italic">On Population (</hi> 1798 <hi
                    rend="italic">)</hi> exercised the most important influence on Darwin’s thought,
                    as he himself tells us, and led him to give attention to the facts of animal
                    population, and so to discover the great moving cause of natural selection—the
                    struggle for existence. Darwin may be said to have founded the science of
                    bionomics, and at the same time to have given new stimulus and new direction to
                    morphography, physiology, and plasmology, by uniting them as contributories to
                    one common biological doctrine—the doctrine of organic evolution— itself but a
                    part of the wider doctrine of universal evolution based on the laws of physics
                    and chemistry.</p>
                <p>The full influence of Darwin’s work upon the progress and direction of zoological
                    study has not yet been seen. The <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> result has
                    been, as pointed out above, a reconstruction of the classification of animals
                    upon a genealogical basis, and an investigation of the individual development of
                    animals in relation to the steps of their gradual building up by cell-division,
                    with a view to obtaining evidence of their genetic relationships. On the other
                    hand, the studies which occupied Darwin himself so largely subsequently to the
                    publication of the <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species,</hi> viz., the
                    explanation of animal (and vegetable) mechanism, colouring, habits, &amp;c., as
                    advantageous to the species or to its ancestors—in fact, the new teleology,—has
                    not yet been so vigorously pursued as it must be hereafter. The most important
                    work in this direction has been done by Fritz Müller <hi rend="italic">(Fur
                    Darwin),</hi> by Herman Müller <hi rend="italic">(Fertilization of Plants by
                    Insects),</hi> and by August Weismann (memoirs translated by Meldola). Here and
                    there observations are from time to time published, but no large progress has
                    yet been made, probably on account of the fact that animals are exceedingly
                    difficult to keep under observation, and that there is no provision in
                    universities and like institutions for the pursuit of these inquiries or even
                    for their academic representation. More has been done with plants than with
                    animals in this way since Darwin, probably owing to the same cause which has,
                    ever since the revival of learning, given botany a real advantage over zoology,
                    namely, the existence of “physick” gardens, now become “botanical” gardens, and
                    the greater ease of management, experiment, and observation in the case of
                    plants than in that of animals. It is true that zoological gardens have existed
                    for the last fifty years in all large European cities, but these have always
                    been conducted with a view to popular exhibition; and, even where scientific
                    influences have been brought to bear on their management, they have been those
                    of the morphographer and systematist rather than of the bionomist. Moreover,
                    zoological gardens have never been part of the equipment of the university
                    professor of zoology, as it may be hoped in future will be the case. The
                    foundation of marine biological laboratories under the control of scientific
                    zoologists offers a prospect of true bionomic observation and experiment on an
                    increased scale in the near future, and, were such laboratories founded in our
                    universities and provided with the necessary appliances for keeping terrestrial
                    and freshwater animals, as well as marine forms, alive and under observation in
                    conditions resembling as nearly as possible those of nature, a step would have
                    been taken towards carrying on the study of bionomics which cannot long be
                    delayed. It seems to be even more important that the academic curriculum of
                    zoology should not, by mere mechanical adhesion to the old lines of
                    morphography, and experimental research on the chemical and physical properties
                    of tissues and organs, confine the attention and training of young students to
                    what are now, comparatively speaking, the less productive lines of research.</p>
                <p>If we turn to the other branch of bionomics, that con cerned with the laws of
                    variation and heredity (thremmatology), we find that since Darwin, and
                    independently of his own work, there has been a more obvious progress than in
                    teleology. In the first place, the continued study of human population has
                    thrown additional light on some of the questions involved, whilst the progress
                    of microscopical research in the hands of Bütschli, Hertwig, Balfour, and August
                    Weismann promises to give us a clear foundation as to the structural facts
                    connected with the origin of the egg-cell and sperm-cell and the process of
                    fertilization. This is not the fitting place in which to give a sketch of the
                    doctrines and hypotheses of thremmatology. They may be gathered from Darwin’s
                    writings, more especially the <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Animals and Plants under Domestications.</hi><note anchored="true"

                    bionomics since Darwin’s own writings, and at the same time touches questions of
                    fundamental interest. The matter strictly relates to the consideration of the
                    “causes of variation,” and is as follows.</p>
                <p>The fact of variation is a familiar one. No two animals, even of the same brood,
                    are alike: whilst exhibiting a close similarity to their parents, they yet
                    present differences, sometimes very marked differences, from their parents and
                    from one another. Lamarck had put forward the hypothesis that structural
                    alterations acquired by a parent in the course of its life are transmitted to
                    the offspring, and that, as these structural alterations are acquired by an
                    animal or plant in consequence of the direct action of the environment, the
                    offspring inheriting them would as a consequence not unfrequently start with a
                    greater fitness for those conditions than its parents started with. In its turn,
                    being operated upon by the conditions of life, it would acquire a greater
                    development of the same modification, which it would in turn transmit to its
                    offspring. In the course of several generations, Lamarck argued, a structural
                    alteration amounting to such difference as we call “specific” might be thus
                    acquired. The familiar illustration of Lamarck’s hypothesis is that of the
                    giraffe, whose long neck might, he suggested, have been acquired by the efforts
                    of a primitively short-necked race of herbivores, who stretched their necks to
                    reach the foliage of trees in a land where grass was deficient, the effort
                    producing a distinct elongation in the neck of each generation, which was then
                    transmitted to the next. This process is known as “direct adaptation;” and there
                    is no doubt that such structural adaptations are acquired by an animal in the
                    course of its life. Whether such acquired characters can be transmitted to the
                    next generation is a separate question. It was not proved by Lamarck that they
                    can be, and, indeed, never has been proved by actual observation. Nevertheless
                    it has been assumed, and also indirectly argued, that such acquired characters
                    <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be transmitted. Darwin’s great merit was that he
                    excluded from his theory of development any <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi>
                    assumption of the transmission of acquired characters. He pointed to the
                    admitted fact of congenital variation, and he showed that these variations to
                    all intents and purposes have nothing to do with any characters acquired by the
                    parents, but are arbitrary and, so to speak, non-significant. Their causes are
                    extremely difficult to trace in detail, but it appears that they are largely due
                    to a “shaking up” of the living matter which constitutes the fertilized germ or
                    embryo-cell, by the process of mixture in it of the substance of two cells,—the
                    germ-cell and the sperm-cell,—derived from two different individuals. Other
                    mechanical disturbances may assist in this production of congenital variation.
                    Whatever its causes, Darwin showed that it is all-important. In some cases a
                    pair of animals produce ten million offspring, and in such a number a large
                    range of congenital variation is possible. Since on the average only two of the
                    young survive in the struggle for existence to take the place of their two
                    parents, there is a selection out of the ten million young, none of which are
                    exactly alike, and the selection is determined in nature by the survival of the
                    congenital variety which is fittest to the conditions of life. Hence there is no
                    <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> for an assumption of the perpetuation of direct
                    adaptations. The selection of the fortuitously (fortuitously, that is to say, so
                    far as the conditions of survival are concerned) produced varieties is
                    sufficient, since it is ascertained that they will tend to transmit those
                    characters with which they themselves were born, although it is <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> ascertained that they could transmit characters <hi
                    rend="italic">acquired</hi> on the way through life. A simple illustration of
                    the difference is this; a man born with four fingers only on his right hand is
                    ascertained to be likely to transmit this peculiarity to some at least of his
                    offspring; on the other hand, there is not the slightest ground for supposing
                    that a man who has had one finger chopped off, or has even lost his arm at any
                    period of his life, will produce offspring who are defective in the slightest
                    degree in regard to fingers, hand, or arm. Darwin himself, apparently influenced
                    not merely by the consideration of certain classes of facts which seem to favour
                    the Lamarckian hypothesis but also by a respect for the general prejudice in its
                    favour and for Mr Herbert Spencer’s authority, was of the opinion that acquired
                    characters are <hi rend="italic">in some cases</hi> transmitted. It should be
                    observed, however, that Darwin did not attribute an essential part to this
                    Lamarckian hypothesis of the transmission of acquired characters, but expressly
                    assigned to it an entirely subordinate importance.</p>
                <p>The new attitude which has been taken since Darwin on this question is to ask for
                    evidence of this asserted transmission of acquired characters. It is held<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Weismann, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vererbung,</hi> &amp;c., 1886.</p></note> that the Darwinian doctrine of
                    selection of fortuitous congenital variations is sufficient to account for all
                    cases, that the Lamarckian hypothesis of transmission of acquired characters is
                    not supported by experimental evidence, and that the latter should therefore be
                    dismissed. Weismann has also ingeniously argued from the structure of the
                    egg-cell and sperm-cell, and from the way in which, and the period at which,
                    they are derived in the course of the growth of the embryo from the egg—from the
                    fertilized egg-cell— that it is impossible (it would be better to say highly
                    improbable) that an alteration in parental structure <hi rend="italic"
                    >could</hi> produce any exactly representative change in the substance of the
                    germ or sperm-cells.</p>
                <p>It does not seem improbable that the doctrine of organic evolution will thus
                    become pure Darwinism and be entirely dissociated from the Lamarckian
                    heresy.</p>
                <p>The one fact which the Lamarckians can produce in their favour is the account of
                    experiments by Brown-Séquard, in which he produced epilepsy in guinea-pigs by
                    section of the large nerves or spinal cord, and in the course of which he was
                    led to believe that in a few rare instances the artificially produced epilepsy
                    was transmitted. This instance does not stand the test of criticism. It is not
                    clear whether the guinea-pigs operated upon had or had not already a
                    constitutional tendency to epilepsy, and it is not clear in what proportion of
                    cases the supposed transmission took place, and whether any other disease
                    accompanied it. On the other hand, the vast number of experiments in the
                    cropping of the tails and ears of domestic animals, as well as of similar
                    operations on man, are attended with negative results. No case of the
                    transmission of the results of an injury can be produced. Stories of tailless
                    kittens, puppies, and calves, born from parents one of whom had been thus
                    injured, are abundant, but they have hitherto entirely failed to stand before
                    examination.</p>
                <p>Experimental researches on this question are most urgently needed, but they are
                    not provided for either in the morphographical or physiological laboratories of
                    our universities.</p>
                <p>Whilst simple evidence of the fact of the transmission of an acquired character
                    is wanting, the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> arguments in its favour break
                    down one after another when discussed. The very cases which are advanced as only
                    to be explained on the Lamarckian assumption are found on examination and
                    experiment to be better explained, or only to be explained, by the Darwinian
                    principle. Thus the occurrence of blind animals in caves and in the deep sea was
                    a fact which Darwin himself regarded as best explained by the atrophy of the
                    organ of vision in successive generations through the absence of light and
                    consequent disuse, and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0868-0819"/> the transmission (as Lamarck would have supposed)
                    of a more and more weakened and structurally impaired eye to the offspring in
                    successive generations, until the eye finally disappeared. But this instance is
                    really fully explained by the theory of natural selection acting on congenital
                    fortuitous variations. Many animals are thus born with distorted or defective
                    eyes whose parents have not had their eyes submitted to any peculiar conditions.
                    Supposing a number of some species of Arthropod or Fish to be swept into a
                    cavern or to be carried from less to greater depths in the sea,—those
                    individuals with perfect eyes would follow the glimmer of light and eventually
                    escape to the outer air or the shallower depths, leaving behind those with
                    imperfect eyes to breed in the dark place. A natural selection would thus be
                    effected. In every succeeding generation this would be the case, and even those
                    with weak but still seeing eyes would in the course of time escape, until only a
                    pure race of eyeless or blind animals would be left in the cavern or deep sea.
                    Experiments and inquiries with regard to this subject are in progress; amongst
                    those who have occupied themselves with it are August Weismann of Freiburg and
                    E. B. Poulton of Oxford.</p>
                <p>It has been argued that the elaborate structural adaptations of the nervous
                    system which are the corporeal correlatives of complicated instincts must have
                    been slowly built up by the transmission to offspring of acquired experience,
                    that is to say, of acquired brain structure. At first sight it appears difficult
                    to understand how the complicated series of actions which are definitely
                    exhibited as so-called “instincts” by a variety of animals can have been due to
                    the selection of congenital variations, or can be otherwise explained than by
                    the transmission of habits acquired by the parent as the result of experience,
                    and continuously elaborated and added to in successive generations. It is,
                    however, to be noted, in the first place, that the imitation of the parent by
                    the young possibly accounts for some part of these complicated actions, and,
                    secondly, that there are cases in which curiously elaborate actions are
                    performed by animals as a characteristic of the species, and as subserving the
                    general advantage of the race or species, which, nevertheless, can <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> be explained as resulting from the transmission of
                    acquired experience, and must be supposed to be due to the natural selection of
                    a fortuitously developed habit which, like fortuitous colour or form variation,
                    happens to prove beneficial. Mr Poulton has insisted upon the habits of
                    “shamming dead” and the combined posturing and colour peculiarities of certain
                    caterpillars (Lepidopterous larvae) which cause them to resemble dead twigs or
                    similar surrounding objects. The advantage to the animal of this imitation of
                    surrounding objects is that it escapes the pursuit of (say) a bird which would,
                    were it not deceived by the resemblance, attack and eat the caterpillar. Now it
                    is clear that preceding generations of caterpillars cannot have acquired this
                    habit of posturing by experience. Either the caterpillar postures and escapes,
                    or it does not posture and is eaten; it is not half eaten and allowed to profit
                    by experience. We seem to be justified in assuming that there are many movements
                    of stretching and posturing possible to caterpillars, and that some caterpillars
                    had a congenital fortuitous tendency to one position, some to another, and,
                    finally, that among all the variety of habitual movements thus exhibited one has
                    been selected and perpetuated because it coincided with the necessary conditions
                    of safety, since it happened to give the caterpillar an increased resemblance to
                    a twig.</p>
                <p>The view that instinct is the hereditarily fixed result of habit derived from
                    experience has hitherto dominated all inquiry into the subject, but we may now
                    expect to see a renewed and careful study of animal instincts carried out with
                    the view of testing the applicability to each instance of the pure Darwinian
                    theory without the aid of Lamarckism.</p>
                <p>The whole of this inquiry has special importance in regard to mankind, since the
                    great questions of influence of race and family as opposed to the influence of
                    education are at issue. If pure Darwinism is to be accepted, then education has
                    no value in directly affecting the mental or physical features of the race, but
                    only in affecting those of the individual. Were acquired characters really and
                    fully transmitted, then every child born would inherit the knowledge of both its
                    parents more or less completely, and from birth onwards would be able to add to
                    its inherited stock, so that the progress of the race in mental acquirements
                    would be prodigiously more rapid than it is. On the other hand, peculiarities of
                    mind and body established in a race or a family acquire increased significance,
                    for they cannot be got rid of by training, but are bound to reappear if the
                    stock which exhibits them is allowed to breed. It seems that the laws of
                    thremmatology may eventually give to mankind the most precise directions, not
                    only as to how to improve the breeds of plants and animals, but as to how to
                    improve the human stock. It is not a little remarkable that the latest
                    development of zoological science should favour that respect to breeding which
                    is becoming less popular than it was, and should tend to modify the current
                    estimate of the results of education.</p>
                <p>The relation of Darwinism to general philosophy and of the history of zoology to
                    philosophical doctrines is one of the most interesting chapters which might be
                    written on the subject of this article. It belongs, however, rather to the
                    history of philosophy than to that of zoology. Undoubtedly the conceptions of
                    mankind at different periods of history with regard to cosmogony, and the
                    relations of God, nature, and man, have had a very marked influence upon the
                    study of zoology, just as in its turn the study of zoology has reacted upon
                    those conceptions.</p>
                <p>In this, as in other phases of mental development, the ancient Greeks stand out
                    in the most striking manner as possessing what is sometimes called the modern
                    spirit. The doctrine of evolution is formulated in unmistakable terms by
                    Heraclitus and other philosophers of antiquity. Not only so, but the direct
                    examination of nature, including the various forms of animal life, was practised
                    by Aristotle and his disciples in a spirit which, though not altogether free
                    from prejudice, was yet far more like that which actuated the founders of the
                    Royal Society less than three hundred years ago than anything which was
                    manifested in the two thousand years intervening between that date and the time
                    of Alexander the Great. The study of zoology in the Middle Ages was simply a
                    fantastic commentary on Aristotle and the records of animals in the various
                    books of the Bible, elaborated as part of a peculiar system of mystic
                    philosophy, which has more analogy with the fetichism and totem worship of
                    savage races than with any Greek or modern conceptions. So far as philosophy
                    affected the study of zoology in the beginning of the modern period, its
                    influence was felt in the general acceptance of what has been called the
                    Miltonic cosmogony,— namely, that interpretation of the Mosaic writings which is
                    set forth by the poet Milton, and of which the characteristic is the conception
                    of the creation of existing things, including living things, nearly or just as
                    they are, by a rapid succession of “fiats” delivered by an anthropomorphic
                    Creator. It was not until the end of the 18th century that Schelling (as quoted
                    above) conceived that unity of nature and general law of development which is
                    now called the doctrine of evolution.</p>

                    the authors of more or less complete systems of a philosophy of nature in which
                    living things were regarded as the outcome of natural law, that is, of the same
                    general processes which had produced the inanimate universe. The
                    “Natur-philosophen,” as they were called in Germany, demand the fullest
                    recognition and esteem. But, just in proportion as the “Natur-philosophen”
                    failed to produce an immediate effect on the study of zoology by their theory of
                    natural development, so was the doctrine of evolution itself deprived of
                    completeness and of the most important demonstration of its laws by the
                    long-continued delay in the final introduction of biology into the area of that
                    doctrine.</p>
                <p>Darwin by his discovery of the mechanical principle of organic evolution, namely,
                    the survival of the fittest in the struggle for existence, completed the
                    doctrine of evolution, and gave it that unity and authority which was necessary
                    in order that it should reform the whole range of philosophy. The detailed
                    consequences of that new departure in philosophy have yet to be worked out. Its
                    most important initial conception is the derivation of man by natural processes
                    from ape-like ancestors, and the consequent derivation of his mental and moral
                    qualities by the operation of the struggle for existence and natural selection
                    from the mental and moral qualities of animals. Not the least important of the
                    studies thus initiated is that of the evolution of philosophy itself. Zoology
                    thus finally arrives through Darwin at its crowning development: it touches and
                    may even be said to comprise the history of man, sociology, and psychology.</p>
