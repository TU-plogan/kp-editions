                    founder of what was the national religion of the Perso-Iranian people from the
                    time of the Achaemenidae to the close of the Sasanian period. The name
                    (Zωpoάστρης) is the Greek form of the old Iranian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zarathushtra</hi> and the new Persian <hi rend="italic">Zardusht;</hi> it seems
                    to mean “possessor of old camels.”</p>
                <p>Zoroaster was already famous in classical antiquity as the founder of the widely
                    renowned wisdom of the Magi. The later Greek writers place him with almost one
                    consent in the east of Iran, and more particularly in Bactria. The name is not
                    mentioned by Herodotus in his sketch of the Medo-Persian religion (i. 131 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.),</hi> but it occurs in a fragment (29) of the earlier writer
                    Xanthus. Plato calls Zoroaster the founder of the doctrine of the Magi and a son
                    of Oromazes. According to Hermodorus, one of Plato’s disciples, he was a
                    Persian, the first Magian; according to Hermippus, a Bactrian; according to
                    Trogus Pompeius, even king of the Bactrians and founder of the Magian art and
                    knowledge of the stars; according to Diodorus, an Arian, that is, a native of
                    east Iran. A few details as to his life are also given. Thus, according to
                    Pliny, he laughed on the very day of his birth—a statement found also in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zardusht-Nâma—</hi> and for thirty years he lived in the
                    wilderness upon cheese. Plutarch speaks of his intercourse with the deity and
                    compares him with Lycurgus and Numa. Dio Chrysostom, Plutarch’s contemporary,
                    declares that neither Homer nor Hesiod sang of the chariot and horses of Zeus so
                    worthily as Zoroaster, of whom the Persians tell that out of love to wisdom and
                    righteousness he withdrew himself from men and lived in solitude upon a
                    mountain. The mountain was burnt up, but Zoroaster escaped uninjured and spoke
                    to the multitude. His struggle with Semiramis seems to be an invention of
                    Ctesias. Plutarch, drawing partly on Theopompus, speaks of his religion in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Isis and Osiris</hi> (cc. 46 and 47).</p>
                <p>Ancient writers differ greatly as to Zoroaster’s date. Ctesias, as we have seen,
                    makes him a contemporary of Semiramis. Hermippus of Smyrna places him 5000 years
                    before the Trojan War, Xanthus 6000 years before Xerxes. Aristotle assigned him
                    a similar antiquity. Agathias remarks (ii. 24) with perfect truth that it is no
                    longer possible to determine with any certainty when he lived and legislated.
                    “The Persians,” he adds, “say that Zoroaster lived under Hystaspes, but do not
                    make it clear whether by this name they mean the father of Darius or another
                    Hystaspes. But, whatever may have been his date, he was their teacher and
                    instructor in the Magian religion.” All classical antiquity, however, without a
                    dissentient voice speaks of Zoroaster as an historical person.</p>
                <p>He is nowhere mentioned in the cuneiform inscriptions of the Achaemenidae,
                    although Darius and his successors were without doubt devoted adherents of
                    Zoroastrianism. Very little value can be attached to the fabulous narratives
                    concerning him in the later Persian and Parsee literature, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shâh-Nâma</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Zardusht-Nâma</hi> (13th century); and
                    the information of the Pahlavi books is very scanty. The Zend-Avesta alone gives
                    abundant details, which, in part at least, may be regarded as authentic.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding to compile from these a brief sketch of the life and doctrine
                    of Zoroaster it will be well that we should first look at the question whether
                    we are entitled to regard him as an historical character at all. For Zoroaster
                    too, like his great fellowteacher Buddha, has fallen under the ban of modern
                    scepticism. According to Darmesteter and Eduard Meyer, the Parsee saint is a
                    mere myth, a divinity invested with human attributes, an incarnation of the
                    storm-god, who with his divine word, the thunder, comes down from heaven and
                    smites the demons. Darmesteter, however, has failed to realize sufficiently the
                    distinction between the Zoroaster of the later Avesta and the Zoroaster of the
                    Gâthâs. It cannot be denied that in the later Avesta, and still more in writings
                    of more recent date, he is presented in a supernatural light and invested with
                    superhuman powers. At his appearing all nature rejoices <hi rend="italic">(
                    Yasht</hi> 13, 93); he enters into conflict with the demons and rids the earth
                    of their presence <hi rend="italic">(Yasht</hi> 17, 19); Satan approaches him as
                    tempter to make him renounce his faith (<hi rend="italic">Vd.,</hi> 19, 6). The
                    <hi rend="italic">Zar-dusht-Nâma</hi> is full of miracles and miraculous
                    deliverances wrought by Zoroaster. But it is quite otherwise in the Gâthâs.</p>
                <p>The Gâthâs alone within the Avesta make any claim to be the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ipsissima verba</hi> of the prophet; in the rest of that work they are put into
                    Zoroaster’s own mouth <hi rend="italic">(Yasna,</hi> 9, 1) and are expressly
                    called “the Gâthâs of the holy Zoroaster” <hi rend="italic">(Yasna,</hi> 57, 8).
                    The litanies of the Yasna, and the Yashts, refer to him as a personage belonging
                    to a remote antiquity. The Vendidad also merely gives accounts of the dialogues
                    between Ormuzd and Zoroaster. The Gâthâs alone claim to be authentic utterances
                    of Zoroaster, his genuine expressions in presence of the assembled church.</p>
                <p>The person too of the Zoroaster whom we meet with in these hymns differs <hi
                    rend="italic">toto caelo</hi> from the Zoroaster of the younger Avesta. He is
                    the exact opposite of the miraculous personage of later legend, —a mere man,
                    standing always on the solid ground of reality, whose only arms are trust in his
                    God and the protection of his powerful allies. And at times his position is
                    precarious enough. He whom we hear in the Gâthâs has had to face, not merely all
                    forms of outward opposition and the unbelief and lukewarmness of adherents, but
                    also the inward misgivings of his own heart as to the truth and final victory of
                    his cause. At one time hope, at another despondency, now assured confidence, now
                    doubt and despair, here a firm faith in the speedy coming of the kingdom of
                    heaven, there the thought of taking refuge by flight,—such is the range of the
                    emotions which find their immediate expression in these hymns. And the whole
                    breathes such a genuine originality, all is psychologically so accurate and
                    just, the earliest beginnings of the new religious movement, the childhood of a
                    new community of faith, are reflected so naturally in them all, that it is
                    impossible for <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0870-0821"/> a moment to think of a later period of
                    composition by a priesthood whom we know to have been devoid of any historical
                    sense, and incapable of reconstructing for themselves the spiritual conditions
                    under which Zoroaster lived. As soon as the position has been fully
                    mastered—that in the Gâthâs we have firm historical ground on which Zoroaster
                    and his surroundings may rest, that here we have the beginnings of the
                    Zoroastrian religion—then it becomes impossible to answer otherwise than
                    affirmatively every general question as to the historical character of
                    Zoroaster. On the other hand, we must not expect too much from the Gâthâs in the
                    way of definite detail. They give no historical account of the life and teaching
                    of their prophet, but rather are, so to say, <hi rend="italic">versus
                    memoriales,</hi> which recapitulate the main points of interest, often again in
                    an allusive way. It must be remembered too that their extent is but limited.</p>
                <p>As to the birthplace of Zoroaster the Avesta is silent. In later tradition two
                    places contended for this honour: the older and more widely spread story made
                    him a native of Rai (Rhagae) in Media, another of Shîz, the capital of
                    Atropatene, also in Media. It is hard to decide whether both traditions rest
                    merely upon priestly pretensions of a later date or whether one of them is not
                    perhaps authentic. According to <hi rend="italic">Yasna,</hi> 19, 18, the
                    “zarathushtrotema” or supreme head of the Zoroastrian priesthood had at a later
                    (Median or Sasanian? <hi rend="italic">)</hi> time his residence in Rhagae. But
                    there is a passage in even the Gâthâs (<hi rend="italic">Y</hi>., 53, 9) which
                    seems to contain a lurking allusion to Rhagae; unfortunately, however, both text
                    and meaning are uncertain. However this may be, the activity of Zoroaster as a
                    teacher is certainly to be placed in the east of Iran. On this point also the
                    Gâthâs say nothing. The later Avesta names, as the locality of his advent,
                    “Airyanem vaêjô,” a quite fabulous country, which, according to <hi
                    rend="italic">Vd.,</hi> 1, 3 and 7, was not identified with Bactria. He taught
                    under the reign of a ruler named Vîshtâspa (later Gushtâsp, the Greek
                    Hystaspes), with whom and with whose court he stood in close and friendly
                    relations. This Vîshtâspa must be carefully distinguished from Hystaspes the
                    father of Darius. According to the epic legend, Vîshtâspa was king of Bactria.
                    Already in the later Avesta he has become a half mythical figure, the last in
                    the series of heroes of east Iranian legend, in the arrangement of which series
                    priestly influence is unmistakably evident. He stands at the meeting-point
                    between the old world and the new era which begins with Zoroaster. In the Gâthâs
                    he appears as a quite historical personage; it is essentially to his power and
                    good example that the prophet is indebted for his success. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yasna,</hi> 53, 2, he is spoken of as a pioneer of the doctrine revealed by
                    Ormuzd. In the relation between Zoroaster and Vîshtâspa already lies the germ of
                    the state church which afterwards became so completely subservient to the
                    interests of the dynasty and sought its protection from it.</p>
                <p>Among the grandees of the court of Vîshtâspa mention is made of two brothers
                    Frashaoshtra and Jâmâspa; the latter, according to the later legend, was the
                    minister of Vîshtâspa. Zoroaster was nearly related to both; his wife Hvôvi
                    seems to have been their sister, and the husband of her daughter, Pourucista,
                    was a son of Jâmâspa. Apart from this connexion, the new prophet relies
                    especially upon his own kindred <hi rend="italic">(hvaêtush)</hi> and their
                    followers <hi rend="italic">(airy-aman).</hi> His first disciple,
                    Maidhyôimâongha, was a relation; his father was, according to the later Avesta,
                    Pouru-shaspa, his great-grandfather Haêcataspa, and the ancestor of the whole
                    family Spitama, for which reason Zarathushtra usually bears this surname. His
                    sons and daughters are repeatedly spoken of. His death is, for reasons easily
                    intelligible, nowhere mentioned in the Avesta; in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shâh-Nâma</hi> he is said to have been murdered at the altar by the Turanians
                    in the storming of Balkh.</p>
                <p>We are quite in the dark as to the date of Zoroaster; King Vîshtâspa has no place
                    in any historical chronology, and the Gâthâs give no hint on the subject. But at
                    any rate he must have lived long before Cyrus, by whose time the new religion
                    had already become established in western Iran (Nic. Damasc., fr. 66). Duncker
                    places him about the year 1000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Merely conjectural
                    also is the opinion once orally expressed by Gutschmid that Zoroaster may have
                    been a contemporary of Moses, thus belonging, according to Gutschmid’s view, to
                    about the 14th century B.c.,—a period of great religious activity throughout
                    western Asia.</p>
                <p>It was a new religion that Zoroaster taught. This must not, however, be taken as
                    meaning that everything he taught came, so to say, out of his own head. His
                    doctrine was a product of the time, and had its roots in the nature and history
                    of the people to which he belonged. Usually he is spoken of as a reformer of the
                    old Iranian faith. But in order to be sure of this it would be necessary first
                    to know something about the nature of that faith as it existed before he arose.
                    Was it still essentially the same as that of the nearly-allied ancient Hindus,
                    as found in the <hi rend="italic">RigVeda?</hi> To this question no distinct
                    answer is forthcoming; we are ignorant as to how far the way had been prepared
                    for Zoroastrianism or how far it was wholly new. But still there is room for
                    conjecture as to what it was that gave the prophet the first impulse and
                    occasion for his work.</p>
                <p>The most striking difference between Zoroaster’s doctrine of God and the old
                    religion of India lies in this, that, while in the Avesta the evil spirits are
                    called <hi rend="italic">daêva</hi> (Modern Persian <hi rend="italic">dîv),</hi>
                    the Aryans of India, on the other hand, in common with the Italians, Celts, and
                    Letts, gave the name of <hi rend="italic">dêva</hi> to their good spirits, the
                    spirits of light. An -alternative designation for deity in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >RigVeda</hi> is <hi rend="italic">asura.</hi> In the more recent hymns of the
                    <hi rend="italic">RigVeda</hi> and in later India, on the other hand, only <hi
                    rend="italic">evil</hi> spirits are understood by <hi rend="italic">asurâs,</hi>
                    while in Iran the corresponding word <hi rend="italic">ahura</hi> was, and ever
                    has continued to be, the designation of God the Lord, especially of the supreme
                    God, with the epithet of <hi rend="italic">Mazdâο</hi> (the Wise). Thus <hi
                    rend="italic">ahura-daêνa, dêva-asura</hi> in Zoroastrian and in later Brahman
                    theology are in their meanings exactly opposed. This difference no one has as
                    yet satisfactorily accounted for, and yet it supplies the key to the doctrine of
                    Zoroaster.</p>
                <p>The difference proceeded from an old distinction between the ideas <hi
                    rend="italic">deva</hi> and <hi rend="italic">asura.</hi> An original ideal
                    difference, a different conception of god associated with the two words, grew in
                    the two lands into a sharp antithesis, a formal conflict, but in opposite
                    senses. In India the development still admits of being traced. In the older <hi
                    rend="italic">RigVeda</hi> the difference is latent. Here a god is spoken of as
                    <hi rend="italic">déva,</hi> but not every <hi rend="italic">dêva</hi> is an <hi
                    rend="italic">asura. Asura</hi> is something which is attributed only to certain
                    particular gods as a special attribute, notably to Varuna, though also to
                    others, such as Indra, but only by the so-called “katheno-theism” of the Vedic
                    religion. On the other hand, it is expressly stated that in the case of Indra
                    the dignity of an <hi rend="italic">asura</hi> was only a conferred one <hi
                    rend="italic">(Rig-V.,</hi> 6,10, 2). In <hi rend="italic">RigVeda,</hi> 4, 42
                    Varuna claims as against Indra the priority in the <hi rend="italic">asura</hi>
                    dignity. This hymn, like 10, 124, is of importance for the whole question. The
                    contrast there implied between Varuna and Indra, the rivalry between them as to
                    which is the greater, comes to light sometimes more strongly, sometimes less so,
                    throughout the entire <hi rend="italic">RigVeda.</hi> The contrast is really in
                    other terms the old contrast between <hi rend="italic">asura</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">deva,</hi> between a more spiritualistic and a more materialistic
                    conception of deity. <hi rend="italic">Asura</hi> is ethically the higher
                    conception, <hi rend="italic">deva</hi> the lower: <hi rend="italic">deva</hi>

                    down; it becomes unmodern, obsolete, and acquires an undesirable flavour. The
                    <hi rend="italic">asuras</hi> thus come to form a distinct group of celestial
                    beings mentioned along with the <hi rend="italic">devas (A.- V.,</hi> 10, 10,
                    26): they become in rank inferior to the <hi rend="italic">devas (A.- V.,</hi>
                    6, 86, 3) and receive the designation of <hi rend="italic">asurâ
                    adevâs—asuras</hi> that are no <hi rend="italic">devas;</hi> and from this it is
                    but a short step to the “<hi rend="italic">asuras</hi> that are opposed to the
                    gods.”</p>
                <p>The old contrast between <hi rend="italic">asura</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >deva</hi> was wrought out and accentuated quite differently on Iranian soil.
                    While in India the entire revolution took place in a bloodless manner wholly
                    within the realm of ideas, the old antithesis led to an open quarrel among the
                    Aryans of Iran. In the background of the picture of Zoroaster’s times set before
                    us in the Gâthâs we see the people divided between two opposing and hostile
                    cults, the watchwords of which are <hi rend="italic">ahura</hi> on the one hand
                    and <hi rend="italic">daeva</hi> on the other. How it is that matters had come
                    to this pass remains obscure, for we have no source of information to take us
                    further back. The opposing parties are not separated by distance in space or by
                    differing nationality, but occur side by side. “Hard by the believer in <hi
                    rend="italic">ahura</hi> dwells the worshipper of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >daêvas,”</hi> complains Zoroaster. The entire people seems broken up by the
                    religious difference.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to focus the scattered references in the Gâthâs so as to obtain a
                    clear picture of the time. Only this much is clear, that in Zoroaster’s day not
                    two cults only but two stages of culture are struggling for the mastery. The <hi
                    rend="italic">ahura</hi> worshippers represent the higher phase; they are
                    breeders of cattle, and the care of the cow is to them a sacred duty. The
                    worshippers of the <hi rend="italic">daevas</hi> maltreat the animal and
                    slaughter it in their sacrifices. We perceive that the higher ethical tendency
                    of the old <hi rend="italic">asura</hi> faith is producing its effects in the
                    higher degree of culture of the believers in Ahura, while the worshippers of the
                    <hi rend="italic">daevas</hi> stand on a lower grade.</p>
                <p>It is to this period of religious ferment that Zoroaster’s appearance on the
                    scene belongs. It is not he who has evoked this religious conflict of parties,
                    as the common assumption is, and just as little is it he who in Ahura with the
                    epithet of Mazdâo offers a new god to his people. He strikes decisively into the
                    existing struggle, mounts to the position of spiritual leader of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ahura</hi> party and makes the battle a victory. As <hi
                    rend="italic">zaotâ</hi> (Indian <hi rend="italic">hotâ),</hi> for so he calls
                    himself, the first in rank of the old Aryan priests, he had all the greater
                    opportunity to make his views known in matters of religion. Mankind had been
                    brought face to face with a critical choice, that of electing between two
                    radically opposed confessions of faith, without having any clearness as to the
                    lasting consequences of the momentous step. He determines to save them, to lead
                    them to a right choice, for he sees further than they, and believes himself to
                    be initiated into the secrets of the godhead and of the life to come. What the
                    other party worship as gods under the name of <hi rend="italic">daêva</hi> are
                    in reality powers by whom unwitting mankind are led to their destruction,—evil
                    powers, false gods, devils. Such is the position from which all his teaching
                    starts; and thus the change in the conception of <hi rend="italic">daeva</hi>
                    was a natural development. From the <hi rend="italic">daevas</hi> proceeds all
                    the evil in the world. But his speculation does not stop here. The <hi
                    rend="italic">daevas</hi> themselves anon become manifest to him as being but
                    the instruments of a higher principle, called by him for the most part <hi
                    rend="italic">Druj</hi> (falsehood, deception), and more rarely <hi
                    rend="italic">Angrô Mainyush,</hi> that is the spirit enemy, Ahriman. This
                    Ahriman or evil principle is the most characteristic product of Zoroastrian
                    speculation. From the schism or religious dualism of his time he derived the
                    idea of that dualistic scheme of the universe which has impressed its character
                    upon the whole of the religion called by his name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Zoroastrian Doctrine.</hi></p>
                <p>The fundamental idea of the Zoroastrian creed is dualistic. At the beginning of
                    things there existed two spirits—Ahurô Mazdâo (Ormuzd) and Angrô Mainyush
                    (Ahriman)—who represented good and evil (<hi rend="italic">Yasna,</hi> 30, 3).
                    The existence of evil in the world is thus presupposed from all eternity. Both
                    spirits possess creative power, which manifests itself in the one positively and
                    in the other negatively. Ormuzd is light and life and all that is pure and
                    good,— in the ethical world law, order, and truth; his antithesis is darkness,
                    filth, death, all that is evil in the world, lawlessness, and lies. λVhen the
                    two are spoken of as <hi rend="italic">yêma</hi> (“a pair”), this is not to be
                    interpreted as meaning that they are twins:<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Later sects sought to rise from the dualism to a higher
                    unity. Thus the Zarvanites represented Ormuzd and Ahriman as twin sons
                    proceeding from the fundamental principle of all, Zrvana Akarana, or limitless
                    time.</p></note> it simply denotes a duality, an opposed couple, a <hi
                    rend="italic">dυandυa.</hi> The two spirits had until then counterbalanced one
                    another. The ultimate triumph of the good spirit is an ethical demand of the
                    religious consciousness and the quintessence of Zoroaster’s revelation.</p>
                <p>The evil spirit with his wicked hosts appears in the Gâthâs much less endowed
                    with the attributes of personality than does Ahura Mazda. Within the world of
                    the good Ormuzd is Lord and God alone. In this sense Zoroastrianism is often
                    referred to as the faith of Ormuzd or as Mazdaism. Ormuzd in his exalted majesty
                    is the ideal figure of an Oriental king. Of other gods beside him the doctrine
                    of the Gâthâs knows nothing. The natural and symbolical gods of the popular
                    belief have no place in it. Yet Ormuzd is not alone in his doings and conflicts,
                    but has in conjunction with himself a number of genii—for the most part
                    personifications of ethical ideas. These are his creatures, his instruments,
                    servants, and assistants, like the ministers of an autocratic sovereign. They
                    are comprehended under the general name of <hi rend="italic">ameshâ spentâ</hi>
                    (“immortal holy ones”) and are the prototypes of the seven <hi rend="italic"
                    >amshaspands</hi> of a later date. These are—(1) Ashem, afterwards Ashem
                    Vahishtem (Plutarch’s ἀλ <hi rend="italic">ήθϵιa),</hi> corresponding to all
                    that is true, good, and right,—ideas practically identical for Zoroaster, and
                    the embodiment of all that is true, good, and right, upright law and rule; (2)
                    Vohu Manô (<hi rend="italic">ϵὒvoια</hi>), good sense, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.</hi>, the good principle, the idea of the good, the principle that works
                    in man inclining him to what is good; (3) Khshathrem, afterwards Khshathrem
                    Vairîm (<hi rend="italic">εὐvoμία</hi>), the power and kingdom of Ormuzd, which
                    have subsisted from the first but not in integral completeness, the evil having
                    crept in like the tares among the wheat: the time is yet to come when it shall
                    be fully manifested in all its unclouded majesty; (4) Armaiti (σοφία), or the
                    spirit of docility and obedience, spoken of as daughter of Ormuzd and regarded
                    as having her abode upon the earth; (5) Haurvatât (πλ <hi rend="italic"
                    >oυτoς</hi>), perfection; (6) Ameretatât, immortality. Other ministering angels
                    are Gêush Tashan (“the creator of the cow ”), Gêush Urvan ( "the genius and
                    defender of animals”), and the holy spirit of Ormuzd, often thought of as having
                    personal existence. Of the elements fire alone ( “the son of Ahura Mazda ”)
                    receives personification and figures as his ally.</p>
                <p>As soon as the two at first absolutely separate spirits (comp. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bundahish,</hi> 1, 4) encounter one another, their creative activity and at the
                    same time their permanent conflict begin. The history of this conflict is the
                    history of the world. A great cleft runs right through the world: all creation
                    divides itself into that which is Ahura’s and that which is Ahriman’s. Not that
                    the two spirits carry on the struggle in person; they leave it to be fought out
                    by their respective creations and creatures which they send into the field. The
                    field of battle is the present world.</p>
                <p>In the centre of battle is man; his soul is the object of the war. Man is a
                    creation of Ormuzd, who therefore has the right to call him to account. But
                    Ormuzd created him free in his determinations and in his actions, wherefore he
                    is accessible to the influences of the evil powers. This freedom of the will is
                    clearly expressed in <hi rend="italic">Yasna,</hi> 31, 11: “Since thou, O Mazda,
                    didst at the first create our being and our souls in accordance with thy mind,
                    and didst create our understanding and our life together with the body, and
                    works and words in which man according to his own will can frame his confession,
                    the liar and the truth-speaker alike lay hold of the word, the knowing and the
                    ignorant each after his own heart and understanding. Armaiti searches, following
                    thy spirit, where errors are found.” Man takes part in this conflict by all his
                    life and activity in the world. By a true confession of faith, by every good
                    deed, by continually keeping pure his body and his soul, he impairs the power of
                    Satan and strengthens the might of goodness, and establishes a claim for reward
                    upon Ormuzd; by a false confession, by every evil deed and defilement, he
                    increases the evil and renders service to Satan.</p>
                <p>The life of man falls into two parts,—its earthly portion and that which is lived
                    beyond the grave. The lot assigned to him after death is the result and
                    consequence of his life upon earth. No religion has so clearly grasped the ideas
                    of guilt and of merit On the works of men here below a strict reckoning will be
                    held in <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n872/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0872-0823"/> heaven (according to later representations by
                    Rashnu and Mithra). All thoughts, words, and deeds of each are entered in the
                    book as separate items <hi rend="italic">(dâthra, V.,</hi> 31, 14; <hi
                    rend="italic">Vend.,</hi> 19, 27), all the evil works as debts <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ishudô).</hi> Wicked actions cannot be undone, but in the heavenly account can
                    be counterbalanced by a surplus of good works. It is only in this sense that an
                    evil deed can be atoned for by a good one. Of a remission of sins the doctrine
                    of Zoroaster knows nothing. After death the soul arrives at the <hi
                    rend="italic">cinvato pere-tush</hi> or accountant’s bridge over which lies the
                    way to heaven. Here the statement of his life account is made out. If he has a
                    balance of good works in his favour, he passes forthwith into paradise <hi
                    rend="italic">(Garô demâna)</hi> and the blessed life. If his evil works
                    outweigh his good he falls finally under the power of Satan, and the pains of
                    hell are his portion for ever. Should the evil and the good be equally balanced,
                    the soul passes into an intermediate stage of existence (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hamêstakâns</hi> of the Pahlavi books) and his final lot is not decided until
                    the last judgment. This court of reckoning, the <hi rend="italic">judicium
                    particulare,</hi> is called <hi rend="italic">âka.</hi> The course of inexorable
                    law cannot be turned aside by any sacrifice or offering, nor yet even by the
                    free grace of God.</p>
                <p>But man has been smitten with blindness and ignorance: he knows neither the
                    eternal law nor the things which await him after death. He allows himself only
                    too easily to be ensnared by the craft of the evil powers who seek to ruin his
                    future existence. He worships and serves false gods, being unable to distinguish
                    between truth and lies. Therefore it is that Ormuzd in his grace determined to
                    open the eyes of mankind by sending a prophet to lead them by the right way, the
                    way of salvation. According to later legend (<hi rend="italic">Vd.,</hi> 2, 1),
                    Ormuzd at first wished to entrust this task to Yima (Jemshîd), the ideal of an
                    Iranian king. But Yima, the secular man, felt himself unfitted for it and
                    declined it. He contented himself therefore with establishing in his paradise
                    <hi rend="italic">(vara)</hi> a heavenly kingdom in miniature, to serve at the
                    same time as a pattern for the heavenly kingdom that was to come. Zoroaster at
                    last, as being a spiritual man, was found fit for the mission. Zoroaster
                    experienced within himself the inward call to seek the amelioration of mankind
                    and their deliverance from everlasting ruin, and regarded this inward impulse,
                    intensified as it was by means of dreams and visions, as being the call
                    addressed to him by God Himself. Like Mohammed after him he often speaks of his
                    conversations with God. He calls himself most frequently <hi rend="italic"
                    >manthran</hi> (“prophet”), <hi rend="italic">ratu</hi> (“spiritual authority
                    ”), and <hi rend="italic">saoshyant</hi> (meaning “he who will deliver,” that is
                    to say, when men come to be judged according to their deeds).</p>
                <p>The full contents of his dogmatic and ethical teaching we cannot gather from the
                    Gâthâs. He speaks for the most part only in general references of the divine
                    commands and of good and evil works. Among the former those most inculcated are
                    renunciation of Satan, adoration of Ormuzd, purity of soul and body, and care of
                    the cow. We learn little otherwise regarding the practices connected with his
                    doctrines. A ceremonial worship is hardly mentioned. He speaks more in the
                    character of prophet than in that of lawgiver. The contents of the Gâthâs are
                    essentially eschatological. Revelations concerning the last things and the
                    future lot, whether bliss or woe, of human souls, promises for true believers,
                    threatenings for misbelievers, his firm confidence as to the future triumph of
                    the good—such are the themes continually dwelt on with endless variations.</p>
                <p>It was not without special reason, Zoroaster believed, that the calling of a
                    prophet should have taken place precisely when it did. It was, he held, the
                    final appeal of Ormuzd to mankind at large. Like John the Baptist and the
                    Apostles of Jesus, Zoroaster also believed that the fulness of time was near,
                    that the kingdom of heaven was at hand. Through the whole of the Gâthâs runs the
                    pious hope that the end of the present world is not far off. He himself hopes
                    along with his followers to live to see the decisive turn of things, the dawn of
                    the new and better aeon. Ormuzd will summon together all his powers for a final
                    decisive struggle and break the power of evil for ever; by his help the faithful
                    will achieve the victory over their detested enemies, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >daêva</hi> worshippers, and render them powerless. Thereupon Ormuzd will hold a
                    <hi rend="italic">judicium universale (vîdâiti)</hi> upon all mankind and judge
                    strictly according to justice, punish the wicked, and assign to the good the
                    hoped-for reward. Satan will be cast, along with all those who have been
                    delivered over to him to suffer the pains of hell, into the abyss, where he will
                    thenceforward lie powerless. Forthwith begins the one undivided kingdom of God
                    in heaven and on earth. This is called, sometimes the good kingdom, sometimes
                    simply the kingdom. Here the sun will for ever shine, and all the pious and
                    faithful will live a happy life, that no evil power can disturb, in the
                    fellowship of Ormuzd and his angels for ever.</p>
                <p>Zoroaster’s teachings show him to have been a man of a highly speculative turn,
                    faithful, however, with all his originality, to the Iranian national character.
                    With zeal for the faith, and boldness and energy, he combined diplomatic skill
                    in his dealings with his exalted protectors. His thinking is consecutive,
                    self-restrained, practical, devoid on the whole of all that might be called
                    fantastic and excessive. His form of expression is tangible and concrete. His
                    system is constructed on a clearly conceived plan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Later Development of Zoroastrianism.—</hi> For the
                    great mass of the people Zoroaster’s doctrine was too abstract and
                    spiritualistic. Popular faith instinctively and naturally turns to concrete
                    plastic forms of godhead borrowed from surrounding nature, and thus it came to
                    pass that a number of the old Aryan divinities, whom the new teaching had driven
                    into the background, were again restored to their former rank,—especially
                    Mithra, the sun-god. Besides him, in the younger Avesta, Anâhita (Anâitis), the
                    goddess of the waters, Tishtrya (Sirius), and other heavenly bodies are invoked
                    with special preference. The Gâthâs know nothing of a new belief which
                    afterwards arose in the <hi rend="italic">fravashi,</hi> or guardian angels of
                    the faithful. <hi rend="italic">Fravashi</hi> properly means “confession of
                    faith,” and when personified comes to be regarded as a protecting spirit.
                    Unbelievers have no <hi rend="italic">fravashi.</hi></p>
                <p>On the basis of the new teaching arose a widely spread priesthood <hi
                    rend="italic">(âthravanô)</hi> who systematized the doctrines, organized and
                    carried on the worship, and laid down the minutely elaborated laws for the
                    purifying and keeping pure of soul and body which are met with in the Vendidad.
                    To the last-named belong in particular the numerous ablutions, bodily
                    chastisements, love of truth, agriculture, protection of useful animals, as dogs
                    and cattle, the destruction of noxious animals, and the prohibition either to
                    burn or to bury the dead. In the worship the drink prepared from the <hi
                    rend="italic">haoma</hi> (Indian <hi rend="italic">soma)</hi> plant had a
                    prominent place. The last things and the end of the world are relegated to the
                    close of a long period of time (3000 years after Zoroaster), when a new
                    Saoshyant is to be born of the seed of Zoroaster, the dead are to come to life,
                    and a new incorruptible world to begin.</p>
                <p>The religion of Zoroaster, broadly speaking, never spread beyond the limits of
                    Iran, although some isolated Turanian stems can be reckoned among those who
                    profess it. From the East it doubtless passed in the first instance into Media
                    and thence into Persia proper (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol.
                    xviii. p. 564). In the Persians of Herodotus’s time we still see the new
                    proselytes who have indeed accepted the creed, but not yet without reserve all
                    the religious usages which accompany it, and least of all those which run
                    completely counter to sacred and immemorial traditions of their time-honoured
                    customs. According to Herodotus (i. 140), they still refrained from exposing, at
                    least from openly exposing, their dead to dogs and vultures, but continued to
                    bury them. This was practised by the Magi only, that is, by the priesthood, in
                    conformity with the priestly laws. The Persians, however, made so far a
                    concession to their adopted religion that they enveloped their dead bodies in
                    wax, so that the earth might not be defiled.</p>
                <p>After the fall of the Achaemenidae (331 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>)
                    Zoroastrianism lost greatly in power and dignity. It was subsequently
                    rehabilitated, however, by the Sasanians, under whom it reached its highest
                    prosperity. Protected by this dynasty, the priesthood developed into a
                    completely organized state church, which was able to employ the power of the
                    state in enforcing strict compliance with the religious law-book hitherto
                    enjoined by their unaided efforts only. The formation of sects was at this
                    period not infrequent (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Manichaeism).</hi> The
                    Mohammedan invasion (636), with the terrible persecutions of the following
                    centuries, was the death-blow of Zoroastrianism. In Persia itself only a few
                    followers of Zoroaster are now found (in Kirman and Yazd). The <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Parsees</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v</hi>.) in and around Bombay
                    hold by Zoroaster as their prophet and by the ancient religious usages, but
                    their doctrine has reached the stage of a pure monotheism.</p>
