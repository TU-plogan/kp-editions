                <p><label type="entry">ZWICKAU</label>, one of the busiest towns in the industrial
                    district of the kingdom of Saxony to which it gives its name, is situated in a
                    pleasant valley on the left bank of the Zwickauer Mulde, 41 miles south of
                    Leipsic. The river is here crossed by four bridges, two of which are of iron.
                    The town contains six churches, including the fine Late Gothic church of St Mary
                    (1453-1536, restored 1884), with a tower 278 feet high, and the Gothic church of
                    St Catherine (14th to 15th century), of which Thomas Münzer was pastor in
                    1520-22. Among the secular buildings are the town-house of 1581, the Gothic
                    “Gewandhaus” (now a theatre) of 1522-24, the Government buildings of 1838, the
                    law-courts, the hospital, and the barracks. The railway station, which with its
                    dependencies covers 81 acres, is said to be one of the largest in Germany. The
                    chateau of Osterstein (1581-91) is now a penitentiary. The manufactures of
                    Zwickau are both extensive and varied: they include machinery, chemicals,
                    porcelain, paper, glass, dyestuffs, tinware, stockings, and curtains. There are
                    also steam saw-mills, brickfields, iron-foundries, and breweries.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0881-0832"/>
                <p>Though no longer so important as when it lay on the chief trade route from Saxony
                    to Bohemia and the Danube, Zwickau still carries on considerable commerce in
                    grain, linen, and coal. The mainstay of the industrial prosperity of the town is
                    the adjacent coalfield, which in 1885 employed 10,000 hands and yielded coal to
                    the value of £854,900. The mines are mentioned as early as 1348; but they have
                    been actively worked only for the last 65 years, during which time the
                    population of the town has increased more than sixfold. In 1885 the population
                    was 39,245; in 1834 it was 6701.</p>
                <p>Zwickau is of Slavonic origin, and is mentioned in 1118 as a trading place. From
                    1290 till 1348 it was a free imperial city, but about the latter date it was
                    forced to accept the protection of the margrave of Meissen. The Anabaptist
                    movement of 1525 began at Zwickau under the inspiration of the “Zwickau
                    prophets.” Robert Schumann (1810-1856), the musical composer, was born here. The
                    name is sometimes fancifully derived from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                        >cygnea,</hi> from a tradition that placed a. “swan lake” here which had the
                    property of renewing the youth of those who bathed in it.</p>
