                    from his birthplace, <hi rend="smallcaps">Zarlinus Clodiensis,</hi> was born at
                    Chioggia, Venetia, in 1517. Studying in his youth for the church, he was
                    admitted to the minor orders in 1539 and ordained deacon in 1541 at Venice; but
                    he soon devoted himself entirely to the study of music under the guidance of
                    Adrian Willaert, then choirmaster at St Mark’s. Willaert, dying in 1562, was
                    succeeded by Cipriano di Rore, on whose removal to Parma in 1565 Zarlino was
                    elected choir-master. Though now remembered chiefly as a theorist, it is evident
                    that he must have been famous both as a practical musician and as a composer;
                    for, notwithstanding the limited number of his printed works, consisting of a
                    volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Modulationes Sex Vocum</hi> (Venice, 1566),
                    and a few motets and madrigals scattered through the collections of Scotto and
                    other contemporary publishers, he both produced and superintended the public
                    performance of some important pieces in the service of the republic. First among
                    these was the music written to celebrate the battle of Lepanto (7th October
                    1571). Again, when Henry III. of France passed through Venice on his return from
                    Poland in 1574, Zarlino directed on board the “Bucentaur” the performance of an
                    ode for which he himself had composed the music, to verses supplied by Rocco
                    Benedetti and Cornelio Frangipani. The ode <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0820-0771"/> was followed by a solemn service in St Mark’s, in
                    which Zarlino’s music formed a prominent feature, and the festival concluded
                    with the representation of a dramatic piece entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orfeo</hi> composed by Zarlino. When the church of S. Maria della Salute was
                    founded in 1577 to commemorate the plague, he composed a solemn mass for the
                    occasion. Not one of these works is now known to be in existence; the only
                    example we possess of Zarlino’s compositions on a grand scale is a MS. mass for
                    four voices, in the library of the Philharmonic Lyceum at Bologna. He died at
                    Venice on 14th February 1590.</p>
                <p>Fortunately for the science of music, Zarlino’s theoretical writings have all
                    been preserved. Though he was by no means free from certain visionary ideas
                    concerning the transcendental powers of music, in which the theorists of the
                    16th century delighted, Zarlino was, in practical knowledge and intelligent
                    application of scientific truth to the development of art, immeasurably in
                    advance of the age in which he lived. His clear insight into the mathematical
                    foundation of the scale placed him in direct antagonism to the leaders of the
                    school of the Renaissance, which, with Vincenzo Galilei at its head, blindly
                    followed the mistaken reasoning of Boetius (see vol. xvii. p. 80), and adhered
                    as a matter of principle to the Pythagorean section of the canon. This
                    difference of opinion, occurring at a critical period in the development of art,
                    made Zarlino many bitter enemies; but he steadily maintained his principles in
                    temperate and unanswerable argument; and his theory is now accepted as the basis
                    of modern art, while that of his opponents is utterly discarded.</p>
                <p>Zarlino’s first theoretical work was the <hi rend="italic">Istitutioni
                    Armoniche</hi> (Venice, 1558; reprinted 1562 and 1573). This was followed by the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dimostrationi Armoniche</hi> (Venice, 1571; reprinted 1573)
                    and by the <hi rend="italic">Sopplimenti Musicali</hi> (Venice, 1588). Finally,
                    in a complete edition of his works published shortly before his death Zarlino
                    reprinted these three treatises, accompanied by a <hi rend="italic">Tract on
                    Patience,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Discourse on the True Date of the Crucifixion
                    of Our Lord,</hi> an essay on <hi rend="italic">The Origin of the
                    Capuchins,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Resolution of Some Doubts Concerning
                    the Correction of the Julian Calendar</hi> (Venice, 1589).<note anchored="true"

                    either.</p></note></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Istitutioni</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dimostrationi
                    Armoniche</hi> deal, like most other theoretical works of the period, with the
                    whole science of music as it was understood in the 16th century. The earlier
                    chapters, treating chiefly of the arithmetical foundations of the science,
                    differ but little in their line of argument from the principles laid down by
                    Pietro Aron, Zacconi, and other early writers of the Boetian school; but in bk.
                    ii. of the <hi rend="italic">Istitutioni</hi> Zarlino boldly attacks the false
                    system of tonality to which the proportions of the Pythagorean tetrachord, if
                    strictly carried out in practice, must inevitably lead. The fact that, so far as
                    can now be ascertained, they never were strictly carried out in the Italian
                    mediaeval schools, at least after the invention of counterpoint, in no wise
                    diminishes the force of the reformer’s argument. The point at issue was, that
                    neither in the polyphonic school, in which Zarlino was educated, nor in the
                    later monodic school, of which his recalcitrant pupil, Vincenzo Galilei, was the
                    most redoubtable champion, could those proportions be tolerated in practice,
                    however attractive they might be to the theorist in their mathematical aspect.
                    So persistently does the human ear rebel against the division of the tetrachord
                    into two greater tones and a leimma or hemitone, as represented by the fractions
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi>, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 8</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi>, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 243</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 256</hi>, that, centuries
                    before the possibility of reconciling the demands of the ear with those of exact
                    science was satisfactorily demonstrated, the Aristoxenian school advocated the
                    use of an empirical scale, sounding pleasant to the sense, in preference to an
                    unpleasing tonality founded upon immutable proportions. Didymus, writing in the
                    year 60, made the first step towards establishing this pleasant-sounding scale
                    upon a mathematical basis, by the discovery of the lesser tone; but unhappily he
                    placed it in a false position below the greater tone. Claudius Ptolemy (130)
                    rectified this error, and in the so-called syntonous or intense diatonic scale
                    reduced the proportions of his tetrachord to <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi>, <hi rend="superscript"> 9</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi>, <hi rend="superscript"> 15</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 16</hi>,— <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the greater tone,
                    lesser tone, and diatonic semitone of modern music.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We have given the fractions in the order in
                    which they occur in the modern system. Ptolemy, following the invariable Greek
                    method, placed them thus—/,/,/. This, however, made no difference in the actual
                    proportions.</p></note> Ptolemy set forth this system as one of eight possible
                    forms of the diatonic scale. But Zarlino uncompromisingly declared that the
                    syntonous or intense diatonic scale was the only form that could reasonably be
                    sung; and in proof of its perfection he exhibited the exact arrangement of its
                    various diatonic intervals, to the fifth inclusive, in every part of the
                    diapason or octave. The proportions are precisely those now universally accepted
                    in the system called “just intonation.” But this system is practicable only by
                    the voice and instruments of the violin class. For keyed or fretted instruments
                    a compromise is indispensable. To meet this exigency, Zarlino proposed that for
                    the lute the octave should be divided into twelve equal semitones; and after
                    centuries of discussion this system of “equal temperament” has, within the last
                    thirty-five years, been universally adopted as the best attainable for keyed
                    instruments of every description.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It was first used in France, for the organ, in 1835; in
                    England, for the pianoforte in 1846 and for the organ in 1854. Bach had
                    advocated it in Germany a century earlier; but it was not generally
                    adopted.</p></note></p>
                <p>Again, Zarlino was in advance of his age in his classification of the
                    ecclesiastical modes. These scales were not, as is vulgarly supposed, wholly
                    abolished in favour of our modern tonality in the 17th century. Eight of them,
                    it is true, fell into disuse; but the mediaeval Ionian and Hypo-ionian modes are
                    absolutely identical with the modern natural scale of C; and the Aeolian and
                    Hypoaeolian modes differ from our minor scale, not in constitution, but in
                    treatment only. Mediaeval composers, however, regarded the Ionian mode as the
                    least perfect of the series and placed it last in order. Zarlino thought
                    differently and made it the first mode, changing all the others to accord with
                    it. His numerical table, therefore, differs from all others made before or
                    since, prophetically assigning the place of honour to the one ancient scale now
                    recognized as the foundation of the modern tonal system.</p>
                <p>These innovations were violently opposed by the apostles of the monodic school.
                    Vincenzo Galilei led the attack in a tract entitled <hi rend="italic">Discorso
                    Intorno alle Opere di Messer Gioseffe Zarlino,</hi> and followed it up in his
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Dialogo,</hi> defending the Pythagorean system in very
                    unmeasured language. It was in answer to these strictures that Zarlino published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Sopplementi.</hi></p>
