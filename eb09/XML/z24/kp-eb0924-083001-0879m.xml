                    from the Lake of Zurich, and on the river Sihl, which joins the Limmat just
                    above the north end of the lake. That part which lies on the right bank of the
                    Limmat is known as the Large Town, that on the left as the Little Town. The
                    central portion— the “city”—is governed by an executive of seven members and a
                    town council of sixty, both elected by the citizens, and in 1887 had 27,638
                    inhabitants. The nine outlying townships or “gemeinden” have each a separate
                    organization, distinct from that of the city, and in 1887 had 60,836
                    inhabitants, of whom 18,527 were in Aussersihl and 10,883 in Riesbach. The total
                    population of the town and its suburbs was thus 88,474 in 1887. These are nearly
                    all Protestants and German-speaking. The number of Roman Catholics has doubled
                    in the last ten years; they are mainly resident in Aussersihl, the workmen’s
                    quarter, where also many Italian-speaking persons dwell. There are in Zurich
                    about 7000 Old Catholics.</p>
                <p>Of the old buildings the finest and most important is the Gross Münster (or
                    Propstei) on the right bank of the Limmat. This was originally the church of the
                    king’s tenants, and in one of the chapels the bodies of Felix, Regula, and
                    Exuperantius, the patron saints of the city, were buried, the town treasury
                    being formerly kept above this chapel. The present building was erected at two
                    periods (1090-1150 and 1225-1300), the high altar having been dedicated in 1278.
                    The towers were first raised above the roof at the end of the 15th century and
                    took their present form in 1779. The chapter consisted of twenty-four secular
                    canons; it was reorganized at the Reformation (1526), aud suppressed in 1832. On
                    the site of the canons’ houses stands a girls’ school (opened 1853), but the
                    fine Romanesque cloisters (12th and 13th centuries) still remain. There is a
                    curious figure of Charlemagne in a niche on one of the towers; to him is
                    attributed the founding or reform of the chapter. On the left bank of the Limmat
                    stands the other great church of Zurich, the Frau Munster (or Abtei), founded
                    for nuns in 853 by Louis the German. The high altar was dedicated in 1170; but
                    the greater part of the buildings are of the 13th and 14th centuries. It was in
                    this church that the relics of the three patron saints of the town were
                    preserved till the Reformation, and it was here that the burgomaster Waldmann
                    was buried in 1489. There were only twelve nuns of noble family, comparatively
                    free from the severer monastic vows; the convent was suppressed in 1524. Of the
                    other old churches may be mentioned St Peter’s, the oldest parish church, though
                    the present buildings date from the 13th century only, and formerly the
                    meeting-place of the citizens; the Dominican church (13th century), in the choir
                    of which the cantonal library of 80,000 volumes has been stored since 1873; the
                    church of the Austin friars (14th century), now used by tho Old Catholics; and
                    the Wasserkirche. The last-named church is on the site of an old pagan holy
                    place, where the patron saints of the city were martyred; since 1631 it has
                    housed the city library, the largest in Switzerland, which contains 120,000
                    printed volumes and 4000 MSS. (among these being letters of Zwingli, Bullinger,
                    and Lady Jane Grey), as well as a splendid collection of objects from the lake
                    dwellings of Switzerland. The building itself was erected 1479 to 1484, and near
                    it is a statue of Zwingli, erected in 1885. The existing council house dates
                    from 1698, and the guild houses were mostly rebuilt in the 18th century. Among
                    the modern buildings the polytechnic school, the cantonal school, the reading
                    rooms (museum), the hospital, and the railway station are the most conspicuous.
                    There are some fine old fountains (the oldest dating back to 1568). The quays
                    along the river and the lake are extensive and afford fine views; and there are
                    several good bridges, Roman traces being still seen in the case of the
                    Niederbrücke. The mound of the Lindenhof was formerly crowned by the king’s
                    house, which disappeared in the 13th century, and the hillock was planted with
                    limes as early as 1422. Zurich possesses a large number of charitable
                    institutions.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants are very industrious and of social habits among themselves, the
                    town being noted for its clubs and societies. It is the intellectual capital of
                    German-speaking Switzerland, and has been called “Athens on the Limmat.”
                    Cotton-spinning and the manufacture of machinery are two of the leading
                    industries, but by far the most important of all is the silk trade. This
                    flourished in Zurich in the 12th and 13th centuries, but disappeared about 1420;
                    it was revived by the Protestant exiles from Locarno (1555) and by the Huguenot
                    refugees from France (1682 and 1685). The value of the silk annually exported
                    (mainly to France, the United States, and England) is estimated at £2,916,000 to
                    £3,333,000. The trade employs about 20,000 hand looms and 4500 steam-power
                    looms; but the number of the former is diminishing, while that of the latter is
                    increasing. Poor wine is also made. Zurich is the banking centre of Switzerland.
                    There are a large number of educational establishments, public and private.
                    Besides the excellent primary and secondary schools, there are the cantonal
                    school, including a gymnasium and a technical side (opened 1842), and a high
                    school for girls (opened 1875). The cantonal university and the Federal
                    polytechnic school are housed in the same building, but have no other connexion.
                    The university was founded in 1832-33 (no doubt as a successor to the ancient
                    chapter school at the Gross Münster, said to date back to Charlemagne’s
                    time—hence its name the Carolinum—reorganized at the Reformation, and suppressed
                    in 1832); in 1886 it had 51 professors and 481 matriculated students, besides 65
                    persons attending special courses of lectures. The polytechnic school, founded
                    in 1854, includes six main sections (industrial chemistry, mechanics,
                    engineering, training of scientific and mathematical teachers, architecture,
                    forestry and agriculture), and a general philosophical, mathematical, and
                    literary department. The numbers of students in the first three sections were,
                    in 1885, 122, 97, and 90—in all the six 412, of whom 192 were foreigners; there
                    were about fifty-four professors. The polytechnic school has good collections of
                    botanical specimens and of engravings. Near it is the observatory (1542 feet).
                    There are also in Zurich many institutions for special branches of education—
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> veterinary surgery, music, industrial art,
                    silk-weaving, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The earliest inhabitants of the future site of
                    Zurich were the lake dwellers. The Celtic Helvetians had a settlement on the
                    Lindenhof when they were succeeded by the Romans, who established a customs
                    station here for goods going to and coming from Italy; during their rule
                    Christianity was introduced early in the 3d century by Felix and Regula, with
                    whom Exuperantius was afterwards associated. The district was later occupied by
                    the Alemanni, who were conquered by the Franks. It is not till the 9th century
                    that we find the beginnings of the Teutonic town of Zurich, which arose from the
                    union of four elements: — (1 ) the royal house and castle on the Lindenhof, with
                    the king’s tenants around, (2) the Gross Münster, (3) the Frau Münster, (4) the
                    community of “free men” (of Alemannian origin) on the Zürichberg. The Frankish
                    kings had special rights over their tenants, were the protectors of the two
                    churches, and had jurisdiction over the free community. In 870 the sovereign
                    placed his powers over all four in the hands of a single official (the
                    Reichsvogt), and the union was still further strengthened by the wall built
                    round the four settlements in the 10th century as a safeguard against Saracen
                    marauders and feudal barons. The Reichsvogtei passed to the counts of Lenzburg
                    (1063-1172), and then to the dukes of Zäringen (extinct 1218). Meanwhile the
                    abbess of the Frau Münster had been acquiring extensive rights and privileges
                    over all the inhabitants, though she never obtained the criminal jurisdiction.
                    The town flourished greatly in the 12th and 13th centuries, the silk trade being
                    introduced from Italy. In 1218 the Reichsvogtei passed back into the hands of
                    the king, who appointed one of the burghers as his deputy, the town thus
                    becoming a free imperial city under the nominal rule of a distant sovereign. The
                    abbess in 1234 became a princess of the empire, but power rapidly passed from
                    her to the council, which she had originally named to look after police,
                    &amp;c., but which (c. 124C) came to be elected by the burghers, though the
                    abbess <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n880/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0880-0831"/> was still “the lady of Zurich.” This council was
                    made up of the representatives of certain knightly and rich mercantile families
                    (the “patricians”), who excluded the craftsmen from all share in the government,
                    though it was to these last that the town was largely indebted for its rising
                    wealth and importance.</p>
                <p>In October 1291 the town made an alliance with Uri and Schwyz, and in 1292 failed
                    in a desperate attempt to seize the Hapsburg town of Winterthur. After that
                    Zurich began to display strong Austrian Leanings, which characterize much of its
                    later history. In 1315 the men of Zurich fought against the Swiss Confederates
                    at Morgarten. The year 1336 marks the admission of the craftsmen to a share in
                    the town government, which was brought about by Rudolph Brun, a patrician. Under
                    the new constitution (the main features of which lasted till 1798) the council
                    was made up of thirteen members from the “constafel” (including the old
                    patricians and the wealthiest burghers) and the thirteen masters of the craft
                    guilds, each of the twenty-six holding office for six months. The office of
                    burgomaster was created and given to Brun for life. Out of this change arose a
                    quarrel with one of the branches of the Hapsburg family, in consequence of which
                    Brun was induced to throw in the lot of Zurich with the Swiss Confederation (1st
                    May 1351). The double position of Zurich as a free imperial city and as a member
                    of the Everlasting League was soon found to be embarrassing to both parties (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Switzerland,</hi> vol. xxii. p. 784 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.).</hi> Meanwhile the town had been extending its rule far beyond its
                    walls,—a process which began in the 13th century, went on apace in the 14th, and
                    attained its height in the 15th century (1268-1467). This thirst for territorial
                    aggrandizement brought about the first civil war in the Confederation (the “Old
                    Zurich War,” 1436-50), in which, at the fight of St Jacob on the Sihl (1443),
                    under the walls of Zurich, the men of Zurich were completely beaten and their
                    burgomaster Stüssi slain. The purchase of the town of Winterthur from the
                    Hapsburgs (1467) marks the culmination of the territorial power of the city. It
                    was to the men of Zurich and their leader Hans Waldmann that the victory of
                    Morat (1476) was due in the Burgundian War; and Zurich took a leading part in
                    the Italian campaign of 1512-15, the burgomaster Schmid naming the new duke of
                    Milan (1512). No doubt her trade connexions with Italy led her to pursue a
                    southern policy, traces of which are seen as early as 1331 in an attack on the
                    Val Leventina and in 1478, when Zurich men were in the van at the fight of
                    Giornico, won by a handful of Confederates over 12,000 Milanese troops.</p>
                <p>In 1400 the town received from the emperor the Reichsvogtei, which carried with
                    it complete immunity from the empire and the right of criminal jurisdiction. As
                    early as 1393 the chief power had practically fallen into the hands of the
                    council of 200 (really 212), composed of the former council and a number of
                    other citizens originally elected by it; and in 1498 this change was formally
                    recognized. This transfer of all power to the guilds had been one of the aims of
                    the burgomaster Hans Waldmann (1483-89), who wished to make Zurich a great
                    commercial centre. He also introduced many financial and moral reforms, and
                    subordinated the interests of the country districts to those of the town. He
                    practically ruled the Confederation, and under him Zurich became the real
                    capital of the League. But such great changes excited opposition, and he was
                    overthrown and executed. His main ideas were embodied, however, in the
                    constitution of 1498, by which the patricians became the first of the guilds,
                    and which remained in force till 1798; some special rights were also given to
                    the subjects in country districts. It was, however, the prominent part taken by
                    Zurich in adopting and propagating the principles of the Reformation which
                    finally secured for it the lead of the Confederation; for a detailed account of
                    its policy and the events in which it shared during this period, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Switzerland</hi> (vol. xxii. p. 790 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Zwingli.</hi></p>
                <p>In the 17th and 18th centuries a distinct tendency becomes observable in the city
                    government to limit power to the actual holders. Thus the country districts were
                    consulted for the last time in 1620 and 1640; and a similar breach of the
                    charters of 1489 and 1531 occasioned disturbances in 1777. The council of 200
                    came to be chosen by a small committee of the members of the guilds actually
                    sitting in the council, and early in the 18th century a determined effort was
                    made to crush by means of heavy duties the flourishing silk trade in Winterthur.
                    In 1655 an attempt was made by Bern and Zurich to set up a central
                    administration in the Confederation, which failed through the jealousy of the
                    other cantons. The first symptoms of active discontent appeared later among the
                    dwellers by the lake, who founded in 1794 a club at Stäfa and claimed the
                    restoration of the liberties of 1489 and 1531, a movement which was put down by
                    force of arms in 1795. The old system of government perished in Zurich, as
                    elsewhere in Switzerland, in 1798, and under the Helvetic constitution the
                    country districts obtained political liberty. But under the cantonal
                    constitution of 1815 the town had 130 representatives in the great council,
                    while the country districts had only 88. A great meeting at Uster on 22d
                    November 1830 demanded that two-thirds of the members in the great council
                    should be chosen by the country districts; and in 1831 a new constitution was
                    drawn up on these lines, though it was not till 1837-38 that the town finally
                    lost the last relics of the privileges which it had so long enjoyed as compared
                    with the country districts. In 1833 Zurich tried hard to secure a revision of
                    the Federal constitution and a strong central Government. The town was the
                    Federal capital for 1839-40, and consequently the victory of the Conservative
                    party there caused a great stir throughout Switzerland. But, when in 1845 the
                    Radicals regained power at Zurich, which was again the Federal capital for
                    1845-46, that city took the lead in opposing the Sonderbund cantons. In 1869 the
                    cantonal constitution was again thoroughly revised in a very democratic sense;
                    and, with the exception of a few changes made later, it is the existing
                    constitution. There is an executive of seven members and a legislature of 211
                    (one member to every 1500 inhabitants), each holding office for three years and
                    elected at the same time directly by the vote of the people. The referendum
                    exists in both forms, compulsory and optional: all laws and all money grants of
                    a total sum over 250,000 francs or an annual sum of 20,000 must be submitted to
                    a popular vote, the people meeting for that purpose at least twice in each year,
                    while the executive may submit to a popular vote any other matter, though it
                    fall within its powers as defined by law. One-third of the members of the
                    legislature or 5000 legally qualified voters can force the Government to submit
                    to the people any matter whatsoever (initiative). The constitution provides for
                    the imposition of a graduated and progressive income tax. In 1885 the penalty of
                    death was abolished in the canton. Zurich has sheltered many political refugees
                    of late years, especially Poles and Russians; but its hospitality has been
                    abused by the Socialists, who have given considerable trouble. The Swiss
                    National Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition was held at Zurich in 1883.</p>
