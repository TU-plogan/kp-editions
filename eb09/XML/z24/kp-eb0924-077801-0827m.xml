                <p><label type="entry">ZENO</label>, emperor of the East from 474 to 491, was an
                    Isaurian of noble birth, and originally bore the name of Trascalissaeus, which
                    he exchanged for that of Zeno on his marriage with Ariadne, daughter of Leo I.,
                    in 468. Of his early life nothing is known; after his marriage (which was
                    designed by Leo to secure the Isaurian support against his ambitious minister
                    Aspar) he became patrician and commander of the imperial guard and of the armies
                    in the East. While on a campaign in Thrace he narrowly escaped assassination;
                    and on his return to the capital he avenged himself by compassing the murder of
                    Aspar, who had instigated the attempt. In 474 Leo I. died after appointing as
                    his successor Leo the son of Zeno and Ariadne; Zeno, however, with the help of
                    his mother-in-law Verina, succeeded in getting himself crowned also, and on the
                    death of his son before the end of the year became sole emperor. In the
                    following year, in consequence of a revolt fomented by Verina in favour of her
                    brother Basiliscus, he was compelled to take refuge in Isauria, whither he was
                    pursued by Illus and Trocundus, two of the usurper’s generals, and where, after
                    sustaining a defeat, he was compelled to shut himself up in a strong castle.
                    Basiliscus, however, soon outstripped Zeno in avarice, cruelty, and
                    self-indulgence, and the vicissitudes of war and intrigue ultimately enabled the
                    latter to re-enter Constantinople unopposed (July 477), while his rival was
                    banished to Phrygia, where he soon afterwards died. The remainder of Zeno’s
                    reign was disturbed by numerous other less formidable revolts, and it was to
                    relieve himself of the pressure of one of these that in 487 he gave <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Theodoric</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> permission to
                    invade Italy and dethrone Odoacer, which led to the establishment of the
                    Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy. At an earlier period of his reign (476) Zeno had
                    received the deputation from the Roman senate which announced the deposition of
                    Romulus Augustulus. In ecclesiastical history the name of Zeno is associated
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Henoticon</hi> or instrument of union, promulgated by
                    him and signed by all the Eastern bishops, with the design of terminating the
                    Monophysite controversy. The document, which is given by Evagrius (<hi
                    rend="italic">H. E</hi>., iii. 14), re-affirms the doctrine of the
                    Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed, and renews the condemnation of Nestorius
                    pronounced by the council of Ephesus, but adroitly avoids the crucial point as
                    to the unity or duality of natures in the Incarnate Word, treating this as an
                    open question.</p>
