                <p><label type="entry">ZINC</label>, the name both of an important useful metal and
                    of the element of which the metal consists. Zinc as a component of brass had
                    currency in metallurgy long before it became known as an individual metal.
                    Aristotle refers to the alleged fact that the Mossinecians produced a bright and
                    light-coloured χαλκός, not by addition of tin, but by fusing up with an earth.
                    Pliny explicitly speaks of a mineral <hi rend="italic">cadmia</hi> as serving
                    for the conversion of copper into <hi rend="italic">aurichalcum,</hi> and says
                    further that the deposit (of ZnO) formed in the brass furnaces could be used
                    instead of the mineral. The same process was used for centuries after Pliny, but
                    its rationale was not understood. Stahl, as late as 1702, quoted the formation
                    of brass as a case of the union of a metal with an earth into a metallic
                    compound; but he subsequently adopted the view propounded by Kunkel in 1677,
                    that cadmia is a metallic caix, and that it dyes the copper yellow by giving its
                    metal up to it. In 1597 Libavius described a “peculiar kind of tin” which was
                    prepared in India, and of which a friend had given him a quantity. From his
                    account it is quite clear that that metal was zinc, but he did not recognize it
                    as the metal of calamine. It is not known to whom the discovery of isolated zinc
                    is due; but we do know that the art of zinc-smelting was practised in England
                    from about 1730. The first Continental zinc-works were erected at Liége in 1807.
                    The atomic weight of zinc is 65∙37 (the mean of the results obtained by Marignac
                    and Baubigny), O = 16.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Zinc Ores.—</hi> The following may be named as important.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Red Zine Ore</hi> (impure ZnO) occurs in quartz-like
                    crystals, but more frequently presents itself in large-grained and lamellar
                    masses. Sp. gr. 5∙4 to 5∙7. Colour, hyacinth-red to brown. Lustre,
                    adamantine.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Franklinite</hi> (RO.M <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, where R stands for Zn, Fe, Μη; M for Fe, Mn). The zinc
                    averages about 10 per cent. It crystallizes in regular octahedra, with
                    rounded-off edges and angles. Sp. gr. 5∙1. Colour, black; streak, reddish-brown.
                    Lustre, sub-metallic. This and the preceding occur in association with each
                    other and other things in New Jersey, U.S.</p>

                    massive, and is contaminated, often largely, with clay, silica, oxide of iron,
                    and the like. Sp. gr. 4 to 4∙5. Sometimes colourless, but as a rule light grey,
                    yellow, or buff-coloured. Lustre, vitreous. It is found in association with
                    silicates of zinc, zinc-blende, and lead ores, chiefly in limestone and
                    dolomitic strata, at the Kelmisberg or Vieille Montagne in Belgium, in
                    Derbyshire and Northumberland, and in Silesia; but these last deposits are well
                    nigh exhausted. Irregular deposits occur near Santander and Cartagena in Spain,
                    and in Sardinia. At Wiesloch in Baden a yellow variety is found, which contains
                    as much as 3 per cent. of cadmium. Smaller percentages of cadmium are met with
                    in many other zinc ores.</p>

                    on account of the marked hemimorphism in its (ortho-rhombic) crystals. Sp. gr.
                    3∙35 to 3∙5. Sometimes colourless, but more frequently grey, yellow, red, green,
                    brown, blue,—always, however, light-coloured. Lustre, vitreous. The crystals,
                    when heated, exhibit electric polarity; hence the name. As a rule they are small
                    and united into cuneiform, spheroidal, or kidney-shaped masses; there are also
                    granular, dense, and earthy varieties. It occurs with willemite and calamine at
                    the Altenberg near Aix-la-Chapelle, with blende and lead ore at Raibel and
                    Bleiberg in Carinthia, near Iserlohn in Westphalia, at Matlock in Derbyshire,
                    near Tarnowitz in Silesia, at Olbucs, Rezbanya in Hungary, and Nertchinsk in
                    Siberia. American sources are at Phoenixville and Friedenswille in Pennsylvania
                    and in the Austin mine in Virginia.</p>

                    (ZnS).—The five ores mentioned above, as indeed all oxidized zinc ores, having
                    become scarce, most of the zinc which now occurs in commerce is derived from
                    zinc-blende. This ore crystallizes in combinations of the two tetrahedra and
                    other forms of the regular system. Sp. gr. 3∙9 to 4∙2. Colour, green, yellow,
                    red, but mostly brown or black. Colourless crystals are scarce. Lustre, fatty or
                    diamond-like. The ordinary ore forms crypto-crystalline or fibrous or granular
                    masses, which sometimes present the form of kidneys, consisting of concentric
                    layers. The finest crystals are found in Franklin, New Jersey, which are
                    colourless and consist of pure ZnS, and in the Penas de Europa, Asturias
                    (Spain), in which liquid enclosures are often met with. The darker varieties,
                    which always include more or less of foreign sulphides, are found in a great
                    number of places. In Cornwall, Wales, Alston Moor in Cumberland, Teesdale in
                    Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and the Isle of Man dark-coloured blende is found in the
                    lead-mining districts with galena, quartz, and limestone. In Belgium and on the
                    Rhine massive blende occurs with iron pyrites and galena; this ore requires a
                    great deal of sorting to become fit for smelting. In Sweden blende is frequently
                    found: at Ammeberg on Lake Wetter a vast deposit occurs in the gneiss. To
                    English miners blende is known as “black Jack,” to the South Americans as
                    “chumbe.” The principal American deposits are in Missouri.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metallurgy.—</hi> Oxide of zinc, like most heavy metallic
                    oxides, is easily reduced to the metallic state by heating it to redness with
                    charcoal; but, as zinc has the exceptional property of being readily volatile at
                    the temperature of its reduction, the operation must be carried out in some kind
                    of retort, and the zinc be recovered as a distillate. To pure red zinc ore the
                    operation of distilling with charcoal might be applied quite directly; and the
                    same might be done with pure calamine of any kind, because the carbonic acid of
                    carbonate of zinc goes off below redness and the silica of silicate of zinc only
                    retards, but does not prevent, the reducing action of the charcoal. Zinc-blende,
                    however, being sulphide of zinc, is not directly reducible by charcoal; but it
                    is easy to convert it into oxide by roasting: the sulphur goes off as sulphurous
                    acid, whilst the zinc remains in the (infusible) form of oxide, ZnO. In
                    practice, however, we never have to deal with pure zinc minerals, but with
                    complex mixtures, which must first of all be subjected to mechanical operations,
                    to remove at least part of the gangue, and if possible also of the heavy
                    metallic impurities (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Metallurgy,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 59
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> And, supposing this to be done, the ore, even if it
                    is not blende, must be roasted, in order to remove all volatile components as
                    completely as possible, because these, if allowed to remain, would carry away a
                    large proportion of the zinc vapour during the distillation. If the zinc is
                    present as blende, this operation offers considerable difficulties, because in
                    the roasting process the sulphide of zinc passes in the first instance into
                    sulphate, which demands a high temperature for its conversion into oxide.
                    Another point to be considered in this connexion is that the masses of
                    sulphurous acid evolved, being destructive of vegetable life, are an intolerable
                    nuisance to the neighbourhood in which the operations take place.</p>
                <p>Hasenclever and Helbig have constructed a furnace by which some two-thirds of the
                    sulphurous acid can be conducted into chambers and condensed into the useful
                    form of oil of vitriol. Figs. 1, 2, and 3 show how the furnace is constructed.
                    <hi rend="italic">k</hi> is a Siemens gas furnace, <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    being the orifice for the introduction of the fuel; the gases go out at <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> where they mix with air; the flame travels between the
                    sole <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and the bottom of the muffle <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi>, and then goes along the top of the muffle to the flue <hi rend="italic"
                    >q;</hi> it passes below the slanting canal <hi rend="italic">bb</hi> and keeps
                    it at a temperature above the fusing-point of antimony (432° C.). The ore is
                    introduced through the funnel <hi rend="italic">a</hi>; it slides down the
                    slanting canal <hi rend="italic">bb;</hi> the partition walls <hi rend="italic"
                    >d, d,</hi> which follow each other at distances of half a metre, compel it to
                    spread out evenly into a thin layer. The partition walls, as shown by fig. 3,
                    are arranged so that the gases coming from the muffle must travel along an
                    undulating line and lick up as much as possible of the sulphur of the ore. From
                    the last compartment <hi rend="italic">e</hi> the gaseous product goes first to
                    a cooling chamber, and thence to the vitriol chamber. The hollow cylinder <hi
                    rend="italic">f,</hi> which is cooled internally by air while made to revolve,
                    conveys the ore in instalments from the bottom end of the canal to the muffle.
                    At intervals of two hours it is spread evenly on the bottom of the muffle, and
                    at last it is drawn out through <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and transferred to the
                    sole <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> to be finally roasted (“todtgerostet”) there. The
                    apparatus works very satisfactorily even with ores poor in sulphur. An ore
                    containing 20 per cent. of sulphur contained at the end <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    of the inclined canal 10 per cent., at the end <hi rend="italic">o</hi> of the
                    muffle 6∙4 per cent., and at last, when “todtgerostet,” only 1∙2. About
                    one-third of the sulphur is lost, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> goes out through
                    the chimney, as SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ∙</p>
                <p>The distillation process in former times, especially in England, used to be
                    carried out “per descensum.” The bottom of a crucible is perforated by a pipe
                    which projects into the crucible to about two-thirds of its height. The powdery
                    mixture of ore and charcoal is put into the crucible around the pipe, the
                    crucible closed by a luted-on lid, and placed in a furnace constructed so as to
                    permit of the lower end of the pipe projecting into the ash-pit. The zinc vapour
                    produced descends through the pipe and condenses into liquid zinc, which is
                    collected in a ladle held under the outlet end of the pipe. For manufacturing
                    purposes a furnace similar to that used for the making of glass was employed to
                    heat a circulai· row of crucibles standing on a shelf along the wall of the
                    furnace. This system, however, has long been abandoned; at present one or other
                    of the following methods is used as a rule.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n835/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0835-0786"/>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Belgian process</hi> the reduction and distillation are
                    carried out in cylindrical retorts of fire-clay, about a metre long and 0∙15
                    metre wide inside. Some forty-six or more retorts, arranged in eight parallel
                    horizontal rows, are heated in one furnace. The furnaces are square and open in
                    front, to allow the outlet ends of the retorts to project; they are grouped
                    together by fours; and their several chimneys are within the same enclosure.
                    Each retort is provided with two adapters, namely, a conical pipe of fire-clay,
                    about 0∙4 metre long, which fits into the retort end, and a conical tube of
                    black sheet iron, which fits over the end of the fire-clay pipe, and which at
                    its outlet end is only 2 centimetres wide. To start a new furnace, the front
                    side is closed provisionally by a brick wall, a fire lighted inside, and the
                    temperature raised very gradually to a white heat. After four days’ heating the
                    provisional front wall is removed piecemeal, and the retorts, after having been
                    heated to redness, are inserted in corresponding sets. The charge of the retorts
                    consists of a mixture of 1100 lb of roasted calamine and 550 lb of dry powdered
                    coal per furnace. A newly-started furnace, however, is used for a time with
                    smaller charges. Supposing the last of these preliminary distillations to have
                    been completed, the residues left in the retorts are removed and the retorts, as
                    they lie in the hot furnace, are charged by means of semi-cylindrical shovels,
                    and their adapters put on. The charging operation being completed, the
                    temperature is raised, and as a consequence an evolution of carbonic oxide soon
                    begins, and becomes visible by the gas bursting out into the characteristic blue
                    flame. After a time the flame becomes dazzling white, showing that zinc vapour
                    is beginning to escape. The iron adapters are now slipped on without delay, and
                    left on for two hours, when, as a matter of experience, a considerable amount of
                    zinc has gone out of the retort, the greater part into the fire-clay adapter,
                    the rest into the iron cone. The former contains a mixture of semi-solid and
                    molten metal, which is raked out into iron ladles and cast into plates of 66 to
                    77 lb weight, to be sold as “spelter.” The contents of the iron recipient
                    consist of a powdery mixture of oxide and metal, which is added to the next
                    charge, except what is put aside to be sold as “zinc dust.” This dust may amount
                    to 10 per cent. of the total production. As soon as the adapters have been
                    cleared of their contents, they are replaced, and again left to themselves for
                    two hours, to be once more emptied and replaced, &amp;c. The complete exhaustion
                    of the charge of a furnace takes about 11 hours.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Silesian process</hi> the distillation is conducted in
                    specially constructed muffles, which are arranged in two parallel rows within a
                    low-vaulted furnace, pretty much like the pots in a glass furnace. As a rule
                    every furnace accommodates ten muffles. Through an orifice in the outlet pipe
                    (which during the distillation is closed by a loose plug) a hot iron rod can be
                    introduced from time to time to clear the canal of any solid zinc that may
                    threaten to obstruct it. As soon as the outlet pipe has become sufficiently hot
                    the zinc flows through it and collects in conveniently placed receptacles. About
                    6 or 8 hours after starting the distillation is in full swing, and in 24 hours
                    it is completed. A fresh charge is then put in at once, the muffles being
                    cleared only after three successive distillations. The distillate consists of a
                    conglomerate of drops (“drop zinc”). It is fused up in iron basins lined with
                    clay, and cast out into the customary form of cakes. In some modern works the
                    muffles are heated by means of Siemens’s regenerative gas furnace, by which a
                    more uniform heat can be secured and maintained at a less cost.</p>
                <p>Of the several metallic impurities in zinc ores iron is at once the most common
                    and the least objectionable, because it is absolutely non-volatile at the
                    temperature of a zinc retort; whenever commercial zinc contains iron, this comes
                    from its having been re-fused in iron vessels after its distillation. Lead,
                    though hardly volatile by itself at a red heat, if present in the ore, is, so to
                    say, carried over by the zinc vapour and passes at least partly into the
                    distillate. Cadmium and arsenic being more volatile than zinc itself, if
                    present, accumulate in the first fractions of the distillate, but may pervade it
                    in traces to the end. Zinc made from oxidized ores is usually free from arsenic;
                    that derived from blende is almost sure to contain it. This in practice is
                    equivalent to saying that, while in former times it was easy, it is now very
                    difficult, to obtain in commerce zinc free from arsenic. Traces of arsenic do
                    not, however, interfere with any of the technical applications of the metal. As
                    for cadmium, it is not (metallurgically speaking) an impurity at all, but, like
                    silver in lead, a rather desirable admixture which it may be worth while to
                    extract.</p>
                <p>No reliable method is known by which commercial zinc could be purified so as to
                    render it fit for all the purposes of the analyst; the only way to obtain really
                    pure zinc is to prepare it from pure oxide by distillation with charcoal in a
                    non-metallic retort.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Properties of Pure Zinc.—</hi> Zinc, a bluish-white metal,
                    fuses at 415° C. and under ordinary atmospheric pressure boils at 1040° C.
                    (Deville and Troost). The molten metal on cooling deposits crystals, and at last
                    freezes into a compact crystalline solid, which may be brittle or ductile
                    according to circumstances. According to Bolley, if zinc be cast into a mould at
                    a red heat, the ingot produced is laminar and brittle; if cast at just the
                    fusing-point, it is granular and sufficiently ductile to be rolled into sheet at
                    the ordinary temperature. According to some authorities, pure zinc always yields
                    ductile ingots. A clue to the explanation of these anomalous facts is afforded
                    by certain observations of Gustav Rose and others, from which it appears that
                    zinc is dimorphous and may or may not crystallize in the regular system.
                    Supposing a mass of molten zinc to freeze into, say, cubes, the ingot will be
                    ductile; an ingot of, say, rhombohedra, on the other hand, is almost bound to be
                    brittle, because the crystals are orientated in a lawless fashion, and, as they
                    cannot be expected to contract at the same rate in all directions, we must be
                    prepared for a brittle ingot. Commercial “spelter” always breaks under the
                    hammer; but at 100° to 150° C. it is susceptible of being rolled out into even a
                    very thin sheet. Such a sheet, if once produced, remains flexible when cold. At
                    about 200° C., again, the metal becomes so brittle that it can be pounded in a
                    mortar. The specific gravity of zinc cannot be expected to be perfectly
                    constant; according to Karsten, that of pure ingot is 6∙915, and rises to 7Ί91
                    after rolling. The coefficient of linear expansion is 0∙002,905 for 100° from 0°
                    upwards (Fizeau). The specific heat is 0∙093,93 (Schüller and Wartha). Compact
                    zinc is bluish white; it does not tarnish much in the air. It is pretty soft,
                    and clogs the file. If zinc be heated up to near its boiling-point, it catches
                    fire and burns with a brilliant light into its powdery white oxide, which forms
                    a reek in the air <hi rend="italic">liana philosophica).</hi> Boiling water
                    attacks it appreciably, but no more, with evolution of hydrogen and formation of
                    hydroxide, Zn(OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. A rod of perfectly pure zinc,
                    when immersed in dilute sulphuric acid, is so very slowly attacked that there is
                    no visible evolution of gas; but, if a piece of platinum or other less basilous
                    metal is brought into contact with the zinc, it dissolves readily, with
                    evolution of hydrogen and formation of sulphate. The ordinary impure metal
                    dissolves at once, the more readily the less pure it is. Cold dilute nitric acid
                    dissolves zinc as nitrate, with evolution of nitrous oxide, N <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, and formation of nitrate of ammonia. At higher
                    temperatures, or with stronger acid, nitric oxide, NO, is produced besides or
                    instead of nitrous.</p>

                    prepared chiefly in two ways,—(1) by burning the metal, a method now being

                    rend="italic">extempore</hi> from a mixture of roasted ore and carbon, and (2)
                    by heating the basic carbonate (see below). It is an infusible solid, which is
                    intensely yellow at a red heat, but on cooling becomes white. This at least is
                    true of the oxide produced from the metal by combustion; that produced from the
                    carbonate, if once made yellow at a red heat, retains a yellow shade
                    permanently. Oxide of zinc is insoluble in water, and does not combine directly
                    with it; it dissolves readily in all aqueous acids, with formation of “zinc
                    salts.” It also dissolves in aqueous caustic alkalies, including ammonia,
                    forming “zincates” <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> ZnO.KHO). Oxide of zinc is used
                    in the arts as a white pigment; it has not by any means the covering power of
                    white lead, but offers the advantage of being non-poisonous and of not becoming
                    discoloured in sulphuretted hydrogen. It is used also in medicine, chiefly
                    externally.</p>

                    otherwise the hydrate re-dissolves. It is a white powder, and is insoluble in
                    water. To acids and to alkalies it behaves like the oxide, but dissolves more

                    and C. Meyer). Chloride of zinc is extremely hygroscopic; it dissolves in a
                    fraction of its weight of even cold water, forming a syrupy solution. A solution
                    of chloride of zinc is easily produced from metal and hydrochloric acid, but it
                    cannot be evaporated to dryness without considerable decomposition of the
                    hydrated salt into oxy-chloride and hydrochloric acid. A concentrated solution
                    of chloride of zinc converts starch, cellulose, and a great many other organic
                    bodies into soluble compounds; hence the application of the fused salt as a
                    caustic in surgery, and the impossibility of filtering a strong ZnCl <hi

                    three of finely powdered oxide of zinc free from carbonic acid. On the other

                    Immediately before use the powder is made into a paste with the solution; it
