                    rend="italic">cornetti diritti, cornetti muti)</hi> were usually made with the
                    mouthpiece (a cupped mouthpiece analogous to that of the trumpet) forming part
                    of the tube. The curved (Germ. <hi rend="italic">krumme Zincken</hi>; Ital. <hi
                    rend="italic">cornetti curvi)</hi> are formed of two pieces of wood of different
                    lengths, each having half the channel in which the column of air is to vibrate
                    hollowed out, the diameter increasing from the mouthpiece towards the lower end.
                    The two pieces of wood, when thus prepared, are joined together with glue; they
                    are then finished off so as to form a pipe with eight sides, and are finally
                    covered with leather. The mouthpieces are made of wood, horn, or ivory, and are
                    fixed by a tenon to the upper extremity of the pipe. The primitive instrument
                    was an animal’s horn. Pipes of such small length give only, besides the first or
                    fundamental, the second and sometimes the third note of the harmonic series.
                    Thus, a pipe that has for its fundamental note A will, if the pressure of the
                    lips be steadily increased, give the octave A and the twelfth E. To connect
                    diatonically the first and second, the length of the pipe was progressively
                    shortened, by making holes in its substance for the fingers to cover. The
                    opening of these holes successively furnished the instrumentalist with the
                    different intervals of the scale, six holes sufficing for this purpose: The
                    fundamental was thus connected with its octave by all the degrees of a diatonic
                    scale which could become chromatic by the help of cross fingerings and greater
                    or less pressure of the lips within the mouthpiece. The fingering was completed
                    by a seventh hole, which had for its object the production of the octave without
                    the necessity of closing all the holes in order to produce the second note of
                    the harmonic series. The first complete octave, thus obtained by a succession of
                    fundamental notes, is easily octaved by a stronger pressure of the lips against
                    the mouthpiece, and thus the ordinary limits of the compass of a zincke or
                    cornet extend to a fifteenth. Whether straight or curved, it is pierced
                    laterally with seven holes, six through the front and the seventh, that nearest
                    to the mouthpiece, through the back. The first three holes were usually covered
                    with the third, second, and first fingers of the right hand, the next four with
                    the third, second, and first fingers and the thumb of the left hand. But some
                    instrumentalists inverted the position of the hands. Virdung<note

                    made of an animal’s horn with only four holes, three at the back of the pipe and
                    one in front. Such an instrument as this had naturally a very limited compass,
                    since with the help of these four holes only the intermediate notes between the
                    second and third proper tones of the harmonic scale could be produced, the lower
                    octave comprised between the first and second remaining incomplete. At the

                    the zincken as a complete family arranged thus :—(1) the little zincke, of which
                    the lowest note was that showm in (i.); (2) the ordinary zincke, with lowest

                    France the family was composed of the following instruments:—(1) the <hi
                    rend="italic">dessus,</hi> with lowest note (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>); (2) the

                    note (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>). Numbers (2), (3), and (4) in this last series
                    were sometimes furnished with an open key, which, when the closed tube was
                    lengthened, augmented the compass downwards by a note.</p>
                <p>During the Middle Ages these instruments were in such favour that an important
                    part was given to them in all instrumental combinations. In Germany, in the 18th
                    century, they were used with trombones in the churches to accompany the
                    chorales. There are examples of this employment in the sacred cantatas of J. S.
                    Bach. Monteverde made use of them in his opera <hi rend="italic">Orfeo</hi> in
                    1608, as did Gluck in the opening chorus of his <hi rend="italic">Orfeo,</hi>
                    played at Vienna in 1762. The great vogue of the zincke is not to be accounted
                    for by its musical qualities; for it has a hard, hoarse, piercing sound, and it
                    failed utterly in truth of intonation; and these natural defects could only be
                    modified with great difficulty. It is now hard to understand Mersenne’s eulogium
                    of the <hi rend="italic">dessus,</hi> then more employed than the other cornets,
                    “because it was used in vocal concerts and to make the treble with the organ,
                    which is ravishing when one knows how to play it to perfection, like the Sieur
                    Quiclet,” and, farther on, “as to the property of its tone, it resembles the
                    brilliancy of a sunbeam piercing the darkness, when it is heard among the voices
                    in churches, cathedrals, or chapels.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">serpent</hi> is another instrument of the cornet family,
                    though not usually classed with it. Its construction and its acoustic principle
                    are the same as those of the old cornet. It is, properly speaking, an enlarged
                    cornet with one hole less, that which is stopped with the thumb. The mouthpiece
                    is fixed to the instrument by means of a long brass crook. A detailed account of
                    the serpent and its congeners is given under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ophicleide</hi> (vol. xvii. p. 778). The zincke or cornet has now entirely
                    disappeared, and the rare specimens still met with are eagerly sought by
                    collectors. The serpent has lasted longest, and even within the last twenty
                    years has been used in many churches in the south of France.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cornet, Cornet</hi> À <hi rend="smallcaps">Pistons.</hi></p>
                <p>At present the names of cornet, cornet à pistons, and cornopean are given to an
                    instrument that has no analogy whatever to the mediaeval cornet. It is a
                    transformation of the old post-horn, with a shorter tube than that of the
                    trumpet, and improved to such a degree that its quality of tone is intermediate
                    between the brightness of the trumpet and the softness of the flügel-horn or
                    bugle with pistons. The extent of the modern cornet without pistons is comprised
                    within the second and eighth of the harmonic scale The seventh, being too flat,
                    owing to a well-known acoustic phenomenon, is rarely used. The cornet à pistons
                    of the highest pitch is in B♭,, and is used for a trumpet in that key. The notes
                    written therefore sound a major second lower than the notation. It is furnished
                    with three pistons, which lower the principal tube by a whole tone (1st piston),
                    a half tone (2d piston), and a tone and a half (3d piston) respectively. It has
                    already been explained under <hi rend="smallcaps">Trombone</hi> how the
                    different pistons are combined to produce the entire chromatic compass of the
                    instrument from the lowest limit</p>
                <p>At first the cornet à pistons was supplied with a great many crooks. There were
                    crooks for A, A♭, G, F, E, E♭, and D; but it is easy to understand that, if the
                    additional tubes put in communication with the principal column of air by means
                    of the pistons are adjusted for the key of Bb, the same additional tubes are too
                    short to fulfil the same office for an instrument lowered to the extent of a
                    minor sixth, as it would be for the key of D. Hence nearly all these crooks have
                    disappeared, only those for B♭, A, and A♭ being retained. The invention of the
                    modern comet, or more exactly the application of pistons to the post-horn, is
                    German, and dates from the first quarter of the 19th century, almost immediately
                    after the invention of pistons by Stölzel and Blümel. It was introduced into
                    Great Britain and France about 1830. There were at first only two pistons,—that
                    of the whole tone and that of the half tone,— from which there naturally
                    resulted gaps in the chromatic scale of the instrument. The history of the
                    cornet is that of the improvement brought about by pistons apart from their
                    successive transformations, and it has remained to the present time what it was
                    when first invented. The great favour the cornet meets with is due to the
                    facility with which it speaks, to the little fatigue it causes, and to the
                    simplicity of its mechanism. We may, however, regret, from the point of view of
                    art, that its success has been so great, and that it has ended by usurping in
                    brass bands the place of the bugles, the quality of their tone being infinitely
                    preferable as a foundation for an ensemble composed exclusively of brass
                    instruments. Even the symphonic orchestra has not been secure from its
                    intrusion. In fact, the cornet is taking the place of the trumpet nearly
                    everywhere, and, if care is not taken, the latter will in a few years have
                    completely disappeared, to the great detriment of orchestral tone colour; for
                    the quality of tone of the cornet can never be an adequate substitute for the
                    brilliant and majestic sonorousness so characteristic of the trumpet. (V.
