                    on a rich plain on the right bank of the Ebro, just above its confluence with
                    the Huerva, 212 miles by rail to the north-east of Madrid. The river is here
                    crossed by a fine stone bridge of seven arches, erected in 1437, and another
                    bridge—of iron—much needed for the convenience of through railway traffic, is
                    projected. Seen from a distance, the city with its numerous domes and towers has
                    an imposing appearance, which it hardly maintains on a nearer approach. The
                    older streets are narrow, gloomy, and ill paved; the massive buildings formerly
                    inhabited by the Aragonese nobility are either in ruins or turned into
                    wood-stores and granaries; and an air of poverty and decay pervades the whole
                    town. By the river side there are public walks and avenues of poplar. The two
                    most important buildings of Zaragoza are its cathedrals, in each of which the
                    chapter resides alternately for six months. La Seo (“The See ”) is the older of
                    the two, dating chiefly from the 14th century; its prevailing style is Gothic,
                    but the oldest portion, the lower portion of the apse, is Byzantine, and the
                    façade is of the Late Pseudo-Classical style, by which so many churches in Spain
                    have been disfigured. The Iglesia Metropolitana del Pilar is the larger and more
                    modern building, dating only from the latter half of the 17th century; it was
                    built after designs by Herrera el Mozo, and owes its name to one of the most
                    venerated objects in Spain, the “pillar” of jasper on which the Virgin is said
                    to have alighted when she manifested herself to Santiago as he passed through
                    Zaragoza. It has no architectural merit; externally its most conspicuous
                    features are its domes, which are decorated with rows of green, yellow, and
                    white glazed tiles. The church of San Pablo dates mainly from the 13th century.
                    Adjoining the church of San Felipe is the Torre Nueva, an octangular clock tower
                    in diapered brickwork, dating from 1504; it leans some 9 or 10 feet from the
                    perpendicular, owing to faulty foundations. Among other conspicuous public
                    buildings are the municipal buildings, the exchange <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Lonja),</hi> and the civil and military hospitals, which are among the largest
                    in Spain. The university was founded in 1474, but its history has not been
                    brilliant. To the west of the town is the Aljaferia or old citadel, an irregular
                    pile originally built as a palace by the Moors and also used as such by its
                    Christian owners. It was afterwards assigned by Ferdinand and Isabella to the
                    Inquisition, and has since been used as barracks, a military hospital, and a
                    prison; it is now unoccupied and falling into decay. The chief manufactures of
                    Zaragoza are silk, woollen cloth, leather, saltpetre, soap, and chocolate; and
                    there is considerable trade in agricultural produce, and in wine and spirits.
                    The population of the town in 1877 was 84,575.</p>
                <p>Zaragoza, the Celtiberian <hi rend="italic">Salduba,</hi> was colonized at the
                    close of the Cantabrian War (25 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) by Augustus, who
                    gave it his own name, <hi rend="italic">Caesarea Augusta,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Caesaraugusta.</hi> It was a colonia immunis and the seat of a
                    conventus juridicus. No remains of the ancient city have been preserved. It was
                    taken by the Goths about 466 and in 712 by the Moors. In 1118 it was recovered
                    by Alonso el Batallador of Aragon after a siege of five years, during which the
                    defenders were reduced by famine to the direst straits. In 1710 Stanhope
                    defeated the French under Philip V. not far from the town. The most memorable
                    recent events in the history of Zaragoza are those which took place during the
                    Napoleonic invasion. In 1808 the citizens rose against the French, and, under
                    the command of <hi rend="smallcaps">Palafox (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v. ),</hi>
                    defended the town for two months. The first siege was raised on 15th August
                    1808; but the respite then gained was not made use of to strengthen the
                    defences, and, when the enemy renewed their attack in greater force in December,
                    the place was compelled to surrender (20th February 1809), after losing in all
                    nearly 60,000 men.</p>
