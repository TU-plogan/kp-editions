                    to the order of his book, among the twelve minor prophets, flourished in the
                    reign of Josiah of Judah, and apparently before the great reformation in the
                    eighteenth year of that king (621 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> For various
                    forms of idolatry put down in that year are spoken of by Zephaniah as still
                    prevalent in Judah (chap. i. 4 <hi rend="italic">sq</hi>.), and are specified in
                    such a connexion as to imply that they were not the secret sins of individuals,
                    but held the first place among the national backslidings that could, as the
                    prophet teaches, be removed only by a sweeping judgment on the state. Of the
                    person of Zephaniah nothing is known; but it has been conjectured that his
                    great-great-grandfather Hezekiah (chap. i. 1) is the king of that name, and if
                    so he belonged to the highest class of Judaean society.</p>
                <p>The genuineness and integrity of the short prophecy ascribed to Zephaniah do not
                    seem to be open to reasonable doubt. Stade (<hi rend="italic">Gesch. Isr.,</hi>
                    i. 644) raises a question about chap. iii., and if this were a distinct oracle
                    there would be no cogent reason to ascribe it to the author of the two chapters
                    that precede; for the book of the minor prophets is made up of a number of short
                    pieces, some bearing a name and some anonymous, and it is only old usage that
                    ascribes the anonymous pieces to the last preceding prophet whose name is
                    prefixed to his prophecy. But, though the sequence of thought in the book of
                    Zephaniah is not so smooth as a Western reader may desire, a single leading
                    motive runs through the whole, and the first two chapters would be incomplete
                    without the third, which moreover is certainly pre-exilic (verses 1-4), and
                    presents specific points of contact with what precedes as well as a general
                    agreement in style and idea.</p>
                <p>The dominating motive of the whole is the approach of a sweeping and world-wide
                    judgment, which the prophet announces as near at hand, and interprets, on the
                    lines laid down by Isaiah in his prophecies about Israel and Assyria, as
                    designed to destroy the wicked and prepare the way for the visible sovereignty
                    of the righteous God of Israel. As regards Judah, which forms the subject of the
                    first and third chapters, the effect of the judgment will be to sift out the
                    idolaters, the men of violence and wrong, the false prophets and profane
                    priests, the hardened men of the world to whom all religion is alike and who
                    deem that the Lord will do neither good nor evil. The men who seek meekness and
                    righteousness will be left, a poor and lowly people, trusting in the name of the
                    Lord and eschewing falsehood. To them a future of gladness is reserved, a
                    peaceful life under Jehovah’s immediate kingship and loving protection. Such an
                    ideal necessarily implies that they shall no longer be threatened by hostility
                    from without, and this condition is satisfied by the prophet’s view of the
                    effect of the impending judgment on the ancient enemies of his nation. The
                    destruction of the Philistines on the west and of Moab and Ammon on the east
                    will enable the Hebrews to extend their settlements from the Mediterranean to
                    the Syrian desert; and their remoter oppressors, the Ethiopians and Assyrians,
                    shall also perish. That Ethiopia appears instead of Egypt is in accordance with
                    the conditions of the time. It was with Ethiopic dynasts holding sway in Egypt
                    that Assyria had to contend during the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> when the petty kingdoms of Palestine were so often crushed between
                    the collision of the two great powers, and even Psammetichus, the contemporary
                    of Josiah, and the restorer of a truly Egyptian kingdom, was nominally the heir
                    of the great Ethiopian sovereigns.</p>
                <p>These conceptions are closely modelled on the scheme of Jehovah’s righteous
                    purpose worked out by Isaiah a century before, when Judah first felt the weight
                    of the Assyrian rod, and they afford the most conclusive evidence of the depth
                    and permanence of that great prophet’s influence. But in one point there is an
                    important divergence. In Isaiah’s view Assyria is the rod of God’s anger; and,
                    when the work of judgment is complete and Jehovah returns to the remnant of His
                    people, the theodicea is completed by the fall of the unconscious instrument of
                    the divine decrees before the inviolable walls of the holy mountain. Zephaniah
                    in like manner looks to an all-conquering nation as the instrument of divine
                    judgment on Judah and the rest of the known world. He represents the day of
                    Jehovah, according to the old meaning of that phrase, as a day of battle (not an
                    assize day); he speaks of the guests invited to Jehovah’s sacrifice, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to a great slaughter, of alarm against fenced cities,
                    of blood poured out as dust, of pillage and desolation at the hand of an enemy.
                    But beyond this all is vague; we neither hear who the sword of Jehovah (ii. 12)
                    is, nor what is to become of him when his work is completed. Isaiah’s
                    construction has in all its parts a definite reference to present political
                    facts, and is worked out to a complete conclusion; Zephaniah borrows the ideas
                    of his predecessor without attaining to his clearness of political conception,
                    and so his picture is incomplete. The foreign conqueror, by whom Judah is to be
                    chastised and Nineveh and Ethiopia destroyed, is brought on to the stage, but
                    never taken off it. It is safe to conclude that the principal actor in the
                    prophetic drama, who is thus strangely forgotten at the last, was not as real
                    and prominent a figure in Zephaniah’s political horizon as Assyria was in the
                    horizon of Isaiah. At the same time it is reasonable to think that so complete a
                    reproduction of Isaiah’s ideas in the picture of a new world-judgment was not
                    formed without some stimulus from without, and this stimulus has been sought in
                    the Scythian invasion of western Asia, to which some of Jeremiah’s earlier
                    prophecies also appear to refer; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Israel,</hi> vol.
                    xiii. p. 415. But from the analysis given in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Scythia</hi> (vol. xxi. p. 577) it is doubtful whether the Scythians had
                    appeared even on the distant horizon at the date of Zephaniah’s prophecy,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Scythians appeared in
                    Media about 619 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and, if they were really Sacae
                    and came from the East, their appearance in Palestine would fall still
                    later.</p></note> while, on the other hand, the movements in the far East which
                    preceded the first siege of Nineveh are chronologically suitable, and appear to
                    afford quite sufficient basis for Zephaniah’s undefined anticipation of a
                    general political convulsion. How the danger that threatened Nineveh stirred the
                    mind of the Hebrews appears also from the prophecy of Nahum.</p>
                <p>Be this as it may, the comparison between Isaiah and Zephaniah affords an
                    instructive example of the difference between original and reproductive
                    prophecy. All the prophets have certain fundamental ideas in common, and each
                    has learned something from his predecessors. If Zephaniah draws from Isaiah,
                    Isaiah himself drew from Amos and Hosea. But Isaiah goes to his predecessors for
                    general principles, and shapes the application of these principles to the
                    conditions of his own time in a manner altogether fresh and independent.
                    Zephaniah, on the other hand, goes to his predecessor for details; he does not
                    clearly distinguish between the form and the substance of the prophetic ideas,
                    and looks for a final consummation of the divine purpose, not only in accordance
                    with the principles of Isaiah, but on the very lines whieh that prophet had laid
                    down. But these lines were drawn on the assumption that the Assyrian judgment
                    was final and would be directly followed by the reign of righteousness. This
                    assumption was not justified by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n830/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0830-0781"/> the event; the deliverance and reformation were
                    incomplete; and the inbringing of the reign of righteousness was again deferred.
                    Zephaniah sees this, but fails to draw the true inference. He postulates a new
                    crisis in history similar to the Assyrian crisis of which Isaiah wrote, and
                    assumes that it will run such a course as to fulfil Isaiah’s unfulfilled
                    predictions. But the movements of history do not repeat themselves; and the
                    workings of God’s righteous providence take fresh shape in each new scene of the
                    world’s life, so that a prediction not fulfilled under the conditions for which
                    it was given can never again be fulfilled in detail. As it is an essential
                    feature of prophecy that all ideas are not only presented but thought out in
                    concrete form, and with reference to present historical conditions, the
                    distinction between the temporary form and the permanent religious truth
                    embodied in that form is also essential. The tendency to confound the two, to
                    ascribe absolute truth to what is mere embodiment, and therefore to regard
                    unfulfilled predictions as simply deferred, even where the form of the
                    prediction is obviously dependent on mere temporary conditions of the prophet’s
                    own time, gained ground from the time of Zephaniah onwards, and culminated in
                    the Apocalyptic literature. As it grew, the eternal ideas of the great prophets
                    fell into the background, and were at length entirely lost in the crass Jewish
                    conception of a Messianic age, which is little more than an apotheosis of
                    national particularism and self righteousness. Zephaniah’s eschatology is not
                    open to this charge: with him, as with Isaiah, the doctrine of the salvation of
                    the remnant of Israel is inspired by spiritual convictions and instinct with
                    ethical force. The emphasis still lies on the moral idea of the remnant, not on
                    the physical conception Israel. He does not yield to Amos or Isaiah in the
                    courage with which he denounces sin in high places, and he is akin to Hosea in
                    his firm hold of the principle that the divine governance is rooted not only in
                    righteousness but in love, and that the triumph of love is the end of Jehovah’s
                    working. Yet even here we see the difference between the first and second
                    generations of prophecy. The persuasion to which Hosea attains only through an
                    intense inward struggle, which lends a peculiar pathos to his book, appears in
                    Zephaniah, as it were, ready made. There is no mental conflict before he can
                    pass through the anticipation of devastating judgment to the assurance of the
                    victory of divine love, and the sharp transitions that characterize the book are
                    not, as with Hosea, due to sudden revulsion of feeling, but only mark the
                    passage to some new topic in the circle of received prophetic truth. The finest
                    thing in the book—in spite of certain obscurities, which may be partly due to
                    corruptions of the text—is the closing passage; but the description of the day
                    of Jehovah, the <hi rend="italic">dies irae dies illa</hi> of chap. i. 15, which
                    furnishes the text of the most striking of mediaeval hymns, has perhaps taken
                    firmer hold of the religious imagination. Least satisfactory is the treatment of
                    the judgment on heathen nations, and of their subsequent conversion to Jehovah.
                    In the scheme of Isaiah it is made clear that the fall of the power that
                    shatters the nations cannot fail to be recognized as Jehovah’s work, for Assyria
                    falls <hi rend="italic">before Jerusalem</hi> as soon as it seeks to go beyond
                    the limits of the divine commission, and thus the doctrine “With <hi
                    rend="italic">us</hi> is God” is openly vindicated before the nations. But
                    Zephaniah assumes that the convulsions of history are Jehovah’s work, and
                    specially designed for the instruction and amendment of Israel (iii. 6 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.),</hi> and neglects to show how this conviction, which he
                    himself derives from Isaiah, is to be brought home by the coming judgment to the
                    heart of heathen nations. Their own gods indeed will prove helpless (ii. 11),
                    but this is not enough to turn their eyes towards Jehovah. Here, therefore,
                    there is in his eschatology a sensible lacuna, from which Isaiah’s construction
                    is free, and a commencement of the tendency to look at things from a merely
                    Israelite standpoint, which is so notable a feature of the later
                    Apocalyptic.</p>
                <p>There is no important separate commentary on Zephaniah; the student must refer to
                    the commentaries on the minor prophets (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hosea).</hi>
                    The relative section in Duhm, <hi rend="italic">Theologie der Propheten,</hi>
                    deserves attention. An apocryphal prophecy ascribed to Zephaniah is quoted by
                    Clement of Alexandria, <hi rend="italic">Stromata,</hi> v. 11, § 78. (W. R.
                    S.)</p>
