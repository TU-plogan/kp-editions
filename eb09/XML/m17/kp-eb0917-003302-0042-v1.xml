                    district in the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces of India,
                    lying between 28° 13' and 29° 15' N. lat. and 78° 7' and 79° 2' E. long., is
                    bounded on the N. by Bijnaur and the Tarâi, on the E. by Râmpur state, on the S.
                    by Budâun, and on the W. by the Ganges. The area is 2284 square miles. It lies
                    within the great Gangetic plain, and is demarcated into three subdivisions by
                    the rivers Râmgangâ and Sôt. The eastern tract consists of a submontane country,
                    with an elevation slightly greater than the plain below, and is traversed by
                    numerous streams descending from the Himâlayas. The central portion consists of
                    a level central plain descending at each end into the valleys of the Râmgangâ
                    and Sôt. The western section has a gentle slope towards the Ganges, with a rapid
                    dip into the lowlands a few miles from the bank of the great river. The district
                    is well wooded throughout, and mango groves abound in the neighbourhood of the
                    flourishing villages which cluster thickly over its whole surface. Cultivation
                    has spread over almost every part, patches of jungle rarely occurring, and only
                    a few stray pieces of sandy soil or <hi rend="italic">usar</hi> waste being
                    found among the uplands. Shallow lakes <hi rend="italic">{jhils)</hi> are found
                    at intervals, and are in every case utilized for irrigation. The district as a
                    whole consists of a well-tilled and somewhat monotonous alluvial plain,
                    unrelieved by any striking natural features.</p>
                <p>The census of 1881 returned the population of the district, exclusive of
                    non-Asiatics, at 1,155,173 (males 610,291, females 544,882), Hindus numbering
                    767,844, Mohammedans 384,713, and native Christians 1877. Murâdâbâd contains
                    five municipal towns, viz., Murâdâbâd, 67,387; Amroha, 36,145; Sambhal, 35,196;
                    Chan-dausi, 27,521; Dhanaura, 5204. The total area under cultivation in 1881-82
                    amounted to 1291 square miles, the staple crops being millets, wheat, pulses,
                    and sugar-caue. As a whole the people are well off and live better than the
                    peasantry in other districts. The labourers too have prospered, wages having
                    risen considerably of late years. About two-sevenths of the cultivators possess
                    hereditary rights, the remainder hold as tenants-at-will. Floods upon the Ganges
                    and Râmgangâ cause much damage to the crops, and the district is liable to
                    famine caused by drought. The last famine in 1868-69 was due to the failure of
                    the rainfall, but with the aid of Government relief the difficulty was tided
                    over without serious losses. The chief exports are grain and sugar-cane. The
                    main line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand railway crosses the district; there are
                    also 654 miles of good road. The total revenue of Murâdâbâd in 1881-82 amounted
                    to 1,775,303 rupees, of which 1,399,450 were derived from the land-tax.
                    Education was carried on in 1881 by means of 181 schools, with an aggregate of
                    5496 pupils. The climate is generally healthy, except in the submontane tract
                    bordering on the Tarâi and in the lowlands of the Ganges and Sot. The average
                    annual rainfall in the ten years ending 1870 was 37 <hi rend="superscript">
                        -</hi> 6 inches. The annual mean temperature is 74° <hi rend="superscript">
                        -</hi> 5 Fahr., the lowest monthly mean being 56° in January, and the
                    highest 86° in June.</p>
                <p>For the early history of Murâdâbâd see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bareli.</hi> It
                    passed into the possession of the British in 1801, and in 1857 joined in the
                    general rebellion of that year. Order was restored early in May 1858.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Murâdâbâd,</hi> town and headquarters of the above district,
                    is situated on the right bank of the Râmgangâ river (28° 49' N. lat., 78° 49' E.
                    long.), with a population in 1881 of 67,387, of whom 34,584 were males, and
                    32,803 females. It was founded in 1625 by Rustâm Khan, who built the fort which
                    overhangs the river bank. The town forms a large centre of trade in country
                    produce. The engraved metal-ware of Murâdâbâd has lately attracted much
                    attention, the total value of the annual output being about 3∣ lakhs of
                    rupees.</p>
