                    in Prussia and formerly the capital of the important bishopric of its own name,
                    lies in a sandy plain about halfway between Cologne and Bremen on the Aa, an
                    insignificant affluent of the Ems. It is one of the best-preserved old towns in

                    structures in Germany, though much disfigured by modern decoration, rebuilt
                    after afire in the 13th and 14th centuries, and exhibiting a combination of
                    Romanesque and Gothic forms; the church of St Ludgerus, originally erected in
                    the Romanesque style in 1170, was extended in the Gothic style in 1383, with a
                    tower terminating in a picturesque lantern; the Liebfrauenkirche is of the 14th
                    century; the old church of St Maurice, founded about 1070, was rebuilt in
                    1859-1862. The room in the town-house in which the peace of Westphalia was
                    signed in 1648 contains portraits of the ambassadors present at the ceremony. On
                    the tower of St Lambert’s church (14th century), the upper part of which has
                    recently been pulled down as insecure, were hung three iron cages in which the
                    bodies of John of Leyden and two of his followers were exposed in 1536 (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Anabaptists).</hi> The old Stadtkeller contains a collection of
                    early German paintings. The university of Münster, founded after the Seven
                    Years’ War and closed at the beginning of this century, is now represented by an
                    academy with the rank of a university, possessing faculties of philosophy and
                    theology (Roman Catholic). In connexion with it are botanical and zoological
                    gardens, several scientific collections, and a library. The private houses of
                    Münster afford an admirable picture of German domestic architecture in the 16
                    th, 17 th, and 18th centuries, — Gothic, Renaissance, and Rococo.</p>
                <p>Münster is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop, of the headquarters of an army
                    corps, and of the administrative and judicial authorities of Westphalia. The
                    Westphalian Society of Antiquaries and several other learned bodies also have
                    their headquarters here. The population in 1880 was 40,434, including about 6000
                    Protestants. The relative industrial importance of Münster is no longer
                    maintained, but manufactures of cotton, linen, and woollens, candles, leather,
                    &lt;fcc., are still carried on, and it is the centre of a tolerably brisk trade
                    in these products, as well as in cattle, Westphalian hams, grain, and books.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The first historical mention of Münster takes us
                    back to the close of the 8th century, when Charlemagne fixed ‘ ‘
                    Mime-gardevoord” as the residence of the newly-appointed bishop of the Saxons.
                    The growth of the settlement round the “Monasterium” was slow, owing to its
                    distance from any navigable river or important highway, and it was not till 1180
                    that it received a municipal charter. The name Münster had supplanted the
                    original one about a century earlier. During the 13th century Münster was one of
                    the most important members of the Hanseatic League. At the time of the
                    Reformation the citizens were inclined to adopt Protestantism, but the excesses
                    of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Anabaptists</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> led to
                    the armed intervention of the bishop and the forcible suppression of all
                    divergence from the ancient faith. The Thirty Years’ War, during which Münster
                    suffered most from the Protestant armies, was terminated by the peace of
                    Westphalia or Münster, signed in the town-hall here on 24th October 1648. The
                    authority of the bishops, who seldom resided at Münster, was usually somewhat
                    limited, but in 1661 Bishop Bernhard von Galen took the town by force, built a
                    citadel, and deprived the citizens of most of their privileges. In the Seven
                    Years’ War Münster was occupied both by the French and by the allied troops.
                    Towards the close of last century Münster was recognized as one of the
                    intellectual centres of Germany, being the home of Hemsterhuis, Princess
                    Gallitzin, F. von Stolberg, Fürstenberg, and other notabilities.</p>
                <p>The bishopric of Münster, which possessed the freedom of the empire, embraced an
                    area of 2500 square miles and contained about 350,000 inhabitants. In the 17th
                    century Bishop Galen was of such importance—he supported an army of 20,000
                    men—that his alliance was sought by the English in 1665 in the war against
                    Holland. The bishopric was secularized and annexed to Prussia in 1803.</p>
