                <p><label type="entry">MYSTICISM</label> is a phase of thought, or rather perhaps of
                    feeling, which from its very nature is hardly susceptible of exact definition.
                    It appears in connexion with the endeavour of the human mind to grasp the divine
                    essence or the ultimate reality of things, and to enjoy the blessedness<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0140-0129"/> of actual communion with the Highest. The first
                    is the philosophic side of mysticism; the second, its religious side. The first
                    effort is theoretical or speculative; the second, practical. The thought that is
                    most intensely present with the mystic is that of a supreme, all-pervading, and
                    indwelling power, in whom all things are one. Hence the speculative utterances
                    of mysticism are always more or less pantheistic in character. On the practical
                    side, mysticism maintains the possibility of direct intercourse with this Being
                    of beings—intercourse, not through any external media such as an historical
                    revelation, oracles, answers to prayer, and the like, but by a species of
                    ecstatic transfusion or identification, in which the individual becomes in very
                    truth “partaker of the divine nature.” God ceases to be an object to him and
                    becomes an experience. In the writings of the mystics, ingenuity exhausts itself
                    in the invention of phrases to express the closeness of this union. Mysticism
                    differs, therefore, from ordinary pantheism in that its inmost motive is
                    religious. Pantheism, considered merely as such, may be either an elevating or a
                    degrading theory; it expresses merely the resolution of all things into one
                    metaphysical power or substance. But the mystic is animated not merely by the
                    desire of intellectual harmony; he seeks the deepest ground of his own being, in
                    order that he may cast aside whatever separates him from the true life. This
                    religious impulse is shown in the fact that, whereas pantheism, as such, seems
                    to lead logically to passive acquiescence in things as they are—all things being
                    already as divine as it is their nature to be—mysticism, on the contrary, is
                    penetrated by the thought of alienation from the divine. Even where it preaches
                    most our essential unity with God, its constant and often painful effort is
                    directed towards overcoming an admitted alienation. In other words, the identity
                    with God which it teaches is not a mere natural identity, as in ordinary
                    pantheism, but one which is the goal of achievement.</p>
                <p>These considerations do not serve, however, to differentiate mysticism
                    sufficiently from the general course of religious thought. Alienation from, and
                    yet implicit oneness with, the divine are the two poles on which all religious
                    speculation and practice revolve. It follows from the above that mysticism is
                    distinguished from other religious theories of the relation of man to God by the
                    intensity with which it realizes the divine factor in the relation. The
                    realization is so vivid that, though the theory takes its rise in the needs of
                    the individual, the individual tends in the sequel to be lost altogether in the
                    excess of the divine light. All relations tend to become unreal for the mystic
                    except that between himself and God; his very sense of personality is weakened.
                    The mystical ideal, therefore, is not a life of ethical energy among mankind; it
                    is the eye turned wholly inwards, the life spent in contemplation and devout
                    communion. The type of character to which mysticism is allied is passive,
                    sensuous, and feminine, rather than independent, masculine, and ethically
                    vigorous. In full-blown mysticism the individual may be said to be deprived of
                    the rights which belong to him as an ethical personality.</p>
                <p>The speculative bias, it will be seen, is much stronger in the mystic than in the
                    generality of religious persons; and his speculative insight, it may be added,
                    is usually much finer than theirs. The ordinary man, in religious matters as in
                    others, constantly speaks of the infinite in such a way as virtually to make it
                    finite. As Spinoza says, he passes confidently from finite to infinite and
                    contrariwise, but never attempts to bring the two ideas together. Now mysticism
                    does bring them together, but unfortunately in such a way as to paralyse the
                    individual for action. Ultimately stated, the explanation of this result is to
                    be found in the mistaken categories under which the relation is conceived. The
                    conception of a universal substance or ground of things is naturally the first
                    resort of the mind awakened to speculation; and it is a form which constantly
                    recurs when men are roused afresh to philosophical activity. Nevertheless, the
                    conception is evidently rude. It expresses properly a relation existing between
                    material things in space; and, when applied elsewhere, is necessarily
                    inadequate, analogical, metaphorical. But it is characteristic of mysticism that
                    it does not distinguish between what is metaphorical and what is susceptible of
                    a literal interpretation. Hence it is prone to treat a relation of ethical
                    harmony as if it were one of substantial identity, or chemical fusion; and,
                    taking the sensuous language of religious feeling literally, it bids the
                    individual aim at nothing less than an interpenetration of essence. And, as this
                    goal is unattainable while reason and the consciousness of self remain, the
                    mystic begins to consider these as impediments to be cast aside. Our
                    consciousness of self is the condition under which we possess a world to know
                    and to enjoy; but it likewise isolates us from all the world beside. Reason is
                    the revealer of nature and of God; but, by its very act, reason seems to
                    separate the things reasoned about. Hence mysticism demands a faculty above
                    reason, by which the subject shall be placed in immediate and complete union
                    with the object of his desire,—a union in which the consciousness of self has
                    disappeared, and in which, therefore, subject and object are one. This is the
                    intuition or ecstasy or mystical swoon which appears alike among the Hindus, the
                    Neo-Platonists, and the mediaeval saints. And here it will be observed that the
                    original acceptance of metaphor as speculative truth has terribly avenged
                    itself; for, with the renunciation of self-conscious reason, the divine has been
                    degraded into an object of sense, and its highest realization has come to be
                    placed either in a state of brutish torpor or in a moment of equally unnatural
                    nervous excitation. Not that mysticism always appears in this extreme form, but
                    such is the goal towards which it constantly tends. If the sensuous metaphors of
                    unsophisticated religious feeling be put forward as a metaphysical theory of the
                    supersensuous, it is only to be expected that the practice deduced from· such a
                    theory will be a sophisticated or morbid development of sense, a strain put upon
                    the bodily organs to make them yield a realization of the theory and achieve
                    what is impossible to the sane and conscious reason. The morbid play of the
                    nerves is objectified by the over-driven brain and treated as a sensuous union
                    of the created with the creative spirit, an actual seeing, nay, tasting, of the
                    divine essence.</p>
                <p>To sum up, then, we may say that, compared with pantheism, mysticism is dependent
                    upon a specifically religious impulse; but, whereas religion is ordinarily
                    occupied with a practical problem and develops its theory in an ethical
                    reference, mysticism displays a predominatingly speculative bent, starting from
                    the divine nature rather than from man and his surroundings, taking the
                    symbolism of religious feeling as literally or metaphysically true, and
                    straining after the present realization of an ineffable union. The union which
                    sound religious teaching represents as realized in the submission of the will
                    and the ethical harmony of the whole life is then reduced to a passive
                    experience, to something which comes and goes in time, and which may be of only
                    momentary duration.</p>
                <p>From these general remarks it will be sufficiently apparent that mysticism is not
                    a name applicable to any particular system. It may be the outgrowth of many
                    differing modes of thought and feeling. Most frequently it appears historically,
                    in relation to some definite system of belief, as a reaction of the spirit
                    against the letter. When a religion begins to ossify into a system of formulas
                    and observances, those who protest in the name of heart-religion are not
                    unfrequently known by the name of mystics. At times they merely bring into
                    prominence again the ever-fresh<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n141/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0141-0130"/> fact of personal religious experience; at other
                    times mysticism develops itself as a powerful solvent of definite dogmas.</p>
                <p>A review of the historical appearances of mysticism will serve to show how far
                    the above characteristics are to be found, separately or in combination, in its
                    different phases.</p>
                <p>In the East, mysticism is not so much a specific phenomenon as a natural
                    deduction from the dominant philosophic systems, and the normal expression of
                    religious feeling in the lands in which it appears. Brahmanic pantheism and
                    Buddhistic nihilism alike teach the unreality of the seeming world, and preach
                    mystical absorption as the highest goal · in both, the sense of the worth of
                    human personality is lost. India consequently has always been the fertile mother
                    of practical mystics and devotees. The climate itself encourages to passivity,
                    and the very luxuriance of vegetable and animal life tends to blunt the feeling
                    of the value of life. Silent contemplation and the total deadening of
                    consciousness by perseverance for years in unnatural attitudes are among the
                    commonest forms assumed by this mystical asceticism. But the most revolting
                    methods of self - torture and self - destruction are also practised as a means
                    of rising in sanctity. The sense of sin can hardly be said to enter into these
                    exercises; that is, they are not undertaken as penance for personal
                    transgression. They are a despite done to the principle of individual or
                    separate existence.</p>
                <p>The so-called mysticism of the Persian Sufis is less intense and practical, more
                    airy and literary in character. Sufism (probably derived from σοφός) appears in
                    the 9th century among the Mohammedans of Persia as a kind of reaction against
                    the rigid monotheism and formalism of Islam (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mohammedanism,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 594). It is doubtless to be regarded as a
                    revival of ancient habits of thought and feeling among a people who had adopted
                    the Koran, not by affinity, but by compulsion. Persian literature after that
                    date, and especially Persian poetry, is full of an ardent natural pantheism, in
                    which a mystic apprehension of the unity and divinity of all things heightens
                    the delight in natural and in human beauty. Such is the poetry of Hafiz and
                    Saadi, whose verses are chiefly devoted to the praises of wine and women: Even
                    the most licentious of these have been fitted by Mohammedan theologians with a
                    mystical interpretation. The delights of love are made to stand for the raptures
                    of union with the divine, the tavern symbolizes an oratory, and intoxication is
                    the bewilderment of sense before the surpassing vision. Very often, if not most
                    frequently, it cannot be doubted that the occult religious significance depends
                    on an artificial exegesis; but there are also poems of Hafiz, Saadi, and other
                    writers, religious in their first intention. These are unequivocally pantheistic
                    in tone, and the desire of the soul to escape and rest with God is expressed
                    with all the fervour of Eastern poetry. This speculative mood, in which nature
                    and beauty and earthly satisfaction appear as a vain show, is the counterpart of
                    the former mood of sensuous enjoyment.</p>
                <p>For opposite reasons, neither the Greek nor the Jewish mind lent itself readily
                    to mysticism,—the Greek, because of its clear and sunny naturalism; the Jewish,
                    because of its rigid monotheism and its turn towards worldly realism and
                    statutory observance. It is only with the exhaustion of Greek and Jewish
                    civilization that mysticism becomes a prominent factor in Western thought. It
                    appears, therefore, contemporaneously with Christianity, and is a sign of the
                    world-weariness and deep religious need that mark the decay of the old world.
                    Whereas Plato’s main problem had been the organization of the perfect state, and
                    Aristotle’s intellect had ranged with fresh interest over all departments of the
                    knowable, political speculation had become a mockery with the extinction of free
                    political life, and knowledge as such had lost its freshness for the Greeks of
                    the Roman empire. Knowledge is nothing to these men if it does not show them the
                    infinite reality which is able to fill the aching void within. Accordingly, the
                    last age of Greek philosophy is theosophical in character, and its ultimate end
                    is a practical satisfaction. Neo-Platonism seeks this in the ecstatic intuition
                    of the ineffable One. The systematic theosophy of Plotinus and his successors
                    does not belong to the present article, except so far as it is the
                    presupposition of their mysticism; but, inasmuch as the mysticism of the
                    mediaeval church is directly derived from Neo-Platonism through the speculations
                    of the Pseudo-Dionysius, Neo-Platonic mysticism fills an important section in
                    any historical review of the subject.</p>
                <p>Neo-Platonism owes its form to Plato, but its underlying motive is the widespread
                    feeling of self - despair and the longing for divine illumination characteristic
                    of the age in which it appears. Before the rise of NeoPlatonism proper we meet
                    with various mystical or semi-mystical expressions of the same religious
                    craving. The contemplative asceticism of the Essenes of Judaea may be mentioned,
                    and, somewhat later, the life of the Therapeutae on the shores of Lake Moeris.
                    In Philo, Alexandrian Judaism had already seized upon Plato as “the Attic
                    Moses,” and done its best to combine his speculations with the teaching of his
                    Jewish prototype. Philo’s God is described in terms of absolute transcendency;
                    his doctrine of the Logos or Divine Sophia is a theistical transformation of the
                    Platonic world of ideas; his allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament
                    represents the spiritualistic dissolution of historical Judaism. Philo’s ethical
                    ideal is renunciation, contemplation, complete surrender to the divine
                    influence. Apollonius of Tyana and the so-called NeoPythagoreans drew similar
                    ethical consequences from their eclectic study of Plato. Wonder-workers like
                    Alexander of Aboniteichos exhibit the grosser side of the longing for spiritual
                    communion. The traits common to Neo-Platonism and all these speculations are
                    well summed up by Zeller <hi rend="italic">{Philos,</hi><hi rend="italic">der
                    Griechen,</hi> iii. 2. 214) as consisting in—“ (1) the dualistic opposition of
                    the divine and the earthly; (2) an abstract conception of God, excluding all <hi
                    rend="italic">knowledge</hi> of the divine nature; (3) contempt for the world of
                    the senses, on the ground of the Platonic doctrines of matter and of the descent
                    of the soul from a superior world into the body; (4) the theory of intermediate
                    potencies or beings, through whom God acts upon the world of phenomena; (5) the
                    requirement of an ascetic self-emancipation from the bondage of sense and faith
                    in a higher revelation to man when in a state called enthusiasm.” Neo-Platonism
                    appears in the first half of the 3d century, and has its greatest representative
                    in Plotinus (204-269 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> He develops the Platonic
                    philosophy into an elaborate system by means of the doctrine of emanation. The
                    One, the Good, and the Idea of the Good were identical in Plato’s mind, and the
                    Good was therefore not deprived of intelligible essence. It was not separated
                    from the world of ideas, of which it was represented as either the crown or the
                    sum. By Plotinus, on the contrary, the One is explicitly exalted above the νους
                    and the “ideas”; it transcends existence altogether (∈τreκ∈ιvα της ουσίας), and
                    is not cognizable by reason. Remaining itself in repose, it rays out, as it
                    were, from its own fulness an image of itself, which is called νους, and which
                    constitutes the system of ideas or the intelligible world. The soul is in turn
                    the image or product of the νους, and the soul by its motion begets corporeal
                    matter. The soul thus faces two ways—towards the νους, from which it springs,
                    and towards the materia] life, which is its own product. Ethical endeavour
                    consists in the repudiation of the sensible: material existence is <pb

                    that Plotinus was unwilling to name his parents or his birthplace, and seemed
                    ashamed of being in the body.) Beyond the <hi rend="italic">καθάρσια,</hi> or
                    virtues which purify from sin, lies the further stage of complete identification
                    with God <hi rend="italic">(ovκ cξω</hi> α∕z,αpτiαs eιvaι, αλλά <hi
                    rend="italic">θeov eιvaι).</hi> To reach the ultimate goal, thought itself must
                    be left behind; for thought is a form of motion, and the desire of the soul is
                    for the motionless rest which belongs to the One. The union with transcendent
                    deity is not so much knowledge or vision as ecstasy, coalescence, <hi
                    rend="italic">contact (eKo·racrts,</hi> ατrλω&lt;rιs, <hi rend="italic"
                    >αφή,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ennead.,</hi> vi. 9. 8-9). But in our present state
                    of existence the moments of this ecstatic union must be few and short; “I
                    myself,” says Plotinus simply, “have realized it but three times as yet, and
                    Porphyry hitherto not once.”</p>
                <p>It will be seen from the above that Neo-Platonism is not mystical as regards the
                    faculty by which it claims to apprehend philosophic truth. It is first of all a
                    system of complete rationalism; it is assumed, in other words, that reason is
                    capable of mapping out the whole system of things. But, inasmuch as a God is
                    affirmed beyond reason, the mysticism becomes in a sense the necessary
                    complement of the would-be all-embracing rationalism. The system culminates in a
                    mystical act, and in the sequel, especially with Iamblichus and the Syrian
                    NeoPlatonists, mystical practice tended more and more to overshadow the
                    theoretical groundwork.</p>
                <p>It was probably about the end of the 5th century, just as ancient philosophy was
                    dying out in the schools of Athens, that the speculative mysticism of
                    Neo-Platonism made a definite lodgment in Christian thought through the literary
                    forgeries of the Pseudo-Dionysius. The doctrines of Christianity were by that
                    time so firmly established that the church could look upon a symbolical or
                    mystical interpretation of them without anxiety. The author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Theologia Mystica</hi> and the other works ascribed to the
                    Areopagite proceeds, therefore, to develop the doctrines of Proclus with very
                    little modification into a system of esoteric Christianity. God is the nameless
                    and supra-essential One, elevated above goodness itself. Hence “negative
                    theology,” which ascends from the creature to God by dropping one after another
                    every determinate predicate, leads us nearest to the truth. The return to God
                    (∈vωσ-ις, i‰σιs) is the consummation of all things and the goal indicated by
                    Christian teaching. The same doctrines were preached with more of churchly
                    fervour by Maximus the Confessor (580-622). Maximus represents almost the last
                    speculative activity of the Greek Church, but the influence of the
                    Pseudo-Dionysian writings was transmitted to the West in the 9th century by
                    Erigena, in whose speculative spirit both the scholasticism and the mysticism of
                    the Middle Ages have their rise. Erigena translated Dionysius into Latin along
                    with the commentaries of Maximus, and His system is essentially based upon
                    theirs. The negative theology is adopted, and God is stated to be predicateless
                    Being, above all categories, and therefore not improperly called Nothing. Out of
                    this Nothing or incomprehensible essence the world of ideas or primordial causes
                    is eternally created. This is the Word or Son of God, in whom all things exist,
                    so far as they have substantial existence. All existence is a theophany, and as
                    God is the beginning of all things, so also is He the end. Erigena teaches the
                    restitution of all things under the form of the Dionysian <hi rend="italic"
                    >adunatio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">deificatio.</hi> These are the permanent
                    outlines of what may be called the philosophy of mysticism in Christian times,
                    and it is remarkable with how little variation they are repeated from age to
                    age.</p>
                <p>In Erigena mysticism has not yet separated itself in any way from the dogma of
                    the church. There is no revulsion, as later, from dogma as such, nor is more
                    stress laid upon one dogma than upon another; all are treated upon the same
                    footing, and the whole dogmatic system is held, as it were, in solution by the
                    philosophic medium in which it is presented. No distinction is drawn, indeed,
                    between what is reached by reason and what is given by authority; the two are
                    immediately identical for Erigena. In this he agrees with the speculative
                    mystics everywhere, and differentiates himself from the scholastics who followed
                    him. The distinguishing characteristic of scholasticism is the acceptance by
                    reason of a given matter, the truth of which is independent of rational grounds,
                    and which remains a presupposition even when it cannot be understood.
                    Scholasticism aims, it is true, in its chief representatives, at demonstrating
                    that the content of revelation and the teaching of reason are identical. But
                    what was matter of immanent assumption with Erigena is in them an equating of
                    two things which have been dealt with on the hypothesis that they are separate,
                    and which, therefore, still retain that external relation to one another. This
                    externality of religious truth to the mind is fundamental in scholasticism,
                    while the opposite view is equally fundamental in mysticism. Mysticism is not
                    the voluntary demission of reason and its subjection to an external authority.
                    In that case, all who accept a revelation without professing to understand its
                    content would require to be ranked as mystics; the fierce sincerity of
                    Tertullian’s <hi rend="italic">credo quia</hi><hi rend="italic">absurdum,</hi>
                    Pascal’s reconciliation of contradictions in Jesus Christ, and Bayle’s
                    half-sneering subordination of reason to faith would all be marks of this
                    standpoint. But such a temper of mind is much more akin to scepticism than to
                    mysticism; it is characteristic of those who either do not feel the need of
                    philosophizing their beliefs, or who have failed in doing so and take refuge in
                    sheer acceptance. Mysticism, on the other hand, is marked on its speculative
                    side by even an overweening confidence in human reason. Nor need this be
                    wondered at if we consider that the unity of the human mind with the divine is
                    its underlying presupposition. Hence where reason is discarded by the mystic it
                    is merely reason overleaping itself; it occurs at the end and not at the
                    beginning of his speculations. Even then there is no appeal to authority;
                    nothing is accepted from without. The appeal is still to the individual, who, if
                    not by reason then by some higher faculty, claims to realize absolute truth and
                    to taste absolute blessedness.</p>
                <p>Mysticism first appears in the mediaeval church as the protest of practical
                    religion against the predominance of the dialectical spirit. It is so with
                    Bernard of Clairvaux (1091-1153), who condemns Abelard’s distinctions and
                    reasonings as externalizing and degrading the faith. Bernard’s mysticism is of a
                    practical cast, dealing mainly with the means by which man may attain to the
                    knowledge and enjoyment of God. Reason has three stages, in the highest of which
                    the mind is able, by abstraction from earthly things, to rise to <hi
                    rend="italic">contemplatio</hi> or the vision of the divine. More exalted still,
                    however, is the sudden <hi rend="italic">ecstatic</hi> vision, such as was
                    granted, for example, to Paul. This is the reward of those who are dead to the
                    body and the world. Asceticism is thus the counterpart of mediaeval mysticism;
                    and, by his example as well as by his teaching in such passages, Bernard
                    unhappily encouraged practices which necessarily resulted in self-delusion. Love
                    grows with the knowledge of its object, Bernard proceeds, and at the highest
                    stage self-love is so merged in love to God that we love ourselves only for
                    God’s sake or because God has loved us. “Te enim quodammodo perdere tanquam qui
                    non sis, et omnino non sentire te ipsum et a te ipso exinaniri et pene
                    annullari, coelestis est conversationis. . . . Sic affici deificari est.” “As
                    the little water-drop poured into a large measure of wine seems to lose its own
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n143/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0143-0132"/> nature entirely and to take on both the taste and
                    the colour of the wine, or as iron heated red-hot loses its own appearance and
                    glows like fire, or as air filled with sunlight is transformed into the same
                    brightness so that it does not so much appear to be illuminated as to be itself
                    light,—so must all human feeling towards the Holy One be self-dissolved in
                    unspeakable wise, and wholly transfused into the will of God. For how shall God
                    be all in all if anything of man remains in man? The substance will indeed
                    remain, but in another form, another glory, another power” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(De</hi><hi rend="italic">diligendo</hi><hi rend="italic">Deo,</hi> c. 10).
                    These are the favourite similes of mysticism, wherever it is found.</p>
                <p>Mysticism was more systematically developed by Bernard’s contemporary Hugo of St
                    Victor (1096-1141). The Augustinian monastery of St Victor near Paris became the
                    headquarters of mysticism during the 12th century. It had a wide influence in
                    awakening popular piety, and the works that issued from it formed the text-books
                    of mystical and pietistic minds in the centuries that followed. Hugo’s pupil,
                    Richard of St Victor, declares, in opposition to dialectic scholasticism, that
                    the objects of mystic contemplation are partly above reason, and partly, as in
                    the intuition of the Trinity, contrary to reason. He enters at length into the
                    conditions of ecstasy and the yearnings that precede it. Walter, the third of
                    the Victorines, carried on the polemic against the dialecticians. Bonaventura
                    (1221-74) was a diligent student of the Victorines, and in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Itinerarium</hi><hi rend="italic">mentis ad Deum</hi> maps out the human
                    faculties in a similar fashion. He introduces the terms “apex mentis” and
                    “scintilla” (also “synderesis” or σwττ)p7jσts) to describe the faculty of mystic
                    intuition. Bonaventura runs riot in phrases to describe the union with God, and
                    his devotional works were much drawn upon by mystical preachers. Fully a century
                    later, when the system of scholasticism was gradually breaking up under the
                    predominance of Occam’s nominalism, Pierre d’Ailly (1350-1425), and his more
                    famous scholar John Gerson (1363-1429), chancellor of the university of Paris,
                    are found endeavouring to combine the doctrines of the Victorines and
                    Bonaventura with a nominalistic philosophy. They are the last representatives of
                    mysticism within the limitations imposed by scholasticism.</p>
                <p>From the 12th and 13th centuries onward there is observable in the different
                    countries of Europe a widespread reaction against the growing formalism and
                    worldliness of the church and the scandalous lives of many of the clergy. Men
                    began to feel a desire for a theology of the heart and an unworldly simplicity
                    of life. Thus there arose in the Netherlands the Beguines and Beghards, in Italy
                    the Waldenses (without, however, any mystical leaning), in the south of France
                    and elsewhere the numerous sect or sects of the Cathari, and in Calabria the
                    apocalyptic gospel of Joachim of Floris, all bearing witness to the commotion of
                    the time. The lay societies of the Beghards and Beguines (for men and women
                    respectively) date from the end of the 12 th century, and soon became extremely
                    popular both in the Low Countries and on the Rhine. They were free at the outset
                    from any heretical taint, but were never much in favour with the church. In the
                    beginning of the 13th century the foundation of the Dominican and Franciscan
                    orders furnished a more ecclesiastical and regular means of supplying the same
                    wants, and numerous convents sprang up at once throughout Germany. The German
                    mind was a peculiarly fruitful soil for mysticism, and, in connexion either with
                    the Beguines or the church organization, a number of women appear about this
                    time, combining a spirit of mystical piety and asceticism with sturdy
                    reformatory zeal directed against the abuses of the time. Even before this we
                    hear of the prophetic visions of Hildegard of Bingen (a contemporary of St
                    Bernard) and Elizabeth of Schönau. In the 13th century Elizabeth of Hungary, the
                    pious landgravine of Thuringia, assisted in the foundation of many convents in
                    the north of Germany. For an account of the chief of these female saints the
                    reader is referred to the first volume of Preger’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte
                    der deutschen Mystik.</hi> Mechthild of Magdeburg appears to have been the most
                    influential, and her book <hi rend="italic">Das</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fliessende</hi><hi rend="italic">Licht</hi><hi rend="italic">der Gottheit</hi>
                    is important as the oldest work of its kind in German. It proves that much of
                    the terminology of German mysticism was current before Eckhart’s time.
                    Mechthild’s clerico-political utterances show that she was acquainted with the
                    “eternal gospel” of Joachim of Floris. Joachim had proclaimed the doctrine of
                    three world-ages—the kingdom of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. The
                    reign of the Spirit was to begin with the year 1260, when the abuses of the
                    world and the church were to be effectually cured by the general adoption of the
                    monastic life of contemplation. Very similar to this in appearance is the
                    teaching of Amalrich of Bena <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi> 1207); but, while the
                    movements just mentioned were reformatory without being heretical, this is very
                    far from being the case with the mystical pantheism derived by Amalrich from the
                    writings of Erigena. His followers held a progressive revelation of God in the
                    ages of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Just as the Mosaic dispensation came
                    to an end with the appearance of Christ, so the sacraments of the new
                    dispensation have lost their meaning and efficacy since the incarnation of God
                    as Holy Spirit in the Amalricans. With this opposition to the church they
                    combine a complete antinomianism, through the identification of all their
                    desires with the impulses of the divine Spirit. Amalrich’s teaching was
                    condemned by the church, and his heresies led to the public burning of Erigena’s
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">divisione</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >naturae</hi> in 1225. The sect of the New Spirit, or of the Free Spirit as it
                    was afterwards called, spread widely through the north of France and into
                    Switzerland and Germany. They were especially numerous in the Rhineland in the
                    end of the 13th and during the 14th century; and they seem to have corrupted the
                    originally orthodox communities of Beghards, for Beghards and Brethren of the
                    Free Spirit are used henceforward as convertible terms, and the same
                    immoralities are related of both. Such was the seed-ground in which what is
                    specifically known as German mysticism sprang up.</p>
                <p>In Meister Eckhart (1260-1329;—see <hi rend="smallcaps">Eckhart)</hi> the: German
                    mind definitively asserts its pre-eminence in the sphere of speculative
                    mysticism. Eckhart was a distinguished son of the church; but in reading his
                    works we feel at once that we have passed into quite a different sphere of
                    thought from that of the churchly mystics; we seem to leave the cloister behind
                    and to breathe a freer atmosphere. The scholastic mysticism was, for the most
                    part, practical and psychological in character. It was largely a devotional aid
                    to the realization of present union with God; and, so far as it was theoretical,
                    it was a theory of the faculties by which such a union is attainable. Mysticism
                    was pieced on somewhat incongruously to a scholastically accepted theology; the
                    feelings and the intellect were not brought together. But in Eckhart the
                    attitude of the churchman and traditionalist is entirely abandoned. Instead of
                    systematizing dogmas, he appears to evolve a philosophy by the free exercise of
                    reason. His system enables him to give a profound significance to the doctrines
                    of the church; but, instead of the system being accommodated to the doctrines,
                    the doctrines—and especially the historical facts—acquire a new sense in the
                    system, and often become only a mythical representation of speculative truth.
                    The freedom with which Eckhart treats historical Christianity allies him much
                    more to the German idealists of the 19th century than to his scholastic
                    predecessors<pb break="no"

                    fondness for reconciling apparent contradictions which often lends an air of
                    paradox to his statements Eckhart bears a striking resemblance to Hegel; but in
                    some determinations of his system, such as his doctrine of the Absolute, he
                    approaches more nearly to Schelling. In view of these affinities, it has been
                    customary to say that his interest is prevailingly intellectual, and that he is
                    lacking in religious warmth. But this is largely due to the fusion of intellect
                    and feeling which is often found in highly speculative natures. Eckhart’s system
                    is in itself the expression or formulation of religious feeling, and the
                    speculative statement possesses for him a rich spiritual unction of its own. In
                    this he is the typical representative of German, in opposition to what is often
                    called Romanic, mysticism. The latter, both in scholastic times and in its later
                    Catholic representatives, confines itself to the facts of religious feeling
                    without showing itself attracted by ontological speculation.</p>
                <p>Eckhart distinguishes between the godhead and God. The godhead is the absolute
                    Essence (Wesen), unknowable not only by man but also by itself; it is darkness
                    and absolute indeterminateness, “Nicht” in contrast to “Icht” or definite and
                    knowable existence. Yet it is the potentiality of all things, and its nature is,
                    in a triadic process, to come to consciousness of itself as the triune God.
                    Creation is not a temporal act, but an eternal necessity of the divine nature. I
                    am as necessary to God, Eckhart is fond of saying, as God is necessary to me. In
                    my knowledge and love God knows and loves Himself. “The eye with which I see God
                    is the same eye with which God sees me. My eye and God’s eye are one eye, one
                    vision, one recognition, one love.” To know God, we must become ignorant of
                    ourselves and of all creatures. “Couldst thou annihilate thyself for a moment,
                    thou wouldst possess all that God is in Himself.” The complete renunciation of
                    selfhood is called by Eckhart “decease;” and when I am in this state God brings
                    forth His Son in me. Or, conversely, it is I who beget God anew in my soul; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> li</hi> God has begotten me from eternity that I may be
                    Father and beget Him who begat me.” Our identity with God is recognized by the
                    purely rational and uncreated activity of the soul, which Eckhart calls the
                    “Fünklein,” or spark. By this we press on beyond God into the abyss of the
                    godhead, and Eckhart prays paradoxically “to be rid of God, that is, that God by
                    His grace would bring him into the Essence—that Essence which is above God and
                    above distinction.”</p>
                <p>In spite of Eckhart’s daring assertions of the identity of the human and the
                    divine, there is no reason to call in question his genuinely religious and
                    Christian spirit. His spirit, however, was Christian in a wide sense rather than
                    ecclesiastical; it showed itself in zeal for the upbuilding of Christian life
                    among the people. The condemnation of the church had its effect in later times
                    in obscuring Eckhart’s importance, but it did not avail to check his powerful
                    influence upon his contemporaries. They constantly appeal to him as “the
                    master,” the “wise,” the “divine” master, “from whom God concealed nothing.”</p>
                <p>The political circumstances of Germany in the first half of the 14th century were
                    in the last degree disastrous. The war between the rival emperors, Frederick of
                    Austria and Louis of Bavaria, and the interdict under which the latter was
                    placed in 1324 inflicted extreme misery upon the unhappy people. From some
                    places the interdict was not removed for twenty-six years. Men’s minds were
                    pained and disquieted by the conflict of duties and the absence of spiritual
                    consolation. The country was also visited by a succession of famines and floods,
                    and in 1348 the Black Death swept over Europe like a terrible scourge. In the
                    midst of these unhappy surroundings religion became more inward in men of real
                    piety, and the desire grew among them to draw closer the bonds that united them
                    to one another. Thus arose the society of the Friends of God <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gottesfreunde)</hi> in the south and west of Germany, spreading as far as
                    Switzerland on the one side and the Netherlands on the other. They formed no
                    exclusive sect. They often took opposite sides in politics, and they also
                    differed in the type of their religious life; but they uniformly desired to
                    strengthen one another in living intercourse with God. Among them chiefly the
                    followers of Eckhart were to be found. Such were Heinrich Suso of Constance
                    (1295-1366) and John Tauler of Strasburg (1300-61), the two most celebrated of
                    his immediate disciples. Suso was a remarkable combination of self-torturing
                    austerity with an inexhaustible play of poetic fancy. He has been called “the
                    minnesinger of the love of God.” Tauler’s eloquence may be said to have made him
                    the centre of religious life in the south-west of Germany for more than quarter
                    of a century. In his sermons, while the standpoint is the same as Eckhart’s, the
                    speculative groundwork tends, as is natural, to be less insisted on, and more
                    scope is given to its practical consequences and to direct religious
                    exhortation. Nicolas of Basel, the mysterious layman from whose visit Tauler
                    dates his true religious life, seems to have been the chief organizing force
                    among the Gottesfreunde. He was known as “the great friend of God in the
                    Oberland,” and Basel continued to be a quiet haven of reunion for the members of
                    the society. Tauler and others retired thither at intervals from the political
                    storms of the time. The society counted many members among the pious women in
                    the convents of southern Germany. Such were Christina Ebner of Engelthal near
                    Nuremberg, and Margaretha Ebner of Medingen in Swabia. Laymen also belonged to
                    it, like Hermann von Fritzlar and Rulman Merswin, the rich banker of Strasburg
                    (author of a mystical work, <hi rend="italic">Buch der neun Felsen,</hi> on the
                    nine rocks or upward steps of contemplation). Letters passed between the
                    members, as well as presents of books or relics. Some of them, like Heinrich von
                    Nördlingen, the friend of Margaretha Ebner, went much from place to place, and
                    in that way helped to keep up a living connexion among the friends. It was
                    doubtless one of their number who sent forth anonymously from the house of the
                    Teutonic Order in Frankfort the famous handbook of mystical devotion called <hi
                    rend="italic">Eine deutsche Theologie.</hi> Shortly after the middle of the
                    century most of the friends of whom anything is known drop out of sight. But the
                    combination of warm piety and spiritual freedom in Tauler’s sermons and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologie</hi> exercised a
                    continuous influence on the religious life of Germany till the time of Luther.
                    As is well known, the <hi rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Theologie</hi> was first published in 1516 by Luther, who accompanied it by a
                    preface expressing his own obligations to the “noble book,” and ranking it
                    inferior only to the Bible and St Augustine. The fact that the book was put into
                    his hands by Staupitz, the vicar-general of the Augustinian order, shows that
                    Luther’s high estimate was not singular at the time.</p>
                <p>John Ruysbroeck (1293-1381), the father of mysticism in the Netherlands, stood in
                    connexion with the Friends of God, and Tauler is said to have visited him in his
                    seclusion at Vauvert (Grünthal) near Brussels. He was decisively influenced by
                    Eckhart, though there is noticeable occasionally a shrinking back from some of
                    Eckhart’s phraseology. The sect of the Free Spirit is the frequent object of his
                    polemic, and this leads him into somewhat careful definitions of truth and
                    error. For the rest, Ruysbroeck’s mysticism is more of a practical than a
                    speculative cast. He is chiefly occupied with the means whereby the <hi
                    rend="italic">unio</hi><hi rend="italic">mystica</hi> is to be attained, whereas
                    Eckhart dwells on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n145/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0145-0134"/> union as an ever-present fact, and dilates on its
                    metaphysical implications. Towards the end of Ruysbroeck’s life, in 1378, he was
                    visited by the fervid lay-preacher Gerhard Groot (1340-84), who was so impressed
                    by the life of the community at Vauvert that he conceived the idea of founding a
                    Christian brotherhood bound by no monastic vows, but living together in
                    simplicity and piety with all things in common, after the apostolic pattern.
                    This was the origin of the Brethren of the Common Lot (or Common Life). The
                    first house of the Brethren was founded at Deventer by Gerhard Groot and his
                    youthful friend Florentius Radewyn. Similar brother-houses soon sprang up in
                    different places throughout the Low Countries and Westphalia, and even Saxony.
                    Thomas a Kempis (1380-1471), to whom the brotherhood chiefly owes its fame,
                    forms the subject of a separate article.</p>
                <p>It has been customary for Protestant writers to represent the mystics of Germany
                    and Holland as precursors of the Reformation. In a sense this is true; and the
                    direct influence of Tauler and the <hi rend="italic">Deutsche Theologie</hi>
                    upon Luther has already been referred to. But it conveys a false impression if
                    it is understood to mean that these men protested against the doctrines of the
                    church in the way the Reformers felt themselves called upon to do. There is no
                    sign that Tauler, for example, or Ruysbroeck, or Thomas a Kempis had felt the
                    dogmatic teaching of the church jar in any single point upon their religious
                    consciousness. Nevertheless, mysticism did prepare men in a very real way for a
                    break with the traditional system. Mysticism instinctively recedes from formulas
                    that have become stereotyped and mechanical into the perennially fresh
                    experience of the individual. In the first place, therefore, it brings into
                    prominence only those broad and universal doctrines which it finds to be of
                    vital and present moment for the inward life, while others, though they may have
                    an important place in the churchly system, are (unconsciously) allowed to slip
                    into temporary forgetfulness. It is thus we must explain that almost total
                    absence of distinctively Romish doctrine in Thomas a Kempis which makes the <hi
                    rend="italic">Imitation</hi> as acceptable to the Protestant as to the devout
                    Catholic. In the second place, mysticism accustoms men to deal with their
                    experience for themselves at first hand, and to test the doctrines presented to
                    them by that standard. This growth of spiritual freedom is especially to be
                    marked in the German mystics. It is to be noted, however, that mysticism affords
                    in itself no foundation for a religious community. Its principle is pure
                    inwardness, but it possesses no norm by which the extravagances of the
                    individual may be controlled. Thus, when the Reformers appeared to do their
                    work, the mystics were found opposing the new authority of Scripture to the full
                    as bitterly as they had opposed the old authority of the church. To the
                    thoroughgoing mystic individualist the one standard is as external as the other.
                    When Cellarius was called upon by Luther to substantiate his positions by
                    reference to Scripture, he struck the table with his fist and declared it an
                    insult to speak so to a man of God. A germ of reason may be discerned in this
                    indignation, but none the less we must recognize that, while mysticism showed
                    itself capable at the Reformation of dissolving society into anarchy and
                    atomism, it showed itself perfectly destitute of a reconstructive power. The
                    same people who would claim the pre-Reformation mystics as Protestants in
                    disguise are indignant at the way in which the later mystics oppose, or hold
                    aloof from, the Reformation movement. But the truth seems to be that, in both
                    cases, mysticism was true to its principle. Without some fixed letter to attach
                    itself to, it sinks away into utter formlessness; but its relation to the system
                    is always more or less one of opposition to what it regards as external.</p>
                <p>The wild doctrines of Thomas Münzer and the Zwickau prophets, merging eventually
                    into the excesses of the Peasants’ War and the doings of the Anabaptists in
                    Münster, first roused Luther to the dangerous possibilities of mysticism as a
                    disintegrating force. He was also called upon to do battle for his principle
                    against men like Schwenkfeld (1490-1561) and Sebastian Frank (1500-45), the
                    latter of whom developed a system of pantheistic mysticism, and went so far in
                    his opposition to the letter as to declare the whole of the historical element
                    in Scripture to be but a mythical representation of eternal truth. Valentin
                    Weigel (1533-88), who stands under manifold obligations to Frank, represents
                    also the influence of the semi-mystical physical speculation that marked the
                    transition from scholasticism to modern times. The final breakdown of
                    scholasticism as a rationalized system of dogma may be seen in Nicolaus of Cusa
                    (1401-64), who received his education, like Thomas a Kempis, at Deventer, and
                    afterwards rose to be a cardinal of the church. He distinguishes between the <hi
                    rend="italic">intellectus</hi> and the discursively acting <hi rend="italic"
                    >ratio</hi> almost precisely in the style of later distinctions between the
                    reason and the understanding. The intellect combines what the understanding
                    separates; hence Nicolaus teaches the principle of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >coincidentia contradictoriorum.</hi> If the results of the understanding go by
                    the name of knowledge, then the higher teaching of the intellectual intuition
                    may be called ignorance—ignorance, however, that is conscious of itself, <hi
                    rend="italic">docta ignorantia.</hi> “Intuitio,” “speculatio,” “visio sine
                    comprehensione,” “comprehensio incomprehensibilis,” “mystica theologia,”
                    “tertius coelus,” are some of the terms he applies to this knowledge above
                    knowledge; but in the working out of his system he is remarkably free from
                    extravagance. Nicolaus’s doctrines were of influence upon Giordano Bruno and
                    other physical philosophers of the 15th and 16th centuries. All these physical
                    theories are blended with a mystical theosophy, of which the most remarkable
                    example is, perhaps, the chemico-astrological speculations of Paracelsus (1493-
                    1541). The influence of Nicolaus of Cusa and Paracelsus mingled in Valentin
                    Weigel with that of the <hi rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Theologie,</hi> Osiander, Schwenkfeld, and Frank. Weigel, in turn, handed on
                    these influences to Jacob Boehme (1575- 1624), <hi rend="italic"
                    >philosophus</hi><hi rend="italic">teutonicus,</hi> and father of the chief
                    developments of theosophy in modern Germany. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Boehme.</hi></p>
                <p>Mysticism did not cease within the Catholic Church at the Reformation. In St
                    Theresa (1515-82) and John of the Cross the counter-reformation can boast of
                    saints second to none in the calendar for the austerity of their mortifications
                    and the rapture of the visions to which they were admitted. But, as was to be
                    expected, their mysticism moves in that comparatively narrow round, and consists
                    simply in the heaping up of these sensuous experiences. The speculative
                    character has entirely faded out of it, or rather has been crushed out by the
                    tightness with which the directors of the Roman Church now held the reins of
                    discipline. Their mysticism represents, therefore, no widening or spiritualizing
                    of their theology; in all matters of belief they remain the docile children of
                    their church. The gloom and harshness of these Spanish mystics are absent from
                    the tender, contemplative spirit of François de Sales (1567-1622); and in the
                    quietism of Madame Guyon (1648-1717) and Miguel de Molinos (1627-96) there is
                    again a sufficient implication of mystical doctrine to rouse the suspicion of
                    the ecclesiastical authorities. Quietism, name and thing, became the talk of all

                <p>In the 17 th century mysticism is represented in the philosophical field by the
                    so-called Cambridge Platonists, and especially by Henry More (1614-87), in whom
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n146/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0146-0135"/> influence of the Kabbalah is combined with a
                    species of Christianized Neo-Platonism. Pierre Poiret (1646-1719) exhibits a
                    violent reaction against the mechanical philosophy of Descartes, and especially
                    against its consequences in Spinoza. He was an ardent student of Tauler and
                    Thomas a Kempis, and became an adherent of the quietistic doctrines of Madame
                    Bourignon. His philosophical works emphasize the passivity of the reason. The
                    first influence of Boehme was in the direction of an obscure religious
                    mysticism. J. G. Gichtel (1638-1710), the first editor of his complete works,
                    became the founder of a sect called the Angel-Brethren. All Boehme’s works were
                    translated into English in the time of the Commonwealth, and regular societies
                    of Behmenists were formed in England and Holland. Later in the century he was
                    much studied by the members of the Philadelphian Society, John Pordage, Thomas
                    Bromley, Jane Lead, and others. The mysticism of William Law (1686-1761) and of
                    St Martin in France (1743-1803), who were also students of Boehme, is of a much
                    more elevated and spiritual type. The “Cherubic Wanderer,” and other poems, of
                    Johann Scheffler (1624- 77), known as Angelus Silesius, are more closely related
                    in style and thought to Eckhart than to Boehme.</p>
                <p>The religiosity of the Quakers, with their doctrines of the “inner light” and the
                    influence of the Spirit, has decided affinities with mysticism; and the quaint
                    autobiography of George Fox (1624-91), the founder of the sect, proceeds
                    throughout on the assumption of supernatural guidance. Stripped of its
                    definitely miraculous character, the doctrine of the inner light may be regarded
                    as the familiar mystical protest against formalism, literalism, and
                    scripture-worship. Swedenborg, though selected by Emerson in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Representative Men</hi> as the typical mystic, belongs rather to
                    the history of spiritualism than to that of mysticism as understood in this
                    article. He possesses the cool temperament of the man of science rather than the
                    fervid Godward aspiration of the mystic proper; and the speculative impulse
                    which lies at the root of this form of thought is almost entirely absent from
                    his writings. Accordingly, his supernatural revelations resemble a course of
                    lessons in celestial geography more than a description of the beatific
                    vision.</p>
                <p>Philosophy since the end of the last century has frequently shown a tendency to
                    diverge into mysticism. This has been especially so in Germany. The term
                    mysticism is, indeed, often extended by popular usage and philosophical
                    partisanship to the whole activity of the post-Kantian idealists. In this usage
                    the word would be equivalent to the more recent and scarcely less abused term,
                    transcendentalism, and as such it is used even by a sympathetic writer like
                    Carlyle; but this looseness of phraseology only serves to blur important
                    distinctions. However absolute a philosopher’s idealism may be, he is
                    erroneously styled a mystic if he moves towards his conclusions only by the
                    patient labour of the reason. Hegel therefore, to take an instance, can no more
                    fitly be classed as a mystic than Spinoza can. It would be much nearer the truth
                    to take both as types of a thoroughgoing rationalism. In either case it is of
                    course open to any one to maintain that the apparent completeness of synthesis
                    really rests on the subtle intrusion of elements of feeling into the rational
                    process. But in that case it might be difficult to find a systematic philosopher
                    who would escape the charge of mysticism; and it is better to remain by
                    long-established and serviceable distinctions. Where philosophy despairs of
                    itself, exults in its own overthrow, and yet revels in the “mysteries” of a
                    speculative Christianity, as in J. G. Hamann (1730-88), the term mysticism may
                    be fitly applied. So, again, it is in place where the movement of revulsion from
                    a mechanical philosophy takes the form rather of immediate assertion than of
                    reasoned demonstration, and where the writers, after insisting generally on the
                    spiritual basis of phenomena, either leave the position without further
                    definition, or expressly declare that the ultimate problems of philosophy cannot
                    be reduced to articulate formulas. Examples of this are men like Novalis,
                    Carlyle, and Emerson, in whom philosophy may be said to be impatient of its own
                    task. Schelling’s explicit appeal in the “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Identitats-philoseyphie”</hi> to an intellectual intuition of the Absolute, is
                    of the essence of mysticism, both as an appeal to a supra-rational faculty and
                    as a claim not merely to know but to realize God. The opposition of the reason
                    to the understanding, as used by Coleridge, is not free from the first of these
                    faults. The later philosophy of Schelling and the philosophy of Franz von
                    Baader, both largely founded upon Boehme, belong rather to theosophy than to
                    mysticism proper.</p>
