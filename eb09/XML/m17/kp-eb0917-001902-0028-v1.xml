                <p><label type="entry">MULTAN, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Mooltan</hi></label>, a
                    district in the lieutenantgovernorship of the Punjab, lying between 29° 22' and
                    30° 45' N. lat. and 71° 4' and 72° 54' E. long., is bounded on the N. by the
                    Jhang district, on the E. by that of Montgomery, on the S. by the Sutlej, and on
                    the N.W. by the Chenâb, and has an area of 5880 square miles. Along the banks of
                    the Chenâb, Sutlej, and Râvi extend fringes of cultivation varying in width from
                    3 to 20 miles, but the interior uplands have the same barren character as the
                    district of <hi rend="smallcaps">Montgomery (⅛.v.).</hi> Midway between the
                    boundary rivers, a high dorsal ridge enters from Montgomery, forming a part of
                    the sterile region known as the <hi rend="italic">bâr.</hi> It dips into the
                    lower plateau on either side by abrupt banks, which mark the ancient beds of the
                    Râvi and the Beas (Biâs). These two rivers once flowed much farther southward
                    before joining the Chenâb and the Sutlej, and their original course may still be
                    distinctly traced, not only by the signs of former fluvial action, but also by
                    the existence of dried-up canals. At the present day the Beas (Biâs) is totally
                    lost to the district, the Râvi merely waters a small corner, and the only rich
                    cultivation is that which stretches along the Chenâb and the Sutlej. The soil,
                    though naturally good, requires abundant irrigation to bring it under efficient
                    tillage. Numerous canals supply water from the Sutlej to the surrounding
                    country, and pools or <hi rend="italic">jhils</hi> collect during the rainy
                    weather in the hollows formed by the old watercourses.</p>
                <p>The census of 1881 returned the population at 551,964 persons (males 304,517,
                    females 247,447), Mohammedans numbering 435,901, Hindus 112,001, Sikhs 2085,
                    Europeans 1709, Eurasians 110, native Christians 42, and “others” 116. Only one
                    town had a population exceeding 10,000—Mùltân, 68,674. Most of the people are
                    grouped together in villages on the irrigated lowlands, only a scattered nomad
                    population being found on the sterile upland tract. In 1878-79 the area under
                    Government assessment was 3,763,200 acres, of which 799,360 were cultivated,
                    245,760 uncultivable waste, 2,618,080 cultivable, and 100,000 grazing lands.
                    Cultivation is, however, spreading steadily, though the character of the
                    agriculture remains slovenly, as the Jât tribes who comprise the mass of the
                    rural population have not yet lost their predatory and pastoral propensities.
                    Near the city, however, capitalist farmers have brought their land into a high
                    state of cultivation. The areas under crop in 1881-82 were as follows rice
                    15,998, wheat 209,183, great millet 53,605, spiked millet 13,254, Italian millet
                    724, barley 7460, gram 8303, peas 24,443, and tobacco 1624. Indigo forms the
                    most important commercial staple. The chief articles of trade are sugar and
                    indigo from the lowlands, and wool and <hi rend="italic">ghi</hi> from the
                    pasture lands of the <hi rend="italic">l·&amp;r.</hi> Silk and fine cotton
                    fabrics are produced at Mùltân; coarse cotton cloth for home consumption is
                    woven in every village. The Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway connects the city
                    with the Northern Punjab and with the East Indian line at Delhi, and the Indus
                    Valley State Railway runs through a portion of the district. The total length of
                    roads is 907 miles and of railways 130.</p>
                <p>The total imperial revenue of the district in 1880-81 was 953,408 rupees, of
                    which 561,052 were derived from the land revenue. A small provincial and local
                    revenue is also raised. Education, especially among the Mohammedans, is in a
                    backward state, and in 1872-73 only 3062 children attended school, of whom the
                    Hindus contributed 46 per cent., although they only form 18⅜ per cent, of the
                    whole population. The climate is proverbial even among the hot and dusty Punjab
                    plains for its-heat and dust. The mean temperature in the shade for the six
                    years ending 1876 was in January 54° ’ 70 Fahr., in June 95 <hi

                <p>At the time of Alexander’s invasion Mùltân appears as the chief seat of the
                    Malli; but the Greek power soon came to an end, and the country passed under the
                    rule of the Gupta dynasty of Magadha. The early Arab geographers mention Mùltân
                    as forming part of the kingdom of Sind, which was conquered for the caliphate by
                    Mohammed Kâsim in the middle of the 8th century. The whole province was
                    conquered by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1005 A.D. It afterwards formed a part of the
                    Mughal empire of Bâbar, and continued so till the extinction of that power. The

                    century is a story of alternate invasion by Marhattâs, Afghans, and Sikhs. At
                    length, in 1779, Muzaffar Khan, of the Sadozai family, succeeded in obtaining
                    the governorship of Mûltân. Ranjit Sinh after a long siege carried the capital
                    by storm in 1818, and put Muzaffar Khan and five of his sons to death. In 1829
                    he made over the administration of Mûltân with five neighbouring districts to
                    the famous Sawan Mall, who raised the province to a state of prosperity by
                    excavating canals and inducing new inhabitants to settle. After the
                    establishment of the council of regency at Lahore, difficulties arose between
                    Mûlrâj, son and successor of Sawan Mall, and the British officials, which led to
                    his rebellion, and culminated in the second war and the annexation of the whole
                    of the Punjab. The city of Mûltân, after a stubborn defence, was carried by
                    storm in January 1849. The district at once passed under direct British rule,
                    and order has not been disturbed since.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mûltân,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Mooltan,</hi> city and
                    headquarters of the above district, is situated 4 miles from the present left
                    bank of the Chenâb (30° 12' N. lat., 71° 30' E. long.). The total population in
                    1881 was 68,674. The town is enclosed on three sides by a wall, but open towards
                    the south, where the dry bed of the old Râvi intervenes between the town and
                    citadel. Large and irregular suburbs have grown up outside the wall since the
                    annexation in 1849. Within the city proper, narrow and tortuous streets, often
                    ending in <hi rend="italic">culs-de-sac,</hi> fill almost the whole space; but
                    one broad bazaar runs from end to end. The principal buildings include the
                    shrines of two Mohammedan saints and the remains of an ancient Hindu temple. The
                    civil station contains a courthouse and treasury, commissioner’s offices, jail,
                    post-office, telegraph-office, dispensary, and staging bungalow The Church
                    Missionary Society maintains a station here. As a trade centre Mûltân possesses
                    great importance, its chief imports being cotton and other piece-goods, while
                    the main staples of export are sugar, cotton, indigo, and wool. Trade continues
                    to develop slowly but steadily. The value of the imports for 1879, 1880, 1881
                    was 75, 84, and 87 lakhs of rupees, and of the exports 36, 37, and 40 lakhs
                    respectively. Lately there has been a great revival of the indigo trade.</p>
