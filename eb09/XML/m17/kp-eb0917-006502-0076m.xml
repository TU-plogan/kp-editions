                    decay of their dead parts a thin layer of mould (humus) in which the seeds of
                    higher plants are able to take root. The importance, however, of Mosses in a
                    morphological point of view proceeds from their position in the botanical
                    system. The Muscineae immediately follow the first division of the vegetable
                    kingdom, the Thallophytes, under which are included the Algae and Fungi, because
                    their vegetative body is a “thallus,”—that is to say, is not divided into stem
                    and leaf like that of higher plants, nor are they possessed of roots like those
                    observed in higher plants (Ferns, Conifers, Monocotyledons, Dicotyledons, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> t</hi> fcc.). Their anatomical structure is also very simple,
                    the individual essential tissue-elements being but little differentiated from
                    each other.</p>
                <p>The Muscineae agree in many of their conditions with the Thallophytes, in others
                    again with the next higher division, the vascular Cryptogams (Pteridophytes), to
                    which the Ferns, Equisetums, and Lycopodiums belong. In many Muscineae of the
                    division of Liverworts <hi rend="italic">(Hepa-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ticae)</hi> the vegetative body has still the form of a thallus (fig. 1), which
                    is ribbon-shaped and grows in close contact with the substratum. There are,
                    however, several gradual stages of transition from this ribbon-shaped thallus to
                    a leaved stem, such as many Liverworts <hi rend="italic">(Hepaticae)</hi> and
                    all Leaf-mosses <hi rend="italic">(Λfusci</hi><hi rend="italic">frondosi)</hi>
                    possess. Yet the structure of the leaves and of the stem, even in the latter, is
                    very simple. The leaves present for the most part a cellsurface of one layer,
                    and that (if we leave out of sight those in the middle part of the leaf, which
                    in Leaf-mosses form the “mid-rib”) is ordinarily composed of cells of uniform
                    character. There is thus no epidermis as in higher plants, and the leaf itself
                    attains but very trifling dimensions. The stem is also of simple structure; it
                    possesses no “vascular bundles,” but consists only of simple cells, among which
                    there is no differentiation, except that those which lie outside often have
                    thicker walls, and thus form a firmer rind-layer, while the interior ones are
                    more elongated and serve for the storage and transmission of the plastic
                    substances (albumen, hydrocarbons, &lt;fcc.). The roots also by which the stems
                    are attached to the ground are of very simple organization. They are either
                    hair-like tubules as in many Liverworts, or rows of cells as in the Leaf-mosses.
                    To distinguish them from the roots of higher plants they have been termed
                    “rhizoids.” In many cases the vegetative body scarcely attains one twenty-fifth
                    of an inch in length, in others, however, it rises into a much-branched form of
                    from about 4 to about 12 inches or more. The duration of its life reaches in
                    some small forms <hi rend="italic">(Ephemerum, Phascum,</hi> &lt;fcc.) only a
                    few weeks or months; in most cases, however, it is virtually unlimited, since
                    the vegetative body continues to grow at its point while the older parts below
                    are dying away. From this cause too the branches are isolated from each other,
                    and become independent plants. In a peat-moor, for instance, the Bog-moss plants
                    on the upper surface are the points and branches of the very same plants whose
                    under-parts have long ago died away, and have principally contributed to the
                    formation of the peat. This isolation of the branches through the dying away of
                    the older parts which keep them together is at the same time a means of
                    multiplication. Mosses also possess many other arrangements for asexual
                    multiplication, as through gemmae, “innovations,” &lt;fcc. In the Liverworts,
                    for instance, almost every cell is capable of giving origin to a new plant.</p>
                <p>The most extensive propagation, however, of the Mosses is that by means of
                    spores, small roundish cells which are formed in a peculiar capsule, the <hi
                    rend="italic">sporogonium.</hi> The formation of these sporogonia is especially
                    characteristic of the Muscineae. They originate, as a consequence of
                    fertilization, from a cell—the ovum-cell—which is generated in the female sexual
                    organ, the <hi rend="italic">archegonium.</hi> These archegonia (fig. 6) have,
                    when ready for fertilization, the form of a flask. They consist of an inferior
                    and somewhat swollen portion, which contains the ovum-cell, and of a superior
                    portion drawn out to some length, the neck. The neck forms a canal through which
                    the male fertilizing bodies, the spermatozoïde (fig. 5, Z&gt;), enter to blend
                    with the ovum-cell. In the immature condition the archegonium is closed, its
                    neck portion is filled up with a string of cells and covered at the top by a
                    layer of cells which closes it like a lid (fig. 6). At a later period, however,
                    the membranes of the string of cells which fills up the neck (the canal-cells of
                    the neck) are converted into a jelly, which on contact with water swells up
                    greatly, forces open the apex of the neck portion, and thus presents an open
                    access to the ovum-cell. The mucilage which arises from the swelling up of the
                    canal-cells of the neck is also so far of importance with regard to
                    fertilization that by it the freely-moving male fertilizing bodies are stopped
                    when they reach the neck of the archegonium. The male fertilizing bodies are
                    here, as in many Algae, in the vascular Cryptogams, and in most animals, termed
                    <hi rend="italic">spermatozoids.</hi> They are spirally-coiled filaments,
                    thickened at the posterior extremity, finely pointed at the anterior, and
                    bearing at this thin end two long fine cilia by means of which they can move in
                    water. The spermatozoïde are formed in the male sexual organs, the <hi
                    rend="italic">antheridia</hi> (fig. 5, C ’), which are bodies with long or short
                    stalks, and of spherical, oval, or club-shaped form, surrounded by a
                    wall-stratum consisting of a simple layer of cells, and which possess in their
                    interior a tissue formed of numerous small cells, in each of which one
                    spermatozoid takes its origin. When the wall-layer of the antheridium is torn
                    asunder the spermatozoïde are set free at its apex, and move in water by means
                    of their cilia, like Infusoria. Thus water is always necessary to fertilization;
                    it is only in water that the neck of the archegonium opens, and that the
                    spermatozoids can move. Since either the Mosses grow in moist localities, or
                    those which spring up in dry situations always form little turfs so as to suck
                    up every drop of rain like a sponge, their fertilization is always secured,
                    provided the organs of both sexes are present.</p>
                <p>Even before the opening of the archegonium-case the oosphere has formed itself in
                    the inferior portion of the archegonium. Originally in this inferior ventricose
                    portion of the archegonium is a large cell, the <hi rend="italic">central
                    cell</hi><pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n77/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0077-0066"/> (fig. 6). From this a small cell is severed in an
                    upward direction, which perishes at a later period, and is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">ventral canal-cell</hi> (fig. 6, ό), while the inferior cell
                    becomes round and forms itself into the oosphere. When ready for fertilization
                    the ovum-cell is a spherical portion of protoplasm with a cell-nucleus (fig. 6,
                    e). Fertilization follows on the blending of one or perhaps several
                    spermatozoïde with the oosphere. The first result of fertilization is that the
                    oosphere becomes surrounded by a membrane of cellulose, and then grows very
                    notably, while correspondingly with this growth it becomes divided by
                    cell-walls, and thus becomes a cellular body. From the fertilized oosphere
                    proceeds the moss-fruit, the sporogonium. The embryo which has proceeded from
                    the fertilized oosphere lives at the expense of the vegetative body on which the
                    archegonium is situated, like a parasite on the plant that nourishes it. The
                    ventral portion of the archegonium grows along with the embryo. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Rieda,</hi> the lowest form of one subdivision of the Liverworts,
                    the sporogonium remains even during the whole lifetime of the plant shut up
                    within the ventral portion of the archegonium, and the spores formed in the
                    sporogonium are not set free until that part of the plant on which the
                    archegonium is situated withers away. In most other Liverworts also the
                    sporogonium attains almost its entire development within the ventral portion of
                    the archegonium, which grows contemporaneously with it, and it is not until the
                    spores are mature that the stalk of the sporogonium extends itself considerably
                    (fig. 3, (1 ), <hi rend="italic">Λ);</hi> then the ventral portion of the
                    archegonium springs in pieces and the spore-capsule issues forth and scatters
                    its spores,— an occurrence which is completed within a few days. The ventral
                    portion of the archegonium, which increases considerably after fertilization and
                    which surrounds the embryo like a sheath, is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >calyptra.</hi> In the case of the Liverworts this calyptra is burst open by the
                    sporogonium; in the Mosses, however, the elongated fusiform-embryo tears away
                    the calyptra at its base and raises it up like a cap on its apex, and it is then
                    found situated on the extremity of the sporogonium. In many Leaf-mosses <hi
                    rend="italic">(Polytriclιum, Hypnum crista</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >castrensis)</hi> the sporogonium requires more than a year for its
                    development.</p>
                <p>The function of the sporogonium is the production of spores. The simplest mode in
                    which this takes place is seen in the species <hi rend="italic">Ricda.</hi> Here
                    the sporogonium is a spherical cell-body, consisting of a wall-layer and an
                    interior tissue. The cells of this latter are called the mother-cells of the
                    spores, because each of them by division forms four spores. In the species,
                    however, which stand higher we can distinguish in the sporogonium a foot, which
                    frequently penetrates into the tissue of the vegetative body, and in many
                    Liverworts and almost all Mosses prolongs itself into a stalk supporting the
                    capsule in which the spores are formed (figs. 3, 7, 8). In the case of most
                    Liverworts we find in this capsule, besides the spores, also a number of cells
                    which do not become spores. These either act as “nutrient cells” to the
                    spore-forming cells, which gradually consume the matters stored up in them <hi
                    rend="italic">(Riella),</hi> or they form themselves into fusiform-cells with
                    spiral thickenings of parts of the wall—the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >elaters,</hi> which play a part in the dispersion of the spores. The sporogonia
                    of Mosses do not possess elaters. They are rather complex structures, and attain
                    a higher anatomical differentiation than the moss-stem itself. For example, at
                    certain points in their epidermis they possess openings <hi rend="italic"
                    >(stomata),</hi> which are entirely absent on the stem. In order to ensure the
                    dispersion of the spores, special arrangements are found in the sporogonia of
                    Mosses.</p>
                <p>The course of development of the Muscineae divides itself into two
                    sharply-defined stages. The vegetative body, whether it be only a thallus as in
                    many Liverworts, or a leafy stem, produces the sexual organs, the antheridia and
                    the archegonia. From the fertilized oosphere of the archegonium arises a special
                    structure, the sporogonium, which does not nourish itself independently, but
                    lives like a parasite upon the moss-plant, and produces the spores only in a
                    sexual way. The two stages—on the one hand the moss-plants that bear sexual
                    organs, and on the other the sporogonium developed as the result of
                    fertilization—are termed <hi rend="italic">generations ∙,</hi> accordingly in
                    the Muscineae the course of development consists in a regular alternation of
                    these two stages—in an <hi rend="italic">alternation of generations.</hi> The
                    one generation possesses sexual organs, and is thus the sexual one. The other
                    generation, the result of fertilization, possesses no sexual organs and is
                    asexual, but produces the spores. Such alternation of generations is exhibited
                    still more strikingly in Fems. In this case, however, it is the proper leafy
                    fern-plant which is the asexual generation, producing spores, but possessing no
                    sexual organs. It arises out of a fertilized oosphere, and thus corresponds to
                    the sporogonium of the Muscineae. The sexual generation of the Ferns is a small
                    and insignificant expansion, the prothallium, which bears antheridia and
                    archegonia, and thus corresponds to the sexual generation of the Muscineae,
                    which is here represented by the proper moss-plant. The vegetative body of the
                    Mosses which bears the sexual organs is not, however, the immediate product of
                    the germination of the spore, from which there is produced in the first place a
                    simple structure, a <hi rend="italic">pro-embryo</hi> (specially developed in
                    the Mosses proper, where it is termed “protonema,” and where it assumes the
                    appearance of a much-branched filamentous confervaceous Alga, fig. 15); it is
                    from this proembryo that the leafy stems arise as lateral buds.</p>
                <p>From a systematic point of view the Muscineae are divided into two
                    sections—Liverworts <hi rend="italic">(Hepaticae)</hi> and Mosses <hi
                    rend="italic">(Musci frondosi).</hi> The two sections are closely related to
                    each other, but in external characters they are separated by rather sharp
                    boundary lines.</p>

                <p>Liverworts stand below the Mosses proper in regard to the number both of species
                    and of individuals. They are also of much more limited occurrence, for they are
                    found, for the most part, only in damp and shady localities, and seldom occupy
                    any large extent of ground. The most extensive growths are those of many <hi
                    rend="italic">Marchantiaceae—</hi> as, for example, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fegatella</hi><hi rend="italic">conica,</hi> which often forms a continuous
                    covering on moist stones, walls, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">The Organs of Vegetation.—</hi> With a few exceptions, the
                    vegetative body is closely united to the substratum on which it grows, and
                    fastened to it by clasping-roots (rhizoids) composed of a single cell. The side
                    turned towards the substratum is of different structure from the upper or dorsal
                    side. The Liverworts thus belong, with the exception of two species, to the

                    sides of different structure, a dorsal side and a ventral side, as in vertebrate

                <p>The vegetative body of the Liverworts is either a thallus or a leafy plant; and

                    example of a thallose Liverwort, showing the anterior portion of a plant of <hi

                    the left the under side. The vegetative body is a ribbon-shaped thallus, on the
                    under side of which the clasping-roots (rhizoids) spring out of the mid-rib.
                    Here the mid-rib is sharply separated from the side portions, but in other cases
                    (as <hi rend="italic">Aneura</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pellid)</hi> it passes
                    into them by a very gradual transition. In front, in an indentation of the
                    growing point (s), are found the only organs which are formed upon it. These are
                    hairs secreting mucilage (papillae), and which stand on the under side. The
                    mucilage which they secrete is probably intended for the purpose of protecting
                    the vegetative point against the effects of drought.</p>
                <p>A peculiar exception appears in the growth of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Riella</hi> (fig. 2). In this case a membranous wing, about one-fifth of an
                    inch in width, of the finest green and of extreme delicacy, turns regularly on a
                    central rib or axis, so as to form with the axis a sort of screw or winding
                    staircase, having the form of an inverted cone with the apex downwards. The
                    length of the whole plant of <hi rend="italic">Riella helicophylla</hi> is about
                    2 inches. This plant, which is decidedly one of the most remarkable forms in the
                    vegetable kingdom, grows upright in water, and was discovered in Algiers. At its
                    lower end it is attached to the ground by clasping-roots. This is the only
                    thallose Liverwort that grows upright, and also one of the few that grow in
                    water. There are likewise two species of <hi rend="italic">Rieda</hi> which swim
                    in water— <hi rend="italic">Riccia</hi><hi rend="italic">natans</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ricda</hi><hi rend="italic">fluitans</hi>; but these also possess
                    forms which live on land, and it is these forms which attain to the formation of
                    sporogonia. It follows hence that these plants also were originally in every
                    case land plants. A few others too, such as <hi rend="italic">Pellia
                    epiphylla</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Marchanda</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >polymorpha,</hi> have the power of vegetating in water, but this happens only
                    exceptionally, and the plants are then sterile.</p>
                <p>Returning to the thallose Liverworts that live on land, we have to remark that
                    the differentiation of their tissues is a very simple one. The cells of the
                    thallus, so far as they are not employed in the formation of clasping-roots or
                    of sexual organs, are all homogeneous. Those only of the mid-rib present a
                    difference in <hi rend="italic">Metzgeria, Blyttia,</hi> and others by their
                    lengthened form. From this simple form has arisen a further complication in the
                    development of the vegetative body in two different series. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Marchantiaceae</hi> the vegetative body retains the form of a
                    thallus, but its anatomical organization is of higher structure. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jungermanniaceae</hi> it is the external organization of the
                    vegetative body which is the richer, and here the transition takes place in it
                    to the foliose Liverworts, which possess a stem with leaves.</p>
                <p>We may consider as representative of the <hi rend="italic">Marchantiaceae</hi>
                    the very widely - spread <hi rend="italic">Marchanda</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >polymorpha.</hi> Its vegetative body is a broad ribbonshaped thallus, which has
                    on its under side clasping-roots (single-celled tubules, which are either
                    simple, or have on their inner side characteristic conical or tubercular
                    thickenings) and two rows of membranous lamellae, the uppermost of which cover
                    the growing point and form.a protection to it. (See the section through <hi
                    rend="italic">Fegatella,</hi> an allied form, fig. 3, (1),I..) The upper surface
                    presents a division into small rhomboidal spaces (areolae), and in the middle of
                    each space is an opening, the <hi rend="italic">stoma</hi> or breathing hole. A
                    section through the thallus shows a strongly-marked epidermis broken through at
                    definite spots by the stomata or breathing holes, which, however, in this case
                    have a very different structure from that presented in the higher plants. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Marchanda</hi> (fig. 3, (5), <hi rend="italic">Sp)</hi> they are
                    of barrel-shaped figure, and consist of several rings or tiers of cells placed
                    over one another. Their origin may be traced in fig. 3, (3) and (4). Below the
                    epidermis we find chambers filled with air. These, however, are not empty; from
                    their base sprout forth cellular threads (fig. 3, (5)), the cells of which
                    çontain a large quantity of chlorophyll. It is in these that the assimilation of
                    the carbon takes place. Those cells of the thallus which lie beneath serve only
                    for the storing up and transmission of the materials for construction. The
                    individual chambers are separated from each other by flat layers of cells, and
                    on these rest the rhomboidal areolae of the upper surface which can be seen with
                    the naked eye. In other <hi rend="italic">Marchandées</hi> the stomata are of a
                    different structure. In <hi rend="italic">Fegatella,</hi> for example, they are
                    not barrel-shaped, but are bounded by several concentric circles of cells, which
                    all lie on the upper surface of the thallus. Early stages of these are
                    represented in fig. 3, (2). The way in which the air-chambers and stomata attain
                    their condition is very remarkable. Small depressions in the cell-layer of the
                    upper surface are formed in large numbers behind the growing point (fig. 3, (1),
                    <hi rend="italic">U).</hi> These widen considerably, and become, as it were,
                    roofed over by the neighbouring parts, so that an epidermis (fig. 3, (1), <hi
                    rend="italic">F)</hi> grows in this manner over the hollows from the bottom of
                    which at a later period the green cellular threads sprout forth. The strings of
                    mucilage-cells which are found in the tissue of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fegatella,</hi> the brown threads which appear in that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Preissia,</hi> and the cells filled with a brown oily secretion which are found
                    in <hi rend="italic">Marchanda</hi> and other species must also be
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>The second series, which comes next to the simple thallose forms, is that of the
                    foliose or leafy <hi rend="italic">Jungermannieae.</hi> Forms intermediate
                    between the thallose and the foliose are represented by the species <hi
                    rend="italic">Blasia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fossombronia.</hi> The former,
                    which not unfrequently grows in the damp soil of forests, possesses a flat,
                    thallus-like stem, which bears on its longitudinal axis two rows of leaves
                    inserted parallel to each other, and has also on the under side two rows of
                    toothed scales, the <hi rend="italic">amphigastria. Fossombronia</hi> makes a
                    nearer approach to the proper leafy forms; it possesses two rows of leaves
                    inserted obliquely to the longitudinal axis of the flattened stem. In the
                    foliose <hi rend="italic">Jungermannieae,</hi> in the narrower sense of the
                    term, the stalk is thin and thread-like, and bears distinctly defined leaves. In
                    this case also—with the exception of the upright growing <hi rend="italic"
                    >Haplomitrium Hookeri—</hi> the stem grows in close connexion with the
                    substratum. The leaves stand in three rows: two lateral, and one ventral towards
                    the substratum. The ventral leaves are in this case also, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Blasia,</hi> termed <hi rend="italic">amphigastria</hi> or under
                    leaves. They are smaller than the side leaves, and are sometimes reduced to the
                    form of mere hairs, or even are entirely wanting, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jungermannia bicuspidata,</hi> where it is only in rare exceptional cases that
                    they appear. The leaves of Liverworts consist of a single layer of cells without
                    any mid-rib. They are commonly bifid at the apex, but in many forms this
                    condition is only recognizable in early development, and disappears before
                    maturity.</p>
                <p>In general the leaves stand so thickly that they overlap each other with their
                    margins, and quite cover the upper surface of the stem. The way in which the
                    leaves overlap has been employed as a systematic character. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Overshot</hi> leaves <hi rend="italic">{folia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >succuba)</hi> are those in which the anterior margin turned towards the
                    vegetative point of the stem stands higher than the posterior one, and thus the
                    anterior margin of each leaf overlaps the posterior margin of the leaf which
                    stands before it, while its own posterior margin is overlapped by the anterior
                    margin of the leaf which stands behind it. In the opposite case of <hi
                    rend="italic">undershot</hi> leaves <hi rend="italic">{folia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">incuba),</hi> the posterior margin of the leaf is higher than its
                    anterior margin, and the anterior margin, inclining obliquely outwards, is
                    overlapped by the posterior margin of the leaf which comes next before it, as in
                    fig. 4. The mode in which the leaves overlap each other depends on a difference
                    in the relative amount of growth of the upper or dorsal and the under or ventral
                    side respectively. If the growth of the upper side preponderates, then we have
                    the overshot, in the opposite case the undershot mode of covering. Originally
                    the leaves do not stand obliquely to the longitudinal axis; it is only gradually
                    that they are shifted out of their place. The position of the leaves is
                    explained by their origin. The apex of the stem is occupied by a cell which has
                    the form of a three-sided pyramid with a vaulted base. The surface of one side
                    of the pyramid is directed downwards, the two others are directed laterally.
                    This apical cell is divided by walls which are parallel alternately to one of
                    the side walls. Thus segments are cut off from the apical cell and lie in three
                    rows. From each of these segments arises a leaf. The leaves are thus necessarily
                    likewise arranged in three rows, one of which is turned towards the
                    substratum.</p>
                <p>The anatomical structure of the stem is also a very simple one. Its exterior
                    cells have their walls somewhat more strongly thickened, and thus form a firmer
                    rind-layer. We must also notice the secretion of dark-brown oily corpuscles,
                    which undergo no further conversion, and are met with in certain leaf-cells. In
                    the thallose <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n79/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0079-0068"/> forms the ramification is of a forked character
                    (dichotomous) (fig.</p>
                <p>1). Frequently too, on the older portions, “adventitious” shoots are formed; they
                    may frequently be seen to spring from the margin and the mid-rib of the thallus
                    of <hi rend="italic">Metzgeria furcata.</hi> The ramification of the foliose
                    Liverworts is a very complex one, but is never of a really forked character. The
                    branchlets commonly stand below the leaves on the sides of the stem.</p>
                <p>The above-mentioned “adventitious” shoots serve the purpose of vegetative
                    increase. The same end is attained by the gemmae, which are of many different
                    forms. In <hi rend="italic">Aneura</hi> individual cells detach themselves from
                    the thallus and grow up into new plants. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Marchantieae</hi> the gemmae are formed in peculiar receptacles which stand on
                    the upper side of the ribbon-shaped thallus. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Marchantia</hi><hi rend="italic">polymorpha</hi> these receptacles have the
                    form of a basket open at the top, while in <hi rend="italic">I.·unularia</hi>
                    the margin of the same receptacle is semicircular. The gemmae, which are
                    developed on the base of the receptacle, are flat upright cellular bodies, with
                    two indentations at the sides, out of which at a later period, at the time of
                    germination, proceed two growing points. The gemmae, however, are of similar
                    structure on both sides. Which side is at the time of germination to become
                    dorsal with stomata and air-chambers, and which ventral with root-hairs, is
                    decided by its position with respect to the light. It is always the side turned
                    towards the light which develops itself into that which bears stomata. This
                    occurs even when gemmae that swim on water receive light only from below. In
                    that case the under side becomes that which possesses stomata and the
                    air-chambers described above, while the upper side develops root-hairs
                    (rhizoids). <hi rend="italic">Blasia pusilia</hi> has also very peculiar
                    receptacles for gemmae, provided with a long channel leading outwards, while in
                    many foliose <hi rend="italic">Jungermannieae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> for
                    example, <hi rend="italic">Jungermannia υentricosa, Scapania</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nemorosa,</hi><hi rend="italic">Jungermannia bicuspidata,</hi> and
                    others—gemmae consisting of a few cells are formed on the leaves or the stem
                    respectively.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">The Organs of Sex.—</hi> The antheridium in Liverworts is a
                    spherical or ellipsoidal cellular body with a shorter or longer stalk (fig. 5,
                    &lt;z), and consists of a wall-layer and an interior tissue, the mother-cells of
                    the spermatozoids. In each of these cells a spermatozoid is formed, and, as it
                    appears, in the following way :— the peripheral layer of the cell-nucleus
                    becomes thickened, and splits up into a ribbon, either annular or rolled up
                    spirally. The cilia by means of which the spermatozoid moves in water appear, on
                    the other hand, to be formed from the protoplasm in which the cell-nucleus lies.
                    The process, however, requires still closer investigation. Each antheridium is
                    originally a simple cell, which grows by repeated subdivision and becomes the
                    antheι ’ idial body. By the swelling up of the walls of the spermatozoid
                    mother-cells, the cells of the antheridium-wall are forced asunder at the apex,
                    and the spermatozoids, each imbedded in mucilage, are emitted in jets either
                    free from one another or united into a pulp. This pulp is often ejected by an
                    explosion of the antheridium, as may be easily observed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Frullania</hi><hi rend="italic">dilatata.</hi> In water the spermatozoids
                    isolate themselves, and in the most favourable cases are carried over to the
                    archegonia. Since very many spermatozoids are formed in one antheridium, and
                    since one or very few of these suffice for the fertilization of an archegonium,
                    it is evident that an enormous number of them must perish.</p>
                <p>The archegonia also proceed from one cell, through the division of which their
                    construction is accomplished. They always take their origin from the cells of
                    the upper surface, and the same is the case with those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anthoceros,</hi> which, however, are sunk into the tissue of the thallus, so
                    that their neck and ventral portions remain united with the tissue of the
                    thallus and do not project freely over it.</p>
                <p>The distribution of the organs of sex is either monoecious or dioecious. In the
                    latter case the antheridia and archegonia arc found on different individual
                    plants, as in <hi rend="italic">Sphaerocarpus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >terrestris,</hi> where the male plant is smaller than the female. In the formel
                    case the antheridia and archegonia are found on the same plant. In the thallose
                    forms they are always inserted on the dorsal side of the thallus, and commonly
                    sunk into a cavity in it (fig. <hi rend="italic">5, B).</hi> In <hi
                    rend="italic">Anthoceros</hi> the antheridia even stand in closed cavities,
                    which do not open till the antheridium is mature. The organs of sex stand either
                    on ordinary branches, which at a later period vegetate and grow, or on special
                    sexual shoots. These are of especially remarkable construction in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Marchantieae,</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> which <hi
                    rend="italic">Marchantia</hi><hi rend="italic">polymorpha</hi> may serve as an
                    example. In this species the antheridia are found on the upper side of a peltate
                    radially-lobed disk, supported on a stalk (fig. 5, <hi rend="italic">A^).</hi>
                    The archegonia stand on the under side of a similar receptacle. These structures
                    may be termed “inflorescences.” They are not simple branches, but systems oi
                    branches which have arisen from the repeated bifurcation of a thallus-shoot.
                    Each indentation in the disk of the “inflorescence” corresponds to the
                    vegetative point of a branch, and this explains the fact that the oldest
                    antheridia are found in the centre of the disk; and from this point to the
                    periphery, where the vegetative points are found, are successive groups of
                    antheridia of younger growth, for the youngest organs of sex always stand next
                    to the vegetative point of the shoot. The stalk of the inflorescence is nothing
                    else than the inferior portion of the branch-system greatly prolonged. In the
                    leafy <hi rend="italic">Jungermannieae</hi> the distribution of the organs of
                    sex is also either monoecious or dioecious. The archegonia in this case stand
                    either singly <hi rend="italic">(Lejeunia,</hi> &amp;c. ) or in larger groups.
                    The first archegonium always arises from the apical cell of the shoot connected
                    with it, so that with it the latter closes its longitudinal growth. This
                    circumstance has been employed in the classification of the foliose <hi

                    the <hi rend="italic">anacrogynous,</hi> in which latter the archegonia never
                    proceed from the apex of the shoot itself.</p>
                <p>Whilst the archegonia of the thallose forms are protected by being lodged in an
                    excavation of the thallus, or surrounded by a luxuriant growth of its tissue,
                    the archegonia of the foliose <hi rend="italic">Jungermannieae</hi> are
                    enveloped by the leaves of the stem-bud, which on that account are termed
                    perichaetial leaves <hi rend="italic">(folia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >perichaetialia'),</hi> or, collectively, perichaetium. Between these
                    perichaetial leaves and the archegonia there grows up. in most forms a second
                    involucre, of a goblet or pitcher shape, the “perianthium” (fig. 4, <hi
                    rend="italic">B).</hi> It springs up in the form of a circular fence, gradually
                    growing upwards. In many <hi rend="italic">Jungermannieae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Calypogeia)</hi> the archegonia are enclosed in a kind of sack-shaped
                    structure, which forces its way into the ground, in which, in fact, it takes
                    root. This “fruit-sac” in the <hi rend="italic">Jungermannieae geocalyceae</hi>
                    is the hollowed-out shoot from which the archegonia arise. Its extremity becomes
                    thickened and forms a circular fence about the archegonia; thus there arises a
                    structure about two twenty-fifths of an inch long, which is constantly becoming
                    deeper, and at the bottom of which the archegonia are placed. There is always an
                    endeavour to protect and envelop the archegonia. This is notably conspicuous in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Marchantieae,</hi> where round every archegonium there

                    whilst every group of archegonia is also enveloped by two scales, which incline

                <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Development of the Asexual Generation of the
                    Sporogonium.—</hi> Just as in the vegetative classification we are led in a
                    continuous series from the simple thallose forms to the foliose forms, so in the
                    perfecting of the fertilized oosphere into an embryo (here the sporogonium)
                    there is a gradual advance from simple to more complex forms. The first result
                    of fertilization always is that the oosphere becomes surrounded by a membrane,
                    grows, and transforms itself by division into a cellular body. In the simplest
                    case, in <hi rend="italic">Riccia</hi> (fig. 7, <hi rend="italic">A),</hi> the
                    only differentiation which takes place in this cellular body is that it forms a
                    walllayer which is soon reabsorbed, while the whole of the interior cells form
                    spores in such a way that by division four spores proceed from every
                    mother-cell. In <hi rend="italic">Marchantia</hi> (fig.</p>
                <p>7, <hi rend="italic">B)</hi> we find a separation taking place in the embryo, in
                    which its inferior portion (that beneath the line 1, 1) becomes the short stalk
                    of the sporogonium and its superior portion becomes the capsule. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jungermanniese</hi> (fig. 7, <hi rend="italic">C, E, F)</hi> we
                    find in the young embryo a group of cells from which proceed the mother-cells of
                    the spores (shown by hatched lines in the figures); they are covered by a layer
                    of cells which at a later period becomes the wall of the spore-capsule. Lower
                    down (distinguished by a bracket in fig. 7, C ’) comes that part of the embryo
                    out of which the stalk of the sporogonium is formed, while the cell <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> represents an appendage of the embryo. The inferior portion
                    of the stalk often swells into a thickened foot, which frequently penetrates
                    deeply into the tissue of the fertile shoot (fig. 8). The upper part of the
                    sporogonium, in which the spores and elaters are formed, swells into a
                    sphere.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Jungermanniese,</hi> when the sporogonium attains
                    maturity, the stalk becomes very considerably lengthened, the ventral part of
                    the archegonium, which had hitherto kept pace with it in growth, flies asunder,
                    and the capsule emerges. This opens in various ways. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jungermanniese</hi> the wall breaks up into four valves (fig.</p>
                <p>4). The sporogonia of <hi rend="italic">Anthoceros</hi> behave in a very peculiar
                    manner. The period occupied by their development is much longer than that of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Jungermanniese.</hi> While they are discharging mature spores
                    at their apex they are still growing at their base, and forming new spores. The
                    sporogonium dehisces by two valves, and is traversed in the middle line by a
                    longitudinal string of cells not employed in the formation of spores. This
                    persists till the maturation of the sporogonium as a little column, and is
                    termed the ’ ‘ columella” (see fig. 7, <hi rend="italic">D}.</hi> The cells from
                    which the mothercells of the spores proceed have here the form of a dome and
                    enclose an inner portion which becomes the columella, while the inferior portion
                    of the embryo becomes its foot. In <hi rend="italic">Dendroceros,</hi> a foreign
                    form of <hi rend="italic">Anthoceros,</hi> it drives tubules resembling roots
                    into the tissue of the plant on which the sporogonium is seated. There is no
                    want of transitional steps between this method of formation of the sporogonia
                    and that of the <hi rend="italic">Jungermanniese.</hi> The species <hi
                    rend="italic">Notothylas</hi> is especially noteworthy in this respect.</p>
                <p>The spores, which proceed from one mother-cell by division into four parts, are
                    enveloped by a membrane consisting of two layers— an outer one, which has the
                    character of a cuticle in its great resistance to external agencies, and an
                    inner one, which is composed of cellulose. The plants do not proceed directly
                    from the germination of the spores; there is a pro - embryo of simple structure,
                    which, however, in most cases passes over at its end into the plant itself. In
                    the foliose <hi rend="italic">Jungermanniese</hi> the first step in germination
                    is the springing up of a row of cells in the cell at the end of which the growth
                    of the shoot next takes place. The young germ-plant next develops leaves of very
                    simple structure, and at first there generally appear on it only two rows of
                    leaves at the sides. In <hi rend="italic">Radula,</hi> however, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Frullania,</hi> both of them leafy forms, a cakelike cell-surface
                    is first developed in germination; and it is from one of the cells of the margin
                    of this that the growth of the leafy plant proceeds.</p>

                <p>The Mosses proper play a much larger part in the economy of nature than the
                    Liverworts; they occur in much greater quantity and are more widely distributed,
                    the conditions of their production not being confined within such narrow limits.
                    While the Liverworts, for the most part, thrive only in localities that are not
                    too dry, though some forms that grow upon bark, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Radula</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Frullania,</hi> can even endure drought,
                    Mosses, on the other hand, have an almost ubiquitous character. Many grow in
                    water <hi rend="italic">(Conomitrium,</hi><hi rend="italic">Fontinalis,</hi>
                    &lt;fcc.), in swamps (various kinds of <hi rend="italic">Hypnum,</hi> and

                    >Andreaea),</hi> on roofs, in fields, and on trees,—in short, under favourable
                    circumstances, a growth of Mosses develops itself almost everywhere. This is
                    connected with the fact that very many have the capacity of enduring drought,
                    and of suspending their growth while it continues and resuming it again in moist
                    weather. Besides, a few, such as <hi rend="italic">Hypnum cupressiforme,
                    Ceratodon,</hi><hi rend="italic">Barbula ruralis,</hi> can grow upon any kind of
                    substratum. Others grow by preference on organic substrata: as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Buxbaumia</hi><hi rend="italic">indusiata</hi> on decayed trunks, <hi

                    >Gymnostomum,</hi> and some <hi rend="italic">Hypna)</hi> and those that avoid

                    rendered possible by their uncommonly great capacity for reproduction. Not only
                    is the formation of spores in most species very extensively carried on, but we
                    have to add to this the manifold production of asexual means of multiplication,
                    such as gemmae, &amp;c. The sexual as well as the asexual generation of Mosses
                    attains to a higher grade of perfection than that of Liverworts.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">The Sexual Generation.—</hi> The extent of the sexual
                    generation of the Moss-plants proper varies within wide limits. While the stem
                    of <hi rend="italic">Ephemerum</hi> and some species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phascum</hi> appears in the form of a small bud, often scarcely visible to the

                    species <hi rend="italic">Spiridens.</hi> In every case, however, we have here a
                    really leafy stem; no thallose forms exist.</p>
                <p>The leaves are simple and always small. They either consist of one layer in their
                    whole extent, or are traversed by a mid-rib of several layers, which is often of
                    rather complex structure, and consists of thick-walled and thinwalled
                    tissue-elements, of which the former give mechanical firmness to the leaf, while
                    it is principally in the latter that the conveyance to the stem of the matter
                    formed in the leaf takes place. In the species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polytrichum</hi> the middle nerve occupies the greatest part of the leaf, and
                    is covered with lamellae, which consist of cells bearing chlorophyll. Instead of
                    these lamellae, we find in some other Mosses simple rows of cells, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Pharomitrium subsessile.</hi> A peculiar structure of the leaf is
                    also found in <hi rend="italic">Leucobryum</hi><hi rend="italic">glaucum</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Sphagnum.</hi> The first-named Moss forms thick
                    greenish-white turfs in damp spots. A transverse section through a leaf shows it
                    to be composed of two (or three) layers of cells. Above and below is a layer of
                    large cells devoid of contents, the membrane of which is perforated in various
                    places, so that the cavities of the individual cells communicate with each
                    other; thus arises a system of capillary tubes which suck up water and retain it
                    like a sponge. Between the angles of every two of these colourless cells we find
                    inserted a cell containing chlorophyll. The colourless cells are filled with air
                    instead of water, and thus the whole plant has a whitish appearance <hi
                    rend="italic">(Leucobryum),</hi> while the green hue comes out at the approach
                    of moisture. The leaves of <hi rend="italic">Sphagnum</hi> possess a similar
                    structure. In these too are perforated cells devoid of contents, and surrounded
                    by the meshes of cells containing chlorophyll. The inner wall of the empty cells
                    devoid of chlorophyll is for the most part set with peculiar thickenings of
                    annular or spiral form (fig. 9,∕), which give it the necessary firmness, as in
                    the vessels of higher plants. In this case too the empty perforated cells are
                    intended for the purpose of absorbing water; and the same end is attained by
                    cells of similar structure, which form the rind of the stem.</p>
                <p>The stem of Mosses is distinguished by its slight but uniform thickness, which
                    for the most part does not exceed that of a thick thread. Compared with this
                    delicacy, the compact, firm, and tough quality of the corresponding forms in
                    higher plants is so much the more striking. It depends on the fact that the
                    exterior layers of cells in the stem have thickened cell-walls, generally of a
                    brown colour, while the central parts have thin walls. The differentiation of
                    the tissues reaches its highest point in <hi rend="italic">Polytri∙ chum,
                    Hookeria, Splachnum,</hi> and others. Strings of separated cells pass from the
                    leaves into the stem, and apply themselves to its central tissue, which is of
                    different conformation from the rest of the tissue of the stem,—a circumstance
                    which requires mention because this is the first indication of the fact of such
                    extensive occurrence <pb break="no"

                    which run off from the leaf pass into the stem and there apply themselves to
                    others. The stems are thickly set with leaves. It is but seldom that these stand
                    in two rows on the sides, as in <hi rend="italic">Fissidens, Conomitrium,</hi>
                    and the sterile shoots of <hi rend="italic">Schistostega.</hi> The last-named
                    plant is of special interest as possessing two kinds of shoots of totally
                    different appearance. The fertile ones have their leaves placed on all sides of
                    the stem in a spiral manner; the sterile ones, on the other hand, have leaves
                    placed on two sides, and have the appearance of a fern-leaf. This position,
                    however, only comes to pass through a shifting and twisting of the stem.
                    Originally, in the bud, the leaves of the sterile stems stand in a spiral line.
                    On examination of the end of the stem it is found that the growing point from
                    which the leaves arise contains, as in the foliose Liverworts, an apical cell of
                    the form of a three-sided pyramid with a vaulted base. By means of partition
                    walls which are successively parallel to one of the side walls of the apical
                    cell “segments” are cut off; and from each of these proceeds a leaf, as well as
                    a part of the rind of the stem and of the inner tissue. On the direction of the
                    partition walls in the apical cell depends likewise the arrangement of the
                    leaves. The branches do not spring as in most phanerogamous plants from the axil
                    of a leaf, but from the upper surface of the stem below a leaf, and only out of
                    one of its cells, which becomes the apical cell of the branch.</p>
                <p>In the relation of the ramification to the general structure of the moss-plant
                    two leading classes have to be distinguished—the <hi rend="italic">acrocarpous
                    a,nd pleurocarpous</hi> Mosses. In the former the growth of the stalk concludes
                    with the formation of a sporogonium; for the archegonium, out of which the
                    former springs, proceeds from the apical cell itself. In the pleurocarpous
                    Mosses the sporogonium stands on the tip of a side-branch, and the growth of the
                    principal stem is thus not interfered λvith by fructification. In many
                    acrocarpous Mosses the stalk dies after fructification, and the Moss is then an
                    annual, as in many <hi rend="italic">Phasca-</hi><hi rend="italic">ceae.</hi> In
                    those acrocarpous Mosses which are perennial the further development is taken up
                    by a side-branch, and a so - called “innovation” is formed. By the dying away of
                    the principal stem, these innovation-shoots become at a later period independent
                    plants. The roots consist of simple rows of cells, springing from the surface of
                    the stem, especially at its base (see p. 72).</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">The sexual organs</hi> of the Leaf-mosses, the antheridia
                    and the archegonia, in their mature condition correspond in the main with those
                    of the Liverworts, from which, however, they differ somewhat in their
                    development. They occur generally in groups at the extremity of a shoot. Such
                    groups containing, as the case may be, either solely antheridia, or solely
                    archegonia, or a mixture of the two, are termed “flowers.” An exception to this
                    condition of the antheridia is found in <hi rend="italic">Sphagnum</hi> (fig.
                    11, <hi rend="italic">A).</hi> Here the antheridia do not stand in groups on the
                    summit of the male branch, but are arranged along it, so as to stand beneath the
                    leaves on the prolonged axis of the shoot. In the rest of the Mosses, with the
                    exception of <hi rend="italic">Polytrichum,</hi> the first antheridium (or
                    archegonium) of a group proceeds from the apical cell itself; and thus the
                    growth of the shoot connected with it is closed. The general character of the
                    male “flowers” is very various, in the form of buds, heads, or disks. They are
                    enveloped by a number of leaves, the “perigonium” (fig. 11). The male plants of
                    dioecious Mosses are often considerably smaller than the female ones. This is
                    the case with <hi rend="italic">Funaria hygrometrica,</hi> and to a remarkable
                    extent with <hi rend="italic">I)icranum</hi><hi rend="italic">undulatum</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Leucohryum</hi><hi rend="italic">glaucum.</hi> Dioecious
                    Mosses are frequently sterile on account of the absence of one of the sexes. The
                    female “flowers” (fig. 12) are in the shape of buds, enveloped by a number of
                    leaves, which become smaller towards the inside. The archegonia have in general
                    the same structure as those of Liverworts, but are distinguished by a very much
                    developed stalk, diminishing towards the base in the form of a wedge <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n83/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0083-0072"/> (fig. 12). They originate, as do the antheridia,
                    from a single cell.</p>
                <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">The development of the fertilized oosphere</hi> into the
                    sporogonium differs considerably from that of the Liverworts, both as regards
                    the external processes of growth and as regards the differentiation in the
                    interior of the embryo. In the first of these points the greatest resemblance to
                    the Liverworts is exhibited by <hi rend="italic">Sphagnum.</hi> Here the
                    sporogonium continues almost till maturity to be enclosed by the ventral portion
                    of the archegonium—the calyptra,—which keeps pace with it in growth, and which
                    is irregularly ruptured by it at the period of maturity. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archidiuτn,</hi> one of the <hi rend="italic">Phascaceae,</hi> behaves
                    similarly. In all the other Mosses, however, the sporogonium at an early period
                    bursts through the ventral portion of the archegonium, tearing off the calyptra
                    at its base and raising it up as a cap. The sporogonium possesses a stalk which
                    grows up gradually, but which in <hi rend="italic">Sphagnum,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Andreaea,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Archidium</hi> is very short.
                    In the two first-named genera the shortness of the stalk is made up for by a
                    stalklike elongation of that portion of the stem on which the archegonium is
                    placed. Thus arises a false stalk, a “pseudopodium,” which is to be
                    distinguished from the real stalk, which belongs to the sporogonium. The capsule
                    is often of complex structure. In the <hi rend="italic">Bryineae</hi> it
                    possesses a distinct epidermis, often provided with stomata, which is altogether
                    wanting in the vegetative parts of Mosses. A few layers of cells are united to
                    the epidermis, and together with it form the wall. The interior tissue is never
                    entirely employed in the formation of spores, but a part of it remains as a
                    sterile cell-body—the columella (fig. 13, co) —with the exception of <hi
                    rend="italic">Archidium,</hi> 1 which in this respect approaches the Liverworts.
                    The embryo, the young sporogonium, is originally fusiform (fig. 14, <hi
                    rend="italic">B, C),</hi> and is differentiated into capsule and stalk <hi
                    rend="italic">(seta).</hi> The latter commonly penetrates into the tissue of the
                    fruit-shoot, which forms, outside the base of the sporogonium, an exuberant
                    growth like a fence—the “vaginula”—on which we not unfrequently find archegonia
                    that have miscarried (fig. 13, <hi rend="italic">v).</hi></p>
                <p>In Mosses, as in Liverworts, the spores proceed from the division of one
                    mother-cell into four parts. The phenomena of their germination are very
                    peculiar. In the great majority of the Mosses there arise from the germinating
                    spore cellular filaments resembling Confervae. They have quite the appearance of
                    Algae, and formerly were even confounded with them. They bear the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">protonema,</hi> and often form a thick green covering on the
                    ground in forests. Such a protonema consists of two parts: one above and the
                    other below the ground. Both are rows of cells, but those above the ground
                    contain chlorophyll and have transverse walls placed rectangularly, while those
                    below the ground contain no chlorophyll and their transverse walls are placed
                    obliquely. They serve as roots for the protonema, and of similar structure are
                    the roots (rhizoids) which spring from the surface of the leafy stem, especially
                    from its base. On this protonema, and especially from the basal cells of the
                    threads which are above ground, the moss-stem is formed. This originates from an
                    outward pouching of one of these cells, and this becomes the apical cell of a
                    mossstem. Several mossplants may be formed on one and the same protonema, which
                    has itself proceeded from one spore. The spores of the Bogmoss <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Sphagnum)</hi> form quite another kind of pro-embryo when they germinate on
                    damp earth. They then transform themselves into an intricately ramified
                    expansion or cell-surface; and any cell of this surface may then become the
                    apical cell of the stem.</p>
                <p>When they germinate in water the spores of <hi rend="italic">Sphagnum</hi> form a
                    thread-like <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> pro-embryo. In some other Mosses too,
                    especially Λn- <hi rend="italic">dresea, Tetraphis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diphyscium,</hi> remarkable forms of pro-embryo occur, which, however, can only
                    be alluded to here. In no case does a moss-spore grow directly into a
                    moss-stem.</p>
                <p>Mosses propagate themselves very extensively, not only by means of spores, but in
                    a vegetative way. Every one of the hair-shaped roots (rhizoids) which spring out
                    of the stem has the power, when exposed to the light, of forming protonema, and
                    moss-buds upon this. On this depends the fact that the Mosses which grow on
                    tiled roofs <hi rend="italic">(Grimmia</hi> and others) are hardly to be
                    extirpated. Even if the turf is removed, the roots that have made their way <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n84/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0084-0073"/> into the pores of the tiles still survive, and
                    develop protonema, and new moss-plants upon this. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phascum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ephtmerum,</hi> which are apparently annual
                    Mosses, the protonema is perennial, and forms new plants in the following year.
                    Gemmae also arise in abundance on the protonema (e.&lt;j., of the species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Barbula)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> cellular bodies which are
                    surrounded by a dark-coloured membrane, and whose cells are densely filled with
                    a store of material. They are able to endure drought, and on germinating they
                    either form moss-buds directly or protonema in the first place. Protonema may
                    also proceed directly from the cells of the leaves and stems of moss-plants, and
                    thus subserve their multiplication. Portions even of the sporogonium may
                    transform their cells back into protonema. If we cut off young sporogonia and
                    place them in damp sand, there will arise from their interior cells (or the wall
                    of the capsule) threads of protonema, on which new plants spring up. Many Mosses
                    also possess special gemmae. In <hi rend="italic">Tetraphis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">pellucida</hi> they are stalked cellular bodies, enveloped by a

                    are characterized as well by their anatomical structure as by the development of
                    their sporogonia. The stem, which at first is unbranched, possesses roots only
                    in its earliest stage. The stems then stand in a thickly-set turf, and receive
                    water through the whole of their surface. The ramification is very abundant. Two
                    kinds of branches are formed in the terminal buds—long whip-shaped “flagellae”
                    which hang down, and whose duration is annual; and besides these there is formed
                    every year, after the fruit has reached maturity, a side shoot called an
                    “innovation,” which acts in the same way as the main stem, and at a later period
                    becomes an independent plant. The sexual organs, antheridia and archegonia, are
                    developed on the side branches. The peculiar structure of the leaves has been
                    already mentioned. That of the stem is analogous to it. The latter possesses a
                    rind, formed out of cells with thin walls, whose protoplasmic contents have
                    completely disappeared. Like the empty cells of the leaf, they are penetrated by
                    openings, and thus form a system of narrow capillary tubes which stand in
                    connexion with each other and open outwards, and through which the water mounts
                    upwards.</p>
                <p>The branches that bear the male “flowers” make an approach to those of the
                    Liverworts in the fact that the antheridia do not stand on the summit of the
                    shoot, but singly close to its leaves. On the other hand, the archegonia agree
                    in their position and development with those of the other Mosses. The embryo—the
                    young sporogonium—is at first a pear-shaped body of cellular tissue, the basal
                    portion of which penetrates deeply into the soft tissue of the fruit-branches on
                    which the archegonium is seated. The sporogonium differs considerably from that
                    of the other Mosses. Those cells which give origin to the mother-cells of the
                    spores—termed collectively “archesporium ”—form a dome-shaped layer in the upper
                    portion of the embryo; thus they are not traversed by the sterile cellular
                    tissue, the columella. Each mother-cell is divided as usual into four spores.
                    The short stalk of the capsule extends itself at maturity only so far as to
                    cause the sporogonium to break through the calyptra, the place of a stalk being
                    practically supplied by the “pseudopodium.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The possession of an elastic stalk has this advantage for

                    of the wind.</p></note> The pro-embryo is a cell-surface.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Andreaeaceae</hi> are small blackish Moises growing on
                    rocks. Their antheridia resemble those of the other Mosses. The development of
                    the embryo is anomalous. The archesporium is, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sphagnum,</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> a</hi> dome-shaped layer of cells.
                    On the extremity of the mature capsule is placed the calyptra, which has been
                    torn away, as a delicate cap. The mode of dehiscence of the capsule here reminds
                    us of the Liverworts. This takes place by four longitudinal clefts, which allow
                    the exit of the spores, and are open in dry and closed in damp weather. In this
                    group also the stalk of the sporogonium remains short, its place being supplied
                    by a “pseudopodium.”</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Phascaccae,</hi> which are small and generally annual
                    Mosses, are distinguished from the following division by the fact that the
                    capsule does not open by separation of a lid, but remains closed, and the spores
                    are not set free till the wall of the capsule decays. A remarkably anomalous
                    form is <hi rend="italic">Archidium</hi>; the development of its embryo reminds
                    us of that of the Liverworts; the mature sporogonium also possesses no calyptra,
                    but breaks through the ventral portion of the archegonium like that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sphagnum</hi> and that of the Liverworts. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phascaceae</hi> are termed ‘ ‘ cleistocarpous” in contradistinction to the
                    “stegocarpous” Mosses.</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">Bryineae</hi> comprehend by far the greatest number of
                    all the species of Mosses. They are characterized above all by the structure of
                    their sporogonia. Here the parts of the latter are always the longer or shorter
                    bristle - shaped stalk (seta), the capsule, and the calyptra carried up on its
                    summit. That part of the stalk where it passes into the capsule is termed <hi
                    rend="italic">apophysis</hi>; on its epidermis, as well as on that of the
                    capsule, we almost always find stomata. As regards the structure of the capsule,
                    at a very early period a space filled with air makes its appearance, which
                    divides the interior mass from the wall, which is composed of several layers.
                    This interior complex mass of tissue consists of those cells which give rise to
                    the mother-cells of the spores (the archesporium), of a few layers of cells
                    which smτound these only externally, and of an inner mass of tissue, the
                    columella. The latter, however, passes in this case through the cells of the
                    archesporium; these latter form, as in the <hi rend="italic">Phascaceae,</hi> a
                    stratum of cells which has the form of a barrel, open above and below (fig. 13),
                    and encloses the columella. The <hi rend="italic">Bryineae</hi> are also
                    characterized by the way in which the capsule opens. The upper part of the wall
                    of the capsule is in this case always thrown off as a lid (operculum). This
                    happens in one of two ways: either a layer (or several layers of cells lying
                    upon one another), placed between the inferior portion of the capsule and the
                    operculum, forms a ring (annulus), the cell-walls of which become thickened and
                    partially swollen, so that the annulus becomes loosened and thus causes
                    separation of the operculum and the capsule from each other, or there remains
                    simply a thin-walled annular zone of cells belonging to the wall of the capsule,
                    which splits asunder in dry weather. When the operculum falls away the margin of
                    the open capsule appears in most cases set round with a single or double ring of
                    tooth-like formations, which are termed <hi rend="italic">peristome.</hi> This
                    is wanting in <hi rend="italic">Gymnostomum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hymenostomum.</hi> It occurs in its simplest form in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tetraphis.</hi> Here the epidermis of the upper conical portion falls off as an
                    operculum, while the whole tissue that lies beneath splits crosswise into four
                    valves, which form the peristome. In the other Mosses, with the exception of <hi
                    rend="italic">Polytrichum,</hi> the teeth of the peristome have an essentially
                    different origin. They are in fact nothing but the thickened portions of cell -
                    membranes, whose unthickened portions have perished and been torn asunder. Fig.
                    16 shows a portion of a longitudinal section through the upper part of the
                    capsule of <hi rend="italic">Funaria hygrometrica.</hi></p>
                <p>The capsule possesses a brown epidermis <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> whose walls are
                    greatly thickened; <hi rend="italic">se</hi> is the tissue that lies between the
                    epidermis and the airspaces <hi rend="italic">h,</hi><hi rend="italic">I</hi> of
                    the capsule; sthemother-cells of the spores, and farther inwards follows the
                    columella. Immediately above the air-space rises the stratum of cells which
                    forms the peristome, of one tooth of which a longitudinal section is given in
                    fig. 16. It arises from the great thickening of the outer side of the walls of a
                    row of superposed cells. At maturity the upper portion of the wall of the
                    capsule falls off as an operculum, the cells marked <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    disappear, and only the thickened parts of the cellmembranes remain as the teeth
                    of the peristome. In <hi rend="italic">Funaria</hi> and in other cases the
                    peristome is double, for those cell-walls (fig. 16, <hi rend="italic">i)</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n85/mode/1up"

                    forms the peristome have also in these cases become somewhat thickened, and
                    continue as “cilia,” while the thin portions of membrane placed at right angles
                    to them perish. In other cases <hi rend="italic">(Fontinalis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">anti-pyretica)</hi> the peristome forms a lattice-work. The number
                    of teeth in the peristome is always four, or a multiple of four. They are very
                    hygroscopic; their function is to close up the opening of the capsule in wet
                    weather, and so to hinder the exit of the spores, which are scattered abroad by
                    the wind. In the same way also any germination of the spores in the interior of
                    the capsule is prevented. The columella shrivels up after the formation of the
                    spores, so that at that time we find nothing in the capsule but the spore-dust.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Polytrichaceae</hi> have special arrangements for the
                    protection of the spores. Here the opening of the capsule is covered over by a
                    kind of plate ( “epiphragma ”), which is supported by thirty-two or sixty-four
                    teeth, consisting of fibre-like cells.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Retrospective View. —</hi> Comparing generally the Mosses with
                    the Liverworts, we see that, however great the variety of the forms they
                    comprehend, they still form two connected series. In several of the subdivisions
                    of the Leaf-mosses conditions occur which remind us of the Liverworts. Such are,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Sphagnum,</hi> the form and position of the antheridia, the
                    tearing open of the ventral portion of the archegonium, and the want of a
                    “calyptra” on the sporogonium which proceeds from it. This last is also found in
                    <hi rend="italic">Andresea,</hi> in which the method of opening of the
                    sporogonium likewise reminds us of the Liverworts. Among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phascacese,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Archidium</hi> agrees with Liverworts in
                    the absence of a columella. Some few cells in the interior of the sporogonium
                    are formed into mothercells of spores, and push aside the rest of the tissue.
                    Here, too, the calyptra is absent.</p>
                <p>The simplest Liverworts make a near approach to the Algae. The sporogonium of <hi
                    rend="italic">Riccia</hi> is of scarcely higher organization than the mass of
                    tissue which proceeds from the fertilized ovum-cell of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coleochaete,</hi> a green freshwater Alga. Among plants of a higher order we
                    find no group closely allied to the Muscineae. It is true that the Ferns have a
                    perfectly analogous alternation of generations, but it is not a sporogonium
                    which is produced from the fertilized oosphere, but the leafy fern-plant. No
                    transitional forms occur between these two sections; the chasm which divides
                    them is the widest with which we are acquainted in the whole vegetable kingdom.
