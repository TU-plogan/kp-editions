                <p><label type="entry">MURRAIN</label>, a term usually restricted to extensive
                    outbreaks of disease in cattle, but also applied to serious disorders among
                    sheep and pigs, is taken in this article to cover general or infectious
                    disorders of all the domesticated animals, and as synonymous with plague or
                    epizooty.</p>
                <p>It is now an established fact that murrains are all infectious, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> capable of transmission from diseased to healthy creatures of the
                    same, or perhaps of many different species, the manner and degree of
                    infectiousness varying somewhat in some of the disorders. It is also an
                    established fact that several of them—and presumably all—owe their existence and
                    spread to a micro-organism or germ, vegetable or animal in its nature, which,
                    obtaining access to a healthy body disposed to its reception, grows and
                    multiplies rapidly there, and produces characteristic morbid symptoms and
                    alterations in tissues and organs. On the presence and dissemination of this
                    germ or virulent agent these diseases depend for their continuance and
                    extension; and this knowledge furnishes us with the indications for the sanitary
                    measures required to limit their spread, or to effect their extermination.</p>
                <p>In previous ages the great outbreaks of murrains only occurred at comparatively
                    rare intervals, in regions more or less remote from those to which they were
                    native; and then they generally owed their diffusion to the events of war, which
                    sometimes carried them far beyond their ordinary boundaries. In modern times
                    their extension has been greatly facilitated by the vastly improved means of
                    communication. The movement of large numbers of animals through the channels of
                    commerce and their rapid transport from <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n69/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0069-0058"/> one country to another, their concentration in
                    markets, their incessant renewal, the mixing of native with foreign animals, a
                    general indifference to the existence of contagious diseases and the losses they
                    might inflict, the absence of anything like an organization to control and
                    regulate this movement, carry out sanitary regulations, and investigate and
                    suppress these murrains—all these have operated in rendering some of the most
                    harassing and destructive scourges more or less cosmopolitan, spreading them
                    from a very limited area in the middle of a continent to every quarter of the
                    globe, where they flourish as vigorously and persistently as if indigenous to
                    the soil.</p>
                <p>The best-known murrains are discussed below.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Anthrax.,—</hi> This is one of the most diffused and
                    interesting of murrains, affecting, as it does, wild as well as domesticated
                    animals. It prevails, in one or more of its forms, over the entire surface of
                    the globe. It at times decimates the reindeer herds in Lapland and the Polar
                    regions, and is only too well known in the tropics and in temperate latitudes.
                    It has been observed and described in Russia, Siberia, Central Asia, China,
                    Cochin China, Egypt, West Indies, Peru, Paraguay, Brazil, Mexico, and other
                    parts of North and South America, in Australia, and on different parts of the
                    African continent, while for other European countries the writings which have
                    been published with regard to its nature, its peculiar characteristics, and the
                    injury it inflicts are innumerable. Countries in which are extensive marshes, or
                    the subsoil of which is tenacious or impermeable, are usually those most
                    frequently and seriously visited. Thus there are regions notorious for the
                    prevalence of this murrain, such as the marshes of Sologne, Dombes, and Bresse
                    in France; certain parts of Germany, Hungary, and Poland; in Spain it is
                    severely felt in the half-submerged valleys and the maritime coasts of
                    Catalonia, as well as in the Romagna and other marshy districts of Italy; while
                    it is epizootic, and even panzootic, in the swampy regions of Esthonia, Livonia,
                    Courland, and especially of Siberia, where it is known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sibir-skajajaswa</hi> (Siberian boil-plague), and where it sometimes happens
                    that, in order to suppress its ravages, battalions of soldiers must be sent to
                    bury or burn the carcases of infected animals which float in the canals or lie
                    in the swamps, rendering the air and the water pestilent. The records of the
                    anthrax go back to a very ancient date. It is supposed to be the murrain of
                    Exodus. Classical writers allude to the anthrax as if it were the only cattle
                    disease worthy of mention (see Virgil, <hi rend="italic">Gwrg.,</hi> iii.). It
                    figures largely in the histories of the Early and Middle Ages as a devastating
                    pestilence among animals, and through them to mankind; and our oldest
                    Anglo-Saxon manuscripts contain many fantastic recipes, leechdoms, charms, and
                    incantations for the prevention or cure of the “blacan blezene” (black blain)
                    and the relief of the “elfshot” creatures. From these up to our own times it has
                    attracted more and more attention, as even in the last and this century it has
                    sometimes spread in an epizootic manner over the whole of Europe, from Siberia
                    to France. It was in this malady that the presence of disease-producing germs
                    <hi rend="italic">(bacilli)</hi> was first discovered by Rollender and
                    veterinary surgeon Brauell of Dorpat, and their real character afterwards
                    verified by Davaine; and it has been in their experiments with this disease that
                    Chauveau, Toussaint, and Pasteur have shown how to make the morbific poison its
                    own antidote.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Symptoms.—</hi> These vary according as the disease runs its
                    course as a general or localized affection. While death is usually rapid or
                    sudden when the malady is general, constituting what is designated splenic
                    apoplexy or anthrax fever, in the local form, marked by the formation of
                    carbuncles before general infection occurs, it is more protracted. In the
                    apoplectic form there is apparently no local manifestation, and dissolution may
                    take place so quickly (in a few minutes) that there is no time to afford relief.
                    One or more of the best-conditioned and perhaps robust animals in a herd or
                    flock, which until then exhibited no sign of the disease, are suddenly struck
                    down as if shot while grazing, feeding in the stable, or travelling, and rise no
                    more. Or they commence all at once to tremble and stagger; the breathing becomes
                    hurried and the pulse very rapid, while the heart beats violently; the internal
                    temperature of the body is high; blood flows from the nose, mouth, and anus; the
                    visible mucous membranes are almost black in tint; and death soon supervenes,
                    being immediately preceded by delirium, convulsions, or coma. In some cases the
                    animal rallies from a first attack, but soon a second ensues, to which it
                    speedily succumbs, the creature in the interval remaining drowsy and showing
                    muscular tremors. In the carbuncular form the tumours may appear in any part of
                    the body, being preceded or accompanied by fever. When the tongue is affected,
                    the disease is usually known as blain of the tongue, tongue evil, or
                    glossanthrax.</p>
                <p>The tumours or malignant pustules are developed in the subcutaneous connective
                    tissue, where this is loose and plentiful, in the interstices of the muscles,
                    and in the lymphatic glands. In the various animals affected they have their
                    special affinities for certain regions, as between the branches of the lower
                    jaw, upper part of the throat, lower portion of the neck, breast, behind the
                    shoulders, back, flank, substance of the tongue, &amp;c. If the part where an
                    anthrax tumour is about to appear is covered with hair, this will be observed to
                    become erect, and if the hand is passed over the part perhaps a slight
                    crepitation will be felt; there is also increased sensibility. In many cases
                    there soon appears a nodosity, simple or multiple, about the size of a small nut
                    and circular or irregular in outline. Ordinarily this is little sensitive in
                    itself, the pain the animal experiences being due to the increased sensibility
                    of the surrounding parts. In other instances the tumour suddenly commences in
                    the appearance of a soft cedematous swelling, crepitating and undefined. When
                    the eruption takes this form the tumours are quickly developed, and in a few
                    hours invade all the neighbouring parts, extending in every direction with equal
                    rapidity,—the skin covering them becoming tense and hard like parchment, and
                    crackling on pressure. As they extend they become cold and insensible, a
                    variable number of phlyctaenae arise on their surface, and these quickly
                    bursting give issue to a serous irritant fluid. If an incision is made in the
                    swelling at this stage there is no symptom of pain, and a black or reddish serum
                    escapes, extremely foetid and corrosive, which produces a noise as it flows like
                    the crackling of paper or the bubbling of boiling water. Sometimes passive
                    haemorrhage ensues after the incision is made, and continues until death.</p>
                <p>In whatever form the tumours are developed, their course is always the same,
                    being more rapid the earlier they appear. In from two to eight hours they attain
                    a considerable size, and tlfβ tissues mortify as they are invaded. As they are
                    developed the animal seems to become relieved, the fever abates, and the more
                    urgent symptoms vanish. But, when they have attained certain proportions,
                    general symptoms are manifested, and these vary according as the malady is to
                    terminate favourably or otherwise. In some rare instances the matter which
                    constitutes the tumours is suddenly absorbed, abundant sweats, an increased flow
                    of urine, or a serous foetid diarrhoea ensue, and the animal promptly recovers.
                    In other cases, by surgical intervention, the evolution of the tumours is
                    limited to a certain extent; they reach the suppurative stage, and finally
                    disappear. In ordinary circumstances, however, it happens that after the
                    interval which follows the eruption, the organism being incapable of eliminating
                    the morbid element, the tumours vanish; but this is only a transference, for the
                    disease assumes all the grave characters of anthrax fever without local
                    manifestations, the general symptoms reappear, and, running their course with
                    marvellous rapidity, the animal perishes in a few hours.</p>
                <p>A form of anthrax affects the horse more especially, and this by some authors has
                    been designated anthrax typhus. It manifests itself locally and generally, and
                    is very fatal (Fleming, <hi rend="italic">Veterinary Sanitary Science and
                    Police,</hi> vol. ii. p. 122).</p>
                <p>In cattle there is a disease very fatal among young stock, and known to breeders
                    and graziers by various names, the most common of which is “black quarter,”
                    which had always been classed among the forms of anthrax until its nature was
                    investigated by Arloing and Cornuvin, who have termed it symptomatic anthrax <hi
                    rend="italic">(Charbon symptomatique),</hi> while by others it has been named
                    anthra-coid erysipelas, &amp;c. This is at first a local disease, affecting
                    usually one hind quarter, and occurring among young animals more especially,
                    particularly those fed on rich food and thriving rapidly. It also occurs very
                    suddenly, runs its course in a very brief space, and nearly always terminates
                    fatally unless surgical and medical treatment is promptly resorted to. It is
                    caused also by a bacillus or bacterium somewhat different from that of ordinary
                    anthrax.</p>
                <p>In splenic fever or splenic apoplexy, the most marked alterations observed after
                    death are — the effects of rapid decomposition, evidenced by the foul odour,
                    disengagement of gas beneath the skin and in the tissues and cavities of the
                    body, yellow or yellowish-red gelatinous exudation into and between the muscles,
                    effusion <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n70/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0070-0059"/> of citron-or rust-coloured fluid in various
                    cavities, extravasations of blood and local congestions throughout the body, the
                    blood in the vessels generally being very dark and tar-like. The most notable
                    feature, however, in the majority of cases is the enormous enlargement of the
                    spleen, which is engorged with blood to such an extent that it often ruptures,
                    while its tissue is changed into a violet or black fluid mass.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inoculation. —</hi> Anthrax in all its forms is an inoculable
                    disease, transmission being surely and promptly effected by this means, and it
                    may be conveyed to nearly all animals either by inoculation or through the
                    digestive organs. The abraded skin is often the channel for the introduction of
                    the bacilli; and persons who handle diseased animals or their products—as flesh,
                    skin, wool, or hair—often die from anthrax, which presents similar symptoms in
                    mankind to those it exhibits in animals. The bacillus of anthrax, under certain
                    conditions, retains its vitality for a long time, and rapidly grows when it
                    finds a suitable fluid in which to develop, its mode of multiplication being by
                    scission and the formation of spores, and depending, to a great extent at least,
                    on the presence of oxygen. The morbid action of the bacillus is indeed said to
                    be due to its affinity for oxygen; by depriving the red corpuscles of the blood
                    of that most essential gas, it renders the vital fluid unfit to sustain life.
                    Others assert that the fatal lesions are produced by the enormous number of
                    bacilli blocking up the minute blood-vessels, especially of the lungs, and thus
                    inducing asphyxia.</p>
                <p>It was by the cultivation of this micro-organism, or attenuation of the virus,
                    that Pasteur has been enabled to produce a prophylactic remedy for anthrax,
                    which has already been demonstrated to be very effective; and his discovery is
                    likely to lead to most important results in procuring protective agents for
                    other similar and fatal disorders in man and beast. Though his discovery was
                    first made with regard to the cholera of fowls, a most destructive disorder
                    which annually cames off great numbers of poultry, yet as applied to anthrax it
                    has attracted most attention. This so-called attenuation or cultivation of the
                    virus of the disease by Pasteur is effected by growing the bacillus in an
                    albuminous fluid, the preference being given to chicken-broth which has been
                    previously sterilized by being raised to a temperature of 115° C. This broth is
                    inoculated with a drop of anthrax blood which has been taken with antiseptic
                    precautions from an animal about to die of the disease; it is kept in pure air
                    at a temperature of 42° to 43° C.; at 45° the process of cultivation will not go
                    on. After a certain time another quantity of broth is inoculated with a drop of
                    the first, and kept under the same conditions; and so this cultivation is
                    carried on until a sufficient number of generations of the bacilli have been
                    grown and the required degree of attenuation ensured. This is attained by
                    attention to the temperature, allowing a certain interval to elapse between each
                    inoculation of the broth and the number of generations cultivated. The resulting
                    “vaccine,” as it has been improperly designated, when inoculated into the body
                    of an animal liable to anthrax, confers immunity from the disease, if certain
                    rules are attended to.</p>
                <p>Toussaint had, previous to Pasteur, attenuated the virus of anthrax by the action
                    of heat; and Chauveau has more recently corroborated by numerous experiments the
                    value of Toussaint’s method, demonstrating that, according to the degree of heat
                    to which the virus is subjected, so its innocuousness when transferred to a
                    healthy creature. The attenuation of heat, according to this method, is a safer
                    and readier way to obtain a protective virus than Pasteur’s broth
                    cultivations.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Cattle-Plague or Rinderpest.—</hi> The next disease is that
                    which has, since the commencement of the last century, been generally described
                    as “the murrain,” but which is now better known as the “cattle-plague” or
                    “rinderpest” (German). While anthrax is, with regard to species of animals
                    attacked, the most universal of all diseases, being transmissible to nearly
                    every living creature, including mankind, cattle-plague is limited to ruminants
                    (oxen, sheep, goats, camels, buffaloes, yaks, deer, &amp;c.). It is an Asiatic
                    malady, and prevails frequently and with great severity in southern Russia
                    (imported), Central Asia, Mongolia, China (south, west, and north), Cochin
                    China, Burmah, Hindustan, Persia, Ceylon, and the islands in the Indian and
                    Malay Archipelagos. It is only known in Europe as an exotic and imported malady,
                    it has not yet appeared on the American continent, in Australia, in New Zealand,
                    or on the African continent, except in Egypt, into which it has been carried on
                    several occasions, and where, owing to the absence of sanitary measures, it now
                    prevails constantly. It is one of the most infectious and fatal diseases of
                    animals—a specific fever which runs its course so rapidly, and attacks such a
                    large percentage of ruminants when it is introduced into a country, that from
                    the earliest times it has excited terror and dismay.</p>
                <p>It has been noted that its irruptions into Europe in the earlier centuries of our
                    era always coincided with invasions of barbarous tribes in the east of Europe;
                    and even at a later period the disease accompanied the events of war, when
                    troops with their commissariat moved from the east towards the west, or cattle,
                    when they were carried in the same direction. One of the earliest recorded
                    irruptions of cattle-plague into western Europe occurred in the 5th century
                    after the sanguinary invasion of the Huns under Attila, the expulsion of the
                    Goths from Hungary, and the fierce internecine wars of the whole Germanic
                    population. The disease appears then to have been carried from Hungary through
                    Austria to Dalmatia, while by Brabant it obtained access to the Low Countries,
                    Picardy, and so on to the other provinces of France. In the curious poem <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Mortibus</hi><hi rend="italic">Bovum</hi>
                    written by St Severus, who lived at that period, the course and destructiveness
                    of the disease are specially alluded to. Many invasions of Europe are described,
                    and in several of these Britain was visited by it —as in 809-810, 986-987,
                    1223-1225, 1513-1514, and notably in 1713, 1745, 1774, 1799. In 1865 and 1872 it
                    was imported direct from Russia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Symptoms.—</hi> Like some other general diseases, this does not
                    offer any exclusive or pathognomonic symptoms, but is rather characterized by a
                    group of functional and anatomical alterations. An exact knowledge of its
                    symptoms and necroscopical appearances is of the utmost importance, as its
                    extension and consequent ravages can only be arrested through its timely
                    recognition and the immediate adoption of the necessary sanitary measures.
                    Intense fever, diarrhoea or dysentery, croupous inflammation of the mucous
                    membranes in general, sometimes a cutaneous papular eruption, and great
                    prostration mark the course of the affection, which is frequently most difficult
                    to diagnose during life, especially if its presence is not suspected. Its
                    introduction and mode of propagation can, in many instances, be ascertained only
                    at a late period, and when great loss may already have been sustained. In the
                    majority of cases the examination of the carcase of an animal which has died or
                    been purposely killed is the best way to arrive at a correct diagnosis. Indeed,
                    this is practically the only certain means of concluding as to the presence of
                    the malady, as in different invasions, and even in different countries and
                    different individuals during the same invasion, there are observed considerable
                    variations in the chief symptoms with regard to their intensity as well as in
                    the secondary symptoms or epiphenomena.</p>
                <p>Among cattle indigenous to the regions in which this malady may be said to be
                    enzootic the symptoms are often comparatively slight, and the mortality not
                    great. So much is this the case that veterinary surgeons who can readily
                    distinguish the disease when it affects the cattle of western Europe, can only
                    with difficulty diagnose it in animals from Hungary, Bessarabia, Moldavia, or
                    other countries where it is always more or less prevalent. In these the
                    indications of fever are usually of brief duration, and signs of lassitude and
                    debility are, in some instances, the only marks of the presence of this virulent
                    disorder in animals which may, nevertheless, communicate the disease in its most
                    deadly form to the cattle of other countries. Slight diarrhoea may also be
                    present, and a cutaneous eruption accompanied by gastric disturbance, shedding
                    of tears, and infrequent cough. In the more malignant form the fever runs very
                    high, sometimes to 107’6° Fahr., and all the characteristic symptoms of the
                    disorder are well marked, the lesions during life being observed-in the
                    cheese-like deposits on the gums, the presence of petechiae on the mucous
                    membranes, discharges from the eyes, nose, and mouth, eruption on the skin,
                    cough and laboured breathing, certain nervous phenomena, and dysenteric
                    dejections. Death generally occurs in four or five days, the course of the
                    disorder being more rapid with animals kept in stables than with those living in
                    the open air, and in summer than in winter. After death the chief alterations
                    are found in the digestive canal, and consist in evidence of inflammation of a
                    more or less acute kind, with ulceration, extravasation of blood, gangrene,
                    &amp;c. The membrane lining the air-passages offers similar alterations; indeed,
                    all the mucous membranes of the body appear to be involved, and the malady might
                    almost be considered as a malignant infectious catarrhal fever.</p>
                <p>Protective inoculation has often been advocated and practised (particularly in
                    Russia) for this disorder, but the advantages derived have not been sufficient
                    to compensate for the danger attending<pb break="no"

                    veterinary school has made experiments with cultivated or attenuated virus, and
                    so far the results have been encouraging.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Pleuro-Pneumonia or Lung-Plague.—</hi> The next murrain in
                    importance, with regard to destructiveness, is the so-called “lung-plague” or
                    contagious “pleuro-pneumonia” of cattle.</p>
                <p>This disease is particularly interesting from the fact that within less than two
                    centuries it has been spread from a very small area over nearly every part of
                    the world. The earliest notices of it testify that it first prevailed in central
                    Europe, and in the last century it was present in certain parts of southern
                    Germany, Switzerland, and France, and had also appeared in upper Italy. Though
                    Valentine described an epizooty occurring among cattle in 1693 in Hesse, yet
                    doubts have been entertained as to whether it was this malady. It was not until
                    1769 that it was definitely described as prevailing in Franche-Comté by the name
                    of “murie.” From that date down to 1789 it appears to have remained more or less
                    limited to the Swiss mountains, the Jura, Dauphiné, the Vosges, Piedmont, and
                    upper Silesia; it showed itself in Champagne and Bourbonnais about the time of
                    the Revolution, when its spread was greatly accelerated by the wars that
                    followed, and the consequent demand for cattle for the commissariat parks of the
                    contending armies. Since that time the continually increasing commercial
                    relations between various countries have carried it to the ends of the earth,
                    the long duration of latency, and the somewhat slow course of the disorder,
                    eminently adapting it for conveyance to great distances. In this century its
                    diffusion has been accurately determined. It invaded Prussia in 1802, and soon
                    spread over North Germany. It was first described as existing in Russia in 1824;
                    it reached Belgium in 1827, Holland in 1833, the United Kingdom in 1841, Sweden
                    in 1847, Denmark in 1848, Finland in 1850, South Africa in 1854, the United
                    States —Brooklyn in 1843, New Jersey in 1847, Brooklyn again in 1850, and Boston
                    in 1850; it was also carried to Melbourne in 1858, and to New South Wales in
                    1860; New Zealand received it early in 1864. It has also been carried to Asia
                    Minor, and has made its presence felt at Damascus. In Austria it is less
                    prevalent than in some other European countries, being scarcely known except in
                    Bohemia, Moravia, and a portion of Tyrol. In Hungary it appears to be almost
                    unknown, in consequence of the minimum importation of foreign cattle; and in
                    countries to which it has not been introduced by infected animals it is not
                    seen. In consequence of its insidious invasion, the subtlety of its contagion,
                    and the great fatality attending it, there can be no doubt that it is one of the
                    most disastrous plagues that can afflict a cattle-producing country.
                    Fortunately, unlike the two preceding murrains, it is confined entirely to the
                    bovine species; no well-authenticated instances of its transmission, either
                    accidental or experimental, to other species have been recorded.</p>
                <p>In its nature it is a specific infectious disease, generally affecting the lungs
                    and the lining membrane of the chest, producing a particular form of lobar or
                    lobular pleuropneumonia, and in the majority of cases, if not in all, it is
                    transmitted through the medium of the inspired air,— hence its localization in
                    the lungs. Inoculation with the fluid from the diseased lungs does not produce
                    any effect on other than the bovine species; but in this its action is most
                    energetic. Producing, after a certain interval, characteristic lesions at the
                    seat of inoculation, the morbid change or infective process soon involves parts
                    beyond, and if not checked may cause most serious damage and even the death of
                    the inoculated animal; though it does not develop the lung lesions always
                    observed in accidental infection, yet there is a local anatomical similarity or
                    identity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Symptoms.—</hi> The malady is slow and insidious in its course,
                    lasting from two to three weeks to as many months, the chief symptoms being
                    fever, diminished appetite, a short cough of a peculiar and pathognomonic
                    character, with quickened breathing and pulse, and physical indications of lung
                    and chest disease. The progress of the malady is marked by exacerbation of the
                    symptoms, and towards the end there is great debility and emaciation, death
                    generally ensuing after hectic fever has set in. Recovery is somewhat rare.</p>
                <p>The pathological changes are generally limited to the chest and its contents, and
                    consist in a peculiar marbled-like appearance of the lungs on section, and
                    fibrinous deposits on the pleural membrane, with oftentimes great effusion into
                    the cavity of the thorax.</p>
                <p>Willems of Hasselt (Belgium) in 1852 introduced and practised inoculation as a
                    protective measure for this scourge, employing for this purpose the serum
                    obtained from a diseased lung; and his success was so marked that he made known
                    his procedure. Since that time inoculation has been extensively resorted to, not
                    only in Europe, but also in Australia and South Africa; and its protective value
                    has been generally recognized. When properly performed, and when certain
                    precautions are adopted, it would appear to confer immunity from the disease.
                    The usual seat of inoculation is the extremity of the tail, the virus being
                    introduced beneath the skin by means of a syringe or a worsted thread
                    impregnated with the serum. One or two drops are sufficient to cause the local
                    and constitutional disturbance which mark successful prophylactic infection. A
                    particular micro-organism has been discovered in the diseased textures and
                    fluids of animals affected with contagious pleuro-pneumonia, which is supposed
                    to cause the malady. It has been cultivated, and inoculation experiments have
                    been made with it. The intravenous injection of the virus has been found to be a
                    safer method of conferring immunity than inoculation beneath the skin, and quite
                    as certain a method.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Foot-and-Mouth. Disease</hi> (Epizootic Aphtha, Eczema
                    epizootica), if we were to judge by the somewhat vague descriptions of different
                    disorders by Greek and Roman writers, has been a European malady for more than
                    2000 years. But no reliance can be placed on this evidence, and it is not until
                    we reach the 17 th and 18th centuries that we can find trustworthy proof of its
                    presence, when it was reported as frequently prevailing extensively in Germany,
                    Italy, and France. During this century, owing to the vastly-extended commercial
                    relations between every civilized country, it has, like the lung-plague, become
                    widely diffused. In the Old World its effects are now experienced from the
                    Caspian Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. It gradually extended towards Britain at the
                    commencement of this century, after invading Holland and Belgium, and about 1839
                    appeared in England, where it was immediately recognized as a new disease; it
                    quickly spread over the three kingdoms. From the observations of the best
                    authorities it would appear to be an altogether exotic malady in the west of
                    Europe, always invading it from the east; at least, this has been the course
                    noted in all the principal invasions. It was introduced into Denmark in 1841,
                    and into the United States of America from Canada, where it had been carried by
                    diseased cattle from England. It rapidly extended through cattle traffic from
                    the State first invaded to adjoining States, but was extinguished, and does not
                    now appear to be known on the American continent. It was twice introduced into
                    Australia in 1872, but was stamped out on each occasion. It appears to be well
                    known in India, Ceylon, Burmah, and the Straits Settlements. In 1870 it was
                    introduced into the Andaman Islands, where it had not previously been seen, by
                    cattle imported from Calcutta, where it was then prevailing. There is evidence
                    that it is common in South Africa, and is frequently epizootic there, causing
                    great inconvenience, owing to the bullocks used for draught purposes, which
                    travel great distances, becoming unfit for work, by which traffic is much
                    interfered with. These cattle also spread the contagion. It is not improbable
                    that it also prevails in Central Africa, as Schweinfurth alludes to the cattle
                    of the Dinkas suffering from a disease of the kind. Though not a fatal malady,
                    and in the majority of cases readily amenable to treatment, yet it is a most
                    serious scourge. It is transmissible to nearly all the <pb break="no"

                    infected, but its ravages are most severe among cattle, sheep, and pigs. Since
                    it was introduced into the United Kingdom it has proved more disastrous on the
                    whole, perhaps, than any other murrain, and has most injuriously affected
                    agricultural interests. What makes it more serious is the fact that one attack
                    is not protective against another, an animal sometimes being affected a second
                    time within a few months.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Symptoms.—</hi> This is an eruptive fever, characterized by
                    vesicles or blisters in the mouth, sometimes in the nostrils, and on parts of
                    the body where the skin is thin and least covered with hair, as on the udder and
                    towards the feet. The animal cannot eat so well as usual, suffers much pain and
                    inconvenience, loses condition, and, if a milk-yielding creature, gives less
                    milk, or, if pregnant, may abort. Sometimes the feet become very much diseased,
                    and the animal is so crippled that it has to be destroyed. It is often fatal to
                    young creatures. It is transmitted more especially by the saliva and the
                    discharges from the vesicles on the feet and udder, though all the secretions
                    and excretions are doubtless infective, as well as all articles soiled by them.
                    The disease can be produced by injecting the saliva intravenously.</p>
                <p>These are the best-known murrains affecting cattle; but there are others which,
                    though they cannot be noticed here, are of some moment. One in particular
                    demands most serious consideration, the disease known as “consumption,”
                    “pining,” and (from the appearance of the morbid growths in the chest) “grapes,”
                    and to the medical and veterinary pathologist as “tuberculosis.” It is a
                    highly-infectious disorder in cattle, is becoming very common among the improved
                    breeds, and causes heavy losses in dairy stock. It has been experimentally
                    demonstrated that the tuberculous matter, as well as milk and the juice of the
                    flesh of diseased cows, when given to healthy animals or inoculated in them,
                    will produce the malady, and this leads to the grave question as to the danger
                    incurred by mankind through the consumption of the flesh and milk of tuberculous
                    cows. This is a pressing sanitary problem which demands early solution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prevention of Murrains.—</hi> The legislative measures
                    necessary for prevention or suppression of murrains are based upon the fact that
                    these diseases depend for their extension solely upon their contagious
                    properties. The object is, therefore, either to prevent the admission of the
                    contagious principle, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> through diseased animals or
                    articles which have become infective by contact with them, or to destroy it as
                    quickly as possible. The necessity for this is abundantly evident on every page
                    in the history of these scourges. It is almost impossible to realize the loss
                    and embarrassment caused by cattle-plague, lung-plague, and foot-and-mouth
                    disease only. By the first-named murrain it has been estimated that the loss in
                    Europe from 1711 to 1796 only was 200,000,000 head of cattle. And in this
                    century the disease has not been less severe, though its opportunities for
                    extension, much greater than before, have been much diminished by the progress
                    made in veterinary science. From 1841 to 1844 Egypt lost 400,000 head of cattle;
                    and 1,000,000 perished in Russia in 1844-1845. From 1849 to 1863 the Austrian
                    states lost 258,107. In Hungary from 1861 to 1867 this steppe murrain appeared
                    in 680 communes having a bovine population of 908,209; 25 per cent, λvere
                    attacked, and of these 145,474 or 63 '9 per cent, were lost. In 1860-1861
                    Austria lost 4800 cattle; and in Russia 183,678 died in 1860. In 1865-1866 Great
                    Britain is supposed to have lost 233,629 head, valued at from five to eight
                    millions of pounds, though this is probably far below the actual figure; and
                    Holland, receiving the infection from England, at this time lost 115,000 cattle.
                    In 1870 Germany reported 8122 as dead from rinderpest; and during the
                    Franco-German war, when the disease was introduced into France by the German
                    troops, the Bas-Rhin department alone lost 6104 cattle and sheep at the period
                    of the invasion, and 582 cattle and 944 sheep when the troops returned, the
                    amount of indemnity paid for cattle destroyed being 1,622,249 francs, while in
                    Lorraine 5000 cattle and more than 3000 sheep, and in the Haut-Rhin 14,000
                    cattle perished, the compensation to cover this loss being estimated at
                    1,500,000 francs. In August 1873 thirteen governments in Russia were invaded by
                    rinderpest, and it was computed that 18,000 animals were attacked, 14,000 of
                    which died or were destroyed.</p>
                <p>These figures give but a faint idea of the appalling destruction wrought by
                    rinderpest; and lung-plague, though its ravages are not so striking or
                    immediate, has been scarcely less formidable. For instance, in Holland in 230
                    parishes the average yearly loss has been reckoned at 49,661. In 705 parishes in
                    Wiirtemberg 1706 stables contained 10,214 cattle; of these 4200 were attacked,
                    and 2583 were killed or died. In France, according to published statistics, the
                    loss caused by this murrain in 217 communes of the department of the Nord during
                    seven consecutive years was 11,200 in a bovine population of 280,000 — or a
                    total in nineteen years of 218,000 head, the estimated value of which was
                    fifty-two millions of francs. In the departments of Aveyron, Cantal, and Lozère
                    the average loss for a long time was not less than 35 per cent, of the entire
                    cattle. In Australia the losses caused by it during thirteen years were supposed
                    to be at least 30 to 40 per cent, of the whole number of cattle, or about
                    1,404,097 head, which, if valued at only £6 each, would amount to about
                    £8,500,000. Only a very imperfect notion can be formed of the destruction it has
                    caused in Great Britain and Ireland since its introduction; but for the six
                    years ending with 1860 it has been calculated that there perished considerably
                    more than a million of cattle in the United Kingdom, the value of which must
                    have amounted to more than twelve millions of pounds. From 1863 to 1866 the
                    death-rate from the scourge was from 50 to 60 per cent, annually.</p>
                <p>The deaths from foot-and-mouth disease vary in number at different outbreaks, and
                    are much less than in the invasions of steppe murrain and lung-plague. The most
                    serious feature of this murrain is its affecting .a large percentage (frequently
                    nine-tenths) of the ruminants and pigs on a farm or in a district. In 1839, in a
                    district in Wiirtemberg comprising about 8 square miles and containing 11,000
                    head of cattle, only 1300 or 12 per cent, escaped; in the arrondissement of
                    Mülhausen, Alsace, containing 32,000 animals, in 1862-3-4 only about 4000, or
                    one in eight, were not attacked; in the department of the Nord in 1839 of
                    277,000 cattle 120,000 were affected, more than one-half of the sheep, and
                    one-fifth of the pigs. In Baden in 1864 of 607,825 cattle 139,995 were infected.
                    It is scarcely possible to arrive at anything like a correct estimate of the
                    number of cattle affected during any particular outbreak in Britain. Perhaps it
                    would not be an exaggeration to assert that 150,000 or 200,000 suffered from the
                    disease in 1872, and from 1839 up to 1874 it was estimated that the money loss
                    it caused the country was £13,000,000, but this is probably far below the mark.
                    It has been calculated that the loss experienced from an outbreak in Baden in
                    1869 was no less than £103,000, and for the southern states of Germany £833,000.
                    France is supposed to have lost from this disease, among cattle only, in twenty
                    years £4,000,000.</p>
                <p>When it is considered how rapidly animals lose condition, especially fat stock;
                    what losses occur when it appears among milch cows and those in calf, or amongst
                    oxen used for draught, and among sheep, pigs, and poultry; what embarrassment it
                    may occasion to agriculture and the cattle and milk trade, not to speak of the
                    expense of curative measures,—it will be seen what a serious murrain this is,
                    even under the most favourable circumstances. It is still more so when it
                    assumes a severe character, which it often does, and is likely to be accompanied
                    by complications. The great rapidity with which it spreads greatly increases
                    these losses. In a very few months it has been observed to enter the eastern
                    frontiers and spread over a large portion of the continent of Europe, infecting
                    Germany, Switzerland, France, Holland, and Belgium, andreachiug England, always
                    following the course of cattle traffic.</p>
                <p>These examples and estimates afford after all only a very faint notion of the
                    devastation, misery, embarrassment, and loss that murrains occasion, and it is
                    this which has compelled enlightened Governments to adopt severe measures for
                    their extinction, or at least limitation. These measures are successful in
                    proportion as they are well devised and energetically carried out, for all the
                    murrains or contagious diseases are perfectly amenable to control, and may even
                    be totally suppressed by international agreement and combined action. There is
                    reason to hope that this most desirable result will be ultimately attained, but
                    at present it is a long way off—some infected countries, in consequence of
                    imperfect measures or the absence of any veterinary sanitary police, proving a
                    standing menace to others which are either free from infection, or are
                    energetically endeavouring tρ get rid of it. The measures now in force may be
                    briefly said to be interdiction of the importation of cattle from countries in
                    which cattle-plague, foot-and-mouth disease, or contagious pleuro-pneumonia is
                    prevalent, or compulsory slaughter at the ports of debarkation. In some of the
                    infected countries, as in the United Kingdom, where foot-and-mouth disease and
                    contagious pleuro-pneumonia are always more or less prevalent, infected
                    cowsheds, farms, or districts are rigorously isolated, so far as the movement of
                    animals from them is concerned, none being allowed to leave until the disease
                    has been suppressed, and cattle-markets or fairs may be closed for a certain
                    period. In contagious pleuro-pneumonia, diseased animals and those which have
                    been in contact with them are slaughtered, and compensation allowed the owner
                    for the latter by the local authorities, while measures of cleansing and
                    disinfection are enforced. The movement of cattle in, into, and from the
                    infected area is closely watched to extinguish the contagion as speedily as
                    possible <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n73/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0073-0062"/> by prohibiting communication between sick and
                    healthy animals susceptible to the malady, and so preventing the formation of
                    new infectious centres. Evasion or infraction of the legislative orders in force
                    for the suppression of contagious diseases in animals is punishable by fine or
                    imprisonment. (G. FL.)</p>
