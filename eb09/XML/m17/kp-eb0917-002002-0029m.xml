                    preservation of the body was deemed essential to the corporeal resurrection of
                    the “justified” dead. The living man consisted of a body, a soul, an
                    intelligence, and an appearance or <hi rend="italic">eidolon,—</hi> in Egyptian,
                    a <hi rend="italic">ka.</hi> Death dissociated these four parts, which must
                    ultimately be reunited for all eternity. Between death on earth and life
                    everlasting there intervened, however, a period varying from 3000 to 10,000
                    years, during which the intelligence wandered, luminous, through space, while
                    the soul performed a painful probationary pilgrimage through the mysterious
                    under-world. The body, in order that it should await, intact, the return of the
                    soul whose habitation it was, must meanwhile be guarded from corruption and
                    every danger. Hence, and hence only, the extraordinary measures taken to ensure
                    the preservation of the corpse and the inviolability of the sepulchre; hence the
                    huge pyramid, the secret pit, and the subterraneous labyrinth. The shadowy and
                    impalpable <hi rend="italic">ka</hi> —the mere aspect, be it remembered, of the
                    man—was supposed to dwell in the tomb with the mummied body. This fragile
                    conception was not, however, indestructible, like the soul and the intelligence.
                    Being an aspect, it must perforce be the aspect of something material; and, if
                    the body which it represented were destroyed or damaged, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ka</hi> was liable to the like mischance. In view of this danger, the Egyptian,
                    by stocking his sepulchre with portrait statues, sought to provide the <hi
                    rend="italic">ka</hi> with other chances of continuance, these statues being
                    designed, in a strictly literal sense, to serve as <hi rend="italic"
                    >supports</hi> or dummies for the <hi rend="italic">ka.</hi> The funereal
                    portrait statues of the ancient empire (Dynasties I. to VI.) are marvels of
                    realistic art in basalt, diorite, limestone, and wood. As many as twenty
                    duplicates have been found in a single tomb, and always secreted in hidden
                    chambers constructed in the thickness of the walls of the sepulchre. The Bulak
                    Museum is very rich in <hi rend="italic">ka</hi> statues of the ancient empire;
                    and the British Museum contains two in wood from the tomb of Seti I., of the
                    period of Dynasty XIX.</p>
                <p>For the processes of mummification, as narrated by Greek and Latin authors, see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Embalming.</hi> The details which follow are taken from
                    original Egyptian sources.</p>
                <p>The embalmment of a man of wealth, done in the costliest manner, consisted of—(1)
                    the “going into the good abode,” (2) the <hi rend="italic">Teb,</hi> (3) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kesau.</hi> The first of these was the process of evisceration,
                    cleansing, &lt;fcc., which occupied 15 or 16 days; the second was the salting or
                    bituminizing, and took 19 or 20 days; the third was the spicing and bandaging,
                    and took 34 or 35 days,—making 70 or 72 days in all. There were four special
                    “rituals” for the guidance of the priestly operators and assistants—(1) that of
                    “going into the good abode,” which was a kind of surgical manual for the use of
                    the paraschists, enumerating the incisions to be made in the body; (2) that of
                    “the <hi rend="italic">Kesau,”</hi> a corresponding manual for the use of the
                    taricheutes, containing lists of the necessary gums, resins, spices, &lt;fcc.,
                    directions as to the number and nature of the bandages, and prayers to be
                    repeated while adjusting them; (3) the “water ritual” or service-book of
                    litanies, to be recited during the transport of the mummy to the cemetery, which
                    was almost always done by boat; (4) the funereal ritual, performed on consigning
                    the mummy to the tomb. No copy of the first of these documents is known, but its
                    substance is summarized in the Rhind papyrus. Of the other three, contemporary
                    copies written on papyrus exist in various museums. Establishments for the
                    reception and mummification of the dead were attached to all the great
                    cemeteries. These mortuary suburbs, by the Greeks called “memnonia”
                    (∕χe∕ιv0veια), were inhabited by a large population of embalmers, mummy-case
                    makers, gilders, painters, scribes, priests, and the like; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n30/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0030-0021"/> and it has been calculated that from 500 to 800
                    corpses must always have been on hand in the workshops attached to the
                    necropolis of Memphis. To prevent mistakes in delivering the mummies to their
                    families, the bandagers were in the habit of marking the wrappings with the name
                    and age of the deceased, sometimes adding the name and regnal year of the king
                    in whose time he died. The ink in which these entries were written was made from
                    nitrate of silver, like the marking-ink of the present day. The bandages were of
                    linen only. The texture varied with the rank of the mummy, some being as fine as
                    the finest India muslin, and some extremely coarse. The quantity used was
                    enormous, and persons used to save their old linen for this purpose all their
                    lives long. Each limb, finger, and toe was first separately swathed; and finally
                    the whole body was enveloped in numberless convolutions, the contours of the
                    shrunken form being skilfully restored by means of padding. From 700 to 1250
                    yards of bandages, in strips of 3 to 4 inches wide, have been found on
                    mummies.</p>
                <p>The processes of mummification varied in different parts of Egypt and at
                    different periods. The mummies made at Memphis are black, dry, and brittle,
                    whereas those of the best Theban epoch are yellowish, flexible, and so elastic
                    that the flesh yields to the touch of the finger and the limbs may be bent
                    without breaking. Champollion-Figeac attributes this exquisite softness and
                    elasticity to the injection of costly chemical liquids into the veins, whereby
                    the substance of the flesh was preserved. The natron process, on the contrary,
                    destroyed the flesh, leaving only the skin and the bones. By some schools of
                    embalmers the cavity of the skull, after the withdrawal of the brain, was washed
                    out by an injection of refined bitumen, the effect of which was to preserve the
                    membranous covering which has frequently been found inside the brain-pan, dried
                    and unimpaired. Hair is constantly found on the heads of mummies, sometimes
                    plaited, sometimes frizzled,—thus showing that the fashion of wearing wigs was
                    by no means universal. The under bandages of mummies were laid on wet, having
                    probably been dipped in spirits. They sometimes come off with the solidity of a
                    pasteboard mask; and life-like portraits of the dead have been reproduced by
                    simply casting plaster into these masks as into a mould. When Syrian turpentine
                    came into use the Theban mummies ceased to maintain their supremacy, and became
                    even blacker than those of Memphis, the corpse and its bandages forming one
                    solid mass almost as hard as stone. In Memphite mummies, especially of the
                    Ramesside and Saitic periods, the cavity of the chest is found filled with
                    scarabaei and amulets in <hi rend="italic">pietra dura.</hi> The Theban mummies,
                    on the other hand, from Dynasty XI. to Dynasty XXIII., were adorned with rings,
                    pectoral ornaments, collars, bracelets, &amp;c., in exquisitely-wrought gold
                    inlaid with lapis-lazuli, carnelian, green felspar, and other precious stones.
                    Under the Greeks and Romans the art of mummification declined. Rudely-painted
                    wooden coffins were substituted for the granite sarcophagi and richly-decorated
                    mummy-cases of former times. The mummies became ashen-grey, or, being boiled in
                    bitumen, were black, heavy, and shapeless. Those of Graeco-Roman times are
                    frequently found wrapped in painted shrouds, and sometimes with coarsely-daubed
                    encaustic portraits on panel laid above the faces. Dr Birch gives 700 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> as the date at which mummification practically
                    ceased. It was formerly supposed that the bodies of the dead were merely
                    desiccated under the ancient empire, and that actual embalming was not practised
                    before 2000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Recent explorations among the ruined
                    pyramids of Sakkarah have, however, brought to light the mummied corpse of King
                    Merenra, and part of the mummy of King Pepi, his father, both of Dynasty VI.
                    Though denuded of its wrappings by ancient tomb-breakers, the mummy of Merenra
                    is distinctly impressed in the usual manner with marks of its former bandages;
                    and portions of the bandages and a “well-embalmed” hand were recovered from the
                    <hi rend="italic">débris</hi> of that of King Pepi. It is thus shown that
                    mummification was an established rite towards the close of the ancient empire,
                    and that the processes then in use were identical with those of later times,
                    which compels us to ascribe a very early date (possibly 3800 or 4000 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> to the beginnings of the art.</p>
                <p>The styles of sarcophagi and mummy-cases vary according to periods and places as
                    much as do the styles of mummification. At Gizeh, Sakkarah, and Meydùm, in tombs
                    of the ancient empire (Dynasties I. to VI.), the dead are found in unpainted
                    wooden coffins with carved human faces, these coffins being enclosed in massive
                    rectangular sarcophagi of black basalt, red granite, and limestone. Interments
                    of the earliest Theban period (Dynasty XI.) yield cases shaped like the mummy
                    within, and carved out of solid tree-trunks. The masks are painted yellow,
                    white, or black, and on the breast Isis and Nephthys are depicted as if
                    overshadowing the mummycase with their wings. These cases are sometimes found
                    enclosed in large rectangular wooden coffers with flat lids. With Dynasty XVII.
                    (Theban) there appears the mummycase with hands carved in relief and crossed
                    upon the breast. The ground-colour of these cases is generally white or black,
                    painted with transverse bands of hieroglyphed inscriptions, the mask is red or
                    gilded, and a vulture with extended wings is depicted on the breast. From
                    Dynasty XIX. to Dynasty XXI. the coffins are highly ornamented in gay colours,
                    figures being more abundant than inscriptions, and yellow varnishes much in
                    favour. The mummy is frequently found enclosed in two, three, and even four such
                    cases, each a size larger than the last. Cases with black grounds are succeeded
                    by cases with brown grounds, and these again by white, resembling those of
                    Dynasties XVII. and XVIII. The masks are now painted red, with richly-decorated
                    head-dresses imitating wigs. Under the priest-king or Amenide domination these
                    triple and quadruple “nests” of mummy-cases are found enclosed in gigantic
                    rectangular outer sarcophagi of wood, highly painted and varnished. From Dynasty
                    XXII. to Dynasty XXVI. the inscriptions are mostly painted in green on a white
                    ground. At Memphis, meanwhile, the granite, basalt, or limestone
                    sarcophagus—sometimes rectangular with rounded corners, sometimes mummy-shaped
                    with sculptured hands and feet, sometimes resembling a long bath—continued to
                    hold its ground. The Saitic period (Dynasties XXVI. to XXX.) is distinguished by
                    the minute finish and artistic beauty of its sculptured sarcophagi in basalt and
                    granite. Last of all, in the extreme decadence of the art, come squared wooden
                    coffins, unpainted, unvarnished, and rudely scrawled in ink with hieroglyphed
                    legends so corrupt as to be almost illegible. According to the religious law of
                    ancient Egypt, the rites of mummification were universal and compulsory, being
                    performed, not only for every native in a style consistent with his rank in
                    life, but also for all strangers and foreigners who died in the land, for all
                    slaves and captives, and even for outcasts, criminals, and lepers.</p>
                <p>The most ancient mummified—or, at all events, desiccated—human remains, not being
                    pre-historic, which are known to science are the fragments of the body of
                    Menkara (Gr., Mycerinus), third king of Dynasty IV., and builder of the smallest
                    of the three great pyramids of Gizeh. These fragments were found by Colonel
                    Howard Vyse strewn on the floor of the upper chamber of that pyramid, together
                    with the woollen wrappings and empty <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n31/mode/1up"

                    now in the British Museum. The fragments consist of the ribs and vertebrae and
                    the bones of the legs and feet, the dried flesh upon the thighs being perfectly
                    preserved. The date of these remains may be approximately assigned to 4000 B.c.
                    Next in antiquity comes the mummy of King Merenra of Dynasty VI., now in the
                    Bulak Museum, the date of which is about 3600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    Most famous and most interesting of all, however, are the royal mummies of
                    Dynasties XVΠ., XVIII., XIX., and XXI., found at Dair al-Baharf, near the great
                    temple of Queen Hatshepsu, on the left bank of the Nile opposite Karnak, in July
                    1881. The circumstances of this, the most extraordinary archaeological discovery
                    of any age, are too remarkable to be passed over in silence.</p>
                <p>The so-called “Theban Arabs” are the busiest treasure-seekers and
                    antiquity-vendors in Egypt. But not often, apparently, have they lighted upon a
                    royal interment. The royal sepulchres in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings
                    and the neighbourhood have tempted the cupidity of all ages; and we have the
                    direct evidence of two legal documents of the time of Rameses IX., 7th pharaoh
                    of Dynasty XX., to show that bands of organized tomb-breakers infested the
                    cemeteries of Thebes at that comparatively early period.</p>
                <p>It is now about twelve years since certain objects of great rarity and antiquity,
                    mostly belonging to the period of the Amenide Dynasty (XXL), began to find their
                    way to Europe from Upper Egypt. Foremost in importance among the said relics
                    were four funereal papyri (consisting of extracts from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ritual</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Book of the Dead)</hi> written for royal
                    personages of the Amenide family. Concurrent testimony pointed to a family of
                    Arab brothers named Abd er-Rasoul as the original holders of these papyri; it
                    was therefore concluded that the tombs of Pinotem I. and of the Queens
                    Notem-Maut and Hathor Hont-taui (for whom the papyri were written) had by them
                    been discovered and pillaged. The eldest brother was ultimately induced to
                    reveal the secret, and pointed out a lonely spot at the foot of the cliffs not
                    far from the ruins of the great temple of Hatshepsu, on the western bank of the
                    Nile, where the bottom of a hidden shaft opened into a short corridor leading to
                    a gallery 74 metres in length, at the end of which was a sepulchral vault
                    measuring 7 metres by 4. The whole of this gallery and vault were crowded with
                    mummies and mortuary furniture, as sacred vessels, funereal statuettes, canopic
                    and libation vases, and precious objects in alabaster, bronze, glass, acacia
                    wood, and the like. The mummies were thirty-six in number, including upwards of
                    twenty kings and queens from Dynasty XVII. to Dynasty XXL, besides princes,
                    princesses, and high priests, all of which, together with four royal papyri and
                    a miscellaneous treasure consisting of upwards of 6000 objects, are now in the
                    Bulak Museum.</p>
                <p>The door-jambs of the mortuary chamber at the end of this long gallery are
                    inscribed with various attestations of burial. These entries refer to interments
                    of members of the Amenide line only. It is also to be observed that only members
                    of that line were found inside the chamber, so proving that the sepulchre was
                    the family vault of the descendants of the first priest-king. All the other
                    royal mummies, and all the objects appertaining to those mummies (that is to
                    say, to the representatives of Dynasties XVII., XVIII., and XIX.) were found in
                    the long gallery outside. When these earlier kings, queens, and princesses were
                    brought out into the light of day, and conveyed to the museum of Bulak, it was
                    discovered that the coffins of some, and the wrappings of others, were inscribed
                    with short official entries written thereon at different times and in different
                    places by successive inspectors of tombs. The dates of these visits of
                    inspection are restricted to the period of Dynasty XXL, whence it is evident
                    that the necessity for protecting the last homes of the illustrious dead was as
                    urgent then as the “Amherst” and “Abbott” papyri prove it to have been in the
                    reign of Rameses IX. The terms of these entries show that it was the duty of the
                    said inspectors to enter the sepulchres of the “royal ancestors," to report upon
                    the condition of the mummies, to repair their wrappings and mummy-cases when
                    requisite, and, if expedient, to remove them from their own tombs into any
                    others which might be regarded as more secure. The mummies and mummy-cases thus
                    inscribed are five in number— namely, those of Amenhotep I., Thothmes II.,
                    Rameses I., Seti I., and Rameses II. Two entries on the coffin-lid of Amenhotep
                    I. show his tomb to have been inspected and his wrappings renewed in the 6th
                    year of Pinotem II., fourth of the priest-king line, and again in the 16th year
                    of the pontificate of Masahirti, his son and successor. In the 6th year of
                    Pinotem I. the same was done for the mummy of Thothmes II. The three pharaohs of
                    Dynasty XIX.—Rameses I., Set; I., and Rameses II.—seem, however, to have been
                    still more anxiously looked after. Either because their mummies were specially
                    revered, or because their sepulchres had already been attacked by the
                    tomb-breaking gangs of that period, we find them continually being removed from
                    one tomb to another. In the 6th year of Her-Hor, the founder of the Amenide
                    line, while they yet occupied their own splendid sepulchres in the Valley of the
                    Tombs of the Kings, they were there examined by a Government inspector, who
                    “renewed their funerary equipments” and made an entry of his visit on the
                    coffins of Seti I. and Rameses II. After this Rameses I. and Rameses II. were
                    removed to the tomb of Seti I. (the tomb known as Belzoni’s), whence, in the
                    16th year of Her-Hor, all three mummies, father, son, and grandson, were
                    transferred to the tomb of Queen Ansera. This act of transfer is written, dated,
                    signed, and witnessed on all three coffins. Again, in the 10th year of Pinotem
                    I., grandson of Her-Hor, occur more entries showing them to have been conveyed
                    from the tomb of Queen Ansera to the tomb of one of the Amenhoteps. Finally, in
                    bold hieratic characters, written with markingink upon the breast-bandages of
                    Rameses 11., we find the following memorandum recording how, ten years later
                    still, the mummy of this illustrious pharaoh was again taken back to the tomb of
                    his father Seti I. :—</p>
                <p>“The year 16, the third month of Pert <hi rend="italic">(i,e.,</hi> seed-time),
                    the sixth day, being the day of carrying the defunct King Ra-user-Ma
                    Sotep-en-Ra, for the renewal of his funerary appointments, into the tomb of the
                    defunct King Ra-men-Ma Seti, by the first prophet of Amen, Pinotem.”</p>
                <p>At what precise date these and the earlier royal mummies were brought into the
                    Dair al - Bahari vault does not appear; but, as that vault was finally closed on
                    the burial of Queen Isi-em-Kheb, we may conclude that, as a last resource
                    against possible depredation, the “royal ancestors” were deposited therein at or
                    about that time. This would be in the reign of King Menkheperra (brother and
                    successor of Masahirti, and husband of Isi-em-Kheb), whose seal, impressed on
                    clay, was found upon the shattered door of the mortuary chamber. The condition
                    of the various mummies and mummy-cases thus hospitably sheltered gives every
                    indication that their original sepulchres had been previously violated. The
                    coffins of Thothmes III. and Rameses I. are much damaged. That of Rameses II.
                    was probably destroyed, since the one in which his mummy now reposes is of
                    Dynasty XXL workmanship. The mummy of Rameses I. is doubtful, that of Thothmes
                    I. is missing, as are also the coffins of Queen Ansera, Queen Merit-Amen, and
                    Queen Sitka. The mummy of Thothmes III.—greatest of all Egyptian
                    pharaohs—greater than even Seti I. or Rameses II. —is broken in three pieces.
                    All this is apparently the work of ancient marauders.</p>
