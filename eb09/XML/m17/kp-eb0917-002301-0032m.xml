                <p><label type="entry">MUNCHAUSEN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Baron</hi></label>, the
                    modern Philopseudes, “of whom Ferdinand Mendez Pinto was but a type,” is
                    commonly identified with Hieronymus Karl Friedrich von Münchausen, of
                    Bodenswerder in Hanover, who, having entered the Russian service and served in
                    several campaigns against the Turks, amused himself in his retirement by
                    relating extraordinary instances of his prowess as soldier and sportsman. He
                    died in 1797. Inl785a little book of 48 pages, <hi rend="italic">Baron
                    Munchausen’s Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia,</hi>
                    was published in London. A second edition was printed at Oxford next year; an
                    enlarged London edition speedily followed, and the book had gone through five
                    editions before, in 1787, it was introduced to the German public in a
                    translation, with a preface by the poet Bürger. Bürger very naturally passed in
                    Germany for the writer; and it was not until 1824 that a communication from his
                    editor Karl von Reinhard to the <hi rend="italic">Gesellschafter</hi> fixed the
                    authorship upon Rudolf Erich Raspe. Raspe, a man of versatile talent, the author
                    of some works on natural history and painting and of a poem entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Hermin and Gunilde,</hi> was born at Hanover in 1737, and had been
                    professor of archaeology and curator of the museum at Cassel, which appointments
                    he lost upon a charge of stealing medals. He fled to England, where he had
                    already been elected an honorary fellow of the Royal Society, though his name
                    was subsequently expunged. From 1782 to about 1788 he was assay-master and
                    storekeeper at Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, where his ingenuity was still
                    remembered in the middle of the present century. In 1794 he accepted a similar
                    situation at Muckross in Ireland, but died there before entering upon his post.
                    His authorship of Munchausen rests entirely upon the testimony of Von Reinhard,
                    but the fact was in all probability communicated to the latter by Bürger; it has
                    never been disputed, and is confirmed by the appearance of the book in London
                    during Raspe’s residence in England. The father of Adolf Ellisen, a recent
                    German editor, visited Baron Münchausen himself in 1795, two years before his
                    death, and found him very uncommunicative. He was convinced, however, by the
                    evidence of acquaintances that the baron had in his younger days fully entitled
                    himself to the distinction thrust upon him by Herr Raspe.</p>
                <p>It would be superfluous to descant on the qualities of a work so universally
                    known, whose name has become a household word. It is to be observed, however,
                    that the typical Munchausen is chiefly to be encountered in the 48 pages
                    originally published by Raspe, and that the subsequent accessions, while
                    quadrupling the dimensions of the book, are far from adding proportionably to
                    its merit. There is hardly such another instance in literature of eleven
                    buckram-men growing out of two. The most important of these additions is
                    entitled “A Journey to the Moon and Dog Star,” and is mainly borrowed from
                    Lucian’s <hi rend="italic">True History.</hi> A very inferior appendix,
                    published in 1793, represents the baron in conflict with the French
                    revolutionists and Tippoo Saib; and there are several undisguised imitations.
                    The family likeness of the stories published by Raspe himself renders it
                    probable that they were actually derived by him from Münchausen, of whom he
                    speaks respectfully in his preface, attributing to his inventions the moral
                    purpose of “awakening and shaming the common sense of those who have lost it by
                    prejudice or habit.” It is nevertheless likely that Münchausen shone rather as a
                    narrator than an inventor, some of his marvels having been traced to Bebel’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Facetiae,</hi> to Lange’s <hi rend="italic">Mendacia
                    Ridicula,</hi> to Castiglione’s <hi rend="italic">Cortegiano,</hi> and even to a
                    Portuguese magazine.</p>
                <p>The best English edition is that by Teignmouth Shore (1872), with illustrations
                    by Gustave Doré and additions by Théophile Gautier; the best German edition that
                    by Ellisen (1849), to which is prefixed a valuable essay upon the literature of
                    pseudology in general. The English edition of 1809 has plates by Rowlandson.</p>
