                    >juncea.</hi> The finest qualities of Black and White Mustard are cultivated in
                    the eastern counties of England. The former is a plant requiring a rich soil and
                    much care in its treatment, but its seeds, which are very minute, weighing not
                    more than one-fiftieth of a grain, are the most valuable for commercial
                    purposes. The peculiar pungency and odour to which mustard owes much of its
                    value are due to an essential oil developed by the action of water on two
                    peculiar chemical substances contained in the black seed. These bodies are a
                    compound termed by its discoverers myronate of potassium, but since called
                    sinigrin, C <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 18</hi> KNS
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi>, and an albuminoid
                    body, myrosin. The latter substance in presence of water acts as a ferment on
                    sinigrin, splitting it up into the essential oil of mustard, a potassium salt,
                    and sugar. It is worthy of remark that this reaction does not take place in
                    presence of boiling water, and therefore it is not proper to use very hot water
                    in the preparation of mustard. Essential oil of mustard is in chemical
                    constitution an iso-sulphocyanate of allyl C <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi> NS. It is prepared artificially by a process,
                    discovered by Zinzin, which consists in treating bromide of allyl with
                    sulphocyanate of ammonium and distilling the resultant sulphocyanate of allyl.
                    The seed of White Mustard contains in place of sinigrin a peculiar principle
                    called sinalbin, <pb break="no"

                    sinigrin. In presence of water it is acted upon by myrosin, present also in
                    White Mustard, splitting it up into sulphocyanate of acrinyl, sulphate of
                    sinapine, and sugar, Sulphocyanate of acrinyl is a powerful rubefacient
                    principle, whence White Mustard, although yielding no volatile oil, forms a
                    valuable material for cataplasms. The seeds of <hi rend="italic"

                    properties as Black Mustard, as a substitute for which they are extensively

                <p>Both as a table condiment and as a medicinal substance, mustard has been known
                    from a very remote period. Under the name of vατrυ it was used by Hippocrates in
                    medicine. The form in which table mustard is now sold in the United Kingdom
                    dates from 1720, about which time Mrs Clements of Durham hit on the idea of
                    grinding the seed in a mill and sifting the flour from the husk. The bright
                    -yellow farina thereby produced under the name of “Durham mustard” pleased the
                    taste of George I., and rapidly attained wide popularity. As it is now prepared
                    mustard consists essentially of a mixture of black and white farina in certain
                    proportions. Several grades of pure mustard are made containing nothing but the
                    farina of mustard-seed, the lower qualities having larger amounts of the white
                    cheaper mustard; and corresponding grades of a mixed preparation of equal price,
                    but containing certain proportions of wheaten or starch flour, are also prepared
                    and sold as “mustard condiment.” The mixture is free from the unmitigated
                    bitterness and sharpness of flavour of pure mustard, and it keeps much
                    better.</p>
                <p>All varieties of mustard-seed contain from 25 to 35 per cent, of a bland
                    inodorous yellow-coloured fixed oil, free from pungency and with little tendency
                    to become rancid. It is extensively used in India for cooking and all ordinary
                    purposes, and is one of the ordinary commercial oils of Western countries. The
                    mustard papers commonly used as rubefacients and vesicants are made from mustard
                    flour entirely deprived of its fixed oil.</p>
