                <p>THERE is scarcely one of the numerous branches of decorative art which has not at
                    some time or other been applied to the ornamenting of wall-surfaces. It will be
                    convenient to classify the various methods under different heads.<note

                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Reliefs sculptured in Marble or Stone.—</hi> This is the
                    oldest method of wall-decoration, of which numerous examples still exist. The
                    tombs and temples of Egypt are very rich in this kind of mural ornament of
                    various dates, extending over the enormous period of nearly 5000 years. These
                    sculptures are, as a rule, carved in very low relief; in many cases they are
                    “counter-sunk,” that is, the most projecting parts of the figures do not extend
                    beyond the flat surface of the ground. Some unfinished reliefs discovered in the
                    rock-cut tombs of Thebes show the manner in which the sculptor set to work. The
                    plain surface of the stone was marked out by red lines into a number of squares
                    of equal size. The use of this was probably twofold: first, as a guide in
                    enlarging the design from a small drawing, a method still commonly practised;
                    second, to help the artist to draw his figures with just proportions, following
                    the very strict canons which were laid down by the Egyptians. No excessive
                    realism or individuality of style arising from a careful study of the lifemodel
                    was permitted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>During
                    the earliest times—more than 4000 years before our era —there appear to have
                    been exceptions to this rule.</p></note> When the surface had been covered with
                    these squares, the artist drew with a brush dipped in red the outlines of his
                    relief, and then cut round them with his chisel.</p>
                <p>When the relief was finished, it was, as a rule, entirely painted over with much
                    minuteness and great variety of colours. More rarely the ground was left the
                    natural tint of the stone or marble, and only the figures and hieroglyphs
                    painted. In the case of sculpture in hard basalt or granite the painting appears
                    often to have been omitted altogether. The utter absence of perspective effects
                    and the severe self-restraint of the sculptors in the matter of composition show
                    a keen sense of artistic fitness in this kind of decoration. That the stern
                    rigidity of these sculptured pictures did not in any way arise from want of
                    skill or observation of nature on the part of the artists is at once apparent
                    when we examine their representations of birds and animals; with the most
                    unerring skill and precision the special characteristics of each creature and
                    species were caught by the ancient Egyptian and reproduced in stone or colour,
                    not literally, but in a half-symbolic way, suggesting exactly those
                    peculiarities of form, plumage, or movement which are the essence and
                    “differentia” of each, all other ideas bearing less directly on the point being
                    carefully eliminated.</p>
                <p>The subjects of these great mural sculptures are endless in their variety; almost
                    every possible incident in man’s life here or beyond the grave is reproduced
                    with the closest attention to detail. The tomb of Tih at Sakkarah (about 4500
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) has some of the finest and earliest specimens of
                    these mural sculptures, especially rich in illustrations of the every-day
                    domestic life and occupations of the Egyptians. The later tombs, as a rule, have
                    sculptures depicting the religious ritual and belief of the people, and the
                    temples combine these hieratic subjects with the history of the reigns and
                    victories of the Egyptian kings.</p>
                <p>The above remarks as to style and manner of execution may be applied also to the
                    wall-sculptures from the royal palaces of Nineveh and Babylon, the finest of
                    which are shown by inscriptions to date from the time of Sennacherib to that of
                    Sardanapalus (from 705 to 625 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> These are carved
                    in very low relief with almost gem-like delicacy of detail on enormous slabs of
                    white marble. The sacred subjects, generally representing the king worshipping
                    one of the numerous Assyrian gods, are mostly large, often colossal in scale.
                    The other subjects, illustrating the life and amusements of the king, his
                    prowess in war or hunting, or long processions of prisoners and tribute-bearers
                    coming to do him homage, are generally smaller and in some cases very minute in
                    scale (fig. 1). The arrangement of these reliefs in long horizontal bands, and
                    their reserved conventional treatment are somewhat similar to those of ancient
                    Egypt, but they show a closer attention to anatomical truth and a greater love
                    for strong dramatic effect than any of the Egyptian reliefs. As in the art of
                    Egypt, birds and animals are treated with far greater realism than human
                    figures. The plastic art of no period or country has ever surpassed in skill and
                    life-like truth the Assyrian reliefs of horses, mules, hounds, goats, lions, and
                    many other animals. A relief in the British Museum, representing a lioness
                    wounded by an arrow in her spine and dragging helplessly her paralysed hind
                    legs, affords an example of wonderful truth and pathos. Very remarkable
                    technical skill is shown in all these sculptures by the way in which the
                    sculptors have obtained the utmost amount of effect with the smallest possible
                    amount of relief (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Babylonia,</hi> vol. iii. p. 190), in
                    this respect calling strongly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n44/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0044-0035"/> to mind a similar peculiarity in the work of the
                    Florentine Donatello.</p>
                <p>The palace at Mashita on the hajj road in Moab, built by the Sasanian Chosroes
                    II. (614-627 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> is ornamented on the exterior with
                    very beautiful surface sculpture in stone. The designs of this are of peculiar
                    interest as forming an evident link between Assyrian and Byzantine art, and they
                    are not remotely connected with the decoration on Moslem buildings of
                    comparatively modern date.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Among the Mashita carvings occurs that oldest and most widely spread of all
                    forms of Aryan ornament—the sacred tree between two animals. The sculptured slab
                    over the “lion-gate” at Mycenae has the other common variety of this motive—the
                    fire-altar between the beasts. These designs, occasionally varied by figures of
                    human worshippers instead of the beasts, survived in a most extraordinary way
                    long after their meaning had been forgotten; even down to the present day in
                    some form or other they frequently appear on carpets and other textiles of
                    Oriental manufacture.</p></note></p>
                <p>Especially in Italy during the Middle Ages a similar treatment of marble in low
                    relief was frequently used for wall-decoration. The most notable example is the
                    beautiful series of reliefs on the west front of Orvieto cathedral, the work of
                    Giovanni P⅛ano and his pupils in the early part of the 14th century. These are
                    small reliefs, illustrative of the Old and New Testaments, of most graceful
                    design and skilful execution. A growth of branching foliage serves to unite and
                    frame the tiers of subjects.</p>
                <p>Of a widely different class, but of considerable importance in the history of
                    mural decoration, are the very beautiful reliefs, sculptured in stone and
                    marble, with which Moslem buildings in many parts of the world are ornamented.
                    These are mostly geometrical patterns of great intricacy and beauty, which cover
                    large surfaces, frequently broken up into panels by bands of more flowing
                    ornament or Arabic inscriptions. The mosques of Cairo, India, and Persia, and
                    the domestic Moslem buildings of Spain are extremely rich in this magnificent
                    method of decoration. In western Europe, especially during the 15 th century,
                    stone panelled-work with rich tracery formed a large part of the scheme of
                    decoration in all the more splendid buildings. Akin to this, though without
                    actual relief, is the very sumptuous stone tracery,—inlaid flush into rough
                    flint walls,—which was a mode of ornament largely used for enriching the
                    exteriors of churches in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. It is almost
                    peculiar to that district, and is an admirable example of the skill and taste
                    with which the mediaeval builders adapted their method of ornamentation to the
                    materials which came naturally to hand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Marble Veneer.—</hi> Another widely-used method of mural
                    decoration has been the application of thin marble linings to wall-surfaces, the
                    decorative effect being produced by the natural beauty of the marble itself and
                    not by sculptured reliefs. One of the oldest buildings in the world, the
                    so-called “Temple of the Sphinx” among the Gizeh pyramids, is built of great
                    blocks of granite, the inside of the rooms being lined with slabs of beautiful
                    semi-transparent African alabaster about 3 inches thick. In the 1st century very
                    thin veneers of richly-coloured marbles were largely used by the Romans to
                    decorate brick and stone walls. Pliny (7/. <hi rend="italic">N.,</hi> xxxvi. 6)
                    speaks of this practice as being a new and degenerate invention in his time.
                    Many examples exist at Pompeii and in other Roman buildings. Numerous Byzantine
                    churches, such as St Saviour’s at Constantinople, and St George’s, Thessalonica,
                    have the lower part of the internal walls richly ornamented in this way. It was
                    commonly used to form a dado, the upper part of the building being covered with
                    mosaic. The cathedral of Monreale and other Siculo-Norman buildings owe a great
                    deal of their splendour to these linings of richly-variegated marbles. In most
                    cases the main surface is of light-coloured marble or alabaster, inlaid bands of
                    darker tint or coloured mosaic being used to divide the surface into panels. The
                    peculiar Italian-Gothic of northern and central Italy during the 14th and 15th
                    centuries, and at Venice some centuries earlier, relied greatly for its effects
                    on this treatment of marble. St Mark’s at Venice and the cathedral of Florence
                    are magnificent examples of this work used externally. It is in every case a
                    mere skin, and is in no way connected with the stability of the structure. Both
                    inside and out most of the richest examples of Moslem architecture owe much to
                    this method of decoration; the mosques and palaces of India and Persia are in
                    many cases completely lined with the most lustrous and brilliant sorts of
                    marble, of contrasting tints arranged and fitted together with consummate skill
                    and knowledge of harmony.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Wall-Linings of Glazed Bricks or Tiles.—</hi> This is a very
                    important class of decoration, and from its almost imperishable nature, its
                    richness of colour, and its brilliance of surface is capable of producing a
                    splendour of effect that can only be rivalled by glass mosaics. In the less
                    important form—that of bricks modelled or stamped in relief with figures and
                    inscriptions, and then coated with a brilliant colour in siliceous enamel—it was
                    largely used by the ancient Egyptians and Assyrians as well as by the later
                    Sasanians of Persia. In the 11th and 12th centuries the Moslems of Persia
                    brought this art to great perfection, and used it on a large scale, chiefly,
                    though not invariably, for internal walls. The main surfaces were covered by
                    thick earthenware tiles, overlaid with a white enamel. These were not
                    rectangular, but of various shapes, mostly some form of a star, arranged so as
                    to fit closely together. Very delicate and minute patterns were then painted on
                    the tiles, after the first firing, in a copper-like colour with strong metallic
                    lustre, produced by the deoxidization of a metallic salt in the process of the
                    second firing. Bands and friezes with Arabic inscriptions, modelled boldly in
                    high relief, were used to break up the monotony of the surface. In these, as a
                    rule, the projecting letters were painted blue, and the flat ground enriched
                    with very minute patterns in the lustre-colour. This combination of bold relief
                    and delicate painting produces great vigour and richness of effect, equally
                    telling whether viewed in the mass or closely examined tile by tile. In the 15th
                    century lustre-colours, though still largely employed fσr plates, vases, and
                    other vessels, especially in Spain, were but little used for tiles; and another
                    class of ware, rich in the variety and brilliance of its colours, was
                    extensively used by Moslem builders all over the Mohammedan world. The most
                    sumptuous sorts of tiles used for wall coverings are those of the so-called
                    “Rhodian” and Damascus wares, the work of Persian potters at many places. Those
                    made at Rhodes are coarsely executed in comparison with the produce of the older
                    potteries at Ispahan and Damascus (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pottery).</hi> These
                    are rectangular tiles of earthenware, covered with a white “slip” and painted in
                    the most brilliant colours with slightly conventionalized representations of
                    various flowers, especially the rose, the hyacinth, and the carnation. The red
                    used is a very rich harmonious colour, applied in considerable body, so as to
                    stand out in slight relief. Another class of design is more geometrical, forming
                    regular repeats; but the most beautiful compositions are those in which the
                    natural growth of trees and flowers is imitated, the branches and blossoms
                    spreading freely over a large surface covered by hundreds of tiles <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n45/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0045-0036"/> without any repetition. One of the finest
                    examples is the “Mecca wall” in the mosque of Ibrâhîm Agha, Cairo; and other
                    Egyptian mosques are adorned in the same magnificent way (fig. 2). Another
                    variety, the special production of Damascus, has the design almost entirely
                    executed iι. blue. It was about the year 1600 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> in
                    the reign of Shah Abbas I., that this class of pottery was brought to greatest
                    perfection, and it is in Persia that the most magnificent examples of its use
                    are to be found. Nothing can surpass the splendour of effect produced by these
                    tilecoverings, varieties of which, dating from the 12th to the 17th centuries,
                    were largely used in all the chief buildings of Persia. The most remarkable
                    examples for beauty of design and extent of surface covered by these tiles are
                    the mosque at Tabriz, built by Ali Khoja in the 12th century, the ruined tomb of
                    Sultan Khodabend (1303- 1316 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> at Sultanieh, the

                    1666 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> at Ispahan, all of which buildings are
                    covered almost entirely inside and out with this magnificent sort of
                    decoration.</p>
                <p>Another important class of wall-tiles are those manufactured by the Spanish
                    Moors, called “azulejos,” especially during the 14th century. These are in a
                    very different style, being designed to suggest or imitate mosaic. They have
                    intricate interlacing geometrical patterns marked out by lines in slight relief;
                    brilliant enamel colours were then burned into the tile, the projecting lines
                    forming boundaries for the pigments. A very rich effect is produced by this
                    combination of relief and colour. They are mainly used for dados about 4 feet
                    high, often surmounted by a band of tiles with painted inscriptions. The
                    Alhambra and Generalife palaces at Granada, begun in the 13th century, but
                    mainly built and decorated by Yùsuf I. and Mohammed V. (1333-1391 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> and the Alcazar at Seville have the most beautiful
                    examples of these “azulejos.” The latter building chiefly owes its decorations
                    to Pedro the Cruel (1364 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> who employed Moorish
                    workmen for its tile-coverings and other ornaments. Many other buildings in
                    southern Spain are enriched in the same way, some as late as the 16th
                    century.</p>
                <p>Almost peculiar to Spain are a variety of wall-tile the work of Italians in the
                    16th and 17th centuries. These are effective, though rather coarsely painted,
                    and have a rich yellow as the predominant colour. The Casa de Pilatos and
                    Isabel’s chapel in the Alcazar palace, both at Seville, have the best specimens
                    of these, dating about the year 1500. In other Western countries tiles have been
                    used more for pavements than for wall-decoration.<note anchored="true"

                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Wall-Coverings of Hard Stucco, frequently enriched with
                    Reliefs.—</hi> The Greeks and Romans possessed the secret of making a very
                    beautiful hard kind of stucco, creamy in colour, and capable of receiving a
                    polish like that of marble; it would stand exposure to the weather. Those of the
                    early Greek temples which were built, not of marble, but of stone, such as the
                    Doric temples at Aegina, Phigaleia, Paestum, and Agrigentum, were all entirely
                    coated inside and out with this beautiful material—itself pleasant both in
                    texture and hue, and an admirable surface for the further polychromatic
                    decoration with which all Greek buildings seem to have been ornamented. Another
                    highly artistic use of stucco among the Greeks and Romans for the interiors of
                    buildings consisted in covering the walls and vaults with a smooth coat, on
                    which while still wet the outlines of figures, groups, and other ornaments were
                    sketched with a point; more stucco was then applied in lumps and rapidly
                    modelled into delicate reliefs before it had time to set. Some tombs in Magna
                    Graecia of the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> are decorated in this
                    way with figures of nymphs, cupids, animals, and wreaths, all of which are
                    models of grace and elegance, both in form and action, and extremely remarkable
                    for the dexterous way in which a few rapid touches of the modelling tool or
                    thumb have produced a work of the highest artistic beauty and spirit (fig. 3).
                    Roman specimens of this sort of decoration are very common, fine examples have
                    been found in the baths of Titus and numerous tombs near Rome, as well <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n46/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0046-0037"/> as in many of the houses of Pompeii. These are
                    mostly executed with great skill and frequently with good taste, though in some
                    cases, especially at Pompeii, elaborate architectural compositions with awkward
                    attempts at effects of violent perspective, modelled in slight relief on flat
                    wall-surfaces, produce a very unpleasing effect. Other Pompeian examples, where
                    the surface is divided into flat panels, each containing a figure or group, have
                    great merit for their delicate richness of effect, without offending against the
                    canons of wall - decoration, one of the first conditions of which is that no
                    attempt should be made to disguise the fact of its being a solid wall and a flat
                    surface.</p>
                <p>The Moslem architects of the Middle Ages, who excelled in almost all possible
                    methods of mural decoration, made great use of stucco ornament in the most
                    elaborate and magnificent way, both for external and internal walls. The stucco
                    is modelled in high or low relief in great variety of geometrical patterns, of
                    wonderful beauty and richness, alternating with bands of more flowing ornament,
                    or long Arabic inscriptions. Many of their buildings, such as the mosque of
                    Tuhin at Cairo (879 <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.),</hi> owe nearly all their beauty
                    to this fine stucco work, the purely architectural shell of the structure being
                    often quite simple and devoid of ornament. These stucco reliefs were, as a rule,
                    further decorated with delicate painting in gold and colours, producing an
                    effect of indescribable beauty and splendour. The Moorish tower at Segovia in
                    Spain is a good example of this class of ornament used externally. With the
                    exception of a few bands of brick and the stone quoins at the angles, the whole
                    exterior of the tower is covered with a network of stucco reliefs in simple
                    geometrical patterns. The Alhambra at Granada and the Alcazar at Seville have
                    the richest examples of this work, both in the delicate intricacy of the designs
                    and in the brilliant colours with which they are painted. The lower part of the
                    walls is lined with marble or tiles to a height of about 4 feet, and above that
                    in many cases the whole surface is encrusted with these reliefs, the varied
                    surface of which, by producing endless gradations of shadow, takes away any
                    possible harshness or over-gaudiness from the brilliance of the gold and colours
                    (fig. 4).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is
                    unfortunate that the otherwise valuable work of Owen Jones on the Alhambra gives
                    a very false and unpleasing notion of the colouring of the place.</p></note></p>
                <p>During the 16th century, and even earlier, stucco wall-reliefs were used with
                    considerable skill and decorative effect in Italy, England, and other Western
                    countries. Perhaps the most graceful examples are the reliefs with which Vasari
                    in the 16th century encrusted pillars and other parts of the court in the
                    Florentine Palazzo Vecchio, built of plain stone by Michelozzi in 1454. These
                    are very beautiful reliefs, some of flowing vines and other plants winding
                    spirally round the columns. The English examples of this work are very
                    effectively designed, though coarser in execution. The outside of an old
                    half-timbered house in the market-place at Newark-upon-Trent has high reliefs in
                    stucco of canopied figures, dating from the end of the 15th century. The
                    counties of Essex and Suffolk are very rich in examples of this work used
                    externally; and many 16th-century houses in England have fine internal stucco
                    decoration, especially Hardwicke Hall (Derbyshire), one of the rooms of which
                    has the upper part of the wall enriched with life-sized stucco figures in high
                    relief, forming a deep frieze all round. The best English stucco work of this
                    sort is very remarkable for its freedom and spirit of design, as well as for
                    certain grace of line, which is a survival of the old mediaeval sense of beauty,
                    then rapidly passing away.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Sgraffito.—</hi> This is a variety of stucco work used
                    chiefly in Italy from the 16th century downwards, and employed only for
                    exteriors of buildings, especially the palaces of Tuscany and northern Italy.
                    The process is this. The wall is covered with a coat of stucco made black by an
                    admixture of charcoal; over this a second very thin coat of white stucco is
                    laid. When it is all hard the design is produced by cutting and scratching away
                    the white skin, so as to show the black under-coat. Thus the drawing appears in
                    black on a white ground. This work is effective at a distance, as it requires a
                    bold style of handling, in which the shadows are indicated by cross-hatched
                    lines more or less near together.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A good description of the process is given by Vasari, <hi
                    rend="italic">Tre Arti del Disegno,</hi> cap. xxvi.</p></note> Flowing
                    arabesques mixed with grotesque figures occur most frequently in sgraffito. It
                    is still largely practised in northern Italy, and has been used with success in
                    the external decoration of the South Kensington Academy of Music.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Stamped Leather.—</hi> This was a very magnificent and
                    expensive form of wall-hanging, chiefly used during the 16th and 17th centuries.
                    Skins, generally of goats or calves, were well tanned and cut into rectangular
                    shapes. They were then covered with silver leaf, which was varnished with a
                    transparent yellow lacquer, making the silver look like gold. The skins were
                    then stamped or embossed with patterns in relief, formed by heavy pressure from
                    metal dies, one in relief and the other sunk. The reliefs were then painted by
                    hand in many colours, generally brilliant in tone. Italy and Spain (especially
                    Cordova) were important seats of this manufacture; and in the 17 th century a
                    large quantity was produced in France. Fig. 5 gives a good example of Italian
                    stamped leather of the 16th century. In England, chiefly at Norwich, this
                    manufacture was carried on in the 17th and 18th centuries, in many cases of very
                    excellent design. In durability and richness of effect stamped leather surpasses
                    most other forms of movable wall-decoration.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Painted Cloth.</hi> —Another form of wall-hanging, used most
                    largely during the 15th and 16th centuries, and in a less extensive way a good
                    deal earlier, is canvas painted to imitate tapestry. English mediaeval
                    inventories both <pb break="no"

                    contain items such as these: “stayned cloths for hangings,” “paynted cloths with
                    stories and batailes,” or “paynted cloths of beyond sea work,” or “of Flaunder’s
                    work.” Many good artists working at Ghent and Bruges during the first half of
                    the 15 th century produced very fine work of this class, as well as designs for
                    real tapestry. Several of the great Italian artists devoted their utmost skill
                    in composition and invention to the painting of these wall-hangings. The most
                    important existing example is the magnificent series of paintings of the triumph
                    of Julius Caesar executed by Andrea Mantegna (1485-1492) for Ludovico Gonzaga,
                    duke of Mantua, and now at Hampton Court. These are usually, but wrongly, called
                    “cartoons,” as if they were designs meant to be executed in tapestry; this is
                    not the case, as the paintings themselves were used as wall-hangings. They are
                    nine in number, and each compartment, 9 feet square, was separated from the next
                    by a pilaster. They form a continuous procession, with life-sized figures of
                    unrivalled grace and beauty, remarkable alike for their composition, drawing,
                    and delicate colouring,—the latter unfortunately much disguised by the most
                    coarse and tasteless “restoration.” Like most of these painted wall-hangings,
                    they are executed in tempera, and rather thinly painted, so that the pigment
                    might not crack off through the cloth falling slightly into folds.<note

                    actual dyes were used for this sort of work. A MS. of the 15th century<note

                    cloth,” showing that sometimes they were dyed in a manner similar to those
                    Indian stuffs which were afterwards printed, and are now called chintzes. These
                    receipts are for real dyes, not for pigments, and among them is the earliest
                    known description of the process called</p>
                <p>“setting” the woad or indigo vat, as well as a receipt for removing or
                    “discharging” the colour from a cloth already dyed. Another method employed was
                    a sort of “encaustic” process; the cloth was rubbed all over with wax, and then
                    painted in tempera; heat was then applied so that the colours sank into the
                    melting wax, and were thus firmly fixed upon the cloth.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Printed Hangings and Wall-Papers.—</hi> The printing of
                    various textiles with dye-colours and mordants is probably one of the most
                    ancient of the arts. Pliny <hi rend="italic">(H. N.,</hi> χχχv,) clearly
                    describes a dyeing process employed by the ancient Egyptians, in which the
                    pattern was probably formed by printing from blocks. Various methods have been
                    used for this work — wood blocks in relief, engraved metal plates, stencil
                    plates, and even hand-painting; frequently two or more of these methods have
                    been employed for the same pattern. The use of printed stuffs is of great
                    antiquity among the Hindus and Chinese, and was certainly practised in western
                    Europe in the 13th century, and perhaps earlier. The »South Kensington Museum
                    has 13th-century specimens of block-printed silk made in Sicily, of very
                    beautiful design. Towards the end of the 14th century a great deal of
                    block-printed linen was made in Flanders, and largely imported into England.</p>
                <p>Wall-papers did not come into common use in Europe till the 18th century, though
                    they appear to have been used much earlier by the Chinese. A few rare examples
                    exist in England which may be as early as the 16th century; these are
                    imitations, generally in flock, of the fine old Florentine and Genoese cut
                    velvets, and hence the style of the design in no way shows the date of the
                    wallpaper, the same traditional patterns being reproduced for many years with
                    little or no change. Machinery enabling paper to be made in long strips was not
                    invented till the end of the last century, and up to that time wall-papers were
                    printed on small square pieces of hand-made paper, difficult to hang, disfigured
                    by numerous joints, and comparatively costly; on these accounts wall-papers were
                    slow in superseding the older and more magnificent modes of mural decoration,
                    such as wood-panelling, painting, tapestry, stamped leather, and painted cloth.
                    A little work by Jackson of Battersea, printed in London in 1744, throws some
                    light on the use of wall-papers at that time. He gives reduced copies of his
                    designs, mostly taken from Italian pictures or antique sculpture during his
                    residence in Venice. Instead of flowing patterns covering the wall, his designs
                    are all pictures — landscapes, architectural scenes, or statues—treated as
                    panels, with plain paper or painting between. They are all printed in oil, with
                    wooden blocks worked with a rolling press, apparently an invention of his own.
                    They are all in the worst possible taste, and yet are offered as great
                    improvements on the Chinese papers which he says were then in fashion.</p>
                <p>The method of printing wall-papers of the better sort is probably the same now
                    that it has always been. Wooden blocks with the design cut in relief, one for
                    each colour, are applied by hand, after being dipped in an elastic cloth sieve
                    charged with wet tempera pigment, great care being taken to lay each block
                    exactly on the right place, so that the various colours may “register” or fit
                    together. In order to suit the productions of the paper-mills these blocks are
                    made, in England 21 inches wide, and in France 18 inches wide; the length of the
                    block is limited to what the workman can easily lift with one hand,—2 feet being
                    about the limit, as the blocks are necessarily thick, and in many cases made
                    heavier by being inlaid with copper, especially the thin outlines, which, if
                    made of wood, would not stand the wear and tear of printing. In “flock” and gold
                    or silver printing the design is first printed in strong size; the flock (finely
                    cut wool of the required colour), or metallic powder is then sprinkled by hand
                    all over the paper; it adheres only to the wet size, and is easily shaken off
                    the ground or unsized part. If the pattern is required to stand out in some
                    relief this process is repeated several times, and the whole paper then rolled
                    to compress the flock. Cheaper sorts of paper are printed by machinery, the
                    design being cut on the surface of wooden rollers, under which <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0048-0039"/> the paper passes. The chief drawback to this
                    process is that all the colours are applied rapidly one after the other, w
                    ithout allowing each to dry separately, as is done in hand printing. A somewhat
                    blurred appearance is the usual result.</p>
                <p>Though at first wall-papers were a mere makeshift and feeble imitation of rich
                    textiles, yet, with a good feeling for the harmonies of colour and a regard for
                    the technical necessities of the process, very rich and beautiful effects may be
                    produced at a comparatively small cost if handprinting be adopted. Imitations of
                    stamped leather are now produced with great success, though of inferior
                    durability. Very thick tough paper is used for this, and treated in the same way
                    as the real skins mentioned above. Fig. 6 is a good English example of
                    18th-century wall paper printed on squares of stout hand-made paper 22 inches
                    wide. The design is apparently copied from an Indian chintz.</p>

                <p>This is naturally the most important and the most widely used of all forms of
                    wall-decoration, as well as perhaps the earliest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Egyptian Paintings.—</hi> Egypt is the chief storehouse of
                    ancient specimens of this, as of almost all the arts. Owing to the intimate
                    connexion between the sculpture and paint ing of early times, the remarks above
                    both as to subjects and treatment under the head of Egyptian wall-sculpture will
                    to a great extent apply also to the paintings. It is a very important fact, and
                    one which testifies clearly to the enormous antiquity of Egyptian civilization,
                    that the earliest paintings, dating more than 4000 years before our era, are
                    also the cleverest both in drawing and execution. In later times the influence
                    of Egyptian art, especially in painting, was very important among even very
                    distant nations. In the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Egyptian
                    colonists, introduced by Cambyses into Persepolis, largely influenced the
                    painting and sculpture of the great Persian empire and throughout the valley of
                    the Euphrates. In a lesser degree the art of Babylon and Nineveh had felt
                    considerable Egyptian influence several centuries earlier. The same influence
                    affected the early art of the Greeks and the Etrurians, and it was not till the
                    middle of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> that the further
                    development and perfecting of art in Greece obliterated the old traces of
                    Egyptian mannerism. After the death of Alexander the Great, when Egypt came into
                    the possession of the Lagidae (320 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), the tide of
                    influence flowed the other way, and Greek art modified though it did not
                    seriously alter the characteristics of Egyptian painting and sculpture, which
                    still retained much of their early formalism and severity. And yet the increased
                    sense of beauty, especially in the human face, derived from the Greeks was
                    counterbalanced by loss of vigour and force; art under the Ptolemies ceased to
                    have a real life and became a mere dull copyism of earlier traditions.</p>
                <p>The general scheme of mural painting in the buildings of ancient Egypt was very
                    complete and magnificent. Columns, mouldings, and other architectural features
                    were enriched with patterns in brilliant colours; the flat wallspaces were
                    covered with figure-subjects, generally in horizontal bands, and the ceilings
                    were richly ornamented with sacred symbols, such as the vulture, or painted blue
                    and studded with gold stars to symbolize the sky. The wall-paintings are
                    executed in tempera on a thin skin of fine lime, laid over the brick, stone, or
                    marble to form a smooth and slightly absorbent coat to receive the pigments,
                    which were most brilliant in tone and of great variety of tint. Not employing
                    fresco, the Egyptian artists were not restricted to “earth colours,” but
                    occasionally used purples, pinks, and greens which would have been destroyed by
                    fresh lime. The blue used is a very beautiful colour, and is generally laid on
                    in considerable body—it is frequently a “smalt” or deep-blue glass, coloured by
                    copper oxide, finely powdered. Red and yellow ochre, carbon-black, and powdered
                    chalk-white are most largely used. Though in the paintings of animals and birds
                    considerable realism is often seen (fig. 7), yet for human figures certain
                    conventional colours are employed, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> white for
                    females’ flesh, red for the males, or black to indicate people of negro race.
                    Heads are painted in profile, and little or no shading is used. Considerable
                    knowledge of harmony is shown in the arrangement of the colours; and otherwise
                    harsh combinations of tints are skilfully softened and brought into keeping by
                    thin separating lines of white or yellow. Though at first sight the general
                    colouring, if seen in a museum, may appear crude and gaudy, yet it should be
                    remembered that the internal paintings were much softened by the very dim light
                    that was sparingly <pb break="no"

                    outside were subdued by contrast with the brilliant blue sky and glowing
                    sunshine under which they were always seen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    p. 645) supply the only existing specimens of their mural painting; and, unlike
                    the tombs of Egypt, only a small proportion appear to have been decorated in
                    this way. The actual dates of these paintings are very uncertain, but they range
                    possibly from about the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> down to
                    almost the Christian era. The tombs which possess these paintings are mostly
                    square-shaped rooms, with slightly-arched or gabled roofs, excavated in soft
                    sandstone or tufa hillsides. The earlier ones show distinct Egyptian influence
                    alike in drawing and in composition: they are very broadly designed with flat
                    unshaded tints, the faces in profile, except the eyes, which are drawn as if
                    seen in front. Colours, as in Egypt, are used conventionally—male flesh red,
                    white or pale yellow for the females, black for demons. In one respect these
                    paintings differ from those of the Egyptians; very few colours are used—red,
                    brown, and yellow ochres, carbon-black, lime or chalk-white, and occasionally
                    blue are the only pigments. The rock-walls are prepared by being covered with a
                    thin skin of lime stucco, and lime or chalk is mixed in small quantities with
                    all the colours; hence the restriction to “earth pigments,” made doubly
                    necessary by the constant dampness of these subterranean chambers. The process
                    employed was in fact a kind of <hi rend="italic">fresco,</hi> though the stucco
                    ground was not applied in small patches only sufficient for the day’s work the
                    dampness of the rock was enough to keep the stucco skin moist, and so allow the
                    necessary infiltration of colour from the surface. Many of these paintings when
                    first discovered were quite fresh in tint and uninjured by time, but they are
                    soon dulled by exposure to light. In the course of centuries great changes of
                    style naturally took place; the early Egyptian influence, probably brought to
                    Etruria through the Phoenician traders, was succeeded by an even more
                    strongly-marked Greek influence—at first archaic and stiff, then developing into
                    great beauty of drawing, and finally yielding to the Roman spirit, as the
                    degradation of Greek art advanced under their powerful but inartistic Roman
                    conquerors.</p>
                <p>Throughout this succession of styles—Egyptian, Greek, and Graeco-Roman—there runs
                    a distinct undercurrent of individuality due to the Etruscans themselves. This
                    appears not only in the drawing but also in the choice of subjects. In addition
                    to pictures of banquets with musicians and dancers, hunting and racing scenes,
                    the workshops of different craftsmen and other domestic subjects, all thoroughly
                    Hellenic in sentiment, other paintings occur which are very un-Greek in feeling.
                    These represent the judgment and punishment of souls in a future life. Mantus,
                    Charun, and other infernal deities of the Rasena, hideous in aspect and armed
                    with hammers, or furies, depicted as black bearded demons winged and brandishing
                    live snakes, terrify or torture shrinking human souls. Others, and not the
                    earliest in date, represent human sacrifices, such as those at the tomb of
                    Patroclus— a class of subjects which, though Homeric, appears but rarely to have
                    been selected by Greek painters. The constant import into Etruria of large
                    quantities of fine Greek painted vases appears to have largely contributed to
                    keep up the supremacy of Hellenic influence during many cen turies, and by their
                    artistic superiority to have prevented the development of a more original and
                    native school of art. Though we now know Etruscan painting only from the tombs,
                    yet Pliny mentions <hi rend="italic">(H. E</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    r</hi><hi rend="italic">.,</hi> xxxv. 3) that fine wall-paintings existed in his
                    time, with colours yet fresh, on the walls of ruined temples at Ardea and
                    Lanuvium, executed, he says, before the founding of Rome. As before mentioned,
                    the actual dates of the existing paintings are very uncertain. It cannot
                    therefore be positively asserted that any existing specimens are much older than
                    600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> though some, especially at Veii, certainly
                    appear to have the characteristics of more remote antiquity. The most important
                    of these paintings have been discovered in the cemeteries of Veii, Caere,
                    Tarquinii, Vulci, Cervetri, and other Etruscan cities.<note anchored="true"

                    although Strabo, Pliny, Pausanias, and others have left us minute descriptions
                    of Greek paintings and ample accounts of painters and styles, yet of the
                    pictures themselves almost nothing now remains. Even in Egypt the use of colour
                    does not appear to have been more universal than it was among the Greeks, who
                    applied it freely to their marble statues and reliefs, the whole of their
                    buildings inside and out, as well as for the decoration of flat wall-surfaces.
                    They appear to have cared but little for pure form, and not to have valued the
                    delicate ivory-like tint and beautiful texture of their fine Pentelic and Parian
                    marbles, except as a ground for coloured ornament. A whole class of artists,
                    called αγαλ/ζάτων eγκaυ&lt;rτai, were occupied in colouring marble sculpture,
                    and the⅛ services were very highly valued.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    cases, probably for the sake of hiding the joints and getting a more absorbent
                    surface, the marble, however pure and fine in texture, was covered with a thin
                    skin of stucco made of mixed lime and powdered marble. Among the extremely rare
                    specimens of Greek painting still existing, the most important is an alabaster
                    sarcophagus, found in a tomb near Corneto, and now in the Etruscan museum at
                    Florence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="italic">Mon. Inst. Arch.,</hi> Rome, ix. plate 60.</p></note> This is
                    decorated outside with very beautiful and purely Greek paintings, executed on a
                    stucco skin as hard and smooth as the alabaster itself. The pictures represent
                    combats of the Greeks and Amazons, drawn with marvellous beauty of outline and
                    grace of movement and composition. The colouring, though rather brilliant, is
                    very simply treated, and the figures are kept strictly to one plane without any
                    attempt at complicated perspective. Other most valuable specimens of Greek art,
                    found at Herculaneum and now in the Naples museum, are some small paintings, one
                    of girls playing with dice, another of Theseus and the Minotaur. These are
                    painted with miniature-like delicacy on the bare surface of marble slabs; they
                    are almost monochromatic, and are of the highest beauty both in drawing and in
                    their skilfully-modelled gradations of shadow— quite unlike any of the Greek
                    vase-paintings. The first-mentioned painting is signed ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΣ ΑΘΗΝΑΙΟΣ. It
                    is probable that the strictly archaic paintings of the Greeks, such as those of
                    Polygnotus in the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> executed with few

                    with caution. He was neither a scientific archaeologist nor a practical

                    imitators the Romans used the names of colours, it appears that they paid more
                    attention to <hi rend="italic">tones</hi> and <hi rend="italic">relations</hi>
                    of colour than to actual hues. Thus most Greek and Latin colour-names are now
                    quite untranslatable. Homer’s “wine-like sea” (oΓvo^), Sophocles’s
                    “wine-coloured ivy” <hi rend="italic">(Oed.</hi><hi rend="italic">Col.),</hi>
                    and Horace’s “purpureus olor” probably refer less to what we should call colour
                    than to the chromatic strength of the various objects and their more or less
                    strong powers of reflecting light, either in motion or when at rest. Nor have we
                    any word like Virgil’s “flavus,” which could be applied both to a lady’s hair
                    and to the leaf of an olive-tree.z<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>So also a meaning unlike ours is attached to Greek technical
                    words —by τ6vos they meant, not “tone,” but the gradations of light and shade,

                <p>During the best periods of Greek art the favourite classes of subjects were
                    scenes from poetry, especially Homer, and contemporary history. The names <hi
                    rend="italic">πινακοθήκη</hi> and <hi rend="italic">στοά ποικίλη</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vferQ</hi> given to many public buildings from their walls being
                    covered with paintings. Additional interest was given to the historical subjects
                    by the introduction of portraits; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the great
                    picture of the battle of Marathon (490 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> on the
                    walls of the <hi rend="italic">στοά ποικίλη</hi> in Athens, portraits were given
                    of the Greek generals Miltiades, Callimachus, and others. This picture was
                    painted about forty years after the battle by Polygnotus and Micon. One of the
                    earliest pictures recorded by Pliny (xxxv. 8) represented a battle of the
                    Magnesians (c. 716 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>); it was painted by Bularchus,
                    a Lydian artist, and bought at a high price by King Candaules. Many other
                    important Greek historical paintings are mentioned by Pausanias and earlier
                    writers. The Pompeian mosaic of the defeat of the Persians by Alexander is
                    probably a Romanized copy from some celebrated Greek painting; it obviously was
                    not designed for mosaic work.</p>
                <p>Landscape painting appears to have been unknown among the Greeks, even as a
                    background to figure subjects. The poems especially of Homer and Sophocles show
                    that this was not through want of appreciation of the beauties of nature, but
                    partly, probably, because the main object of Greek painting was to tell some
                    definite story, and also from their just sense of artistic fitness, which
                    prevented them from attempting in their mural decorations to disguise the flat
                    solidity of the walls by necessarily delusive effects of aerial perspective and
                    distance.</p>
                <p>It is interesting to note that even in the time of Alexander the Great the
                    somewhat archaic works of the earlier painters were still highly appreciated. In
                    particular Aristotle gives high praise to Polygnotus, both for his power of
                    combining truth with idealization in his portraits and for his skill in
                    depicting men’s mental characteristics; on this account he calls him <hi
                    rend="italic">ο ηθογράφος.</hi> Lucian too is no less enthusiastic, and praises
                    Polygnotus alike for his grace, drawing, and colouring. Later painters, such as
                    Zeuxis and Apelles, appear to have produced easel pictures more than mural
                    paintings, and these, being easy to move, were mostly carried off to Rome by the
                    early emperors. Hence Pausanias, who visited Greece in the time of Hadrian,
                    mentions but few works of the later artists. Owing to the lack of existing
                    specimens of Greek painting it would be idle to attempt an account of their
                    technical methods, but no doubt those employed by the Romans described below
                    were derived with the rest of their art from the Greeks. Speaking of their
                    stucco, Pliny refers its superiority over that made by the Romans to the fact
                    that it was always made of lime at least three years old, and that it was well
                    mixed and pounded in a mortar before being laid on the wall; he is here speaking
                    of the thick stucco in many coats, not of the thin skin mentioned above as being
                    laid on marble.</p>
                <p>Greek mural painting, like their sculpture, was chiefly used to decorate temples
                    and public buildings, and comparatively rarely either for tombs<note

                    strict self-restraint and due subordination to their architectural surroundings
                    which we see so strongly marked in all Greek sculpture of the best periods.<note

                    of Roman mural paintings now exist, of which by far the greatest quantity was
                    discovered in the private houses and baths of Pompeii, nearly all dating between
                    63 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> when the city was ruined by an earthquake,
                    and 79 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> when it was buried by Vesuvius. A
                    catalogue of these and similar paintings from Herculaneum and Stabiae, compiled
                    by Professor Helbig, comprises 1966 specimens. The excavations in the baths of
                    Titus and other ancient buildings in Rome, made in the early part of the 16th
                    century, excited the keenest interest and admiration among the painters of that
                    time, and very largely influenced the later art of the Renaissance. These
                    paintings, especially the “grotesques” or fanciful patterns of scroll-work and
                    pilasters mixed with semi-realistic foliage and figures of boys, animals, and
                    birds, designed with great freedom of touch and inventive power, seem to have
                    thoroughly fascinated Raphael during his later period, and many of his pupils
                    and contemporaries. The “loggie” of the Vatican and of the Farnesina palace are
                    full of carefully-studied 16th-century reproductions of these highly-decorative
                    paintings. Of late years the excavations on the Palatine and in the garden of
                    the Farnesina in Rome have brought to light some mural paintings of the 1st
                    century of our era, perhaps superior in execution even to the best of the
                    Pompeian series.</p>
                <p>The range of subjects found in Roman mural paintings is very large — mythology,
                    religious ceremonies, genre, still life, and even landscape (the latter
                    generally on a small scale, and treated in an artificial and purely decorative
                    way), and lastly history. Pliny mentions several large and important historical
                    paintings, such as those with which Valerius Maximus Messala decorated the walls
                    of the Curia Hostilia, to commemorate his own victory over Hiero II. and the
                    Carthaginians in Sicily in the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The
                    earliest Roman painting recorded by Pliny was by Fabius, sumamed Pictor, on the
                    walls of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n51/mode/1up"

                <p>Unfortunately no existing Roman paintings seem to be earlier in date than the
                    Christian era, and all belong to a period of decline in art. Pliny (xxxv. 1)
                    laments the fact that the wealthy Romans of his time preferred the costly
                    splendours of marble and porphyry wall-linings to the more artistic decoration
                    of paintings by good artists. Historical painting seems then to have gone out of
                    fashion; among the numerous specimens now existing very few from</p>
                <p>Pompeii represent historical subjects; one has the scene of Masinissa and
                    Sophonisba before Scipio, and another of a riot between the people of Pompeii
                    and Nocera, which happened 59 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>Mythological scenes, chiefly from Greek sources, occur most frequently: the myths
                    of Eros and Dionysus are especial favourites. Only five or six relate to purely
                    Roman mythology. We have reason to think that some at least of the Pompeian
                    pictures are copies, probably at third or fourth hand, from celebrated Greek
                    originals. The frequently repeated subjects of Medea meditating the murder of
                    her children and Iphigenia at the shrine of the Tauric Artemis suggest that the
                    motive and composition were taken from the celebrated originals of these
                    subjects by Timanthes. Those of Io and Argus, the finest example of which is in
                    the Palatine “villa of Livia,” and of Andromeda and Perseus, often repeated on
                    Pompeian walls, may be from the originals by Nicias.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Newton, <hi rend="italic">Leet, on
                    Painting of the Ancients,</hi> 1882.</p></note></p>
                <p>In many cases these mural paintings are of high artistic merit, though they are
                    probably not the work of the most distinguished painters of the time, but rather
                    of a humbler class of decorators, who reproduced, without much original
                    invention, stock designs out of some pattern-book. They are, however, all
                    remarkable for the rapid skill and extreme “verve” and freedom of hand with
                    which the designs are, as it were, flung on to the walls with few but very
                    effective touches. Though in some cases the motive and composition are superior
                    to the execution, yet many of the paintings are remarkable both ’ for their
                    realistic truth and technical skill. The great painting of Ceres from Pompeii,
                    now in the Naples museum, is a work of the highest merit—the simple grandeur of
                    the drawing and the delicate modelling of the flesh, executed in the easiest and
                    most direct manner possible, are alike admirable. The round juiciness of the
                    fruit in her basket, rapidly painted with a few telling strokes of the brush,
                    recalls to mind in effect, though not in execution, the startling realism of the
                    Dutch painters of still life, who laboured painfully to gain the effect produced
                    with such rapidity and ease by the Roman artist. Fig. 8, from a Pompeian
                    picture, is a fine example of good modelling of flesh.</p>
                <p>In the usual scheme of decoration the broad wall-surfaces are broken up into a
                    series of panels by pilasters, columns, or other architectural forms. Some of
                    the panels contain pictures with figure-subjects; others have conventional
                    ornament, or hanging festoons of fruit and flowers. The lower part of the λvall
                    is painted one plain colour, forming a dado; the upper part sometimes has a
                    well-designed frieze of flowing ornaments. In the better class of painted walls
                    the whole is kept flat in treatment, and is free from too great subdivision, but
                    in many cases great want of taste is shown by the introduction of violent
                    effects of architectural perspective, and the space is broken up in a
                    disagreeable way by complicated schemes of design, studded with pictures in
                    varying scales which have but little relation to their surroundings. The
                    colouring is on the whole very pleasant and harmonious—quite unlike the usual
                    chromolithographic copies. Black, yellow, or a rich deep red are the favourite
                    colours for the main ground of the walls, the pictures in the panels being
                    treated separately, each with its Own background.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Technical Methods of the Romans.—</hi> Much has been written on
                    this subject, and the most varying opinions have been expressed. The real fact
                    appears to be that several methods were employed in each painting. First, the
                    ground of the required colour was laid on while the stucco was still moist. This
                    ground therefore was true fresco or “fresco buono.” On this, when dry, the
                    various pictures and ornaments were painted in tempera. That the pictures
                    themselves were not in true fresco is shown: (1) because the coloured ground
                    always exists <hi rend="italic">under</hi> the pictures; (2) by the wide
                    distances apart of the “fresco edges” or joinings in the stucco, showing that a
                    much larger area of stucco was applied at once than could have been covered with
                    the frequently elaborate paintings before the stucco was dry; (3) by the fact
                    that many of the brilliant pigments were not such as could have been used upon
                    moist stucco. The next point is how these tempera paintings on the fresco ground
                    were <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> so as to last for nearly eighteen hundred
                    years uninjured by the damp which necessarily soaked through into the soil and
                    ashes in which they were buried. This was probably effected by the ‘ ‘

                    the face of the wall till, bit by bit, all the wax disappeared from the surface
                    and soaked thoroughly into the absorbent stucco,—thus fixing the pigments with a
                    vehicle that could stand the effects of damp. This application of hot wax
                    appears to have been repeated more than once. The extreme smoothness of the
                    fresco ground <hi rend="italic">under</hi> the tempera pictures seems to show
                    that the ground itself was both waxed and polished <hi rend="italic">before</hi>
                    the pictures were painted over it. By another method of encaustic the pigments
                    themselves were mixed with hot wax, probably rendered more fluid and easy to
                    work by the addition of some mineral · spirit or essential oil. The final
                    application of heat to the painted surface blended the colours together and
                    fixed them on and into the absorbent stucco ground. Vitruvius (vii. 9) describes
                    the former process, in which the wax was applied after the colours were laid on
                    the wall. According to him this was necessary in order to prevent the painted
                    surface becoming patchy, especially in the case of the red ground made of
                    vermilion, an oxide of mercury. This, as well as the evidence of the paintings
                    themselves, shows that Pliny is mistaken in asserting that encaustic work could
                    not be used for walls.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Vitruvius (vii.) also gives an interesting account of the great care that was
                    needed in preparing stucco for painting. Three coats of old slaked lime and sand
                    were first to be laid, and then three more coats mixed with pounded white
                    marble, each coat of more finely powdered marble than the one beneath; the last
                    coat was to be polished till it gave a reflexion like a mirror. Damp or external
                    walls were to be built hollow, and the cavity ventilated; this was sometimes
                    done, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the Palatine villa, by facing the wall
                    inside with hollow bricks or tiles, on which the stucco was laid. Vitruvius, who
                    probably died shortly before the Christian era, laments the decay of taste in
                    his time, much as Pliny does; he specially deprecates the use of gaudy red.

                    incongruities are made to support heavy cornices and roofs of buildings. He
                    complains also of the novel taste for expensive but inartistic colours, such as
                    purple and azure.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gell

                    in Italy.—</hi> A very interesting series of these exists in various catacombs,
                    especially those of Rome and Naples. They are of great value, both as an
                    important link in the history of art and also as throwing considerable light on
                    the mental· state of the early Christians, which was distinctly influenced by
                    the older faith. Thus in the earlier paintings of about the 4th century we find
                    Christ represented as a beardless youth, beautiful as the artist could make him,
                    with a lingering tradition of Greek idealization, in no degree like the “Man of
                    Sorrows” of mediaeval painters, but rather a kind of genius of Christianity in
                    whose fair outward form the peace and purity of the new faith were visibly
                    symbolized, just as certain distinct attributes were typified in the persons of
                    the gods of ancient Greece. The favourite early subject, Christ the Good
                    Shepherd (fig. 9), is represented as Orpheus playing on his lyre to a circle of
                    beasts, the pagan origin of the picture being shown unmistakably by the Phrygian
                    cap and by the presence of lions, panthers, and other incongruous animals among
                    the listening sheep. In other cases Christ is depicted standing with a sheep
                    borne on his shoulders like Hermes Criophoros or Hermes Psychopompos—favourite
                    Greek subjects, especially the former, a statue of which Pausanias (ix. 22)
                    mentions as existing at Tanagra in Bceotia. Here again the pagan origin of the
                    type is shown by the presence in the catacomb paintings of the pan-pipes and
                    pedum, special attributes of Hermes, but quite foreign to the notion of Christ.
                    Though in a degraded form, a good deal survives in some of these paintings,
                    especially in the earlier ones, of the old classical grace of composition and
                    beauty of drawing, notably in the above-mentioned representations where old
                    models were copied without any adaptation to their new meaning. Those of the 5th
                    and 6th centuries still follow the classical lines, though in a rapidly
                    deteriorating style, until the introduction of a foreign—the Byzantine—element,
                    which created a fresh starting-point on quite different lines. The old
                    naturalism and survival of classical freedom of drawing is replaced by stiff,
                    conventionally hieratic types, very superior in dignity and strength to the
                    feeble and spiritless compositions produced by the extreme degradation into
                    which the native art of Rome had fallen. The designs of this second period of
                    Christian art are very similar to those of the mosaics, such as many at Ravenna,
                    and also to the magnificently illuminated MSS. on which the utmost skill and
                    labour of the time were lavished. For some centuries there was but little change
                    or development in this Byzantine style of art, so that it is impossible in most
                    cases to be sure from mere internal evidence of the date of any painting. This
                    to some extent applies also to the works of the earlier or pagan school, though,
                    roughly speaking, it may be said that the least meritorious pictures are the
                    latest in date.</p>
                <p>These catacomb paintings range over a long space of time j some may possibly be
                    of the 1st or 2d century, e.y., those in the cemetery of Domitilla, Rome; others
                    are as late as the 9th century, e.y., some full-length figures of St Cornelius
                    and St Cyprian in the catacomb of St Callixtus, under which earlier paintings
                    may be traced. In execution they somewhat resemble the Etruscan tombpaintings;
                    the walls of the catacomb passages and chambers, excavated in soft tufa, are
                    covered with a thin skin of white stucco, and on that the mural and ceiling
                    paintings are simply executed in earth colours. The favourite subjects of the
                    earliest paintings are scenes from the Old Testament which were supposed to
                    typify events in the life of Christ, such as the sacrifice of Isaac (Christ’s
                    death), Jonah and the whale (the resurrection), Moses striking the rock, or
                    pointing to the manna (Christ the water of life, and the Eucharist), and many
                    others. The later paintings deal more with later subjects, either events <pb

                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> the miracles they performed. A very fine series of
                    these exists in the lower church of S. Clemente in Rome, apparently dating from
                    the 6th to the 10th centuries; among these are representations of the passion
                    and death of Christ—subjects never chosen by the earlier Christians, except as
                    dimly foreshadowed by the Old Testament types. When Christ Himself is depicted
                    in the early catacomb paintings it is in glory and power, not in His human
                    weakness and suffering.</p>
                <p>Other early Italian paintings exist on the walls of the church of the Tre Fontane
                    near Rome, and in the Capella di S. Urbano alia Caffarella, executed in the
                    early part of the 11th century. The atrium of S. Lorenzo fuori le mura, Rome,
                    and the church of the Quattro Santi Incoronati have mural paintings of the first
                    half of the 13th century, which show no artistic improvement over those at S.
                    Clemente four or five centuries older.</p>
                <p>It was not in fact till the second half of the 13th century that stiff
                    traditional Byzantine forms and colouring began to be superseded by the revival
                    of native art in Italy by the painters of Florence, Pisa, and Siena (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fresco).</hi> During the first thirteen centuries of the
                    Christian era mural painting appears to have been for the most part confined to
                    the representation of sacred subjects. It is remarkable that during the earlier
                    centuries council after council of the Christian church forbade the painting of
                    figure-subjects, and especially those of any Person of the Trinity; but it was
                    quite in vain. The double desire, both for the artistic effect of painted walls
                    and for the religious teaching afforded by the pictorial representation of
                    sacred scenes and the celebration of the sacraments, was too strong. In spite of
                    the zeal of bishops and others, who sometimes with their own hands defaced the
                    pictures of Christ on the walls of the churches, in spite of threats of
                    excommunication, the forbidden paintings by degrees became more numerous, till
                    the walls of almost every church throughout Christendom were decorated with
                    whole series of pictured stories. The useless prohibition was becoming obsolete
                    when, towards the end of the 4th century, the learned Paulinus, bishop of Nola,
                    ordered the two basilicas which he had built at Fondi and Nola to be adorned
                    with wall-paintings of sacred subjects, with the special object, as he says, of
                    instructing and refining the ignorant and drunken people. These painted
                    histories were in fact the books of the unlearned, and we can now hardly realize
                    their value and importance as the chief mode of religious teaching in ages when
                    none but the clergy could read or write.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    before among the ancient Greeks, coloured decoration was used in the widest
                    possible manner, not only for the adornment of fiat walls, but also for the
                    enrichment of sculpture and all the fittings and architectural features of
                    buildings, whether the material to be painted was plaster, stone, marble, or
                    wood. It was only the damp and frosts of northern climates that to some extent
                    limited the external use of colour to the less exposed parts of the outsides of
                    buildings. The varying tints and texture of smoothly-worked stone appear to have
                    given no pleasure to the mediaeval eye; and in the rare cases in which the
                    poverty of some country church prevented its walls from being adorned with
                    painted ornaments or pictures the whole surface of the stone-work inside,
                    mouldings and carving as well as flat wall-spaces, was covered with a thin coat
                    of whitewash. Internal rough stonework was invariably concealed by stucco,
                    forming a smooth ground for possible future paintings. Unhappily the ignorant
                    barbarity of the 19th century has in the case of most English cathedrals and
                    parish churches stripped off the internal plaster, often laying bare rubble
                    walls of the roughest description, never meant to be exposed, and has scraped
                    and rubbed the surface of the masonry and mouldings down to the bare stone. In
                    this way a great proportion of mural paintings have been destroyed, though many
                    in a more or less mutilated state still exist in England. It is difficult (and
                    doubly so since the so-called “restoration” of most old buildings) to realize
                    the splendour of effect once possessed by every important mediaeval church. From
                    the tiled floor to the roof all was one mass of gold and colour. The brilliance
                    of the mural paintings and richly-coloured sculpture and mouldings was in
                    harmony with the splendour of the oak-work—screens, stalls, and roofs— all
                    richly decorated with gilding and painting, while the light, passing through
                    stained glass, softened and helped to combine the whole into one even mass of
                    extreme decorative effect. Colour, and not in dull tints, was boldly applied
                    everywhere, and thus the patchy effect was avoided which is so often the result
                    of the modern timid and partial use of painted ornament. Even the
                    figure-sculpture was painted in a strong and realistic manner, sometimes by a
                    wax encaustic process, probably the same as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >circumlitio</hi> of classical times. In the accounts for expenses in decorating
                    Orvieto cathedral wax is a frequent item among the materials used for painting.
                    In one place it is specially mentioned that wax was supplied to Andrea Pisano
                    (in 1345) for the decoration of the beautiful reliefs in white marble on the
                    lower part of the west front.</p>

                    16th century the lower part of the walls, generally 6 to 8 feet from the floor,
                    was painted with a dado—the favourite patterns till the 13th century being
                    either a sort of sham masonry with a flower in each rectangular space (fig. 10),
                    or a conventional, representation of a curtain with regular folds stiffly
                    treated (Plate I.).</p>
                <p>Above this dado ranges of pictures with figure-subjects were painted in tiers one
                    above the other, each picture frequently surrounded by a painted frame with arch
                    and gable of architectural design. Painted bands of chevron or other geometrical
                    ornament till the 13th century, and flowing ornament afterwards, usually divide
                    the tiers of pictures horizontally and form the top and bottom boundaries of the
                    dado. In the case of a church, the end walls usually have figures to a larger
                    scale. On the east wall of the nave over the chancel arch there was generally a
                    large painting of the “Doom” or Last Judgment. One of the commonest subjects is
                    a colossal figure of St Christopher (fig. 11), usually on the nave wall opposite
                    the principal entrance,—selected because the sight of a picture of this saint
                    was supposed to bring good luck for the rest of the <pb break="no"

                    of the windows and on the piers and soffit of the arches, especially that
                    opening into the chancel.</p>
                <p>The little Norman church at Kempley in Gloucestershire (date about 1100) has
                    perhaps the best-preserved specimen of the complete early decoration of a
                    chancel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="italic">Archaeologia,</hi> vol. xlvi., 1880.</p></note> The north and
                    south walls are occupied by figures of the twelve apostles in architectural
                    niches, six on each side. The east wall had single figures of saints at the
                    sides of the central window, and the stone barrel vault is covered with a
                    representation of St John’s apocalyptic vision— Christ in majesty surrounded by
                    the evangelistic beasts, the seven candlesticks, and other figures. The chancel
                    arch itself and the jambs and mouldings of the windows have stiff geometrical
                    designs, and over the arch, towards the nave, is a large picture of the “Doom.”
                    The whole scheme is very complete, no part of the internal plaster or stone-work
                    being undecorated with colour. Though the drawing is rude, the figures and their
                    drapery are treated broadly and with dignity. Simple earth colours are used,
                    painted in tempera on a plain white ground, which covers alike both the plaster
                    of the rough walls and the smooth stone of the arches and jambs.</p>
                <p>In the 13th century the painters of England reached a very high point of artistic
                    power and technical skill, so much so that at that time paintings were produced
                    by native artists quite equal, if not superior, to those of the same period
                    anywhere on the Continent, not excepting even Italy. The central paintings on
                    the walls of the chapter-house and on the retable of the high altar of
                    Westminster Abbey are not surpassed by any of the smaller works even of such men
                    as Cimabue and Duccio di Buoninsegna, who were living when these Westminster
                    paintings were executed. Unhappily, partly through the poverty and anarchy
                    brought about by the French wars and the Wars of the Roses, the development of
                    art in England made but little progress after the beginning of the 14th century,
                    and it was not till a time when the renaissance of art in Italy had fallen into
                    a state of degradation and decay that its influence reached the British shores.
                    In the 15th century some very beautiful and noble work, somewhat affected by
                    Flemish influence, was produced in England (fig. 12), chiefly in the form of
                    figures painted on the oak panels of chancel and chapel screens, especially in
                    Norfolk and Suffolk; but, fine as many of these are, they cannot be said to
                    rival in any sense the works of the Van Eycks and other painters of that time in
                    Flanders. To return to the 13th century, the culminating period of English art
                    in painting and sculpture, much was owed to Henry III.’s love for and patronage
                    of the fine arts; he employed a large number of painters to decorate his various
                    castles and palaces, especially the palace of Westminster, one large hall of
                    which was known as the “painted chamber” from the rows of fine pictures with
                    which its walls were covered. After the 13th century the “masonry pattern” was
                    disused for the lower parts of walls, and the chevrony and other stiff patterns
                    for the borders were replaced by more flowing designs (Plate I.). The character
                    of the painted figures became less monumental in style; greater freedom of
                    drawing and treatment was adopted, and they cease in any way to recall the
                    archaic majesty and grandeur of the Byzantine mosaics. A detailed description of
                    the development of the successive styles of mural painting would be almost a
                    complete history of English art, which space does not allow here, but it may be
                    noted that during the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0055-0046"/> 14th century wall-spaces unoccupied by
                    figure-subjects were often covered by graceful flowing patterns, drawn with
                    great freedom of hand and rather avoiding geometrical repetition. Fig. 13, from
                    the church of Stanley St Leonard’s, Gloucestershire, is a good characteristic
                    specimen of 14th-century decoration; it is on the walls of the chancel, filling
                    up the spaces between the painted figures; the flowers are blue, and the lines
                    red on a white ground. In some cases the motive of the design is taken from
                    encaustic tiles, as at Bengeo Church, Herts, where the wall is divided into
                    squares, each containing an heraldic lion. This imitative notion occurs during
                    all periods—masonry, hanging curtains, tiles, and architectural features such as
                    niches and canopies being very frequently represented, though always in a simple
                    decorative fashion with no attempt at actual deception,—not probably from any
                    fixed principle that shams were wrong, but because the good taste of the
                    mediaeval painters taught them that a flat unrealistic treatment gave the best
                    and most decorative effect. Thus in the 15th and 16th centuries the commonest
                    forms of un pictorial wall-decoration were various patterns taken from the
                    beautiful damasks and cut velvets of Sicily, Florence, Genoa, and other places
                    in Italy, some form of the “pine-apple” or rather “artichoke” pattern being the
                    favourite (fig. 14), a design which, developed partly from Oriental sources, and
                    coming to perfection at the end of the 15th century, was copied and reproduced
                    in textiles, printed stuffs, and wall-papers with but little change down to the
                    present century,—a remarkable instance of survival in design. Fig. 15 is a
                    specimen of 15th-century English decorative painting, copied from a 14th-century
                    Sicilian silk damask. Diapers, powderings with flowers, sacred monograms, and
                    sprays of blossom were frequently used to ornament large surfaces in a simple
                    way. Many of these are extremely beautiful (fig. 16).</p>

                    A useful though necessarily incomplete list of English mediaeval mural paintings
                    has been published by the Science and Art Depart., S. Kens. Mus. Fresh
                    wall-paintings are constantly being discovered under later coats of whitewash,
                    so that any list needs frequent additions.</p></note> In the selection of saints
                    for paintings in England, those of English origin are naturally most frequently
                    represented, and different districts had certain local favourites.</p>
                <p>St Thomas of Canterbury was one of the most widely popular; but few examples now
                    remain, owing to Henry VIII.’s special dislike to this saint and the strict
                    orders that were issued for all pictures of him to be destroyed. For a similar
                    reason most paintings of saintly popes were obliterated.</p>

                    the 13th century mural paintings appear to have been executed in the most simple
                    way, in tempera mainly with earth colours applied on dry stucco; even when a

                    discovered in England. In the 13th century, and perhaps earlier, oil was
                    commonly used both as a medium for the pigments and also to make a varnish to
                    cover and fix tempera paintings. Vasari’s statement as to the discovery of the
                    use of oil-medium by the Van Eycks is certainly untrue, but it probably has a
                    germ of truth. The Van Eycks introduced the use of <hi rend="italic">dryers</hi>
                    of a better kind than had yet been used, and so largely extended the application
                    of oil-painting. Before their time it seems to have been the custom to dry
                    wall-paintings laboriously by the use of charcoal braziers, if they were in a
                    position where the sun could not shine upon them. This is specially recorded in
                    the valuable series of accounts for the expenses of wall-paintings in the royal
                    palace of Westminster during the reign of Henry III., printed in <hi

                <p>Two foreign painters were employed—Peter of Spain and William of Florence—at
                    sixpence a day, but the English painters seem to have done most of the work and
                    received higher pay. William, an English monk in the adjoining Benedictine abbey
                    of Westminster, received two shillings a day. Walter of Durham and various
                    members of the Otho family, royal goldsmiths and moneyers, worked for many years
                    on the adornment of Henry III.’s palace and were well paid for their skill. Some
                    fragments of paintings from the royal chapel of St Stephen are now in the
                    British Museum. They are very delicate and carefully-painted subjects from the
                    Old Testament, in rich colours, each with explanatory inscription underneath.
                    The scale is small, the figures being scarcely a foot high. Their method of
                    execution is curious. First the smooth stone wall was covered with a coat of
                    red, painted in oil, probably to keep back the damp; on that a thin skin of fine
                    gesso (stucco) has been applied, and the outlines of the figures marked with a
                    point; the whole of the background, crowns, borders of dresses, and other
                    ornamental parts have then been modelled and stamped with very minute patterns
                    in slight relief, impressed on the surface of the gesso while it was yet soft.
                    The figures have then been painted, apparently in tempera, gold leaf has been
                    applied to the stamped reliefs, and the whole has been covered with an oil
                    varnish. It is difficult to realize the amount of patience and labour required
                    to cover large halls such as the above chapel and the “painted chamber,” the
                    latter about 83 feet by 27, with this minute and gorgeous style of
                    decoration.</p>
                <p>In many cases the grounds were entirely covered with shining metal leaf, over
                    which the paintings were executed; those parts, such as the draperies, where the
                    metallic lustre was wanted, were painted in oil with transparent colours, while
                    the flesh was painted in opaque tempera. The effect of the bright metal shining
                    through the rich colouring is very magnificent. This extreme minuteness of much
                    of the mediaeval wall - decoration is very remarkable. Large wall-surfaces and
                    intricate mouldings were often completely covered by elaborate gesso patterns in
                    relief of almost microscopic delicacy (fig. 17). The cost öf stamps for this is
                    among the items in the Westminster accounts. These patterns when set and dry
                    were further adorned with gold and colours in the most laborious way. So also
                    with the architectural painting; the artist was not content simply to pick out
                    the various members of the mouldings in different colours, but he also
                    frequently covered each bead or fillet with painted flowers and other patterns,
                    as delicate as those in an illuminated MS.,—so minute and highly-finished that
                    they are almost invisible at a little distance, but yet add greatly to the
                    general richness of effect. All this is completely neglected in modern
                    reproductions of mediaeval painting, in which both touch and colour are alike
                    coarse and harsh—mere caricatures of the old work, such as unhappily disfigure
                    the Sainte Chapelle in Paris, and many cathedrals in France, Germany, and
                    England. Gold was never used in large quantities without the ground on which it
                    was laid being broken up by some such delicate reliefs as that shown in fig. 17,
                    so its effect was never gaudy or dazzling.</p>
                <p>Mural painting in England fell into disuse in the 16 th century. For domestic
                    purposes wood panelling, stamped leather, and tapestry were chiefly used as
                    wall-coverings. In the reign of Henry VIII., probably in part through Holbein’s
                    influence, a rather coarse sort of tempera wall-painting, German in style,
                    appears to have been common.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>A good example of arabesque painting of this period in black and white, rudely
                    though boldly drawn and very Holbeinesque in character, was discovered in 1881
                    behind the panelling in one of the canons’ houses at Westminster. Other examples
                    exist at Haddon Hall (Derbyshire) and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Several attempts have been made in the present century to revive the art of
                    monumental wall-decoration, but mostly, like those in the new Houses of
                    Parliament, unsuccessful both in method and design. A large wall-painting by Sir
                    Frederick Leighton of the Arts of War, on a wall in the South Kensington Museum,
                    is much disfigured by the disagreeable gravelly surface of the stucco. The
                    process employed is that invented by Mr Gambier Parry, and called by him “spirit
                    fresco.” A very fine series of mural paintings has been executed by Mr Madox
                    Brown on the walls of the Manchester town-hall. These also are painted in Mr
                    Parry’s “spirit fresco,” but on a smooth stucco surface, free from the
                    unpleasant granular appearance of the South Kensington picture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Mediaeval Wall-Paintings of the Continent.—</hi> In the
                    main the above remarks on English mural decoration apply equally to that of
                    France, Germany, and Scandinavia. Though each of these countries had certain
                    peculiarities of style, mostly slight and unimportant, yet in method of
                    execution, choice and arrangement of subjects, and division of the wall-spaces
                    there is a very close similarity between them all. Italy, on the other hand,
                    developed a style of her own, more purely pictorial, with less regard to the
                    exigencies of architecture. In northern lands the mural paintings were strictly
                    subordinate to the main features of the structure for which they were designed,
                    while in Italy as a rule the architect did but little to decorate the interior
                    of his buildings, and left the painter free to treat the walls as he
                    pleased.</p>
                <p>The very close similarity of the mural decoration in the churches of Sweden to
                    those of England is very remarkable, and some of the Swedish churches have very
                    magnificent and well-preserved schemes of decoration, covering walls and
                    ceilings alike, of dates varying from the 13th to the 15th centuries, all of
                    which have little or nothing to distinguish them from contemporary work in
                    England. Man-delgren’s <hi rend="italic">Monuments</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Scandinaves</hi> (1862) has well-executed reproductions of some of the best of
                    these, especially the fine and complete specimens in the churches of Bjeresjoe,

                    these, the north chancel wall of the church of Räda, 13th century, has been
                    selected (Plate I.) as a good and characteristic example of the treatment of a
                    large wall-space in the 14th century; the dado of painted curtain-folds, the
                    tiers of single life-size figures in architectural niches treated with great
                    breadth and decorative skill, and the band below of subjects on a rather smaller
                    scale give a good idea of a common scheme of ecclesiastic decoration. An
                    inscription on one of these paintings gives the date of their execution as 1323.
                    The lower subject represents the death of the Virgin, above are figures of the
                    apostles, and highest of all, painted on the curved boarding of the
                    waggon-vault, are a row of seated prophets under round arches. The other
                    examples on the same plate, given as specimens of 15th-century flowing patterns,
                    are from the church of Kumbla, also in Sweden, and fully illustrated in
                    Mandel-gren’s valuable work.</p>

                    and monasteries of the Greeks mural painting is still practised very much as it
                    was in the 12th or 13th centuries.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    colouring, nor drawing, nor method has in the least altered during the last six
                    hundred years. Everything is fixed by certain unchangeable hieratic rules, and
                    the Greek painter-monk would think it impious to improve upon or deviate from
                    the artistic canons for sacred subjects handed down from century to century. For
                    this reason it is generally impossible, from internal evidence, to guess the
                    date of the interesting wall-paintings with which many churches in eastern
                    Europe, Egypt, and Asia Minor are decorated.</p>
                <p>In India and Ceylon mural painting has been largely used from very early times,
                    especially to decorate the walls of temples. Some of these appear to be executed
                    in true fresco. Birth-stories of Buddha and other sacred subjects most
                    frequently occur. As among the mediaeval and modern Greeks, the strong
                    conservatism of the Hindu races makes it difficult to judge as to the dates of
                    these paintings.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Many
                    books given under the head of “Early Christian paintings in Italy” apply also to
                    this last division. Plates and descriptions of mediaeval paintings are mostly
