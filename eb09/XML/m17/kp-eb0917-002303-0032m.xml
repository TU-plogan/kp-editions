                    Shakespearean age. In the introduction to his comedy <hi rend="italic">John a
                    Green and John a Cumber,</hi> reprinted for the Shakespeare Society, Collier
                    enumerates 47 works of which Munday was whole or part author, the subjects being
                    very various—pastoral poems, journalistic tracts and pamphlets, translations of
                    romances, plays, pageants. The most interesting remnant of this miscellaneous
                    work is a pamphlet reprinted in the Harleian Miscellany, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >English Romayne Life,</hi> a lively account of adventures among Roman Catholic
                    refugees in France and Italy. Munday’s experiences were the result of a youthful
                    escapade. Born in 1553, and the son of a London citizen of the Drapers’ Company,
                    he had early shown a restless disposition: he took to the stage for some time,
                    tried steady business for a year or two as apprentice to a stationer, tired of
                    it, put all his wealth in his purse, and set out with a companion for the
                    Continent, moved by “a desire to see strange countries as also affection to
                    learn the languages.” According to his own account, he was robbed on the way to
                    Amiens, drifted into the company of Popish refugees, and was by them forwarded
                    to Rome, where he obtained admission as a pope’s scholar to the English
                    seminary. Returning to England about 1581, and using the knowledge thus gained
                    of designs against the English Government, he was a prominent witness in the
                    trials of Campion and other English Jesuits; and, probably as a reward, was
                    appointed one of the “Messengers of Her Majesty’s Chamber.” Thereafter he wrote
                    steadily for the booksellers and the theatres, compiling religious publications,
                    putting words to popular airs, translating French romances, and so forth. Webbe
                    in 1586 praised him for his pastorals—only the title is now extant, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sweet Sobs and Amorous Complaints of Shepherds and
                    Nymphs</hi>;—and in 1598 Meres mentioned him honourably among dramatic writers
                    as “our best plotter.” Critical Ben Jonson was less complimentary, and in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Case is altered</hi> ridiculed Munday severely as “Antonio
                    Balladino, pageant poet.” Judging from the plays on the subject of Robin Hood
                    reprinted in Collier’s <hi rend="italic">Supplement to Dodsley’s Old Plays,</hi>
                    the joint work of Munday and Chettle, his Jiterary faculty was of a very
                    commonplace description, and deserved Jonson’s taunts about “stale stuff” and
                    want of character. Still Munday seems to have been in great request as .ι
                    collaborator in the last years of Elizabeth’s reign, and afterwards he wrote
                    many of the city “pageants.” He obtained repute also as an antiquary, and
                    published an enlarged edition of Stow’s <hi rend="italic">Survey of London</hi>
                    in 1618. This last work was the only literary achievement inscribed on his
                    monument in St Stephen’s church. He died 10th August 1633.</p>
