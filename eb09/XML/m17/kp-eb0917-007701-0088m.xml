                    Greek <hi rend="italic">μουσική</hi>; but this included all arts and sciences
                    over which the Muses presided—the encyclopaedia of learning. The science of
                    sounds was particularly involved in that of the stars, and hence the word had
                    special reference to these two in their relation to numbers; and in its
                    comprehensive sense it was employed to denote the entire mental training of a
                    Greek youth. In Latin the word had a more restricted meaning.</p></note> is the
                    art which employs sounds as a medium of artistic expression for what is not in
                    the province of literature, of sculpture, of painting, of acting, or of
                    architecture. Whereas literature, whether in verse or prose, describes or states
                    emotions, .or perceptions, or impressions; whereas sculpture imitates the
                    outward forms of animated beings, and physiognomically, either in the face, or,
                    to speak more broadly, in the moulding and attitude of the entire figure,
                    displays personal character and the effect of passion upon it; whereas painting
                    vitalizes with colour the forms of sculpture, and extends its range of subjects
                    from animate to inanimate nature; and whereas acting adds speech to the written
                    words of the dramatist, and enforces or even qualifies their meaning by vocal
                    inflexion, and illustrates it by changeful gesture, thus giving the mobility of
                    life to the forms of sculpture and painting;—music embodies the inward feelings
                    of which all those other arts can but exhibit the effect. Those other arts are
                    imitative in respect of their reproducing natural objects or circumstances; it
                    is otherwise with architecture, which makes but conventional reference to
                    nature, and wholly arbitrary application of the lines, the lights, and the
                    shadows of the natural world; and in this particular music has an analogy to
                    architecture which it has not to the other fine arts. In the matter of
                    expression also, architecture may be compared with music in the earlier stages
                    of its development, since representing and also prompting a general idea of
                    solemnity, or grandeur, or gaiety; but music left architecture far behind when,
                    in later times, it assumed the power of special, individual, and personal
                    utterance of every variety of passion. The indefiniteness of musical expression
                    furnishes no argument that music is inexpressive, but is one of the qualities
                    that place it on the highest level of art-excellence, enabling it to suggest
                    still more than it displays, and to stimulate the imagination of the witness as
                    much as to exercise that of the artist. The musician is then a poet, whether we
                    regard the term in its primary sense of “maker,” the exact translation of the
                    Greek word by which versifiers were styled in early English, or in its applied
                    sense of one who expresses thought and feeling through the medium of
                    highly-excited imagination. Music, then, is that one of the fine arts which
                    appropriates the phenomena of sound to the purposes of poetry, and has a
                    province of its own in many respects analogous to, but yet wholly distinct from,
                    that of each of the other arts. It is common to style it “the universal
                    language;” but the definition is untrue, for in every age and in every clime
                    there are varieties of musical idiom which are unsympathetic, if not
                    unintelligible, to other generations than those among whom they are first
                    current, and, still more, the very principles that govern it have been and are
                    so variously developed in different times and places that music which is
                    delightful at one period or to one people is repugnant at another epoch or to a
                    different community. An attempt will here be made to sketch the progress of the
                    art through Western civilization, to show how it has been changed from
                    artificial or calculated into natural or spontaneous, and to describe some of
                    the chief forms of its manifestation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>We thus owe our three chief musical terms to the Greeks, and in our prevailing
                    system much more besides; they themselves, however, owed all to earlier sources,
                    for the essentials of their knowledge and practice are traced to Egypt.</p>
                <p>It has been ingeniously suggested and well sustained by Mr. J. F. Rowbotham that
                    in prehistoric times music passed through three stages of development, each
                    characterized by a separate class of instrument, and the analogy of existing
                    uses in barbarous nations tends to confirm the assumption. Instruments· of
                    percussion are supposed to be the oldest, wind instruments the next in order of
                    time and of civilization, and string instruments the latest invention of every
                    separate race. The clapping of hands and stamping of feet, let us say, in
                    marking rhythm exemplify the first element of music, and the large family of
                    drums and cymbals and bells is a development of the same principle. Untutored
                    ears are quicker to perceive rhythmical accentuation than variations of pitch,
                    so the organ of time makes earlier manifestation than the organ of tune, though,
                    musical sound being a periodic succession of vibrations, the operation of the
                    latter is truly but a refinement on that of the former. The sighing of wind,
                    eminently when passing over a bed of reeds, is Nature’s suggestion of
                    instruments of breath; hence have been reached the four methods of producing
                    sound through pipes: —by blowing at the end, as in the case of the English flute
                    and the flageolet; at the side, as in that of the ordinary concert flute;
                    through a double reed, as in that of the hautboy or oboe and bassoon; and over a
                    single reed, as in that of the clarionet—all of which date from oldest existing
                    records; and also upon the collection of multitudinous pipes in that colossal
                    wind instrument, the organ. An Egyptian fable ascribes the invention of the lyre
                    to the god Thoth; a different Greek fable gives the same credit to the god
                    Hermes; and both refer it, though under different circumstances, to the
                    straining of the sinews of a tortoise across its shell,—whence can only be
                    inferred that the origin of the highest advanced class of musical instruments is
                    unknown. This class includes the lyre and the harp, which give but one note from
                    each stretched string; the lute, which, having a neck or finger-board, admits of
                    the production of several notes from each string by stopping it at different
                    lengths with the fingers; the viol, the addition of the bow to which gives
                    capability of sustaining the tone; and the dulcimer, finally matured into the
                    pianoforte, wherein the extremes of instrumental fabrication meet, since this is
                    at once a string instrument and an instrument <pb break="no"

                    strike the string of the lyre.</p>
                <p>Musical intervals are named numerically from any given note, say C as the 1st,
                    the note next to which is thus D the 2d, the one beyond is E the 3d, and so on
                    to another C, the 8th. Beyond the 8th, numerical names are only used for the
                    rare combinations of the 9th, the 11 th, and the 13th. This is because the 8th
                    is in some sense a reproduction of the 1st, as all intervals beyond it are
                    reproductions of the 8th below them—reproductions, that is, uniting identity and
                    difference, the relation of tones in the higher octave being just what it is in
                    the lower, while each tone is so or so much more acute than its under 8th, an
                    analogy to which may be sought in the reduction of any visual object to half its
                    size while all its proportions are preserved, the larger and the smaller, as in
                    the interval of the 8th, thus uniting identity with difference. When two voices
                    or instruments produce the same sound they are in unison; the unison or 1st<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Literally, the 1st is not a
                    musical <hi rend="italic">distance</hi>; but, as it is a frequent combination in
                    counterpoint, and as its repetition is not rare in melody, it is conveniently
                    classed as an <hi rend="italic">interval.</hi></p></note> is styled perfect; so
                    too is its reproduction, the 8th; the 8th is unequally divisible into a 5th and
                    a 4th, and these two are classed with the 1st and 8th as perfect. There are many
                    specialities that distinguish the four perfect intervals in music from every
                    other. The two notes of which each is constituted are, save in one instance, of
                    the same quality—as natural, or sharp, or flat; to raise or lower either of the
                    two notes by a chromatic semitone<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A chromatic or minor semitone is between two notes of the
                    same alphabetical name, as C and ⅛C, or D and hD; a diatonic or major semitone
                    is between two notes of different alphabetical names, as C and hü, or C and B;
                    the ratio of the latter is ⅜⅜, and that of the former varies with the place of
                    the interval in the chromatic scale.</p></note> changes a perfect interval into
                    a discord, whereas the other intervals are elastic, that is, they may be major
                    or minor from having a chromatic semitone more or less in their extent, and are
                    not changed from concords to discords, or the reverse, by the modification. To
                    invert a perfect interval by placing the higher note beneath the lower produces
                    another perfect interval, whereas to invert any of the other intervals reverses
                    its character of major or minor. The progression of two parts together from one
                    to another 1st or 8th, from one to another 5th or 4 th, has, save in exceptional
                    instances, the bad effect that all musical grammar forbids, whereas the
                    progression of two parts in 3ds or 6ths with each other has a good effect. In
                    the resolution of fundamental discords the progression of perfect intervals is
                    free, whereas that of the imperfect intervals is restricted; and further, in the
                    relation of subject and answer in a fugue, one perfect interval may be changed
                    for another, but never for an imperfect interval. Many technicalities are
                    anticipated in the foregoing which can only be explained in the sequel, but
                    present mention of them is unavoidable in reference to a position now to be
                    stated. The Egyptians perceived the distinction of the perfect intervals from
                    others, if not all the above specialities, and regarded them as typical of the
                    seasons, spring bearing the proportion of a 4th to autumn, of a 5th to winter,
                    and of an 8th to summer. The distinction, then, has been observed for many
                    centuries, but neither ancients nor moderns have adduced any explanation of the
                    phenomenon, and the wondrous fact that perfect intervals differ in constitution
                    and treatment from other intervals appears to defy reason, and not even to
                    incite speculation.</p>
                <p>The anciently supposed affinity of music to astronomy was taught by Pythagoras
                    (585 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), who derived the notion from the Egyptians,
                    and exemplified it by comparison of the lyre of seven strings with the planetary
                    system. The Sun, then believed to rotate round the earth, was deemed the chief
                    planet, next to which were, on the one side Mercury, Venus, and the Moon, and on
                    the other side Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The strings of the lyre, not the notes
                    they sounded, were thus named :—Mesê (middle), being the principal or keynote,
                    corresponding with our A on the fifth line with the bass clef, and likened to
                    the Sun; Paramesë (next to middle) or B flat, likened to Mercury; Paranêtê (next
                    to lowest, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> shortest = highest in pitch) or C,
                    likened to Venus; and Nëtë or Neatë (lowest) or D, likened to the Moon; these
                    constituted the upper tetrachord or scale of four notes, to which the lower
                    tetrachord was conjoined by having Mesë for its acutest note, which was the
                    gravest of the other tetrachord; next to it was Lichanos (forefinger string) or
                    G, likened to Mars; then Parhypatë (next to highest, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> longest = lowest in pitch) or F, likened to Jupiter; and lastly
                    Hypatë (highest) or E, likened to Saturn. The Moon being of all the planets the
                    nearest to, and Saturn the farthest from, the earth, they are analogous to the
                    shortest and the longest string.</p>
                <p>The Greek lyre (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lyre,</hi> vol. xv. p. 113) had at first
                    four strings, to which subsequently were added the longest three; then an 8th,
                    corresponding with our E, tuned to an 8th above Hypatë; then three below the
                    latter, which took the scale down in pitch to B on the second line with the bass
                    clef; afterwards three above the former, which took the scale up to A in the
                    second space with the treble clef; and finally Proslambanomenos, corresponding
                    with our A in the first space with the bass clef, extended the “greater system”
                    of fifteen notes to an 8th below Mesë and an 8th above it.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Tradition has it that Pythagoras made his discovery of the ratios of the perfect
                    intervals by listening to some smiths who struck the iron on their anvil with
                    hammers of different weights, and thus produced different notes from the metal.
                    But the narrator of the tale has disregarded the obvious fact that, save for
                    slight variation due to the greater or less heat of its different parts, a
                    metallic bar, like a string, always sounds a note of the same pitch whatever be

                    the tetrachord, counting downward in pitch into equal intervals of a major tone,
                    left but a <hi rend="italic">leimma</hi> (remnant), which was less than a
                    semitone between the 3d and 4th degrees. Aristoxenus (300 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>), who has been called the father of temperament, discovered the
                    difference between the major and minor tones, the first having the ratio ⅜, and
                    the second having that of ⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>. His followers formed
                    a school opposed to that of Pythagoras, and there was severe contention between
                    the two. Subsequent theorists disputed whether the major or the minor tone
                    should be above the other, and it was Claudius Ptolemy (c. 150 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> who enunciated that the major tone should be below
                    the minor, which is the principle that directs the intonation of our present
                    scale. This intonation may account for the difference between the effect in
                    proceeding from the minor chord of the supertonic to the major chord of the
                    tonic, and the effect in proceeding from the minor chord of the submediant to
                    the major chord of the dominant, of which the latter, at the interval of a minor
                    tone, is acceptable and the former, at the interval of a major tone, is
                    repugnant to cultivated ears.</p>

                <p>The Greeks had four modes or Scales included in their “greater system.” The
                    Dorian comprised a series of eight notes from D to D, of which hB was the 6th,
                    and had its semitones between the 2d and 3d and the 5th and 6th degrees counting
                    upward. The others were exact transpositions of this, as all our modern scales
                    are transpositions of the scale of C, the identity of intervals being induced by
                    the various tuning of the lyre strings. The Phrygian mode lay between E and E,
                    and had ⅛F and ⅛B, the Lydian between ⅛F and ⅛F had ⅛G and ⅛C, and the
                    Mixo-Lydian between G and G had hB and bE. These four were styled <hi
                    rend="italic">authentic,</hi> and were distinguished by having the dominant (or
                    predominant note) at the interval of a 5th above the tonic. Each had a <hi
                    rend="italic">plagal</hi> or relative mode at the interval of a 4th below the
                    authentic, distinguished by having the dominant a 4th below the tonic, and
                    defined by the prefix “hypo” to the name of the authentic mode, as Hypo-Dorian
                    beginning on A, Hypo-Phrygian on B, &amp;c. To each mode was assigned its
                    special character of subject, which may be accounted for by the different
                    qualities of voices that could sing in lower or higher keys, the majestic being
                    fitted to a bass, who would sing in the Dorian, the tender to a tenor, who would
                    sing in the Lydian, and so forth. In later but still classic times other modes
                    were added to these, but on the same principle of precise notai
                    transposition.</p>
                <p>The tetrachords above described—having a semitone between the lowest note and
                    that next above it, a tone between the 2d and 3d, and a tone between the 3d and
                    4th, the latter of which Ptolemy made smaller than the other, and so left a
                    semitone between the 2d and 1st degrees—were called <hi rend="italic"
                    >diatonic,</hi> as A, hB, C, D. To lower by a semitone the 2d note from the
                    highest produced a <hi rend="italic">chromatic</hi> tetrachord, as A, hB, βB, D.
                    To tune the 2d string from the top yet a semitone lower reduced it to the same
                    pitch as the 3d string, which was equivalent to its total rejection, and this
                    form of tetrachord was the <hi rend="italic">enharmonic,</hi> the invention of
                    which was ascribed to Olympus (640 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). If we
                    observe the two tetrachords that occur, for instance, in the Dorian mode—that
                    from D down to A, and that from A down to E—with the addition of the tonic D
                    below, it will be seen that our modern scale of D minor with the omission of the
                    4th and 7th degrees was in the enharmonic genus, and that the chromatic genus
                    gave the minor and major 3d and the minor and major 6th with still the omission
                    of the 4th and 7th :—enharmonic, D, E, F, A, hB, D; chromatic, D, E, F, ⅛F, A,
                    hB, t∣B, D; and the other authentic modes were transpositions of this. In the
                    harmonic scale of nature the 7th from the generator is too flat, and the 11th
                    (octave above the 4th) is too sharp, for accepted use; the rejection of these
                    two notes indicates a refinement of ear that shrank from the natural and equally
                    refused the artificial intonation of these degrees of the scale. Mr. Carl Engel
                    proves the rejection of the said 4th and 7th from the keynote by nations of high
                    civilization in remote parts of the world; we call a scale that is so formed
                    Scottish, but in China, Mexico, and other places than Great Britain the same
                    arrangement is found to have prevailed in the remotest periods of which we have
                    knowledge. An important principle is here involved which has affected all
                    musical theory directly or indirectly, and is now seen to lie at the foundation
                    of modern rules of harmony or the combining of musical sounds. The Pythagoreans
                    advocated the use of the enharmonic genus, and so received the appellation of
                    Enhar-monicists, or were as often called Harmonicists, and hence the twofold
                    application of the term “harmonia.”</p>
                <p>Anacreon (540 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) sang to the accompaniment of the
                    magadis (doubling bridge), an instrument imported from Egypt to Greece; it had a
                    bridge, across which the strings were drawn at one-third of their entire length,
                    when of course the shorter division sounded the note an 8th higher than the
                    longer. Aristotle (384 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) describes <hi
                    rend="italic">antiphon</hi> (τδ άντίφωνον) as the singing of a melody by men an
                    8th lower than it is sung at the same time by boys—in other words, what is
                    miscalled in modern church congregations “singing in unison.” The same writer
                    enunciates that the antiphon may not be at either of the other perfect
                    intervals, the 5th or the 4th below a melody, and in this he anticipates a rule
                    till lately deemed inflexible in modern music. Beyond these two instances of the
                    combination of the 8th, no allusion has been found in ancient writings to the
                    use of harmony in the modern sense of the word, and the only three examples of
                    ancient Greek music that are known to exist are melodies (notes in succession),
                    and supposition assigns them to the 3d or 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> They are hymns to Apollo, Nemesis, and Calliope, with the respective
                    verses, and their translation into modern notation has only been possible
                    through reference to the verbal accent, because there are no extant rules of
                    that era for purely musical measure. Nevertheless we have Egyptian paintings of
                    the period of Dynasty IV., and Greek sculptures of players on pipes of different
                    lengths which must have produced notes of different pitches, and sometimes in
                    the same party players on string instruments with necks whereon two strings,
                    differently stopped and yet sounded together, would have yielded a combination
                    of different notes; and this, though a speechless, is a strong evidence that the
                    musicians so represented made at least a forecast of modern harmony. One cannot
                    but marvel that, while copious treatises have come down to us upon niceties that
                    have here been adduced, nothing has been brought to light but pictorial
                    testimony as to ancient knowledge of chords; and the three specimens just
                    mentioned are all that have been found of musical composition in any form.</p>
                <p>The classic Greeks used music in rhapsodizing or chanting with vocal inflexions
                    the epic poems; they employed it in religious rites and to accompany military
                    evolutions; and prizes were awarded for its performance by voices and on
                    instruments (including, during the last two centuries <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> the organ) at their Olympic and other games. It belonged essentially
                    to the drama, which had its origin in the dithyrambic hymns; these were
                    gradually developed into the tragedy, which took its name from the tragos (goat)
                    that was sacrificed to Dionysus during the performance. Possibly Thespis (536
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) may have spoken the recitations with which he
                    was the first to intersperse the hymns; but some interpreters of Greek writings
                    afiirm, and others while doubting do not disprove, that in the mature drama all
                    the characters sang or chanted, seemingly after the manner of the rhapsodists,
                    and the impersonal chorus sang to instrumental accompaniment during their
                    orchestric evolutions, from which motions or marchings the part of the theatre
                    wherein the chorus were stationed between the audience and the proscenium was
                    called the orchestra. Here, then, was the prototype of the modern opera, the
                    main departure from which is the transplanting of the chorus to the stage and
                    giving to its members participation in the action. Aeschylus wrote the music to
                    his own tragedies; Sophocles accompanied on the cithara the performance of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Thamyris,</hi> if not of other of his plays; Euripides left
                    the composition of the music for his works to another genius than his own, and
                    such was the case with after dramatists.</p>
                <p>In ancient Rome the choristers in tragedies were very numerous, including female
                    as well as male singers; they were accompanied by a large number of instruments,
                    among which trumpets were conspicuous. This we learn from Seneca, who employs
                    the idea of multitudinous unity it presents to illustrate figuratively the
                    organization of a state.</p>

                <p>How or when the musical system of the Greeks fell into disuse is still untraced;
                    certainly it prevailed and engaged the attention of philosophers for some
                    centuries of the Christian era. The first notices of music in the Western Church
                    refer to the manner but not to the matter of the performance. The name of St
                    Ambrose (384 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> is familiarly associated with the
                    music of his metropolitan church in Milan; but all that is proved of his
                    connexion with the art is that, advised by Flavian of Antioch, he adopted for
                    the first time in the West the practice of dividing the verses of the Psalms
                    between responsive choirs, an usage which has a natural connexion with the
                    so-called “parallelism” of Hebrew poetry, indicated in the English version of
                    the Psalter by the colon that divides each verse. This practice has come to be
                    falsely called antiphonal singing— falsely, because, according to the etymology
                    of the word and to Aristotle’s definition, the Greeks used it for singing <hi
                    rend="italic">together,</hi> whereas the church uses it for singing in <hi
                    rend="italic">alternation.</hi> St Ambrose regulated the order of the prayers,
                    the ritual, and other matters in the service besides the music; his ordinances
                    prevailed in Milan, and were distinguished by his name; so the term Ambrosian
                    denotes the “use of Milan” in all things in which that differs from the practice
                    of other churches. No proof is given that the melodies so defined belong to the
                    date of St Ambrose.</p>
                <p>Boetius (475 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> was the most copious of the Roman
                    writers on music, but his voluminous treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Institutione Musica</hi> proves that the Greek principles of the
                    art had in his time become matter of antiquarianism; nay, it proves further that
                    he did not understand the technical terms he professed to translate. For
                    instance, he mistook the word for the shortest string of the lyre (Nëtë), which
                    naturally gave the acutest sound, to signify the gravest note; and he mistook
                    the word for the longest string (Hypatë) to signify the acutest note. It is not
                    necessary here to catalogue this author’s many verbal errors;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Chappell, <hi

                    ignored the advance made by Didymus and completed by Ptolemy in the tuning of
                    the scale with the major and minor tones, and the modern semitone of ⅜⅜,
                    counting upward, and returned to the Pythagorean division of two major tones,
                    inducing a discordant 3d, and the leimma ⅜∣f.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The ratios of the three may thus be stated

                    Boetius makes it matter of regret that he ever wrote upon music. His Latin book
                    being accessible when those of Greek authors were not, it was established as a
                    text-book on the art in the English universities, and musical degrees were
                    granted for knowledge of the principles it set forth; musical progress was thus
                    seriously retarded, and the 18th century was far advanced before search for
                    sound theory dispelled reverence for his scholastic dogma.</p>
                <p>As St Ambrose ordained a ritual for Milan which bore his name, so also St Gregory
                    the Great (590 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> ordained one for Rome which was
                    called Gregorian. The terms Ambrosian and Gregorian are now erroneously applied
                    to a system of music that came first into use centuries after the dates of the
                    two bishops, and they are applied even to melodies constructed upon that system.
                    This sentence of St Isidore, the friend and survivor of Gregory, distinctly
                    proves that no music of the time of the Roman pontiff was or could be preserved:
                    “Unless sounds are retained in the memory, they perish, because they cannot be
                    written.” Whatever the age of the oldest church melodies, belief cannot
                    associate them with the days of St Gregory.</p>
                <p>The system of notation by letters of the Greek alphabet had fallen into disuse. A
                    system by neumes <hi rend="italic">(grvevμa)</hi> or pneumeter, of later date
                    than St Gregory, employed signs over or under the syllables to indicate the
                    rising or falling of the voice but not to define its extent, and, in the manner
                    of modern punctuation, to show where breath should be taken. This was followed
                    by, though for a time practised coincidently with, one in which the Roman
                    letters stood for notes. Afterwards, something like our staff was employed, of
                    which the spaces only and not the lines were used, the syllables being placed in
                    the higher or lower of them to denote to what extent the melody should rise or
                    fall. Of earlier date than anything that has been found of like advance in other
                    countries is a service-book which belonged to Winchester cathedral, and contains
                    music written on the lines as well as in the spaces of a staff of four lines;
                    and this comprises a prayer for Ethelred II., who died in 1016. It has been
                    stated and constantly repeated that staff notation was invented by Guido, a monk
                    of Arezzo, who was alive in 1067, and whose book, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Micrologus,</hi> refers only to writing in spaces, and who throughout his works
                    professes no more than to describe established principles, and these far less
                    advanced than what then prevailed in England. To him is falsely ascribed the
                    first use of a red line for the note F, and a saffron for the note C, and to
                    him, as unduly, the appropriation of the initial syllables—nonsense without the
                    completion of the words—of six lines of a hymn to St John the Baptist as names
                    of the notes—Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La.</p>
                <p>Hucbald (930 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> invented a system, not of notation,
                    but of scales, wherein the semitone was always between the 2d and 3d of a
                    tetrachord, as G, A, bB, C, so the t[B and ⅛F of the second octave were in false
                    relation to the bB and ⅛F of the first two tetrachords. To this scale of four
                    notes, G, A, bB, C, were subsequently added a note below and a note above, which
                    made the hexachord with the semitone between the 3d and 4th both up and down, as
                    F, G, A, bB, C, D. It was at a much later date that the 7 th, our leading note,
                    was admitted into a key, and for this the first two letters of the last line of
                    the above-named hymn, “Sanctus Johannes,” would have been used, save for the
                    notion that as the note Mi was at a semitone below Fa, the same vowel should be
                    heard at a semitone below the upper Ut, and the syllable Si was substituted for
                    Sa. Long afterwards the syllable Ut was replaced by Do in Italy, but it is still
                    retained in France; and in these two countries, with whatever others employ
                    their nomenclature, the original Ut and the substituted Do stand for the sound
                    defined by the letter C in English and German termin-ologv. The literal musical
                    alphabet thus accords with the</p>

                <p>Germany, however, a remnant of Greek use prevails in having the note above A at
                    the interval of a semitone, namely bB, as was the classical Paramesë above Mesë,
                    and the Teutons employ the 8th letter H to denote the sound we call ⅛B, and the
                    Italians and French Si. The gamut, which, whenever instituted, did not pass out
                    of use until the present century, regarded the hexachord and not the octachord,
                    employed both letters and syllables, made the former invariable while changing
                    the latter according to key relationship, and acknowledged only the three keys
                    of G, C, and F; it took its name from having the Greek letter gamma with Ut for
                    its lowest keynote, though the Latin letters with the corresponding syllables
                    were applied to all the other notes.</p>
                <p>A system of modes had already been established for ecclesiastical music which
                    differed essentially from the Greek modal system in having no notes inflected by
                    sharps <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n92/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0092-0081"/> or flats, and consequently a different
                    distribution of tones and semitones in each mode from that in all the others.
                    The sole exception from this was the permissible bB in the second octave, the
                    toleration of which was for the sake of avoiding the interval of the augmented
                    4th between ζB and F below it, but the inflected note was admitted in the fifth
                    mode only. Here the numbers of the modes must be explained and the later
                    misapplication to them of the Greek names. The two classic forms of authentic
                    and plagal were employed in the structure of melody, that having its dominant
                    above the tonic or final, this having its dominant below it. The four authentic
                    modes bore the uneven numbers—first beginning its scale from D, third from E,
                    fifth from F, wherein the bB might be used, and seventh from G. The four plagal
                    modes bore the even numbers, which showed their parallelism or relation to their
                    respective authentic modes—second beginning from A, fourth from B, sixth from C,
                    and eighth from D. In the latter half of the 9th century, Notker, abbot of St
                    Gall, applied the Greek names to these, regardless of the distinction that by
                    use of inflected notes the classic modes had all the same disposition of tones
                    and semitones, whereas by the omission of sharps and of flats the church modes
                    varied from each other in the arrangement of intervals. The confusion of F for
                    the church Lydian with ⅛F for the Greek Lydian is obvious, and the reader may
                    easily trace the discrepancies between the systems if he consider the diverse
                    principles on which the two are based. Some centuries later, the ninth and tenth
                    modes, Aeolian and Hypo-Aeolian, beginning respectively on A and E, were added,
                    and later still, the eleventh and twelfth, Ionian and Hypo-Ionian, beginning
                    respectively on C and G. The mode or scale that comprised bB was called <hi
                    rend="italic">mollis,</hi> and those which had £|B were each called <hi
                    rend="italic">dura,</hi> and hence the sign “b” to indicate a flat, the word <hi
                    rend="italic">bémol</hi> to define the same in French, the word <hi
                    rend="italic">be</hi> or its first letter to name a flat, and the terms <hi
                    rend="italic">moll</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dur</hi> to express minor and
                    major in German. Lastly, as bearing on the aversion from the augmented 4th
                    between F and B, and on the omission of the 4th and 7th in several
                    characteristic national scales, it must be added that, whenever the 5th above or
                    4th below a tonic or final was B, C instead of this note was dominant of the
                    mode.</p>
                <p>Coincidently with the church practice of constructing unrhythmical melody in one
                    or other of these unnatural and arbitrarily devised modes, and of singing the
                    same without accompanying harmony, the people of Northern nations had the habit,
                    as has been proved in many districts, of singing tunes with the accompaniment of
                    different parts performed by other voices. Among what tradition has preserved of
                    these tunes, some indeed are in one or other of the church modes, as was
                    inevitable in the productions of people who had experience of this artificial
                    system in the music of the daily service; but many approximate far nearer to the
                    scale of present use, and are thus susceptible of just harmonic treatment, which
                    is incompatible with the modal system. So devoted to their song-tunes were the
                    English people in the later Saxon times that churchmen, as is well attested,
                    would often sing these to attract the public to divine worship, and after the
                    Norman settlement it was a frequent custom to write words of hymns to fit
                    secular tunes, which tunes and their titles are preserved through this
                    appropriation only, with the Latin words written under the notes.</p>
                <p>The appropriation of popular tunes to church use was followed by the adoption of
                    the harmonic practice or part-singing of the people in many English districts,
                    and probably in other Northern lands. At the end of the 11th or beginning of the
                    12th century, a part added to another received the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >descant (dis-cantus,</hi> something apart from or extra to the song), and rules
                    were gradually framed for its extemporaneous invention. It was preceded by <hi
                    rend="italic">faburden</hi> (the singing of a single note or drone throughout a
                    given melody), and this latter term was retained with a wider contrapuntal
                    signification, whence difficulty has arisen as to its primary meaning. To “bear
                    the burden” was to sing the bass below either a single part or fuller harmony;
                    when the bass was a single note, which was of course the tonic, this being
                    generally F or Fa, it constituted the faburden or drone; that the term is
                    translated <hi rend="italic">fauxbourd&lt;m</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >falsobordone</hi> in French and Italian may have referred at first to its being
                    a single note or drone, and not a part changing with the changeful harmony.</p>
                <p>The assertion that previously to the period now being considered there prevailed
                    a church custom of accompanying melodies with a transposition of the same at the
                    interval of the 5th or 8th above or below is disproved by Aristotle’s injunction
                    that the antiphon might be at the 8th below, but not at any other of the perfect
                    intervals; and the blundering of Boetius could not eradicate the fact, though it
                    might obscure the rule. It is also disproved by the habit of the peoples of the
                    North to sing in harmony, showing unschooled perception of the principles of
                    combining sounds, and making it impossible that either they or their priests
                    (who must casually have heard their natural performances) could have tolerated
                    the cacophonous progression of parts at perfect intervals from each other. It is
                    disproved by the identity of human perceptions to-day with those of a thousand
                    years ago, and by the certainty that men of old positively could not have sung
                    with satisfaction, or heard with respect, things that are in the highest degree
                    offensive to us all. An explanation may be speculatively ventured, that the
                    manuscripts wherein two parts appear to be written in 5ths or 4 ths with each
                    other are not scores showing what was to be sung in combination, but the parts
                    for separate choirs, showing what was to be sung in response; thus, when i <hi
                    rend="superscript"> D</hi>)</p>
                <p>&lt; A &gt; stand as the initials of three melodies, the top or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(dJ</hi> the bottom may have been intended to be sung alone,
                    the middle to follow, and the other to succeed. In this is to be seen the germ
                    of the fugue, if we may suppose that the part which first held the cantus was
                    continued in descant, when the cantus was sung a 5th higher by another part.
                    Music written as here described is defined as <hi rend="italic">diaphony,—</hi>
                    a term at least as appropriate to the successive as to the simultaneous singing
                    of a melody at the interval of a 5th above or below.</p>
                <p>One of the most inscrutable things to the modern student is the lateness at which
                    notation was devised for defining the relative length of musical sounds. The
                    rhythmical sense is the earliest of the musical faculties to be developed, and
                    is often the strongest in its development among individuals and nations. Still,
                    the ancients have left no record that they had signs of indication for the
                    length of notes, and centuries rolled over Christendom before there was any
                    chronicled attempt to find a principle for supplying this musical necessity.
                    Here again conjecture will insist that the practice of singing longer and
                    shorter notes with stronger and weaker accent must have prevailed before a
                    system was framed for its regulation; and in this supposition offers that the
                    instincts of the people must have given example for the canons of the schoolmen.
                    Franco of Cologne, in the 12th century, is the first writer who codified the
                    uses of “measured music,” and all he enunciates is expanded in the treatises of
                    Walter Odington, a monk of Evesham who was appointed archbishop of Canterbury in
                    1228. At this period and afterwards<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n93/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0093-0082"/>, bar-lines were drawn across the whole or a
                    portion of the staff to show the end of a musical phrase in accordance with that
                    of the line or verse which was to be sung to it, and the number of notes between
                    these bar-lines was more or less, according to the number of syllables in the
                    verse. It was not, however, till more than three hundred years later that music
                    was first divided into bars of equal length, and not until a still later date
                    that these were applied to their most valuable purpose of showing the points of
                    strongest emphasis. Prior to thisinvention the distribution of accent was styled
                    <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> or <hi rend="italic">imperfect time,</hi>
                    according to whether the strongest note was to be the first of three or the
                    first of two, or according to whether three or two should follow during the
                    continuance of one, corresponding with present division into triple or duple
                    time. Our compound times were denoted by such directions as “imperfect of the
                    first and perfect of the second,” which may be translated by</p>
                <p>6 6</p>
                <p>our sign 7 or -, meaning that a bar is divisible into 4 8</p>
                <p>two equal notes (dotted minims or dotted crotchets), and each of these into three
                    equal notes (crotchets or quavers). It is not only that early music is, on
                    account of this vague notation, difficult to interpret, but writers seem to have
                    had undefined notions of where their accent should lie; and hence we have
                    varying versions of melodies, partly because the transcribers may have doubted
                    how to express them, and partly because composers, when choosing them as themes
                    against which to construct other parts, lengthened or shortened any of the notes
                    at the prompting of their own fancy. It was not until the 18th century that the
                    plan was fully accepted of having the strongest note on the first of every bar,
                    and of having, with rarest exceptions, the close or cadence or conclusion of
                    every phrase on this note of strongest accent. To induce such termination of a
                    phrase many a strain must begin with a half bar, or with a shorter or longer
                    fragment, and the exceptions from the rule are so few as to be easily mastered,
                    and so clear as to aid in strengthening the principle.</p>
                <p>Descant, which has become a term of general use for disquisition on a stated
                    subject, has been shown to owe its first meaning and musical application to the
                    words <hi rend="italic">dis-cantus.</hi> A like meaning belongs to the word <hi
                    rend="italic">motet,</hi> which seems to have come from <hi rend="italic"
                    >motetus,</hi> to denote a florid or moving part against a fixed theme in longer
                    notes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Among other
                    grounds for this derivation a strong one is that in the 13th and 14th centuries
                    the word <hi rend="italic">motetus</hi> often defined a florid part next above
                    that which was styled <hi rend="italic">tenor,</hi> because it <hi rend="italic"
                    >held</hi> the chief melody, the word <hi rend="italic">motetus</hi> being
                    subsequently changed for <hi rend="italic">medius</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >mean</hi> when that part stood midway between the <hi rend="italic">tenor</hi>
                    and the third part above it or <hi rend="italic">treble.</hi> Bass, or base of
                    the harmonic column, was then designated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >burden.</hi></p></note> It may be supposed that the term anthem had reference
                    originally, similarly to the word motet, to a free part constructed against or
                    upon the plain-song. The word descant has passed out of use as a musical
                    definition; motet now generally signifies a composition to Latin text for the
                    Roman Church, and it is also applied to the works produced in North Germany in
                    the centuries next following the Reformation which were elaborations of the
                    choral melodies; and anthem is applied to pieces designed for use in the Church
                    of England.</p>
                <p>When descant ceased to be improvised, and with the advance of notation the
                    writing of a carefully-planned accompanying part became more and more
                    practicable, such a part was defined as <hi rend="italic">counterpoint—</hi>
                    point or note against note. Counterpoint is simple when each melody is in notes
                    of the same length as those of an accompanying melody; it is florid when one
                    melody proceeds in longer or shorter notes than, another melody. At first the
                    use of perfect concords only was allowed in counterpoint, but of these never two
                    at the same interval, as two 5ths or two 8ths, in succession. 3ds and 6ths were
                    afterwards introduced. Then discords were admitted under either of two
                    conditions: (1) that they were approached and quitted by step and not by leap,
                    and were always unaccented; (2) that they were suspended from a note of a
                    previously-sounded chord, or from a note without harmony, and that they were
                    resolved by passing to a concord while the harmony lasted against which they
                    were discordant. Subsequently one more class of discords was employed; these
                    were elements of the harmony, being added to, not substituted for, the notes of
                    a chord, and they were resolved, with the change of the entire chord, upon notes
                    of that chord whose root was at the interval of a 4th above the root of the
                    discord. It is from the institution of the art of constructing counterpoint that
                    the history of the music we know, and the capability to produce it, are truly to
                    be dated. Throughout the period of transition from what must be regarded as an
                    instinct of the people to what was truly a scholastic problem, there were
                    English writers on music in such numbers as to prove the high consideration in
                    which it was held in Britain, and the great pains spent there to evolve
                    principles for its regulation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>John Cotton (referred to as Johannes Anglicanus by the
                    almost fabulous Guido) was the earliest to indicate the good effect of contrary
                    motion between two simultaneous melodies.</p></note> John of Dunstable is
                    especially to be noted, of whom Tinctor the Netherlander (c. 1460 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> wrote, in discussing the art of counterpoint: “Of
                    this new art, as I may call it, the fountain and source is said to have been
                    among the English, of whom Dunstable was the chief.” Contemporaneous with
                    Dunstable, but far behind him in esteem, was Egide Binchois, a musician of
                    Picardy.</p>
                <p>The first essays at composition in harmony were in the form of <hi rend="italic"
                    >canon—</hi> that is, in which successive parts have the same melody, but begin
                    each at a stated period after its precursor. When the first part completes a
                    rhythmical sentence prior to the entry of the second part and continues the
                    melody as accompaniment to the second, and so on with regard to the third or
                    fourth parts if there be so many, the composition has in England always been
                    styled a <hi rend="italic">round</hi> or <hi rend="italic">catch,</hi> as
                    distinguished from the closer canon, in which the successive parts enter without
                    regard to the close of a phrase; but elsewhere than in England no distinction is
                    made between the catch and the canon. The term round refers to the return to the
                    beginning by the first part, while the other parts respectively continue the
                    melody. The term ’ catch springs from each later part catching up the tune
                    during its continuance by the others. The term canon relates to the problem of
                    finding the one or more points in a melody whereat one or more successive parts
                    should begin the same tune. Very early allusion is made to the singing of
                    catches by the English people, which continued in practice until after the
                    Restoration; every trade had its characteristic catch; there were many on
                    pastoral subjects; those which engaged composers in the time of Charles II. are
                    mostly of a bacchanalian cast; and the form was appropriated in the later
                    Georgian era to sentimental subjects, when the practice of singing catches had
                    passed from the people at large, but was preserved in some convivial clubs that
                    consisted of men of fortune, who paid and listened to, but took no part with,
                    professional singers.</p>
                <p>Quite distinct from the canon is the <hi rend="italic">fugue {fugd).</hi> In it a
                    short complete melody <hi rend="italic">flies</hi> (hence the name) from one
                    part to another, while the original part is continued in counterpoint against
                    it. To suit the different compass of high and low voices, this melody is
                    transposed into the key of the dominant (the 5th above or 4th below) when
                    assigned to the second entering voice; in the first instance it is called the

                    its answer must be plagal, and, if the subject be plagal, the answer must be
                    authentic. The copious rules of fugal development needed many years for their
                    ripening, but the beginning of this art-form dates from very primitive times,
                    and a speculation has been already offered as to its origin (p. 81).</p>
                <p>The earliest piece of music for several voices that has been found in any country
                    is an English “six men’s song,” contained in a manuscript which best judges
                    assign to the period prior to 1240. It is a canon for four voices, with
                    independent parts for two more, which stand as a foot, or burden, or ground bass
                    to support all the others. The original words are a description of summer; these
                    are proof of the secular origin of the music, but there are also written to the
                    notes the words of a Latin hymn, which prove the practice above noticed of
                    utilizing the people’s songs for church purposes. The Arundel MS., which had
                    lain unnoticed in the library of the Royal Society and has lately been
                    transferred to that of the British Museum, comprises several compositions in
                    two-part and three-part counterpoint, and it belongs to the year 1260—a new
                    addition to the many proofs of the earlier and greater advance of music in
                    England than in other countries. In the Parisian library are some pieces by Adam
                    de la Hale, the Hunchback of Arras, which consist of a secular tune as bass with
                    its original words, and two florid parts above it with sacred Latin words. The
                    reputed author lived in the later half of the 13th century, but it is surmised
                    that the contrapuntal parts may have been added to his tune at a subsequent
                    period by another hand; if this be so, the English pieces are the first; and
                    seem to be the only extant specimens of counterpoint of the period.</p>
                <p>Thus far the advance of music was earlier and greater in England than elsewhere.
                    In the 15th century Flanders produced the musicians of most esteem and greatest
                    influence. Early among these was Ockenheim or Ockeghem of Hainault (c.
                    1420-1513), who was surpassed in fame by his pupil Josse Desprès (more commonly
                    known by what must have been his pet name of Josquin) of Hainault. He practised
                    the art in his own country, in Italy, in France, and in Austria, and was
                    everywhere regarded as its highest ornament. Though not credited with the
                    origination of principles, he is highly extolled for his practical application
                    of those already acknowledged, and the renown of many of his scholars shows him
                    to have been as good a teacher as he was a voluminous composer. In his works,
                    however, the artificiality of the prevailing style is obvious; many of them have
                    some secular song for “cantus fermus” which supports the florid melodies set to
                    sacred texts that it was the musician’s highest aim to engraft upon them. Some
                    of them are notable for a pleasantry or even a jest framed on a punning
                    application of the names of the notes, or on the choice of a text that was
                    pertinent to the occasion for which they were written. Others are distinguished
                    for the multiplicity of their parts. All are of a character to elicit admiration
                    of their ingenuity rather than induce delight by their beauty.</p>
                <p>Tinctor, already mentioned, founded in Naples the first musical conservatory, and
                    coincidently Willaert, another Fleming, founded one in Venice, their object
                    being, as implied in the definition, to conserve the art of music from
                    corruption. Not only in these exclusively musical schools and in similar
                    institutions which sprang up in the same and other cities was the art
                    cultivated, but in the academies of general learning that were established in
                    all the Italian cities when study of the classics became the passion of the age
                    there was generally provision for the teaching of music.<note anchored="true"

                    the principal schools for musical education that have been instituted of late,

                    its five provincial branch schools; the Conservatoire of Brussels; the

                <p>In the 15th century and later, because musical erudition was still applied
                    entirely to the service of the church, and because Italy was the ecclesiastical
                    centre, musicians of all lands went to Italy, and especially to Rome. It was,
                    however, in England first, and it has been only in England until America adopted
                    the practice, that academical honours have been given to musicians. John Hamboys
                    (c. 1470), author of some treatises on the art, is the reputed first doctor of
                    music. The record exists that in 1463 the university of Cambridge conferred the
                    degrees of doctor and bachelor respectively on Thomas Seynt Just and Henry
                    Habyngton. Probably these degrees were granted on the strength of pedantic lore
                    formally required. In the following century a musical composition also was
                    exacted from candidates for graduation. It may seem an anomaly that
                    art-excellence should be tested by academical regulation, since by some supposed
                    to soar above rule; but, rise as it may, to be art it must be founded on
                    principle, and, if in its working of to-day it overstep its limits of yesterday,
                    it is for ever unfolding new exemplifications of those natural laws whereon it
                    is based, and the greatest artist of any time is he who can most deeply probe,
                    and is thus best able to apply, the phenomena; upon these grounds, then, it is
                    not beyond the province of the schoolman to test and to declare the
                    qualifications of an artist.</p>
                <p>The knightly calling, in the age of chivalry, not only referred to heroic acts
                    and deeds of arms, but regarded skill in verse and melody, in singing and
                    accompaniment. Princes and nobles of highest rank practised these arts, and were
                    then styled troubadours, who were sometimes attended and assisted by jongleurs
                    to play to their singing. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Troubadours.</hi> Their music
                    seems to have been rhythmical, as was necessary to fit the verses, and the
                    perfect, or ternary, or triple time is said to have prevailed in it more
                    commonly than that which we should now write .as two or four in a bar. A similar
                    race of knightly songsters in Germany were the minnesänger (see vol. x. p. 525).
                    They set great value on the invention of new metres, and he who produced one
                    with a melody to suit it was called a <hi rend="italic">meister</hi> (master),
                    while he who cast his verses in a previously accepted metre or adapted them to a
                    known melody was styled <hi rend="italic">tondieb</hi> (tone thief). For the
                    most part, their pieces comprised a fore-song, a far longer section in several
                    stanzas, to each of which the same melody was repeated, and an after-song, all
                    three divisions having their own separate melody. Their music is said to have
                    been in the church style of the period, but was distinctly their own
                    composition. The exercise of the gentle arts by the nobility declined with the
                    decline of chivalry, and as it fell into disuse among them it was adopted by the
                    burgher class in the guilds of meistersänger (see vol. x. p. 526). One of the
                    most meritorious and by far the most prolific of the whole craft—his
                    compositions being numbered by thousands —was Hans Sachs of Nuremberg
                    (1494-1576). He was by trade a shoemaker, and all the members of the guild
                    followed some such calling, and devoted themselves to the study and practice of
                    song as recreation from their daily.labour. They cultivated the arts of both
                    composition and performance of song in its twofold aspect of verse and tune, for
                    which, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n95/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0095-0084"/> according to tradition, they enacted most rigid
                    and perhaps pedantic laws. None of their work has come down to us, but the name
                    they have left affords an instance of the aspirations of the common people to
                    that intellectual condition which is not the exclusive prerogative of the church
                    nor the privilege of the wealthy. Guilds of meistersänger were also established
                    in other towns of North Germany. The title and its application generally
                    declined until the 17 th century, but lingered feebly in a few places until
                    1836, when the latest-lived guild was dissolved at Ulm.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The dawn of the 16 th century is marked by the appropriation of musical
                    scholarship to secular writing. It was about that time that the <hi
                    rend="italic">madrigal</hi> came into vogue. The etymology of the word is
                    obscure, but the class of music to which it is applied is clearly distinguished.
                    It is stamped with the imitative character of the canon, but is free from the
                    rigid continuance of one melody by the successively entering voices; and it has
                    as much resemblance yet unlikeness to the fugue in having the flight of a
                    musical phrase from one to another of the vocal parts, but not being steadfast
                    to one subject throughout its design,—nay, imitation sometimes ceases in the
                    madrigal when particular words need special emphasis. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >villanella, villancico, chanson,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">part-song</hi>
                    of the period is distinguished from madrigal by the definite rhythm, a quality
                    excluded from this latter by the response in one part to the uncompleted phrase
                    of another; and the lighter species of composition was so arranged as to suit a
                    single voice with a lute accompaniment when a voice to each part was not
                    available for the performance. Still more marked in rhythm and more slight in
                    structure was the <hi rend="italic">ballet,</hi> so named because it was sung as
                    an accompaniment to dancing <hi rend="italic">(ballata,</hi> from δα‰re), or the
                    <hi rend="italic">fal-la,</hi> so named because often set to these two
                    syllables. All these classes of music were as often played as sung, and in
                    English copies are generally described as “apt for voices or viols.” The Flemish
                    masters have left as many and as admirable specimens of secular work as of
                    church music; Italian musicians, who rose from the teaching of the Flemings,
                    successfully emulated the twofold example; but in England secular composition
                    seems to have been the indigenous development of national intuition, and at its
                    outset at least to have had a style of its own. This is exemplified in the
                    pieces comprised in the <hi rend="italic">Fayrefax MS.,</hi> which are mostly of
                    a pastoral and always of a tuneful character; of these, Dr. Robert Fayrefax the
                    collector, Sir Thomas Phelyppes (a priest), Newark, Theryngham, Turges, Tudor,
                    Browne, Gilbert Bannister, Richard Davy, Cornyshe, and others were the
                    composers.</p>
                <p>The renowned Roman school, to which we must now pass, owed its existence to the
                    precept as much as to the example of foreigners, chiefly from Flanders. Claude
                    Goudimel (<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1510-1572), known as a Fleming, though his
                    birth be assigned to Avignon, was the first to open a seminary for musical
                    tuition in Rome, and the most famous musicians of the century were its
                    pupils—Palestrina (oδ. 1594), Orlando di Lasso <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi>
                    1594), the brothers Animuccia, the brothers Nanini, and many more. Lasso,
                    Lassus, or Latres of Mons is signalized among these for the great number and
                    great beauty of his works, and for the wide area over which he spread his
                    labours. In his own land, in Rome, in France, in England, and chiefly in
                    Bavaria, he was active as a choir-master and as a composer, and did as much to
                    advance art by making his music express the words to which it was set as by
                    teaching the executants to realize this expression in performance. He is praised
                    for breaking from the long previous practice of writing prolix florid passages
                    to single syllables, a weakness manifest in the music of his countryman Desprès
                    and of intervening writers.</p>
                <p>Several musical treatises by Spanish writers of this period are extant, which are
                    not regarded highly for the novelty of their views, nor for more than usual
                    perspicacity in the statement of them. It might have been supposed that Spain
                    would have been as favourable to the production of musical talent as Italy has
                    always been. That the contrary is the fact is, however, patent; but the
                    explanation lies with the ethnologist rather than with the musician.</p>
                <p>Though the church from time to time appropriated the secular art-forms from their
                    rise to their maturity, its chief authorities were always jealous of these
                    advances, and issued edicts against them. So in 1322 Pope John XXII. denounced
                    the encroachments of counterpoint, alleging that the voluptuous harmony of 3ds
                    and 6ths was fit but for profane uses. So too the twelfth or Ionian mode—the
                    modern scale of C major, the only one of the church modes, save under special
                    conditions the fifth or Lydian mode, that accords with the tonality of present
                    use—was stigmatized as “lascivious” and proscribed from the sanctuary. More
                    accordant with present views of propriety was the many-sided objection to the
                    employment of tunes of the people in place of the church’s plain-song as bases
                    on which to erect counterpoint, and the construction of this counterpoint in the
                    most ornate of the several florid species. Enlarging on the primitive practice
                    of adapting Latin words to popular tunes, the best approved masters, in the two
                    centuries preceding the epoch now under notice, took tunes of this class, to
                    which it is stated the original words were commonly sung by congregations at
                    least, and even by some members of the authorized choir, while other of the
                    singers had such extensive passages to execute that to make the sacred syllables
                    distinct was impracticable. The whole custom of composition and performance was
                    rigorously condemned by the council of Trent, in consequence of which Palestrina
                    was commissioned in 1563 to write music for the mass that should be truthful to
                    the spirit of devout declamation and aim ät the utmost approach to musical
                    beauty. To this end he made three experiments; the first two were declared
                    successful, and the third was accepted as the fulfilment of all that could be
                    desired for religion and for art; it was named, after the preceding pope, “Missa
                    Papae Marcelli.” This great work was set forth as the standard to which all
                    ecclesiastical composition was required to conform; and so it did conform until
                    a new musical idiom arose, until the popular ear thirsted for new forms of
                    expression, and until musicians sought and found favour in meeting the general
                    demand. In the three hundred years between that time and this, pontiffs and
                    conclaves have again and again enacted statutes to conserve the purity of
                    ecclesiastical art, but art as often has run out of control and proved that
                    every succeeding era adds to its capabilities.</p>
                <p>Despite the unbroken continuance of their use in the Roman service, great
                    ignorance now prevails as to the church modes and their permitted modification.
                    Ears trained by modern experience recoil from the uncouth effect of the melodic
                    progressions incidental to some of these artificial scales, while antiquaries
                    protest the infallibility of extant copies of music constructed in those modes,
                    and insist on the authority of such manuscripts to secure purity of performance.
                    A <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Counterpoint</hi> by Stefano Vanneo of Recanati
                    (1531), however, expressly states that the notes in the modes were subject to
                    inflexion, that accomplished singers necessarily knew what <pb break="no"

                    flats, and that these signs were never written but for the direction of boys and
                    other executants who had not attained to mastery of their art. The treachery of
                    tradition is exemplified in the loss of the rules for this once generally
                    understood practice of notai inflexion; but the inference is strong that, could
                    these rules be recovered, many of the melodies now called Gregorian might resume
                    a musical character of which they are robbed by strict adherence to their
                    written notes.</p>
                <p>In England during the 16th century choral music kept pace with the age. This is
                    evidenced in the works of Tallis and Byrde (Bird, or Byrd), who wrote for the
                    Roman ritual, and continued their labours for the Anglican service as modified
                    by the Reformation, which exercised the genius of many another, of whom Orlando
                    Gibbons was the crowning glory, for the few of his works that are accessible in
                    comparison with what he is believed to have produced are classed among the
                    masterpieces of their style and their period. The same musicians, or most of
                    them, are as notable for their secular as for their sacred writings.</p>
                <p>It was in the middle of the 16th century that the class of composition now ranked
                    as the highest was originated. The <hi rend="italic">oratorio</hi> dates its
                    existence and its name from the meetings held by San Filippo Neri in the oratory
                    of his church in Rome, at first in 1556, for religious exercise and pious
                    edification. He was the confessor and friend of Giovanni Animuccia, whom he
                    engaged to write music to be interspersed throughout his discourses. Originally
                    this consisted of <hi rend="italic">laudi</hi> or short hymns, the extent of
                    which was afterwards enlarged; by and by the spoken matter was replaced by
                    singing, and ultimately the class of work took the form in which it is cast by
                    present composers. Such is the source of the didactic oratorio; the dramatic
                    oratorio is an offshoot of the same, but is distinguished by its representation
                    of personal characters and their involvement in a course of action. The first
                    instance of this kind of writing was the production of Emilio del Cavalieri, <hi
                    rend="italic">La Rappresentazione dell' Anima e del Corpo,</hi> which, like its
                    didactic precursor, was given in the oratory of a church in Rome (1600).<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The correspondence of this
                    account with that of the rise of Greek tragedy is obvious.</p></note></p>
                <p>To the beginning of the 16th century is due a more significant matter than the
                    secularization of studied music, than the reform of the music of the church, and
                    even than the labours of those musicians of whose great names only the most
                    notable have been cited. The matter in question refers not to art-forms nor to
                    artists, but to the fact that music has its foundation in the natural laws of
                    acoustics, and thus it lays open the principle for which Pagan philosophers and
                    Christians had been vainly groping through centuries, while a veil of
                    mathematical calculation hung between them and the truth. Jean Mouton of Holling
                    in Lorraine (1475- 1522) is the earliest musician in whose works has been found
                    an example of the phenomenal chord of the dominant 7th approached with the full
                    freedom of present-day practice. The discovery is usually ascribed to Claudio
                    Monteverde, of whom and of his great art services much will be said when
                    treating of the ensuing century. Like others of the wonders of nature, the chord
                    and its application seem not to have come suddenly into knowledge, much less
                    into acceptance, but to have been experimented upon with less or more of
                    hardihood by one musician after another, until good effect had silenced dispute
                    and authorized the adoption of this beautiful harmony into the language of
                    music. The discovery of the grounds of its justification is to be traced to a
                    still later time. The speciality of the chord consists in its comprising between
                    its 3d and 7th the interval of the diminished 5th, the two notes of our diatonic
                    scale which are omitted by many primitive nations—the 4th and 7th from the
                    keynote—and which perplexed the considerations of theorists and practitioners,
                    as has in the foregoing been repeatedly shown. Speculation as to the new delight
                    the first hearing of this combination must have occasioned is precarious; the
                    opposition with which it was encountered by the orthodox is certain.</p>
                <p>Yet another prominent feature in musical history dates from the beginning of the
                    16 th century, the practice of hymnody. Luther is said to have been the first to
                    write metrical verses on sacred subjects in the language of the people, and his
                    verses were adapted sometimes to ancient church melodies, sometimes to tunes of
                    secular songs, and sometimes had music composed for them by himself and others.
                    Many rhyming Latin hymns are of earlier date whose tunes are identified with
                    them, some of which tunes, with the subject of their Latin text, are among the
                    Reformer’s appropriations; but it was he who put the words of praise and prayer
                    into the popular mouth, associated with rhythmical music which aided to imprint
                    the words upon the memory and to enforce their enunciation. In conjunction with
                    his friend Walther, Luther issued a collection of poems for choral singing in
                    1524, which was followed by many others in North Germany. The English versions
                    of the Psalms by Sternhold and Hopkins and their predecessors, and the French
                    version by Marot and Beza were written with the same purpose of fitting sacred
                    minstrelsy to the voice of the multitude. Goudimel in 1566 and Le Jeune in 1607
                    printed harmonizations of tunes that had then become standard for the Psalms,
                    and in England several such publications appeared, culminating in Ravenscroft’s
                    famous collection (1621); in all of these the arrangements of the tunes were by
                    various masters. The English practice of hymn-singing was much strengthened on
                    the return of the exiled Reformers from Frankfort and Geneva, when it became so
                    general that, according to Bishop Jewell, thousands of the populace who
                    assembled at Paul’s Cross to hear the preaching would join in the singing of
                    psalms before and after the sermon.</p>
                <p>The placing of the choral song of the church within the lips of the people had
                    great religious and moral influence; it has had also its great effect upon art,
                    shown in the productions of the North German musicians ever since the first days
                    of the Reformation, which abound in exercises of scholarship and imagination
                    wrought upon the tunes of established acceptance. Some of these are
                    accompaniments to the tunes with interludes between the several strains, and
                    some are compositions for the organ or for orchestral instruments that consist
                    of such elaboration of the themes as is displayed in accompaniments to voices,
                    but of far more complicated and extended character. A special art-form that was
                    developed to a very high degree, but has passed into comparative disuse, was the
                    structure of all varieties of counterpoint extemporaneously upon the known
                    hymn-tunes (chorals), and several masters acquired great fame by success in its
                    practice, of whom Reinken (1623-1722), Pachelbel (1653-1706), Georg Boehm, and
                    the great Bach are specially memorable. The hymnody of North Germany has for
                    artistic treatment a strong advantage which is unpossessed by that of England,
                    in that for the most part the same verses are associated with the same tunes, so
                    that, whenever the text or the music is heard, either prompts recollection of
                    the other, whereas in England tunes were always and are now often composed to
                    metres and not to poems; any tune in a given metre is available for every poem
                    in the same, and hence there are various tunes to one poem, and various poems to
                    one tune.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The old tune
                    for the 100th Psalm and Croft’s tune for the 104th are almost the only

                    some other unsignifying word; in North Germany a tune is mostly named by the
                    initial words of the verses to which it is allied, and consequently, whenever it
                    is heard, whether with words or without, it necessarily suggests to the hearer
                    the whole subject of that hymn of which it is the musical moiety undivorceable
                    from the literary half. Manifold as they are, knowledge of the choral tunes is
                    included in the earliest schooling of every Lutheran and every Calvinist in
                    Germany, which thus enables all to take part in performance of the tunes, and
                    hence expressly the definition of “choral.” Compositions grounded on the
                    standard tune are then not merely school exercises but works of art which link
                    the sympathies of the writer and the listener, and aim at expressing the feeling
                    prompted by the hymn under treatment.</p>
                <p>On the verge of the 17 th century a novelty in music was originated that was as
                    pregnant of consequence as anything that has yet been noticed; this was <hi
                    rend="italic">recitative</hi> with its special characteristics. Vincenzo Galilei
                    was one of a band of Florentine nobles and gentry who devised the appropriation
                    of music to free declamation, and they engaged authors and productive and
                    executive musicians to put the conception into practice. Galilei had already
                    come prominently into public notice in a controversy with Giuseppe Zarlino, the
                    most esteemed of all the writers on music in his age, who was the author of a
                    treatise that expounded and justified the Ptolemaic division of the scale with
                    the major and minor tones, and the former below the latter; this was answered by
                    Galilei in support of the Pythagorean doctrine of equal tones, which is confuted
                    by the phenomenon of harmonics, and Zarlino in turn replied to him. During two
                    and a half centuries the art of music had been untouched by the New Learning,
                    which had had the effect of regenerating all the other arts, and had wrought the
                    intellectual change now known as the Renaissance. The members of the Florentine
                    association thought it possible to apply ancient principles in modern practice,
                    and so to reproduce the effect to which the newly-revealed writings of Greece
                    testified, but of which these gave no such technical description as could be the
                    groundwork of any reorganization. Obviously, the poetic power of Greek music
                    must have lain in the force it gave to declamation; in exalting speech into song
                    it must have given to words a clearer yet more varied significance than they
                    could else have had, and to the passions words embody it must have given an
                    otherwise impossible medium of expression. There existed two classes of music at
                    the time under notice. The music of the people consisted of concise rhythmical
                    tunes that were either composed to accompany dancing, or so constructed that,
                    though made for singing, they were applicable to that other use; and these
                    tunes, being repeated again and again to the almost countless stanzas of some
                    ballad poems, could have in themselves no quality of expression beyond a vague
                    character of sadness or gaiety; for, what might have been expressive of the
                    prevalent feeling at one stage of a long story would necessarily be fallacious
                    in the subsequent diversities of the tale. The music of the schools consisted of
                    ingenious contrivances of wholly artificial nature, either to assign the same
                    melody to several successive voices in canonic continuance or fugal imitation,
                    or else to multiply more and more the parts for simultaneous execution; in the
                    former case definition of rhythm is annulled, as has been shown by the entry of
                    one part with a phrase while that phrase was uncompleted in another part, and in
                    the latter case the manifold melodies so obscured the sound of one another that
                    none could be distinguished,—a fact that must be self-apparent if we think of
                    the sound of twelve, or twenty-four, or so many as forty simultaneous currents
                    of song. In this music there could neither be expression nor even articulation
                    of the words, and hence, our Florentines assumed, the purpose of music was
                    perverted and its inherent poetical essence was abused. Such combination of
                    diverse melodies is now styled <hi rend="italic">polyphony,</hi> a term that
                    might better be applied to simple counterpoint in which the many sounds are
                    onefold in accent than to the florid counterpoint it is employed to define,
                    wherein the many parts have various movement. With the idea before them of the
                    ancient rhapsodists the association proposed the setting of music to verses with
                    the main, nay, only object of expressing the words. This music was not to be
                    rhythmical, but was to consist of longer or shorter phrases in accordance with
                    the literary sense; its intervals were not to be chosen with regard to their
                    melodic interest, but in imitation or idealization rather than exaggeration of
                    the rising and falling of the voice in ordinary speech, the speed being hurried
                    or relaxed by the exigency of the passing sentiment; and the accompaniment of
                    the singer was to be on some unobtrusive instrument or, later, some combination
                    of instruments, that should, as did the lyre of old, verify the intonation and,
                    in the new era (what had not been in the classic), enhance the vocal expression
                    by some pungent harmony. Applied solely to recitation, the new invention was
                    called <hi rend="italic">recitativo</hi> (recitative), <hi rend="italic"
                    >musica</hi><hi rend="italic">parlante,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">stilo</hi><hi

                    prevails as to whether <hi rend="italic">II Comlattimento d</hi><hi rend="italic

                    given to the world in 1590, were both in dramatic form, and both exemplified the
                    new, if not the revived, classic style of music. Caccini was fitted to make the
                    experiment by practice and excellence as a vocalist more than by contrapuntal
                    erudition, and he was soon associated with Jacopo Peri, a musician of his own
                    class, in the composition of <hi rend="italic">Dafne,</hi> a more extensive work
                    than the foregoing, indeed a complete lyrical drama, which was privately
                    performed in the palace of one of the Florentine instigators of the experiment
                    in 1597, or, according to some, in 1594. These two again worked together on the
                    opera of <hi rend="italic">Euridice,</hi> which was publicly represented in
                    Florence at the nuptials of Henry IV. of France with Maria dei Medici in 1600,
                    its production having been preceded by that of Cavalieri’s posthumous oratorio
                    in Rome, <hi rend="italic">La Eappresentazione dell</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Anima e del Corpo,</hi> before noticed.
                    That the first public performance of a dramatic oratorio and of a secular opera,
                    both exemplifying the recently-devised declamatory power of music, should have
                    occurred in the same year is a remarkable coincidence. That the first
                    experiments in the novel art of lyrical declamation were confided to practised
                    executants who brought their experience as vocalists to bear upon composition
                    for a hitherto untried phase of vocal effect was excellent for the purpose of
                    proving the proposition. The success of the experiment was, however, to be
                    established when a composer already renowned as such, one who had drawn
                    exceptional attention by his then new views of harmony, gave the force of his
                    genius and the weight of his name to the novel class of writing. Such was
                    Monteverde (1568-1643), who in 1607 brought out at the court of Mantua his opera
                    of <hi rend="italic">Arianna,</hi> followed in 1608 by his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orfeo.</hi> In these works, and in those of the same nature that he
                    subsequently produced at Venice, is anticipated the principle (and, so far as
                    the resources of the time allowed, the practice also) which was revived by <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0098-0087"/> Gluck some hundred and fifty years later, and of
                    which the votaries of Richard Wagner in the present day assume their hero to
                    have been the originator,—the principle, namely, that the exigencies of the
                    action and the requirements of the text should rule the musical design in a
                    lyrical drama, and that the instrumental portions of the composition should,
                    quite as much as those assigned to voices, illustrate the progress of the scene
                    and the significance of the words. The last speciality is exemplified in the
                    harmonies and figures of accompaniment, and in the appropriation of particular
                    instruments to the music of particular persons, so as to characterize every
                    member of the action with special individuality. Such must be the true faith of
                    the operatic composer; it has again and again been opposed by the superstition
                    that feats of vocal agility and other snares for popular applause were lawful
                    elements of dramatic effect; but it has ever inspired the thoughts of the
                    greatest artists and revealed itself in their work, and no one writer more than
                    another can claim to have devised or to have first acted upon this natural
                    creed.</p>
                <p>Monteverde had been attacked by Giovanni Battista Artusi for his use of what are
                    now known as fundamental harmonies, which the composer might have learned from
                    the music of Mouton (already named), but which he more probably rediscovered for
                    himself; he had defended the practice, and his theoretical assailant had
                    retorted. Polemics ran high as to the relative rights of contrapuntal
                    legislation which had been developed through the course of ages, and the freedom
                    of thought which had as yet neither rule nor tradition; for every separate use
                    of an unprepared discord was tentative as to effect and speculative as to
                    reception by its hearers. It will presently be shown that the discovery (no
                    lighter term will suffice) of Mouton and Monteverde has its base in the laws of
                    nature; here it is enough to say that it was a turning-point in the history of
                    music, the throwing open the resources of the modern as opposed to the
                    limitations of what may justly be called the archaic. The distinction of these
                    two styles was not clearly defined till long afterwards; but a writer may here
                    be named, Angelo Berardi, whose work (1687) more fully than any other sets forth
                    the contrapuntal code and enunciates the requirements in fugal writing, such as
                    the affinity of subject to answer, and whatever else marks the style and the
                    class of composition.</p>
                <p>The opera now became a fixed institution in Italy, its performance was no longer
                    restricted to the palaces of princes and nobles, and it became the best-esteemed
                    entertainment in public theatres. The dramatic oratorio was transferred from the
                    church to the secular stage, becoming in every respect a sacred opera, and only
                    specimens of this class were suffered to be represented during the season of
                    Lent.</p>
                <p>Conspicuous, as much for the merit as the multitude of his productions, was
                    Alessandro Scarlatti (1659-1725), who gave to the world 115 secular operas, many
                    oratorios, and, besides these, which might well have been a long life’s labour,
                    a far greater quantity of ecclesiastical music, some of which is characterized
                    as most dense and massive. He is accredited with three novelties in his dramatic
                    writing: the repetition, <hi rend="italic">Da Capo,</hi> of the entire first
                    part of an aria after the second part, of which, however, some specimens by
                    earlier writers are said to exist; the accompanied recitative, wherein
                    orchestral interludes illustrate the declamation and figurative accompaniment
                    enforces it, as distinguished from speaking recitative, wherein the
                    accompaniment does little more than indicate the harmony whereon the vocal
                    phrases are constructed; and the <hi rend="italic">sinfonia</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">overture</hi> which is often associated with his name, as
                    distinguished in plan from that which was first "written by Lully, his being
                    sometimes styled the French and Scarlatti’s the Italian form of instrumental

                    type="authorial"><p>The Italian “sinfonia” mostly begins with an allegro, which
                    is succeeded by a shorter adagio, and ends with a second quick movement that is
                    sometimes the resumption of the first and is sometimes independent of it, and it
                    is exemplified in the overtures to the <hi rend="italic">Seraglio</hi> of
                    Mozart, the <hi rend="italic">Euryantlιe</hi> of Weber, and several of Auber.
                    The French “ouverture” (the original form of the word, which still remains in
                    France) generally begins with a majestic movement, which is followed by an
                    allegro, often of a fugal character, and concludes with a march or gavotte or
                    some other description of dance, and it is exemplified in the overtures of
                    Purcell and nearly all of those of Handel.</p></note> Alessandro Scarlatti is
                    little less famous as a teacher than as an artist; he was at the head of all the
                    three conservatories then flourishing in Naples, and the long list of his pupils
                    includes his son Domenico and most of the other chief Italian notabilities of
                    the next generation. Conspicuous among his contemporaries were Cavalli and
                    Cesti.</p>
                <p>Opera was first introduced in France by Cardinal Mazarin, who imported a company
                    of Italian performers for an occasion. The first French opera, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Akebar, Hoi de Mogul</hi> (1646), was composed by the abbé Mailly for court
                    performance. So was <hi rend="italic">La Pastorale</hi> (1659), by Cambert, who
                    built his work on the Florentine model, and, encouraged by success, wrote
                    several others,* on the strength of which he, "with his librettist Perrin,
                    instituted the Académie Royale de Musique, and obtained a patent for the same in
                    1669, exclusively permitting the public performance of opera. Jean Battiste
                    Lully<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is the French
                    form of his names Giovanni Battista Lulli, adopted after he was taken from
                    Florence to Paris as a page.</p></note> (1633-1687) procured the transfer of
                    this patent in 1672, and by it gained opportunity not only for the exercise of
                    his own genius but for the foundation of the French national lyrical drama,
                    which to this day is wrought upon his model.</p>
                <p>The ballet had been a favourite subject of court diversion since Beaujoyeaulx
                    produced in 1581 <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Ballet</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Comique</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Royne,</hi> a medley of
                    dancing, choral singing, and musical dialogue. Lully, in his course to the
                    summit of royal esteem, had composed several pieces of this order, which were
                    performed chiefly by the courtiers, and in which the king himself often
                    sustained a part; and, experienced in the taste of the palace, and indeed of the
                    people, our musician incorporated the ballet as an essential in the opera, and
                    so in France it still remains. It was not singly in the structural intermixture
                    of dancing with singing that Lully’s operas were, and those of his French
                    successors are, unlike the works of the same order in other countries, he gave
                    such care to and exerted so much skill in the recitative that he made it as
                    interesting as the rhythmical matter, nay, varied it often with metrical vocal
                    phrases and accompanied it constantly with the full band, whereas, until
                    Rossini’s <hi rend="italic">Otello</hi> in 1818, speaking recitative (recitativo
                    parlante, recitativo secco) was always a main element in the operas of
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>In Germany the seed of opera fell upon stony ground. Heinrich Schütz wrote music
                    to a translation of Peri’s <hi rend="italic">Dafne,</hi> which was performed for
                    a court wedding at Torgau in 1627; but only importations of Italian works with
                    Italian singers came before the public until nearly the end of the century.</p>
                <p>In England the lyrical drama found an early home. The masques performed at
                    Whitehall and at the Inns of Court were of the nature of opera, and were largely
                    infused with recitative. Eminent among others in their composition were Nicholas
                    Laniere (c. 1588-1664), born of an Italian father who settled in England in
                    1571; Giovanni Coperario, who during his sojourn in Rome had thus translated his
                    patronymic of John Cooper; Robert Johnson, who wrote the original music for <hi
                    rend="italic">The Tempest; Dr</hi> Campion<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n99/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0099-0088"/>, Ives, and William and Henry Lawes. The name of
                    Henry Purcell (1658-1695) figures brightly in this class of composition; but,
                    except his <hi rend="italic">Dido and Eneas,</hi> written when he was eighteen,
                    his so-called operas are more properly spoken dramas interspersed with
                    music—music of highly dramatic character, but episodical rather than elemental
                    in the design. This is due to an axiom of Dryden, the principal and indeed the
                    model dramatist of the day, that music is not the natural medium of speech, and
                    hence may only be assigned in dramatic representation to preternatural beings,
                    such as spirits, enchanters, and witches,—maniacs also, through the abnormality
                    of their condition, being admitted into the privileged category of those who may
                    sing their conceits, their spells, their charms, and their ravings. The “frost
                    scene” in <hi rend="italic">King Arthur,</hi> the “incantation*’ in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Indian Queen,</hi> and the cantatas for Altisidora and Cardenio in
                    <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> are masterpieces of lyrical art that give
                    warrant of the success that might have been achieved had Purcell’s librettists
                    given range in the province of humanity for his vivid imagination.</p>
                <p>Earlier in the history of English opera was the production of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Siege of Rhodes,</hi> an entirely musical composition, the joint work of Dr
                    Charles Colman, Captain Henry Cook, Henry Lawes, and George Hudson, which was
                    performed at Rutland House in Charterhouse Square in 1656, under the express
                    licence of Cromwell to Sir William Davenant, and retained the stage until some
                    years after the Restoration; the existence of its music is unknown, but a copy
                    of its libretto in the British Museum amply details its construction. Separate
                    mention is made of this remarkable historical incident as serving to refute the
                    common supposition that Puritan influence impelled the decadence of music in
                    England. In truth, this influence stirred the spirit of opposition in persons of
                    a different tendency and was virtually the cause of a very powerful
                    counteraction, and through this of many highly-significant things as to the
                    perpetuation of our music of the past, if not of the continuance of our music in
                    the future. It was during the Commonwealth that John Playford printed <hi
                    rend="italic">Ayres and Dialogues,</hi> a book that comprises with many pleasant
                    pieces the first three that ever were defined by the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >glee,—</hi> a term that later times have wontedly acknowledged and boasted as
                    the designation of a class of music specially English. It was during the
                    Commonwealth that the same publisher issued several editions of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Dancing Master,</hi> each being a variation of the foregoing;
                    and this is the work to which we owe the preservation of all the beautiful
                    English ballad-tunes of earlier date that are, many of them, not to be found in
                    previous print or manuscript. It was in that very opera, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Siege of Rhodes,</hi> that Mrs Colman, daughter-in-law of one of the composers,
                    sustained the character of Ianthe, she being the first female who ever took part
                    in a public musical or dramatic performance in England.</p>
                <p>Notice must not be omitted of the application of recitative to other than
                    theatrical purpose. The cantata of Galilei has been cited; it was followed by
                    many a piece under the same designation, dramatic monologues in which the mainly
                    prevailing declamation was relieved by occasional rhythmical strains, and in the
                    composition of these Carissimi, Stradella, Clari, Purcell, and Blow have left
                    admirable specimens. Later, the term acquired a widely-changed meaning, it
                    having been applied in Germany to compositions comprising matter for solo voices
                    and for chorus, expressly for church use, and in England to works equally
                    extensive on sometimes sacred, sometimes secular subjects. Cantatas are
                    sometimes didactic, sometimes narrative, and sometimes dramatic, though never
                    designed for theatrical use.</p>
                <p>The music of the English Church might demand a separate history, because of its
                    importance by the side of the art of other lands, because of the longer
                    permanence of its examples than of works in other branches, and because of its
                    unbroken succession of contributors, covering a period of beyond three
                    centuries, whose style has varied with the age in which they wrought, but who in
                    this department have ever aimed to express themselves at their highest. Here,
                    however, only the names of the most noted writers, with an approximation to
                    chronological order, can be given —Tallis, Byrde, Farrant, Orlando Gibbons, Dr
                    Child, Dr Benjamin Rogers, Dean Aldrich (as distinguished in logic and in
                    architecture as in music), Dr Blow, Michael Wise, Pelham Humphrey, Henry
                    Purcell, Dr Croft, Dr Greene, Dr Boyce, Dr Nares, Dr Cooke, Battishill, after
                    whom the art sank in character till it received new life from the infusion of
                    the modem element by Attwood, coeval with whom was Samuel Wesley, and lastly are
                    to be noted Sir John Goss, Dr S. S. Wesley, Dr Dykes (popular for his
                    hymntunes), and Henry Smart, who bring the list down to recent personal
                    remembrance. Well esteemed among living representatives of this department of
                    music are Bamby, J. B. Calkin, Sir G. J. Elvey, Gadsby, Dr Garrett, Dr
                    Gladstone, Dr H. Hiles, Dr Hopkins, Dr E. G. Monk, Dr W. H. Monk, Sir F. A. G.
                    Ouseley, Dr Stainer, Dr Steggall, Sir Arthur Sullivan, and E. H. Turpin, to
                    which names many might be added. It must be owned, however, that the vast
                    increase of facilities for publication within recent years have multiplied
                    church music almost immeasurably, and exercised the pens more than the wits of
                    writers who prove themselves to be amateurs less by love of music than by love
                    of composing, and still more by love of notoriety, which is gratified in the
                    circulation among their own connexions of works that gain no acceptance by the
                    world at large. The style, in strictly technical sense, of music for the church
                    is and always has been, in England and elsewhere, identical with that which
                    characterizes contemporaneous music on lay subjects. Some English musicians have
                    of late aimed at, or perhaps only spoken of, a distinction of styles for the
                    church and for the chamber, and this under a supposition that to be archaic was
                    to be sacred, a supposition seemingly founded on the present use of, and high
                    respect for, more ecclesiastical music of early date than of secular music of
                    like age. The supposition overlooks the facts, however, that the church
                    appropriated the tunes of the people eight hundred years ago, while the people
                    framed some of their tunes on the peculiar church modes, that harmony was
                    practised by the people before it was employed by the church, that the style of
                    madrigals appears coincidently in sacred writing, that recitative was first
                    applied to the opera and to the oratorio in the same year, that Monteverde’s
                    innovations in musical combination were at once adopted by church composers,
                    that Purcell, Handel, and Bach wrote in onefold style for both situations, that
                    the glee-writing of the latter half of the 18th century is undistinguishable
                    from the services and anthems of the period, that Attwood had no different
                    phraseology for the cathedral and the theatre, and that even now, though
                    disguised to the glance by the antiquated notation of minims instead of
                    crotchets, the thoughts expressed and the idiom which is their medium belong not
                    more or less to the one than to the other purpose. Though contention be strong
                    for the contrary, this is true art, presenting the feelings of the time in the
                    time’s own language and not making the sanctuary walls a boundary between art
                    and artifice.</p>
                <p>Attention must now be directed to the natural as opposed to the artificial basis
                    of music. Marin Mersenne had great love and much practical knowledge of music;
                    he directed his profound learning and rare mathematical attainments to the
                    investigation of the phenomena of sound; and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0100-0089"/> his treatise <hi rend="italic">Harmonie
                    Universelle</hi> (1636) first enunciated the fact that a string yields other
                    notes than that to which its entire length is tuned. The discovery was extended
                    by William Noble and Thomas Pigot, respectively of Merton and Wadham Colleges,
                    Oxford, to the perception of the mode in which a string vibrates in sections,
                    each section sounding a different note. The ancient musicians tested by
                    calculation the few phenomena of sound then discovered rather than by
                    observation of the principles these exemplify. The measurement of major and
                    minor tones was, after the distinction of perfect intervals, the subject dearest
                    to their consideration, and it seems the furthest limit to which their knowledge
                    attained. All the laws for melody, all the rules for counterpoint, were founded
                    on this mathematical method. The step or the leap of stated intervals was
                    prescribed; combinations of sounds were reckoned by intervals from a named note,
                    as 5th, or 6th, or 3d, not as constituting complete chords traceable to a common
                    source, and intervals which are discordant were permissible only if softened in
                    effect by the previous sounding of their discordant note; the canons for the
                    progression of a single part and for the union of several parts were arbitrarily
                    devised, peremptorily fixed, and rigidly enforced. Mouton and Monteverde found
                    the good effect of musical combinations for which there was no account in the
                    theory of their time, and employed them in their works; the innovation was
                    stigmatized by musical grammarians, but it gave delight to the public and was
                    adopted by subsequent composers. No explanation was, however, given of the
                    natural source of fundamental harmonies, as chords of this class are now
                    defined, and their employment was still exceptional, still an act of daring. In
                    1673 the two Oxonians above named, simultaneously, but independently, noticed
                    the beautiful fact that a stretched string yields a different sound at every one
                    of its nodal divisions, and the same is true of a column of air passing through
                    a tube. The sounds so generated received from Sauveur<note anchored="true"

                    :—</p>
                <p>The figures under the notes show the number of each harmonic, counting from the
                    generator or prime as the 1st. The notes marked * differ in intonation from the
                    corresponding notes in our tempered scale, the 7th and 14th, and also the 13th,
                    and likewise the 17th being slightly flatter, and the 11th being slightly
                    sharper than our conventional notes; but ‘ the matter of temperament must rest
                    for later consideration. The 8th above any note is double the number of that
                    note; thus every higher C is double the number of the C below it, namely, 1, 2,
                    4, 8, 16; and so with every higher G, namely, 3, 6, 12; again with the higher E,
                    namely, 5, 10; and with the higher hB, namely, 7, 14. The number of each
                    harmonic is the same as that of its relative number of vibrations in any given
                    time as compared with those of the variously-numbered harmonics, namely, the 8th
                    above has two vibrations to each one of the note from which the interval is
                    reckoned, the 5th has three vibrations to two, and so forth throughout the
                    series. From hB to E, the 7th and 10th, is the interval of the augmented 4 th,
                    which was shunned in classic times, ignored by the Chinese, the Mexicans, and
                    the Scots, ruled against by contrapuntists, and avoided in melody and harmony
                    until employed by the Fleming and the Italian with such good effect that the
                    world accepted it under the conditions of accompaniment with which those men
                    employed it, and felt that a new element of beauty had been incorporated in the
                    resources of the artist. The occurrence, in the harmonic series, of the two
                    notes that are separated by this interval accounts for the discord they produce
                    when sounded together, not needing the artifice of preparation which is required
                    to mitigate the harshness of other discords; they are brought into being when
                    the generator is sounded, and their assignment to voices or instruments in
                    performance is but to make more articulate, or, so to speak, to confirm what
                    nature prepares—in fact, what is induced by the generator. As light comprises
                    all the colours and every gradation between each colour and the next, but yet
                    seems spotless, so every musical sound comprises all other sounds, but yet seems
                    to be one single note; the blue, or the red, or the yellow, or any other ray is
                    separated from its prismatic brotherhood and seems then a complete and
                    independent object to the vision, and so any sound is separated from the
                    harmonic column and then seems all in all to the sense of hearing. Let the
                    reader observe in the musical example that the intervals become closer and
                    closer as they rise, and that when the 8th or double of a note occurs, if there
                    be any break in the numerical succession between such 8th and the note that
                    would, by example of the lower octave, stand next below it, then some new
                    harmonic appears whose number adjusts the broken order; between the lowest C and
                    the next is no break; between this C and the one above it, 2 and 4, what would
                    else be a blank is filled by G, the third harmonic; between 4 (C) and 6 (G) what
                    would be a blank is filled by E, the fifth harmonic, and so on throughout the
                    series. No division of an interval is ever equal, the lower portion being always
                    the larger; the interval between 2 and 4 is divided into a 5th and a 4th, that
                    between 4 and 6 is divided into a major 3d and a minor, that between 6 and 8 by
                    an interval less than a minor 3d and a 2d, and that between 8 and 10 by a major
                    tone and a minor tone. It may be well to pause at this point, as it is the
                    natural justification of what Ptolemy calculated, but Pythagoras failed to
                    perceive. Thus much having been noticed, readers may be left to trace the same
                    principle of larger and smaller division throughout the series. Beyond the 17th
                    harmonic (the note known as the minor 9th when forming part of a chord) the
                    series continues on the same principle of ever lessening distance, ever finer
                    gradation, until the intervals become so small as to be almost impossible of
                    articulation and of perception. What has here been adduced of the natural
                    preparation of the discord of the harmonic 7th applies as truly to the discords
                    of the major 9th, the llth, the major 13th, the minor 9th, and the minor 13th,
                    which last is too high in the harmonic series for convenient exemplification by
                    gradual ascent in this place, and these notes are now all used in combination by
                    composers.</p>
                <p>Scientific discovery has seldom been made singly. When time has been ripe for the
                    revelation of a phenomenon, several observers have coincidently witnessed its
                    existence, and simultaneously or nearly so displayed if not explained it to the
                    world. In the instance under consideration, art foreran science, and its
                    votaries continued the employment of harmonies which as yet could alone be
                    justified by their beautiful effect, and even musical theorists did not for ages
                    to come perceive the important, the all-powerful bearing of the principle of
                    harmonics upon the subject they treated. What Mouton first ventured to write
                    must be styled the starting-point of the modem in music, and one cannot too much
                    marvel at the strong insight into the beautiful which those after-minds
                    possessed,—that, with no theory to guide, without star or compass, they <pb

                    he had exemplified, and displayed in their works its utmost power of expansion.
                    Three of the world’s greatest musicians may be cited to show the force owned by
                    genius of piercing to the utmost depth of a natural law, while having but their
                    own delicate sense of propriety to restrain them within its bounds. Henry
                    Purcell and his two colossal successors, George Frederic Handel (1685-1759) and
                    Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), wrote every combination of musical notes that
                    down to our own latest times has ever been employed with good effect; and the
                    more the works of these masters are studied the more are they found to
                    foreshadow the supposed novelties in harmony employed by subsequent artists.
                    This refers but to the technical materials of λvhich their music is wrought; it
                    is impossible in the present article to discuss fully the form and excellence of
                    their works.</p>
                <p>Purcell’s voluminous and superb works for the church, his many compositions for
                    the theatre, his countless convivial pieces, and his far less numerous
                    instrumental writings are now but little known, and the ignorance of the age is
                    its loss. They have a wealth of expression that cannot be too highly esteemed,
                    and a fluency of melody that proves the perfect ease of their production. The
                    idiom of the period in which they were written is perhaps a partial barrier to
                    their present acceptance, and the different capabilities of instruments and of
                    executants upon them of those days from the means at a modern musician’s command
                    make the music written in the earlier age difficult sometimes to the verge of
                    possibility, and yet weak in effect upon ears accustomed to later uses.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Here must be defined the
                    chromatic genus in its modern application, which is signally exemplified in this
                    master’s music; it admits of notes foreign to the signature of the key, but
                    which induce no modulation, or, in other words, change of tonality. Notes
                    expressible only by accidentals are as essential to the chromatic scale of any
                    prevailing key as are those elemental in the diatonic scale which are indicated
                    by the key-signature. Chromatic chords were used by Purcell and his nearest
                    followers, chromatic passing-notes (notes that form no portion of chords) came
                    little into use until after the middle of the 18th century.</p></note></p>
                <p>Handel’s music has never, since he wrote, been wholly unknown or unloved, at
                    least in England. He was engaged to come hither as a dramatic composer because
                    of his Continental renown; this was immensely increased by the large number of
                    Italian operas he wrote for the London stage, but, excellent of their kind as
                    are these, the change of structure in the modern lyrical drama unfits the wonted
                    witnesses of the works of the last hundred years to enjoy the complete
                    performance of those of earlier time, and hence we hear but detached excerpts
                    from any of them. It is upon Handel’s oratorios and his secular works cast in
                    the same mould that general knowledge of his mighty power rests, and these are a
                    monument that cannot perish. The <hi rend="italic">Messiah</hi> and <hi

                    rend="italic">Semele,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hercules</hi> are similarly

                    the author’s sanction in 1732, but then, as was expressly notified, without
                    dramatic action. Their success established the class of work and form of
                    representation in English use, for, though Handel subsequently wrote Italian
                    operas, he from time to time engaged a theatre for the performance of complete
                    works in concert wise, and yearly composed some new piece for production in this
                    manner. In 1741 he visited Dublin, taking the <hi rend="italic">Messiah,</hi>
                    which had been written with a view to the occa sion, and this masterpiece was
                    first heard on the 13th April 1742 in the Irish capital. The reverence with
                    which the work is regarded in England all but equals that for its subject, and
                    the countless repetitions of its performance have made it so familiar to all
                    hearers that the unversed in musical knowledge, little less than the profoundest
                    musicians, feel its sublimity and listen to it with such awe as no other work of
                    art induces. No master has ever excelled Handel in verbal declamation (as at the
                    descent on the last word of “sheds delicious <hi rend="italic">death”</hi> in
                    the air of Acis, at that on the last word of “so mean a triumph I <hi
                    rend="italic">disdain</hi>” in the air of Harapha, and the extraordinary use of
                    an almost toneless low note of the tenor voice on the last word of “He turned
                    their waters into <hi rend="italic">blood”</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Israel in
                    Egypt),</hi> in poetic expression (as in the choruses “He sent a thick darkness”
                    in <hi rend="italic">Israel,</hi> and “Wretched lovers” in Acts <hi
                    rend="italic">and Galatea),</hi> or in dramatic characterization (as in all the
                    personages in <hi rend="italic">Jeρhtha,</hi> who are each distinguished from
                    the others far better in their musical than their verbal phraseology); but the
                    quality in his music which compels the epithet sublime is the broad, simple
                    grandeur of the choral writing, which, rich in the devices of counterpoint,
                    never fails in clearness, never in the melodious flow of each of its parts, and
                    is hence as pleasant to executants as it is perspicuous to auditors. He wrote
                    under the sway of contrapuntal law, from which theorists had not yet defined the
                    exceptions, but the force of his genius broke occasionally through its
                    despotism, and so, in his works as in Purcell’s, the principle of fundamental
                    harmony and the application of the chromatic element are freely
                    demonstrated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A custom
                    of the age is largely and, we now feel, sadly exemplified in Handel’s art
                    legacies, namely, the writing in many instances but an outline of the score
                    which was to be filled up extemporaneously by a player on the organ or
                    harpsichord with counterpoint that is necessary to the effect, and even
                    essential to the idea. So long as the composer lived to make these
                    improvisations, we know they added interest and we doubt not they added beauty
                    to the music; but afterorganists lack the ability or courage or both to supply
                    the deficiency. Mendelssohn wrote for <hi rend="italic">Israel</hi> such an
                    organ part as he would have played in the performance of the oratorio,
                    diffidently deliberating &lt;5n what originally was trusted to the fortune of
                    the moment, and the like has rarely been done by other musicians for other
                    works. Mozart wrote for the <hi rend="italic">Messiah, Aris, Alexander's
                    Feast,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ode for St Cecilia’s Day</hi>
                    wind-instrument parts comprising such matter as might have been played on the
                    organ had one been in the hall wherein these pieces were first performed in
                    Vienna; but they modernize the character and often alter the idea, while they
                    complete and perhaps adorn the music. That these parts exist, and that their
                    merit induces their adoption when the works are performed, have been a licence
                    for the production of “additional accompaniments” to many a masterpiece of
                    Handel, when sucKgenius as Mozart had has not inspired the writer. The former
                    custom and the later licence are both to be deplored, particularly in our age,
                    when with regard to other arts the aim prevails to purify the works of older
                    time from additions by strange hands that have accumulated to disfigure
                    them.</p></note></p>
                <p>Bach was one of a very large family of musicians, who for two centuries practised
                    the art, in many instances with great success; the family glory culminated in
                    him, and was scattered among his many sons, in whom it became extinct. Bach was
                    a more assiduous student than either his predecessor or his contemporary who are
                    here classed with him. It was later in life than they that he issued his
                    earliest works, for his youthful renown was more as a player than as a producer.
                    Having no theoretical instructor, he made searching study of all the music of
                    earlier times and of his own.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0102-0091"/> from profounder musicians, he owed his views of
                    plan or design in the structure of a composition to his familiarity with the
                    concertos of Antonio Vivaldi and Tomaso Albinoni, both Venetian violinists who
                    visited Germany, and he gained this familiarity by arranging for the organ many
                    of the concertos for several instruments, as also much that the same authors
                    wrote for a single violin. His arrangement consisted in adding parts to the
                    original, which he kept intact, and so retained the plan while enriching the
                    harmony. To his latest days he was wont to retouch his own music of former
                    years, doubtless with the purpose of improvement, and he thus showed himself to
                    be still a student to the very end of his career. A class of oratorio of which
                    Luther had planted the earliest germ, the recitation of the Divine Passion, had
                    grown into extensive use in North Germany prior to the period of Bach, and to
                    this belongs his largest if not most important work. This is his setting of the
                    portion of St Matthew’s Gospel which narrates the incidents, interspersed with
                    reflective passages, some taken from the chorals of common use in the Lutheran
                    and Calvinistic churches (the tunes proper to which have special harmonic
                    treatment when here appropriated), and some set in the form of airs, duets, and
                    choruses to verses written for the occasion. Bach set also St John’s version of
                    the Passion, and others. He wrote likewise for church use cantatas peculiar to
                    every Sunday’s requirement in the Lutheran service, and left five series of
                    these, each for an entire year. He produced other sacred and many secular
                    cantatas, a mass of such colossal proportions that it is unavailable for the
                    purpose of celebration, other pieces for the Roman Church, very much for the
                    organ alone that has never been equalled in its intrinsic qualities or as a
                    vehicle for executive display, many concertos and suites for the orchestra of
                    the day, and a vast number of pieces for the harpsichord or clavecin. Among
                    these last must be signalized <hi rend="italic">Das wohltemperirte Clavier</hi>
                    (1722), and a sequel to the same, <hi rend="italic">XXIV. Pre-ludien</hi><hi

                    distinct works are now commonly classed together as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Forty-eight Preludes and Fugues.</hi> To describe their purpose reference must
                    be made to the discrepancies between the tuning of intervals by 3ds, or by 8ths,
                    or by 5ths. The B⅛ which is reached by successive 3ds above C, has 250
                    vibrations in the same period that the C, which is reached by 8ths from the same
                    starting note, has 256, and in the same period that the B⅛ which is reached by
                    5ths from the original C, has 259 and a fraction. The same is true of every
                    other musical sound as of C, namely, that tuning by 3ds, or 8ths, or 5ths,
                    yields a different note from the other two. Hence it results that notes which
                    are in tune in one key are out of tune in other keys, and consequently musical
                    composition was of old limited to those very few keys that have several notes in
                    common with the key of C.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>It is supposed that early organs were tuned with true 3ds and flattened 5ths
                    (the “mean tone” system of Zarlino and Salinas), and Mersenne enunciates, though
                    obscurely, a rule for this division.</p></note> The organ Handel presented to
                    the chapel of the Foundling Hospital, London, had the raised or black keys
                    divided, with each half to act on pipes different from the other half, and thus
                    gave different notes for C⅛ and for Db, and the like; and other organs of the
                    period were similarly constructed. Bach’s notion was so to temper the intonation
                    that, while the tuning of no key should be perfect, the discrepancies should be
                    divided so nicely between all keys that no one would be offensive to the hearer,
                    and to illustrate this he wrote in his 38th year a series of pieces in every one
                    of the keys in its major and minor form, calling it “The clavier with equal
                    temperament.” This bears on a supposition, once diffidently advanced and since
                    confirmed by men who have soundly studied the subject, as much as by constant
                    observation of him who first conceived it, although disputed by others; it is,
                    that the ear receives tempered sounds as they should be, instead of as they are,
                    perceiving a different effect from the note whose tonal surroundings prove it to
                    be Gb from that which is yielded by the same string on a pianoforte when it is
                    required to represent F$. Such is the practical application in modern use of the
                    term enharmonic with reference to keyed instruments when it means the giving
                    different names to one note; on the voice, however, and on bowed instruments the
                    smallest gradations of pitch are producible, and so all notes in all keys can be
                    justly tuned, which, among others, is one reason for the exceptional delight
                    given by music that is represented by either of these means. The enharmonic
                    organ and harmonium of Mr Bosanquet are provided with a keyboard of a general
                    nature in which the restriction to closed circles of 5ths is avoided. Systems
                    reducible to series of 5ths of any character can therefore be placed on this
                    keyboard. As the relative position of the keys determines the arrangement of the
                    notes, the fingering is the same in all keys, and depends only on the intervals
                    employed. The modern use of the word chromatic has already been stated, and it
                    only remains to say of the other of the three Greek genera, diatonic, that the
                    term now defines music consisting of notes according to the signature of the
                    prevailing key.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some
                    theorists use the generic terms in limited sense :—diatonic, proceeding by 2ds;
                    chromatic, proceeding by semitones; enharmonic, changing the name of a
                    note.</p></note> To return to Bach, his orchestration is completer than
                    Handel’s, though yet needing the addition of an organ part that he did not
                    write, but his scores are liable to misrepresentation in modern performance
                    because several of the instruments are obsolete for which they were designed;
                    Bach’s orchestral treatment differs from that of later days in having often a
                    special selection of instruments for a single movement in a work, which are
                    engaged throughout that piece with small variety of interchange, and likewise in
                    having mostly the separate counterpoint for every instrument employed instead of
                    combining instruments of different tone in one melody. But seldom Bach wrote in
                    one or other of the ecclesiastical modes, as did Handel more rarely, and he used
                    more freely than his contemporary the extreme chromatic discords. He may indeed
                    be regarded as a double mirror, reflecting the past in his contrapuntal writing
                    and forecasting the future in his anticipation of modern harmonies.</p>
                <p>Notice of these two extraordinary men would be incomplete without an attempt to
                    parallel if not compare them. Born within a month and within walking distance of
                    each other, speaking the same tongue, professing the same religious tenets,
                    devoting themselves to the same art and to the same productive and executive
                    branches of that art with success that cannot be surpassed, they were as
                    different in the character of their works as in their personal traits and their
                    courses of life. The music of Handel for its simple, massive, perspicuous
                    grandeur may be likened to a Grecian temple, and that of Bach to a Gothic
                    edifice for its infinite involution of lines and intricacy of detail. The
                    greater complexity of the one makes it the more difficult of comprehension and
                    more slow in impression, while the sublime majesty of the other displays itself
                    to a single glance and is printed at once on the mental vision. Handel wrote for
                    effect and produces it with certitude upon thousands; Bach wrote as a
                    pleasurable exercise for mastery, and gives kindred pleasure to those who study
                    his work in the spirit that incited him to produce it.</p>
                <p>Contemporary with the working of these two glorious Saxons were the labours of
                    Jean Philippe Rameau (1683- <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n103/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0103-0092"/> 1764), a native of Dijon, who made his mark on
                    history. He wrote many operas and ballets which are held in less esteem than
                    those of Lully, some cantatas and sacred pieces, and a large number of
                    compositions for the organ and clavecin, but, notwithstanding the merit of these
                    and their success, it is more as a theorist than as an artist that he is now
                    regarded. He published several treatises, embracing principles of performance as
                    well as rules of harmony and a system of composition, and the original views
                    these enunciate have obtained high regard. He distinguishes what he styles the
                    “basse continue” from what he names the “basse fondamentale” in tracing inverted
                    chords to their roots, and differs in this from writers on counterpoint who
                    treated only of intervals from each actual bass note. Thus he looked in the
                    direction of later theories of fundamental harmony, but scarcely obtained sight
                    of the object. He speaks of a chord of the 11th apart from the suspension of the
                    4th; but his examples show this to be the double suspension of the 9th and 4th,
                    to be resolved on the root and minor 3d of a chord of the prepared 7th, which
                    further has to be resolved on a chord whose root stands at a 4th above its own,
                    and so this chord, having nothing exceptional in structure or treatment, needs
                    no distinctive title. Another point is indeed original, and has obtained
                    somewhat wide acceptance; this is his theory of the chord he defines as the
                    “great 6th,” which is named the “added 6th” by his English followers. It
                    consists of a common chord (usually of the subdominant) with a 6th added, and
                    its resolution is on the chord whose root is at a 4th <hi rend="italic"
                    >belσw</hi> that of the discord, the 5th in the former chord being retained as
                    the root in the latter.</p>
                <p>Against this view it may be urged that all harmonic intervals are at uneven
                    numbers from the generator, the even numbers standing for the octaves above any
                    of these, as j 2 5, <hi rend="superscript"> 0r e</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript">
                    se</hi> * <hi rend="superscript"> or t</hi> hθ <hi rend="superscript"> ιr</hi>
                    inversions, as g γ, and hence the 6th (D in the above example) is not an
                    original but an inverted interval; further, whatever note may be added in a
                    column of harmony does not affect the concordance or discordance of the notes
                    below it, but is itself the discordant element in the chord, whereas the
                    addition of the 6th to a common chord changes its concordant 5ths into a
                    discord, and therefore the 6th must be otherwise traced. Other theorists have,
                    more in the direction of truth, defined this chord as a first inversion,
                    reckoning the 6th from the bass as the inverted root, but giving no account of
                    its exceptional resolution. It was not till the following century that the
                    theory for this chord was propounded with the seeming of truth, showing that the
                    7th below its given bass (G under the F in the above) is the real generator, and
                    showing this to be an incomplete inversion of the chord of the 11 th, of which
                    Rameau invented but misapplied the name. The subject will be more fully
                    discussed when the period is treated to which this last theory belongs.</p>
                <p>Benedetto Marcello (1686-1739) was a Venetian of wealthy parentage. He was
                    pressed by his father into the pursuit of the law, and held lucrative
                    appointments in his profession, but his love was for music, and in music he has
                    some renown, partly for his compositions, the best known of which are the
                    settings for one or more voices of fifty of the Psalms in an Italian version,
                    and partly for his writings an music, especially a satirical pamphlet, <hi
                    rend="italic">Il Teatro alia moda</hi> (1720), as remarkable for the justice
                    with which it censures the corruptions that cankered dramatic art as for its
                    humour. This treatise quotes the principles of the Florentine assumed musical
                    revival in 1600, and is regarded as the precursor of the practical reform
                    effected by Gluck.</p>
                <p>The renowned Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) is often accredited as a musical
                    theorist because of his several publications on the subject, especially his <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictionnaire</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Musique,</hi> which was finished in 1764, licensed in 1765, but not published
                    till 1768. Its repute must have been gained by the grace of his language rather
                    than by the soundness of his views, which are elegantly stated but rarely stable
                    when they look to either side of the beaten track of accepted principles. He
                    wrote violently against French music and the French language as a musical
                    medium, being prominent in the literary disputes known as the “Guerre des
                    Bouffons,” but recanted when Gluck’s genius was exercised on French opera.
                    Rousseau produced some slight musical dramas, but proof has been adduced that
                    they were the works of other hands.</p>
                <p>Padre Martini (1706-1784) worked to far higher purpose than the last named, and
                    the deeper impression he made on music is due to the depth of his knowledge. He
                    was a mathematician and a scholar in other branches of learning, all of which he
                    brought to bear upon his musical studies. He composed for the church and for the
                    theatre vocal and instrumental chamber music, and pieces for the organ. He
                    enunciated no new theory, but rendered great service by the collected
                    publication of many art rarities exemplifying the musicianship of earlier times,
                    and proving his ability to estimate their merit by the inclusion of a large
                    number of canons of his own, which latter are presented in the enigmatic form of
                    ancient use wherein the primary part or parts alone are given, and the reader
                    has to discover the canon that fixes the period and the interval at which the
                    response is to enter. He issued at different dates three volumes of a <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Music,</hi> and did not live to complete the fourth,
                    which would have brought the subject only down to the Middle Ages. He was
                    revered by the musicians of all lands, and he is honoured by those of our own
                    time for the penetration with which he discovered the excellence of the boy
                    Mozart, and the encouragement that aided largely to confirm the self-reliance of
                    this everlasting prodigy.</p>
                <p>German opera owes its birth to Reinhard Keiser of Weissenfels (1673-1739). His
                    first dramatic effort, <hi rend="italic">Is</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    r</hi><hi rend="italic">mene,</hi> was produced at the court of Brunswick.
                    Success induced him to further exertion in the same field, and its continuance
                    enabled him to undertake the management of the Hamburg theatre, in which,
                    between 1694 and 1734, he produced 116 operas. Even these were but a portion of
                    his works, for he wrote several dramatic oratorios, and made more than one
                    setting of <hi rend="italic">The Passion,</hi> which last preceded the
                    compositions of the class by Handel and Bach. Little of his music survived him,
                    but his influence on the art of his country was enduring. Matthison
                    distinguished himself in Keiser’s theatre, which also was the scene of the young
                    Handel’s first dramatic essays. Karl Heinrich Graun, a singer, and Johann
                    Friedrich Agricola belong to the next generation of writers of German opera,
                    both of whom won large renown.</p>
                <p>It is now time to revert to dramatic music in Italy. Giovanni Battista Buononcini
                    (1672-1750) and his brother Marc Antonio were famed in and out of their own
                    country. They both visited London, where the former opposed Handel, and the
                    rivalry between the Italian and the German musician is notable in the history of
                    the time. Nicola Antonio Porpora (1686-1767) owes his fame more to the success
                    of his pupils in singing, of whom Farinelli and Caffarelli were the most
                    distinguished, than to the merit of his numerous compositions. Leonardo Leo <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n104/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0104-0093"/> (1694-1746) wrote largely for the stage, but is
                    most prized for his church music, which is of a character so different from his
                    other productions that he is entitled to the twofold estimation of being a light
                    and a severe composer. Johann Adolph Hasse (1699-1783), though born in the
                    neighbourhood of Hamburg, wrote all his many operas, except the first, to
                    Italian words for Italian singers, and may therefore be best classed among the
                    composers of that country, where also he received his musical education. His
                    excellence as a tenor singer, his skill as a clavecinist, and his marriage to
                    Faustina Bordogni, the renowned vocalist, all helped to bring him and his music
                    into note. His remark, when at the age of eighty he superintended the production
                    of his last opera at Milan coincidently with Mozart’s bringing out of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Ascanio</hi><hi rend="italic">in Alba</hi> when fourteen years
                    old, that “this youngster will surpass us all,” says as much for his penetration
                    as for the diffidence of one who had passed a long life with success. Giovanni
                    Battista Gesi (1710-1736), being born at Pergola, was called by his schoolmates
                    II Pergolese, and is known by all the world under this instead of his family
                    name. Little acknowledged while he lived, he accomplished during his almost
                    momentary career such work as places his name among those of the most famous of
                    his countrymen. His comic opera <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Serva</hi><hi rend="italic">Padrona,</hi> little noticed when first given in
                    Naples, had such success when reproduced in Paris that it was shortly afterwards
                    played in every country in Europe. If this piece did not initiate it confirmed
                    the application of music as much to subjects of real as of heroic life, and
                    therefore, though slight in structure and brief in extent, it is historically
                    conspicuous. This and his setting of the <hi rend="italic">Stabat</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mater</hi> for female voices, which occupied him during his last
                    illness, are the compositions by which he is best remembered. Nicolo Jomelli
                    (1714-1774) was born and died in the Neapolitan territory; he produced many
                    operas in Naples, several in Rome, Bologna, and Venice, and he held for fifteen
                    years an engagement in Stuttgart, where his genius was active; he is
                    particularly esteemed for his expression of sentiment, in which quality some of
                    his critics account him the forerunner of Mozart; much as he wrote for the
                    stage, his predilection was for church music, but the amount of his erudition or
                    his power to apply it scarcely justified this preference. This composer may
                    close the present list, as being the first to break through the example of
                    Alessandro Scarlatti, and to write airs without the “Da Capo” which general
                    approval of that example had rendered conventional if not indispensable. The
                    plan claims respect as proving and fulfilling design, but it is inconsistent
                    with truthful treatment of a subject which naturally proceeds in a continuous
                    course and does not admit of the plenary recapitulation of feeling that has
                    already been developed after this has passed into a different direction; as a
                    matter of effect, the “Da Capo” is rarely charming and often tedious, it is less
                    inappropriate in instrumental than vocal music, and even there some modified
                    allusion to previously stated ideas is far more interesting than the unqualified
                    restatement of what has already been set forth. One characteristic must be named
                    that marks the whole period under present survey—the subordination of dramatic
                    propriety to the display of vocal specialities; these were classified in
                    distinct orders, and custom became tyrannic in exacting that every singer in an
                    opera should have an aria of each class, and that the story must be so conducted
                    as to admit of their timely or untimely introduction. The entire action of the
                    Italian opera of the period is conducted in spoken recitative, with few
                    exceptions of accompanied recitative in the most impassioned situations, and the
                    arias or rhythmical portions of the work are episodical, being expatiative or
                    reflective on the circumstances. The volubility that then was esteemed the main,
                    if not the highest, qualification of a vocalist had its imperative exercise in
                    all works for the stage, and the original purpose of dramatic music was thus
                    foiled in making the business of the scene to wait upon the exhibition of the
                    representative.</p>
                <p>Instrumental music now began to assume the importance which at present it holds
                    by universal suffrage. Compositions for the organ by Italian and German masters
                    had been numerous, but executancy on bowed instruments was little advanced, and
                    music written for them was accordingly limited in its style and construction.
                    Vivaldi has been named as a pioneer in the art of design, and to the precedent
                    set by him must be attributed the power of unfolding and arranging musical
                    thought which gives to the orchestral and chamber works of after time a supreme
                    position as intellectual and imaginative exercises. The name of Arcangelo
                    Corelli (1653-1713) figures prominently in the annals of violin playing, but,
                    whatever the merit of his tone and his style, he employed but a limited portion
                    of his instrument’s compass; and this is proved by his writings, wherein the
                    parts for the violin never proceed above D on the first string, the highest note
                    in the third position; it is even said that he refused to play, as impossible, a
                    passage which extended to A in altissimo in the overture to Handel’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Trionfo del Tempo,</hi> and took serious offence when the composer
                    played the note in evidence of its practicability. His compositions are still
                    highly esteemed; they consist of <hi rend="italic">concertos—</hi> a term which
                    at the time defined concerted pieces for a band, not, as now, pieces for a solo
                    player with orchestral accompaniment—and sonatas, some for one, some for two
                    violins with a bass; they are melodious, but their harmony is not always pure,
                    and, strange to say, though they were written in Italy, where the laws of rhythm
                    and accent were first established, these are slighted in the music; indeed, the
                    longevity of Corelli’s works must be due to some other cause than their
                    merit.</p>
                <p>Giuseppe Tartini (1692-1770) greatly advanced the art of the violinist, as is
                    testified by his compositions for the instrument and his treatise on its
                    capabilities, and is further proved by the eminence of many of his pupils.
                    Tartini contributed to science as well as to art in his discovery (1714) of
                    “resultant tones,” often called “Tartini’s tones,” and yet some writers ascribe
                    the first perception of the phenomenon to Storge, a German, who described it
                    sixteen years later. The phenomenon is this :— when any two notes are produced
                    steadily and with great intensity, a third note is heard, whose vibration number
                    is the difference of those of the two primary notes. It follows from this that
                    any two consecutive members of a harmonic series have the fundamental of that
                    series for</p>
                <p>E their difference tone—thus, <hi rend="smallcaps">q,</hi> the fourth and fifth
                    harmonic, produce C, the prime or generator, at the interval of two octaves
                    under the lower of those two notes; <hi rend="smallcaps">q,</hi> the third and
                    fifth harmonic, produce C, the second harmonic, at the interval of a 5th under
                    the lower of those two notes. The discoverer was wont to tell his pupils that
                    their doublestopping was not in tune unless they could hear the third note; and
                    our own distinguished player and teacher Henry Blagrove (1811-1872) gave the
                    same admonition. The phenomenon has other than technical significance; an
                    experiment by the Rev. Sir F. A. G. Ouseley showed that two pipes, tuned by
                    measurement to so acute a pitch as to render the notes of both inaudible by
                    human ears, when blown together produce the difference tone of the inaudible
                    primaries, and this verifies the fact of the infinite upward range of sound
                    which transcends the perceptive power of human organs. The obverse of this fact
                    is that of any sound being deepened by an 8th if the length of the string <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n105/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0105-0094"/> or pipe which produces it be doubled. The law is
                    without exception throughout the compass in which our ears can distinguish
                    pitch, and so, of necessity, a string of twice the length of that whose
                    vibrations induce the deepest perceivable sound must stir the air at such a rate
                    as to cause a tone at an 8th below that lowest audible note. It is hence
                    manifest that, however limited our sense of the range of musical sound, this
                    range extends upward and downward to infinity.</p>
                <p>The pianoforte owes its invention to the period now under review. This instrument
                    may be styled the voice of the musician, the only means whereby unaided he can
                    give complete utterance to his thoughts, the only vehicle for the communication
                    of musical ideas in their entirety. This is not said in depreciation of other
                    instruments of various excellence which have qualities impossible to the
                    pianoforte, but has reference to the totality of musical speech that is
                    possible, and to the convenience with which this is produced on the instrument
                    in question. The characteristic difference between this instrument and earlier
                    ones of a similar class is that the strings of the pianoforte are struck by
                    hammers impelled by the keys under the performer’s finger, and yield louder or
                    softer tone according to the force he uses, whereas its predecessors yielded
                    variety of loudness only by mechanical instead of personal means, and hence were
                    not the living exponents as it is of the executant’s impulse. Whether one speak
                    of the happiness kindled in the homestead by this most facile and most
                    self-sufficient instrument, or of the fuel of such happiness, namely, the
                    measureless amount of music of every style and quality that has been written for
                    the pianoforte, its existence is to be accounted as an influence all but
                    infinite upon society as much as upon art. The term “pian e forte” is applied to
                    a musical instrument by Paliarino or Pagliarini, a manufacturer of Modena, in
                    1598, but no particulars have reached us of its structure or effect. Some
                    instruments which foreshadow the chief essentials of the modern pianoforte, made
                    by Bartolomeo Cristofori, a Paduan then working in Florence, are described in
                    letters of 1709, and must have been made some years earlier, and pianofortes by
                    this ingenious inventor still exist bearing date 1720 and 1726. Marius, a
                    Frenchman, submitted plans for an instrument with hammer action to the Académie

                    Gottfried Silbermanq in 1726, who worked from the designs of Cristofori.<note

                <p>Let us now revert to the opera, in which vast modifications were germinated
                    towards the middle of the 18th century, and ripened before its close into noble
                    maturity. Allusion has been made in the notice of Pergolese to the appropriation
                    of the lyric element to comic subjects. At first wholly unregarded as a sphere
                    for art uses, then admitted for interludial purposes in a fabrication styled <hi
                    rend="italic">intermezzo</hi> that was played between the acts of a serious
                    composition, comedy became in course of time the basis of the most highly
                    important, because the most comprehensive and truly the grandest, and further
                    because the most especially musical, application of the art to dramatic ends.
                    The class of writing here to be considered is that structure of concerted vocal
                    music through which a continuous action proceeds, involving the embodiment of
                    the characteristics of the several persons concerned, with their opposition and
                    combination. Handel had been remarkably happy in uniting in one piece the
                    utterances of three, four, and even five distinct persons; he did not, however,
                    make these several individualities interchange speech in dialogue, but caused
                    them to sing, as it were, so many monologues at once, each independent of the
                    others, and Handel was not singular in his occasional practice though he was in
                    his excellence. Nicolo Logroscino (1700-1763), a Neapolitan, who never would
                    write but to the dialect of his own country, was so exclusively comic and so
                    surpassingly successful as to gain the cognomen of “Il Dio dell’ opera buffa.”
                    It was he who first enchained a series of pieces (technically styled movements)
                    in unbroken sequence, during which different persons entered or left the scene,
                    discoursed in amity or disputation, or united either in the outpouring of a
                    common sentiment or in the declaration of their various ^passions. For some time
                    this form of lyrical dramatic art was only applied to comic subjects; Paesiello
                    is said to have been the first musician who introduced its use into serious
                    opera; it reached perfection under the masterly, magical, nay, superhuman touch
                    of Mozart, whose two finales in <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi> and two in <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Giovanni</hi> are models which should be the wonder of all
                    time and yet can never be approached. The spoken drama is limited to the onefold
                    utterance of a single person, for, however rapid the colloquy, if any two spoke
                    together, each would eclipse the other’s voice—retort may be instantaneous, but
                    cannot be simultaneous. In a painting the different characters and emotions of
                    the persons presented are shown at once, but, as if under the glance of Medusa,
                    they are fixed for ever in one attitude with one expression. In an opera finale
                    the manifold passions of as many human beings, vivified by the voices of the
                    same number of singers, come at once on our hearing with prolonged
                    manifestation, and this is the wielding of a power that is not in the capability
                    of any other of the fine arts.</p>
                <p>Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714-1787) was a Bohemian by birth, and a wanderer by
                    habit. He was a grand reformer, or rather restorer, of dramatico-musical art,
                    yes, and a prophet, for he not only revived the principles enunciated in
                    Florence on the threshold of the 17th century, which had been superseded by the
                    vocalisms that had usurped the throne of truth, but he fully forestalled by this
                    revival all that is good in what is nowadays denoted by the cant term “music of
                    the future.” As was the wont of his age, Gluck went to extend his art
                    experience, perhaps to complete his education, to Italy, and there produced so
                    many meritorious works in the style of the time as to establish a high
                    reputation. This led to his engagement to write for the Italian Opera in London,
                    whither he came in 1746. The work he composed for this occasion and one he then
                    reproduced met with small favour, and a “pasticcio” from his previous works, <hi
                    rend="italic">Piramo e Tisbe,</hi> had no better fortune. The failure brought
                    the conviction that, whatever the abstract merit of music, a piece that was
                    appropriate to one character in one situation could not be fitted to another
                    personage under different circumstances, and that admired pieces culled from
                    different works could not be concocted into a whole with appearance of unity.
                    Gluck therefore resolved to abandon the prevailing customs in writing for the
                    stage, and to devise a system of dramatic composition wherein the musical design
                    should grow out of the action of the scene, being ever dependent upon and
                    illustrative of it, and yet being always a design faithful to the principles of
                    what may be named musical architecture. As did Monteverde and his
                    contemporaries, so did this composer aim to distinguish his dramatic persons by
                    assigning music of different character to each; he required that the overture
                    should announce the cast of feeling and thought that was to pervade the work,
                    and he strove to make the whole of the music appropriate to the individuals, to
                    the situations in which they were concerned, and to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n106/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0106-0095"/> words they uttered. He did not reject the
                    essential of rhythmical melody, which is ever necessary to a musical work, and
                    which stands in relation to passages of pure declamation as metaphor in poetical
                    speech stands in relation to circumstantial statement. An orator will pause in
                    the disclosure of facts to enforce them by the mention of a similitude, or
                    brighten them by reflexions from his own mind, and it is an application of the
                    same art when a character in a drama stays to comment on the scene in which he
                    is involved, and show in words the passion that is seething in his heart.
                    Analogous to this is the occasional arrest of intercourse between the musical
                    persons for the expression of the feeling by which one is swayed, and such is a
                    song in an opera during which, if the action be stagnant, the character more
                    than elsewhere proves its vitality. Plan in a musical work consists (1) in
                    uniform or contrasted rhythm, (2) in the relationship and enchainment of keys,
                    (3) in the development and elaboration of phrases, and (4) in their occasional
                    recurrence. Some plans have by frequent appropriation become to a great extent
                    conventional, and their philosophic basis accounts for and justifies the fact
                    that much music is framed upon them; it is the special province, however, of the
                    writer for voices, and still more so of the writer for the stage, to ignore
                    convention, though never to neglect design, and to construct his plans according
                    to the situations they are to fill and to the materials with which he has to
                    work. For sixteen years Gluck pondered the prevalent improprieties and the
                    possible proprieties of dramatic art, and prepared himself by technical study
                    and polite conversation to strike the blow which was to effect a revolution, the
                    while, strange to say, he wrote several operas in his old style for production
                    in different towns of Italy, Germany, and other countries. At length in 1762
                    what he meant to be the representative work of his then matured principle, <hi
                    rend="italic">Orfeo ed Euridice,</hi> appeared in Vienna and made strong
                    impression. Some lighter pieces filled the interim between this, which without
                    exaggeration may be regarded as an event in musical history, and the production
                    in the same city of <hi rend="italic">Alceste</hi> (1767). The opera was
                    published, as also was <hi rend="italic">Paride</hi><hi rend="italic">ed
                    Elena</hi> (1769), each with a statement of the artist’s views; and these two
                    essays have since been regarded as constituting a grammar of dramatic music.
                    Gluck was not content with the Viennese reception of the works on his new model,
                    and was less so with the accessories that city afforded for giving theatrical
                    effect to his compositions. He went, therefore, to Paris, wrote music to an
                    adaptation of Racine’s <hi rend="italic">Iphigénie</hi><hi rend="italic">en
                    Aulide,</hi> which fulfils his purpose in a higher degree than his previous
                    pieces, and brought it out with extraordinary success. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orphée</hi><hi rend="italic">(</hi> 1774), <hi rend="italic">Alceste</hi>
                    (1776) (both rearranged from the Italian versions), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Armide</hi> (1776), and lastly <hi rend="italic">Iphigénie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">en Tauride</hi> (1779) rose each to a loftier level, and met with
                    just acceptance.</p>
                <p>It must be owned that other forces concurred with musical merit in Gluck’s
                    Parisian triumphs. He had taught singing to Marie Antoinette before she became
                    dauphiness, and she now was an ardent partisan of her former instructor. Mme. Du
                    Barry held a rival court to that of the young princess, her jealousy of whom and
                    of her state was evinced by every possible means. Accordingly she invited to
                    Paris Nicola Piccini (1728-1800), and strove to establish him in opposition to
                    the German master. His <hi rend="italic">Poland</hi> set to a libretto by
                    Marmontel was brought out in 1777, anticipating the subject of Gluck’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Armide·,</hi> it was followed by other French operas, and the
                    contest ended with the production of his <hi rend="italic">Iphigénie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">en Tauride</hi> (1781), subsequently to that with the same title,
                    the masterpiece of his opponent. This musical warfare much resembled that of
                    some forty years earlier between Handel and Buononcini in London, when the king
                    headed the partisans of the German and the Prince of Wales those of the Italian
                    artist; but the Parisian feud was waged with far the greater violence, for, not
                    only were the courts of the two ladies involved in it, but every literatist of
                    note sided with one or the other faction, and hurled poems, or pamphlets, or
                    essays, or critiques at his antagonists, that were crammed with remorseless
                    invective. It pretended to be a dispute as to national style, but was a quarrel
                    between two leaders of fashion. Piccini’s music is marked by the melodious grace
                    for which his country claims pre-eminence, Gluck’s by the graver thought by
                    which the Teutonic muse is more distinguished. Gluck, however, was not profound,
                    he was no contrapuntist, and his often grand and always expressive harmony
                    sprang more from intuition than knowledge; Piccini had dramatic power, and he
                    advanced greatly Logroscino’s invention of continuous concerted music
                    conformable to the business of the scene, but applied this only to comic operas,
                    and so turned it to no account in his compositions for Paris. His most
                    successful production, <hi rend="italic">La buona Figliuola</hi> (1760), passed
                    from its birthplace, Rome, to every European capital, and is not even now
                    forgotten.</p>
                <p>The origin, development, and supreme importance of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >symphony</hi> next claim our attention. The term is and always has been used in
                    Italy to define the instrumental preface, which elsewhere is called an overture,
                    to a long vocal work. Handel and others, early in the 18th century, defined by
                    it an instrumental piece incidental to such a work, generally depicting some
                    supposed action, such as a battle, or a multitudinous entry. The term is also
                    applied to the prelude and interludes in a single vocal piece of however small
                    extent. Its significance is far more comprehensive in the application now to be
                    described. Its nearest analogy among earlier compositions is to what of old was
                    called a concerto, and the two names, derived respectively from Greek and Latin,
                    have at root the same meaning. Like the antecedent concerto, the symphony is a
                    composition, consisting of several movements or self-complete divisions, for a
                    full band; unlike its predecessor, the plan of at least its first movement has
                    in the course of years been so distinctly organized that musicians shrink from
                    applying the definition symphony to any work wherein there is not the aim to
                    fulfil this design. At first the term was loosely employed, for even so late as
                    Haydn’s visits to London in 1791 and 1794 the symphonies he wrote for first
                    performance there were sometimes announced as such, sometimes as overtures, and
                    sometimes as “full pieces.” Its structural requirements especially connect it
                    with works for the chamber, which, if for one or two solo instruments, are
                    styled <hi rend="italic">sonatas,</hi> if for three or four or more, <hi
                    rend="italic">trios</hi> or <hi rend="italic">quartets,</hi> or what not,
                    according to the number of parts they comprise. The word “plan,” always used by
                    that distinguished teacher Cipriani Potter (1792- 1871) as meaning musical
                    design, happily, because positively, expresses the arrangement of ideas
                    according to a purpose, to which, being intangible and invisible, the word
                    “form” is but metaphorically applicable. Sebastian Bach, Corelli earlier, and
                    Purcell before them, designated compositions as sonatas which, however, are not
                    modelled on the plan of the modern symphony.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The earliest use that has been traced of the term sonata or
                    suonata is in its application to some pieces for the organ by the uncle and
                    nephew Gabrieli, who wrote in Venice towards the end of the 16th century. They
                    form portions of larger works of which the rest is vocal; they are brief,
                    solemn, and slow, and are seemingly designed to pour <hi rend="italic"
                    >sound</hi> in long continuance or in large masses. Similar pieces by early
                    German masters have the same definition, and the next generation extended the
                    plan by appending a quick movement.</p></note> Bach in some of his later
                    preludes and in other instances has the incipient germ from which the plan has

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0107-0096"/> wherein it is more developed. These musicians
                    were by no means the first, however, to strike the vein of ore for which
                    divination seems to have been carefully in search long prior to their labours.
                    This justifies the belief that its source is in nature, that it was discovered,
                    not created, by man’s genius; and the work of successive generations of artists
                    has been to rear and mature that which, having once been found, is the heirloom
                    of the present and the future. The practice of all ages proves common consent
                    that a musical composition must begin and end in one and the same key, and this
                    statement refers not more to our own time than to that of the ancients, whose
                    modes are comparable though not identical with the keys of modern establishment.
                    Continuance of one key throughout a piece of considerable length would be
                    monotonous; to relieve this, modulation is effected into other keys in the
                    course of a composition. To obtain tonal variety without violence, the choice of
                    alternative keys must be made first and chiefly from those which have the
                    nearest tonal relationship to the primary key. After the harmonic 8th (which is
                    a miniature of the 1st) the harmonic 5th is next in prominence, from this note a
                    chord rises as complete as that of the generator, from this chord a second key
                    proceeds by natural evolution; the note, the chord, the key, are each named the
                    dominant, since dominating, commanding, or defining the tonality of the
                    fundamental note. The key of the dominant is hence the one most often chosen for
                    the principal alternative to the primary key if the latter be major; but the key
                    of the 3d and that of the 6th are occasionally selected instead by a further
                    application of the harmonic system. If the primary key be minor, the choice of
                    the chief alternative key is often made in the contrary direction; the tonic
                    itself is assumed to be a harmonic 3d or else a 6th, and the chief modulation is
                    made to the key at one of these intervals below the original keynote, having
                    reference to the submediant or the mediant as the source whence the minor form
                    of a key is derived. Besides the chief alternative, other keys, more or less
                    frequent, more or less remote, according to the greater or less length of a
                    piece, are also employed in the course of a composition. The distribution of
                    keys constitutes the ground-plan and the elevation of a musical structure; the
                    style of harmony, whether diatonic or chromatic, whether contrapuntal or
                    massive, is its material; the ideas, or subjects, or themes, or phrases, or
                    figures, or—as of late they have been whimsically named— motives, stand for the
                    ornamentation, such as portico, frieze, statuary, and carving, which are
                    sometimes essential in a design. This, then, is a brief summary of the plan of
                    the first movement of a symphony—a first subject in the primary key, which
                    consists of a single idea, or of several connected by tonal identity though
                    melodically distinct; a second subject in the chief alternative key, which also
                    may be onefold or manifold in its matter; and these first and second subjects
                    complete the first part. Thus far has been but a simple statement of ideas,
                    which is here followed by a working of the same matter, drawing from it what
                    varieties of expression it may yield through compression or expansion by means
                    of any or every resource of the musician’s art; the second part is aptly often
                    named the free fantasia, because unrestricted to a fixed course of modulation,
                    the composer’s creative power being at full liberty as to course of keys and
                    manner of development; then for the first time the music reverts to the primary
                    key for a retrospect of the entire matter of the first part, with, however, all
                    that belongs to the second subject transposed from the chief alternative key
                    into that which is the origin and centre whence all the modulations radiate;
                    lastly, there is often, but by no means always, a coda, which is a summing up of
                    the whole argument, or a valediction to the hearer. The first movement, always
                    cast in this mould, is succeeded generally by one in a slow tempo, sometimes
                    planned like a first allegro, sometimes otherwise, according to outlines that
                    cannot here be detailed, and this exhibits the sentiment of the artist, as did
                    the preceding his scholarship and ingenuity. Then follows generally (again one
                    must say, for there is no necessary prescription) a movement of lighter
                    character than either of the foregoing, sometimes having the musical shape of a
                    dance such as the minuet, sometimes having an arbitrary plaη which still is
                    based upon harmonic, and therefore natural, and consequently philosophical,
                    principles. To conclude, there is a movement that is sometimes constructed like
                    the first and is sometimes as complicated, but in other instances has an
                    arbitrary design. Such is the highest class of musical composition: firstly,
                    because it is wholly musical, springing entirely from the artist’s imagination
                    without the prompting of words, needing no words to express its meaning to the
                    auditor, being in itself poetry; secondly, because it may comprise every means
                    within the author’s power to wield melody,—counterpoint, harmony,
                    modulation,—all that but for the symphony would be special to the fugue,
                    orchestration, and, above all, the arrangement of ideas in a consistent logical
                    method with reference to principles that are the very foundation of art. Let it
                    be hoped that this outline of the elements, essence, and plan of the symphony
                    justifies the use of the words supreme importance in reference to the class of
                    composition at the outset of these remarks.</p>
                <p>Haydn (1732-1809) is commonly styled the father of the symphony. If truly, then
                    Carl Philip Emanuel Bach (1714-1788), the second of the many sons of the great
                    Sebastian, stands as grandfather in the genealogy of that species of music; and
                    its remoter ancestry may be traced to all but forgotten men in whose works is
                    certainly a forecast of the plan above described. C. P. E. Bach wrote 18
                    symphonies, and upon these and upon the instrumental chamber music of the same
                    author, Haydn avowedly modelled the plan of his compositions. The earlier writer
                    had not the profundity of his father, nor the grace of Haydn, but his music
                    represents the transition from one to another use in instrumental writing, and
                    it fixed the plan which, however it may be expanded, can never be disestablished
                    from the canons of art. Haydn produced the marvellous number of 125 symphonies
                    (some of them, indeed, were overtures for theatrical use), besides 77 quartets
                    for bowed instruments (the last one unfinished), 52 pianoforte sonatas, and
                    pieces that are almost countless for various combinations of instruments; and in
                    these one knows not whether to wonder more at the infinite fluency of melody or
                    at the artistic mastery. In summing up the enormous amount of his works regard
                    must also be given to his 3 oratorios, his 14 masses, his operas, and his many
                    detached pieces for one and several voices, and then it is hard to believe that
                    all this can have been accomplished in a single life.</p>
                <p>f Next in chronology as a symphonist stands Mozart (1756-1791). Particular
                    comparison must be made of these dates with those of Haydn, as illustrating the
                    relation of the mighty musicians to each other, and the influence each may be
                    supposed to have exercised on his friend—for warmest friends they were and
                    truest estimators of each other’s powers. If the young Mozart profited by
                    Haydn’s example, as doubtless he did, the old Haydn learned greatly from
                    Mozart’s, for there is so obvious a rise in the character of his music from the
                    beginning to the end of his long career as shows that he was under a continuous
                    course of self-schooling. It is because his was self-schooling, and because he
                    seems to have had no distinct principle of harmony, but to have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n108/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0108-0097"/> experimented without infallible success on every
                    unusual combination he wrote, and because likewise in orchestration his writing
                    often appears to have been tentative rather than proving intuition of an effect
                    and a means for its production—it is for these reasons, in spite of his
                    prodigious command of counterpoint, that he may without disrespect be classed
                    after the man whom circumstances compel us to regard as his rival. Mozart wrote
                    48 sym-^∙ phonies, some of them in the tenderest ’ years of childhood, and
                    repeated the design in many chamber works for several or for a single
                    instrument. These differ in merit, mainly, it may be assumed, because some were
                    written to meet the exigencies and the limitations of particular occasions; but,
                    every one compelling admiration, the last three are conspicuous among the music
                    of all time for the excellence of each and for their difference in character
                    from one another, and these were composed in less than seven weeks, between 26th
                    June and 10th August 1788, during which interval several other lesser and larger
                    pieces also were produced, some for voices and some for instruments. The
                    symphony in E flat, No. 46, is notable for sweetness and playful grace; that in
                    G minor, No. 47, is a torrent of passionate fervour; and that in C, No. 48 (in
                    England named Jupiter), is a combination that has never been surpassed of all
                    the means possible to a musician. In the final movement of this last, a fugue is
                    wrought on the symphonic plan, which is also the case in the overture to the
                    author’s latest opera, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Zauberflöte,</hi> a completer fusion than has elsewhere been made of the two
                    most distinguishable art-forms, and the formalism is hidden under the beauty of
                    the ideas.</p>
                <p>History now steps on to the great name of Beethoven (1770-1827), who in his 9
                    symphonies, his 6 concertos (which are pieces on the same plan with the addition
                    of a part for a solo instrument), and his priceless bequest of chamber music
                    commands the world’s adoration. It is the shallow practice of the present day to
                    depreciate his two great predecessors, especially Mozart, in his favour; but
                    comparative criticism is to ill purpose if it can only exalt one master by the
                    dethronement of another. Beethoven enlarged the symphony, in some respects
                    changed its character, and perhaps advanced its consideration; above' all, after
                    writing for a while in the idiom of those two masters, he stamped his own
                    individuality upon music. One finds, however, a prototype for each thing critics
                    describe as particularly Beethovenish in the writings of Mozart, so that the
                    manifest originality of the later musician lies in the new aspect given by happy
                    expansion to prior existences more than in the creation of new forms of thought.
                    Though he often strove at fugal excellence, he was a child at counterpoint as
                    compared with the two adults who preceded him, and he lost rather than gained
                    fluency in this branch of art as his life proceeded. The ideas of a great artist
                    bear the impress of his age, which is remarkably the case with the musical
                    thoughts of Beethoven, and as his age was nearer to our own, so is his frame of
                    mind more congenial with that of present hearers than are those of Haydn and
                    Mozart. The figure may be reversed; the individuality of an artist is the matrix
                    in which the feelings and thoughts of his age, and still more of the age that
                    next follows him, are moulded, but there must be affinity of temperament between
                    the one and the many for this interchange of impressions to be possible. We of
                    to-day have Beethoven and the consequences of Beethoven, and the influences of
                    these have been active in the interval between our time and the period previous
                    to the French Revolution; and the political, moral, and artistic changes that
                    have been wrought by the ones upon the many as much as by the many on the ones
                    indispose us to the recognition of the beautiful under its earlier aspect. Let
                    us delight in Beethoven— who can fail ?—but let us also love Mozart and revere
                    Haydn. Two points are notable in Beethoven’s instrumental music—(1) the linking
                    together of the several movements of a work which usually are separated by an
                    interval of silence; but such union is in some of Mozart’s early symphonies and
                    some also of Emanuel Bach’s; (2) the expression of feelings excited by subjects
                    external to the music and entitling works accordingly, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sinfonia Pastorale,</hi> and sonata, <hi rend="italic">Les Adieux,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Γ Absence,</hi><hi rend="italic">et le Retour·,</hi> but Dietrich
                    Buxtehude of Lübeck had a century earlier produced seven pieces characteristic
                    of the seven planets, and Vivaldi had represented the four seasons in as many
                    concertos, to say nothing of the chaos which opens Haydn’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Creation.</hi> Beethoven’s professed purpose in this last particular was to
                    give utterance to impressions rather than to present pictures, and such is the
                    legitimate scope of music, which is not an imitative but an expressive art.</p>
                <p>Next in time came Spohr (1784-1859), whose deliciously-phrased rich-toned
                    symphonies have lost regard in late years, but not beauty. Of his seven
                    symphonies, four bear titles which refer them to an objective purpose; but <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi> they are still subjective, for the personality of the
                    writer is expressed in every bar. Mendelssohn (1809-1847) did less but achieved
                    more than Spohr; far less numerous, his instrumental writings for the
                    concert-room and for the chamber have vitality and permanence which are not in
                    those of the other master; they belong as much to hereafter as to now, while
                    those of Spohr are already of the past. Mendelssohn too made musical pictures,
                    owning that “as Beethoven had opened the road it was impossible not to follow;”
                    his two finest symphonies, those in A and in A minor, represent, though not so
                    entitled by him, his impressions of Italy and. Scotland, and his characteristic
                    overtures are translations into sound of the poems after which they are named.
                    He also, in more than one instance, joined the several movements of a work, and
                    he employed other devices—his own by felicity of appropriation more than by
                    first use—for enforcing the relationship of the several portions of a musical
                    structure. Schumann (1810-1856) has suffered through the persistence of his
                    partisans in comparing him with another instead of displaying and extolling his
                    own merit. Party spirit and the opposition it kindles has passed, and the
                    delicacy, often subtle in its refinement, the grace, the deep feeling, the
                    ingenuity, but rarely grandeur, that mark his symphonic and chamber music, are
                    now fully perceived. Johannes Brahms is a <hi rend="strikethrough">⅛iny</hi>
                    worker in this class of art who has already planted his foot in the future and
                    given warrant for transmitting to the coming generation the great model he
                    received from the past, which, because of the masterpieces that have been cast
                    in it, justly bears the name of classical. Cherubini (1760-1842) is the one
                    Italian known to have written a symphony, and this work gives small reason for
                    regret that it stands thus alone; he arranged the same as a violin quartet and
                    wrote two original pieces of this class. Méhul (1763-1817) is the French
                    representative of the symphonic art best known and best esteemed.</p>
                <p>The Englishmen who have best succeeded in this highest form of music are Dr
                    Crotch (1775-1847), Cipriani Potter, J. Henry Griesbach (1798-1875), Henry
                    Westrop (1812-1879), and Sterndale Bennett (1816- 1875). The last-named cannot
                    be passed with a mere mention. The wide recognition of Bennett’s genius at home
                    and in Germany distinguishes him; far more so does the quite individual charm of
                    his music, and most of all does the tender age at which he wrote his best works
                    and the facility with which he produced them. Three of his pianoforte concertos,
                    one of his symphonies, and four of his concert overtures may be cited as
                    representative pieces, wherein sometimes the plan, always the <pb break="no"

                    the treatment of the instrument are peculiar to the author in sweetness and
                    elegance; the eternal riddle of the beautiful is propounded in every cadence,
                    and still defies analysis, still remains unsolved. As living writers in this
                    department, Aguilar, Banister, J. F. Barnett, Cowen, Davenport, Walter
                    Macfarren, Hubert Parry, Prout, Stanford, Stephens, and Sullivan must be
                    named.</p>
                <p>To have spoken of orchestral music compels notice of instrumentation as an
                    element of the art that has high significance. It is analogous to colouring with
                    the painter, being extra to the composition or plan of his work, but essential
                    in vivifying and varying its effect. Its root is the appropriation of passages
                    to the capabilities of instruments for which they are designed, and this is
                    planted in the earliest as much as the latest essays in composition. Its trunk
                    and branches are the combinations of voices and instruments of the same or
                    different qualities of tone, so as to give greatest prominence to the chiefest
                    parts in a musical texture, so as to produce effects of sound which cannot be
                    yielded by the means separately used, but are liable to infinite diversity from
                    the manifold compounds in which they are clustered, and, most of all, so as to
                    secure distinctness of every part in the complex woof which strikes the ear as
                    onefold. Instrumentation may be styled the chemistry of sound, which by the
                    synthesis of distinct tones produces new organisms; it is the blending of any of
                    the rays of the musical prism which produces previously unheard colours. Mozart
                    was the first to evince the very fine sense which perceives the parity and
                    disparity of qualities, how some sounds will mix with and some will penetrate
                    through others, how some instruments by pouring forth a stream of harmony may
                    enrich or nourish a melody that floats on its surface in another quality of
                    tone. Prior musicians had used instruments in alternation for variety of effect,
                    or in combination for the sake of loudness; but it was Mozart that both
                    originated and perfected instrumentation as above described, and it has been
                    practised with more or less success in so far as his principles have been
                    fulfilled, with more or less failure in so far as his principles have been
                    abandoned. In two centuries instruments have undergone large modification, and
                    their treatment has been modified accordingly. Writing for the harpsichord is
                    widely different from that for the pianoforte, which also has been changed in
                    character from generation to generation of composers, not only because of
                    improvements in the manufacture of the instrument, but because of enlarged
                    insight into its capabilities; hence the music of Emanuel Bach, Mozart, Dussek,
                    Beethoven, Clementi, Cramer, Hummel, Moscheles, John Field, C. Μ. von Weber,
                    Mendelssohn, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, Thalberg, Sterndale Bennett, and Anton
                    Rubinstein forms a continuous scale of development in aptitude and diversity.
                    The transformation of the viol of various sizes into the violin, violoncello,
                    and double bass of present use is a subject for special history, but its course
                    is inseparably associated with the names of the great Cremonese manufacturers,
                    Andrea Amati (1540), his two sons and his grandson, the family Guanarius, and
                    Straduarius, who all practised their craft as an art more than as a trade,
                    setting each the stamp of his own genius on the instruments he produced and
                    leaving models that have never yet been equalled. The extended resources of
                    bowed instruments have come wholly through extended skill of executants,
                    especially of Viotti <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Rudolphe Kreutzer, Rode,
                    Baillot, Paganini, Spohr, De Beriot, Molique, Ernst, Blagrove, Sivori, Sainton,
                    Vieuxtemps, Joachim, and Carrodus on the violin; of Crosdill, Cervetto, Lindley,
                    and Piatti on the violoncello; and of Dragonetti and Bot-tesini on the double
                    bass. The entire construction of flutes and reed instruments was changed by
                    Theobald Boehm (1794-1881), and all makers now work upon his principle.
                    Facilities have been increased on each of these classes of instruments, but on
                    horns and trumpets modern use has in some respects diminished them; that is,
                    employing only notes of the harmonic scale, players of the time of Purcell,
                    Handel, and Bach practised so constantly in the upper register that they easily
                    produced the 12 th harmonic and above this sometimes notes up to the 18th, and
                    these they executed with volubility akin to that displayed on fingered
                    instruments; it is now the custom to exercise the lips on the lower notes and on
                    longer continued sounds, and hence the passages written by the elder masters are
                    difficult to the verge of the impossible to present practitioners, and a totally
                    different character distinguishes modern from earlier music for brass
                    instruments. On the other hand, Charles Joseph Sax (1791-1865), and far more his
                    still living son Adolphe, have devised such systematic changes in the
                    fabrication of all brass instruments as to give them an entirely new place in
                    the orchestral category; by means of the pistons of their sax-horns, cornets,
                    and saxophones, these instruments yield the complete chromatic scale, which,
                    superficially, appears to be an advantage; but, save for military bands, the
                    alteration is a serious evil and has an incalculably pernicious effect upon the
                    orchestration of the day. This strong but careful statement is justified by the
                    beautiful effects in music written earlier than the use of valves, from the
                    characterization, firstly, of particular keys in a musical composition;
                    secondly, of certain chords in the keys; and, thirdly, of special notes in each
                    of these chords through appropriation to them of selected sounds from the
                    limited harmonic series, whereas composers who apply Sax’s invention to
                    orchestral use reduce the band to a one-toned machine that has the same quality
                    throughout its range. Let proof be drawn from example; in the andante in A flat
                    in Beethoven’s symphony in C minor, the horns and trumpets are crooked in C,
                    they can therefore be used but for peculiar notes in the primary key of the
                    piece, but they give especial tone to the key of C, into which the music thrice
                    modulates, that distinguishes it from the entire context; in the finale of the
                    same master’s symphony in F the return to the primary key from the remote
                    tonality of F sharp minor is marked by the tone of the F trumpet, whose keynote
                    is the enharmonic of the E sharp of the foregoing harmony; and yet again, in the
                    “dona nobis” of the same master’s mass in D, the phrases for the trumpets in B
                    flat are distinguished from what surrounds by the tone and the key, and thus
                    give technical significance to the author’s purpose, “a prayer for peace in the
                    midst of war.” Inability to resist the temptation of the semitonic scale, and so
                    to use “sounding brass” as freely as instruments of more delicate tone and
                    greater natural volubility, is exemplified in the writings of many a living
                    musician, and regretted by many of his admirers.</p>
                <p>A class of opera, defined in French as <hi rend="italic">opéra comique,</hi>
                    dates ostensibly from 1715. The definition is unsound, because, whatever the
                    subjects of the first pieces so styled, it is often applied to works of a
                    romantic, serious, or even tragic nature. The separation of this from the grand
                    opéra lies in the latter having music throughout, its rhythmical pieces being
                    divided by accompanied recitative, while the opéra comique consists of music
                    interspersed with spoken dialogue. The distinction arose from what was
                    considered an infringement of the patent of the Parisian Opera House by a
                    company who performed musical pieces at the Théâtre de la Foire, and an
                    agreement between the two establishments was authorized at the date above cited
                    to the effect that the assumed intruder must have speaking in every piece it
                    presented. The name of Rameau is the earliest of note among composers of this
                    class of work, and his success in <hi rend="italic">I.’Endriaque</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n110/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0110-0099"/> (1721) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >I.'Enrôlement</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Arlequin</hi>
                    (1726), which were comical enough in plot to sanction the definition, procured
                    hearing for his larger and graver dramatic efforts. Most conspicuous of those
                    who later have gained fame as composers of opéras comiques are Monsigny,
                    Dalayrac, Grétry, Méhul, Boieldieu, the profound Cherubini, Halévy, Auber,
                    Ambroise Thomas, and Gounod, many of whom also produced masterly pieces in the
                    other class of opera. The <hi rend="italic">singspiel</hi> is the German
                    parallel to the opéra comique, and its examples comprise some of the greatest
                    works that adorn the lyric stage. Among these are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Entführung aus dem Serail</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Zauberflöte</hi> of
                    Mozart, the <hi rend="italic">Fidelio</hi> of Beethoven, which stands above
                    comparison with all dramatic music save only the <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Don Giovanni</hi> of Mozart, and suffers not in being
                    placed side by side with these prodigies of genius and mastery, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Faust</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Zemira</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >und</hi><hi rend="italic">Azor</hi> of Spohr, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Freischütz</hi> of C. Μ. von Weber, and <hi rend="italic">Heimkehr aus der
                    Fremde</hi> of Mendelssohn. It was a novelty of Weber to break from set forms in
                    his dramatic monologues and frame from the promptings of the situation a special
                    plan for each, which has frequent variations of tempo but always coherence of
                    key, and which never fails to manifest a conceived and fulfilled design; and
                    this successful innovation, as much as their musical merit, gives historical
                    importance to his works for the stage. Spohr, with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jessonda</hi> (1823), was the first to appropriate continuous music with full
                    orchestra to the German stage, and he wrote in the journals to defend his
                    innovation, which had been preceded in Italy by Rossini with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Otello,</hi> wherein the “recitativo parlante” was for the first time in that
                    country discarded. Spoken dramas profusely interspersed with music and called
                    operas have had vogue in England since the time of Purcell, whose genius was
                    cramped by the literary conceit that music was unfit for expression of human
                    feelings on the stage. The principle was superseded, but the form resulting from
                    it was preserved in the <hi rend="italic">ballad operas,</hi> which from 1727
                    for more than a century were the sole vehicles for music in our theatres; but
                    these had the speciality that for the most part their music consists of the
                    popularities of the day and rarely includes original composition. Dr Arne,
                    Stephen Storace, Shield, Dibdin, and Sir H. R. Bishop wrote all the music for
                    pieces of this class, and the last appropriated, or modified, or restored to its
                    pristine form the glee in his dramatic works, and by specimens of this he is and
                    will be chiefly remembered. In 1834 a new impulse was given to English opera by
                    the warm welcome of John Barnett’s <hi rend="italic">Mountain Sylph,</hi> which,
                    though it has speaking, is far more essentially musical in structure than its
                    predecessors, and it has been followed by many a work of merit by the same hand,
                    by Balfe, E. J. Loder, Wallace, and others, several of these being wholly
                    lyrical, according to the requirements of French grand opéra.</p>
                <p>Side by side with the activity in other countries just reviewed was the progress
                    of opera in Italy. Important contributors to this were Giovanni Paesiello
                    (1741-1815) and Domenico Cimarosa (1749-1801), who both wrote extensively,
                    succeeded greatly, and impressed the art with their specialities. Of vastly
                    greater consequence in the future was Mozart, who produced many Italian operas,
                    and, of all musicians that have ever composed for the theatre, brought dramatic
                    music the most nearly to perfection in fitness to the scene, delineation of
                    character, and technical design. The name of Rossini (1792-1868) is conspicuous
                    in the history of opera from the once universal fashion to admire his writings,
                    from the new manner of vocal flourishes he introduced, which strongly tended to
                    revive the inconsistencies against which Gluck had striven, from the ardent
                    imitators who at the time of his triumphs emulated his peculiarities, from his
                    entire change of style in his later productions, and from his all but ceasing to
                    produce during nearly forty years. The languishing Bellini (1802-1835) and the
                    spirited and far more prolific Donizetti (1796-1848) proved their artistic
                    strength by avoiding the Rossini idiom, but neither can be accredited with
                    asserting a style. Giuseppe Verdi has proved melodic creativeness equal to
                    either of theirs, with a stronger power of characterization and a better regard
                    for the exigencies of the scene.</p>
                <p>A new species of composition has sprung into being within these thirty years,
                    which in France is defined as <hi rend="italic">opéra bouffe,</hi> and in
                    England as <hi rend="italic">comic opera,</hi> but is totally distinct from the
                    opera buffa of Italy or the opéra comique of France, while less unlike the
                    intermezzo of Italian use in the 18th century. It may be described as burlesque,
                    sometimes of stories that have held mankind’s respect for ages, sometimes of
                    modern social absurdities, but having the ridiculous for its main quality, and
                    extravagant in every essential. It consists of an intermixture of lightest and
                    most frivolous music with spoken dialogue, and depends as much on its literary
                    sprightliness as on its musical tunefulness, for success. It may be said to have
                    been originated by Offenbach (1819-1882) of Cologne, who settled in Paris when
                    young, where in 1855 he engaged a theatre for the production of his lyrical
                    caricatures, initiated them with <hi rend="italic">Les Deux Aveugles,</hi> and
                    wrote in all sixty-nine pieces. He has several imitators in the country of his
                    adoption, and is represented in England by Sir Arthur Sullivan.</p>
                <p>Operatic history may be epitomized in a few sentences. The Greek tragedy was
                    essentially lyrical, and it portrayed the characters and the incidents with
                    which all who witnessed were intimate. It fell asleep with the other forms of
                    classic art, to be awakened at the end of the 16th century · but those who aimed
                    at restoring it to the active world chose subjects from the antique which
                    stirred the wonder more than the sympathy of their audiences. Regard for the
                    gods and heroes of ancient myths, or for the figures of mediaeval chivalry, who
                    were little less outside general familiarity, long gave an artificial air to
                    theatrical writing. It was the comic branch of opera that first broke from the
                    trammels of the pedagogue, and in representing people of its own time applied
                    the grandest attribute of music—the expression of passions common to us all
                    under circumstances experienced by us all in phraseology familiar to us all. In
                    the pieces for the Countess and the Count in <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi>
                    Mozart rose to earnestness, and in those for Donna Anna, Ottavio, and the
                    Commandant in <hi rend="italic">Don Giovanni</hi> still higher to the grandest
                    tragedy, and always on the lips of persons in a period so near to our own that
                    we recognize our own feelings in their utterances. The preternatural is also
                    shown to be within the range of this art in the music of the Statue in <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Giovanni,</hi> which may confidently be compared for effect
                    with the ghost scenes in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> in answer to those who
                    raise quarrelsome questions as to the relative power of music and speech to
                    embody analogous situations. All musicians since Mozart have chosen subjects,
                    however serious, from modern history or from still later modern life, and the
                    preternatural has exercised the imagination of Spohr, Weber, Marschner, and
                    Barnett, to whom Mendelssohn must be added on account of the fragments of <hi
                    rend="italic">Loreley.</hi></p>
                <p>During the last thirty years Richard Wagner (1813-1883) has striven to
                    revolutionize the lyrical drama by his polemical writing, by his compositions
                    for the theatre, of which he is the twofold author of words and notes, and by
                    his extraordinary means of bringing these conspicuously before the public. His
                    principles were all gathered from antecedent reformers; their application was
                    his own. His works of art are, by himself and his supporters, professed to be

                    them from dramatic and musical censure. The very remarkable commotion he has
                    made in the world of art might be compared with that excited by the rivalry
                    between Buononcini and Handel in London and that between Piccini and Gluck in
                    Paris, but that these were in each instance the contention between one musician
                    and another, whereas in the present case it is the opposition of one writer to
                    all the musicians in the world, save the few members of the profession who,
                    believing in the man, his doctrine, and his power to apply it, undertake
                    propagandism as a duty, and endeavour to make proselytes to their faith.
                    Wagner’s recent death has left judgment free as to his theoretical and practical
                    merit <hi rend="italic">; a few</hi> years will determine the permanence or
                    evanescence of his productions, and an article on his name in the present work
                    may be written far enough from now to chronicle the result.</p>
                <p>Within the present century the oratorio has undergone large modification,
                    somewhat in structure and more in style. Haydn’s <hi rend="italic">Creation</hi>
                    is planned on the model of the several settings of music to the recitation of
                    the Divine Passion which were frequent from the date of the Reformation till the
                    18th century was one-third advanced. Its text consists of a Bible narrative
                    interspersed with reflective verses which have no pretension to be defined as
                    poetry. The work was said to have been suggested to the composer by his hearing
                    some of Handel’s oratorios during his two visits to England, but it differs in
                    character as widely from these as was natural in coming from a musician whose
                    genius, however great, was wholly unlike that of his predecessor. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Seasons,</hi> by the same master, has a secular subject which
                    is secularly treated, and in this, equally with the other, the manner of the
                    author, as evinced in his instrumental music, is ever apparent. Beethoven’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Mount of Olives</hi> is in dramatic form, though changed into
                    narrative in several English versions. The portions of this that have most
                    interest are those which are the least sacred— for instance, the chorus of the
                    soldiers who come to seek and then to arrest the Accused of Iscariot. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Deluge,</hi> by Schneider, is also a drama by a modern hand.
                    It and the <hi rend="italic">Moses</hi> of Marx have sent only the reputation of
                    their esteem into England. Spohr’s three oratorios—especially <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">letzten Dinge,</hi> known here as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Last Judgment</hi> —bear so strongly the impress of his speciality
                    in the constant prevalence of the chromatic element throughout them, and in the
                    rich but always transparent orchestration, and they were so largely imitated by
                    contemporaries, that they may be said to have opened an epoch which, however,
                    was early closed. Far more important in themselves and in their influence are
                    the two works of the class by Mendelssohn, with which may be associated the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lobgesang</hi> (Hymn of Praise), written to commemorate the 400th
                    anniversary of the invention of printing. In these the dramatic, the narrative,
                    and the didactic elements all appear, the first so conspicuously and so grandly
                    in consonance with the spirit of the time that it specially distinguishes the
                    works as they do the master who, through them, holds a rank in England as a
                    sacred writer all but parallel to that of Handel. The influence of Mendelssohn’s
                    oratorios is obvious in the works of other musicians, and public approval
                    attests it to be an influence for good. Compositions styled oratorios have been
                    produced by Liszt and Gounod which seem to aim largely at novelty, but a future
                    generation must judge whether they have struck the mark. In England, Crotch’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Palestine</hi> emulated Handelian precedent, and stood for
                    long alone as a native production. Many years later Sir Sterndale Bennett’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Woman of Samaria</hi> won wider sympathy. The living writers who
                    have courted and gained fame in England by longer or shorter oratorios are J. F.
                    Barnett, Sir J. Benedict, Sir Μ. Costa, and Sir A. Sullivan.</p>
                <p>With some pleasure and some regret must be mentioned the active exertions of John
                    Curwen (1816-1880), a Nonconformist minister, with a large staff of adherents,
                    in the promulgation of a professedly new musical system under the title of
                    “Tonic Sol-fa”: pleasure, because of the wide extension of musical study
                    resulting from his indefatigable zeal; regret, because perhaps a larger and
                    certainly a better result would have rewarded like energy in the propagation of
                    musical knowledge in the shape that has grown into maturity through eight
                    centuries, and possesses the whole world’s acceptance. He who is honoured as the
                    founder of the system professed to have derived it from Miss Glover of Norwich,
                    whose method he but modified and expanded; but hers was based upon the ancient
                    gamut already described, omitting the constant recital of the alphabetical name
                    of each note, together with the arbitrary syllable that indicates its key
                    relationship, and omitting too the recital of two or more of these syllables
                    when the same note is common to as many keys, as “C, Fa, Ut,” meaning that the
                    note C is the subdominant of G and the tonic of C. The notes are represented by
                    the initials of the seven syllables still used in Italy and France as the fixed
                    names of the seven notes; but in “Tonic Sol-fa” the seven letters refer to key
                    relationship and not to pitch. Further, the system has a wholly different
                    terminology from that in universal use. It would be uncandid not to state that
                    many men of greatest eminence outside the musical profession and many musicians
                    support the system; here may only its bare principles be stated and not its
                    merits discussed. A somewhat analogous action has, at the same time, been busy
                    with regard to musical notation in France. Émile Chevé (1804), a surgeon in the
                    French marine service, having married Nanine, the sister of Aimé Paris, learned
                    from her the views of her brother (who had adopted them from Galin) as to
                    another new system of musical notation, and he, Chevé, in 1844 applied himself
                    to its dissemination. The system bears the name of “Galin-Paris-Chevé,” and,
                    like the other, refers the notes to key relationship and not to pitch, but
                    employs the first seven numerals as their symbols. This invention, if so it may
                    be called, was strongly discouraged by the most esteemed musicians of Paris, but
                    its advocates persevere in its propagation.</p>
                <p>As a summary of all the precept and example that has been cited in this survey of
                    the centuries let the writer state his convictions on musical theory, which are,
                    that the <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Harmony</hi> (1845) by Alfred Day
                    (1810-1849) comprehends whatever is practically available, and reconciles the
                    previously apparent discrepancies between principle and use. The laws of the
                    primitive diatonic style had never been repealed; the discovery by Noble and
                    Pigot of generated harmonics had been held as belonging to science and not
                    pertaining to art; composers had employed what may be classed as natural in
                    distinction from arbitrary combinations, but each only on the prompting of his
                    own genius and only with the justification of their effect. The author now cited
                    was the first to classify the ancient, strict, uniform, diatonic, contrapuntal
                    style, apart from the modern, free, exceptive, chromatic, massive style, to
                    separate the principles that guide the one from the laws that control the other,
                    and to place a subject that is at once sublime and beautiful in a light of
                    unfailing clearness. He showed that one or another beautiful chord and the
                    progressions thence were not capricious violations of rule, permissible to
                    genius though unallowable to ordinary writers; he showed that such things were
                    acceptable not only because great masters had written them, and so small
                    musicians might repeat the trespass; he proved this by demonstrating the
                    self-perfection of the ancient canon and the also perfect modern system that
                    rests on a basis totally <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n112/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0112-0101"/> distinct from that of the other. He classed
                    diatonic harmony, with its uniform treatment of all the notes in a key, into
                    concords which include not the 4th from the bass, and three species of discords,
                    namely, passing notes of several varieties, suspensions resolved on a note of
                    the harmony in which they are discordant, and essential or elemental discords
                    resolved with the progression of the whole chord to a chord whose root is at a
                    4th above the root of the discord. In this style discordant notes have identical
                    treatment according to the number of their interval (as 7th or 9th), unaffected
                    by its quality (as major or minor). He traced all the notes of the scale
                    available in the diatonic style to the tonic, the 5th below it, and the 5th
                    above it, as their roots, having thus a minor tone between the dominant and
                    submediant in the major form of a key. Present composers with ability for its
                    production may, by observance of this ancient canon, make music in the style of
                    the 16 th century with as good likelihood of beauty as had the great masters of
                    that period, but without imitating them, since working by their method and not
                    necessarily by their example. Day showed that peculiar treatment of certain
                    notes of the diatonic scale, together with the inclusion of the chromatic
                    element which has crept into use during the later centuries, constitutes a style
                    totally distinct from the other, and justly to be called exceptional. The basis
                    of this system is the derivation of harmonics from specified fundamental nβtes
                    or generators in every key. Thus exceptionally the 4th above the bass is a
                    concord, when it is the root inverted above the 5th in the triads of the tonic,
                    the subdominant, and the dominant. Thus exceptionally the 3d in the dominant
                    triad has peculiar poignancy to which modern ears are sensitive, and the
                    dominant triad is imitable on the supertonic by employment of its chromatic
                    major 3d that has the same special character as the 3d of the dominant. Thus
                    exceptionally the 7th may be added to the dominant triad. This combination may
                    also be imitated on the supertonic, and the addition likewise of a chromatic
                    minor 7th to the tonic triad makes another chord consisting of the same
                    intervals as the dominant 7th, namely, perfect 5th, major 3d, and minor 7th, the
                    last two being at a diminished 5th asunder. Again exceptionally the minor or the
                    major 9th may be added to each of these chords of the 7th, the 11th to the
                    chords of the 9th, and the minor or major 13th to the chords of the 11 th,
                    beyond which the ascent by 3ds proceeds no more, as the 15th is the double
                    octave of the root. The 9th, 11 th, and 13th are susceptible of resolution each
                    on a note of its own chord, which is not so with the 3d and 7 th; or they may,
                    like the 3d and 7 th, be resolved on some note of another chord when the entire
                    harmony changes. The chords of the 9th, still less of the 11 th, and of the 13th
                    least, rarely appear complete, the root being frequently, and other notes
                    occasionally, omitted. In this style the discordant notes (3d, 7th, minor or
                    major 9th, 11 th, and minor or major 13th) are identical in quality to whichever
                    of the three roots they belong; but they vary in treatment according to their
                    source; and in these two specialities they are distinguished from diatonic
                    discords. Broadly it may be stated, but subject to amplification, that the
                    natural resolution of dominant discords is upon the tonic concord, that the
                    natural resolution of supertonic discords is either upon a tonic concord or upon
                    a dominant discord, and that the natural resolution of tonic discords is either
                    upon a dominant discord or upon a supertonic discord, the several elements of
                    each harmony proceeding variously according to what note must follow it in the
                    ensuing chord. The term fundamental discords is aptly applied to these which are
                    traced to their harmonic generator, and their pertinence to one key is
                    established by their all being resolvable on chords peculiar to the same
                    tonality. The theory steps a degree further in proving ⅛F</p>
                <p>that the harmony of the augmented 6th with its several varieties of accompaniment
                    consists of the primary and secondary harmonics of a common generator, and that
                    the dominant and tonic are the notes in any key whence this harmony is derived,
                    yielding respectively the augmented 6th on the minor 6th of the chromatic scale,
                    and the augmented 6th on the minor 2d. The bold venture of Mouton, repeated by
                    Monteverde and defended by the latter against the fierce disputation of the
                    orthodox, is theoretically justified in this system on the principle of natural
                    harmonics first enunciated in Oxford, and the ingenious searchings after truth
                    by Rameau are shown in this system to have been on a false track and so to have
                    passed round instead of to their mark. Day’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise,</hi> on
                    its appearance, was denounced by the chief musicians in London, and a single
                    believer for some time alone maintained and taught its enlightened views. These
                    have now the acquiescence of many more musicians than originally opposed them,
                    they are upheld by several eloquent supporters, and they are widely disseminated
                    throughout England. They have not yet been promulgated beyond that country; but
                    the advance they have made there in thirty-eight years may be taken as augury of
                    their admission elsewhere when time and circumstance may be opportune for their
                    presentation.</p>
                <p>Music, in the modern special sense of the word, was with the early Greeks
                    regulated declamation to the accompaniment of instruments with stretched strings
                    that were plucked or struck. With the Greeks it was also produced from pipes of
                    metal or wood or horn, with reeds or without, as signals or incentives in war
                    and for domestic amusement. Far later, and in imperial Rome, it acquired a more
                    definite form of what is now called melody. The transition of its principles
                    from those which ruled in the classic ages to those which had been slowly
                    developed in the course of after centuries is veiled with a mist like that which
                    obscures the setting of paganism and the dawning of Christianity. Many fallacies
                    are still entertained as to the dated organization of music in the church, and
                    none greater than its ascription to St Ambrose and St Gregory, and the credit
                    given to Guido for the enunciation of its rules. From the end of the 10th
                    century music was in England in advance of other nations until its rise in
                    Flanders in the 15th, when still our forefathers kept abreast of their
                    contemporaries. Throughout the ecclesiastical reign of scholarship, the
                    untutored people had a music of their own, which in its tonal and rhythmical
                    affinity to that of later date commands present sympathy, and which, throughout
                    the North, having the element of harmony or the combination of sounds, was the
                    foundation of all to which science and art have together attained. The Flemings
                    planted schools in Rome, Naples, and Venice, and the rise of the art in Germany
                    was due to their influence. Adopted from the people by the church, the art of
                    harmony was reduced to a system under the name of counterpoint. Its artificial
                    ordinances were broken through at the end of the 16th century, against violent
                    opposition but with permanent success. Coincident with this innovation of
                    principles was another innovation in the form of applying them, which was
                    intended as a revival of antique use, but which issued, working together with
                    the first-named change, in the establishment of the modern in music; these two
                    were the discovery of fundamental discords and the originating of free musical
                    recitation. The acoustical phenomenon whereon fundamental discords are grounded
                    was first perceived in England, and this in the last quarter of the 17th
                    century. Empirical rules drawn from the tentative practices of great musicians
                    were from <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n113/mode/1up"

                    described in the last foregoing paragraph probed the natural principles upon
                    which, unknowingly, masters have wrought, nor distinguished between these and
                    the ingenious artifices whereby in former times musical etymology and syntax
                    were regulated. The development of plan or design in musical composition has
                    been the fruition of the last two centuries, and, in spite of all dispute as to
                    its paramount necessity, hope points to it as the everlasting standard of
                    genuineness in art.</p>
                <p>To distinguish allusions to the present time in comparison with former dates
                    throughout this article, and to mark the period to which its narration reaches,
                    statement must be made that it is completed in 1883. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g. a.

                <p>PART II.—SCIENTIFIC BASIS.</p>
                <p>Musical sounds reach our ears through the air. This is proved by showing that a
                    sounding body placed in a space void of air, as under the receiver of an
                    air-pump, is unable to emit sound. It will be sufficient for our present purpose
                    to admit that musical sounds are transmitted through the air with substantially
                    unchanged quality, even to great distances. The law according to which the
                    apparent intensity of a musical sound diminishes as it spreads itself over an
                    increasing surface of air is as yet uncertain; we can only say with certainty
                    that it does diminish.</p>
                <p>The origin of musical sound consists in the regular periodic vibration of some
                    surface in contact with air, whereby motion is imparted to the air, and thus
                    transmitted to the ear. Experience tells us as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. Regular repetition is characteristic of those motions which give rise to
                    musical sounds.</p>
                <p>2. The pitch of the note produced depends on the time in which the motion takes
                    place.</p>
                <p>3. The loudness or intensity of the note depends on the magnitude of the motion
                    and on the pitch.</p>
                <p>4. The quality of the note depends on the form or shape of the motion, that is to
                    say, on the manner in which it is executed within the time in which it takes
                    place.</p>
                <p>1. Regular repetition characterizes musical notes; irregularity in the movements
                    in successive periods characterizes unmusical noises. This is most usefully
                    illustrated by cases in which <hi rend="italic">false</hi> notes are obtained.
                    Strings, for instance, sometimes cannot be tuned. In these cases the motion can
                    frequently be seen to be irregular.</p>
                <p>2. The time in which the motion takes place is defined conveniently by the number
                    of times the whole motion is repeated in a second. The number which expresses
                    this may be called the vibration number, or the frequency of the note. Pitch,
                    then, is defined by frequency. Notes of different frequencies present sounds to
                    the ear which are essentially different from one another. The physical analogy
                    based on frequency would compare notes of different pitch to light of different
                    colours; this analogy does not, however, extend to the nature of the
                    perceptions. The notes of a uniform instrument present a closer analogy with a
                    definite colour in virtue of their uniform quality, so far as perception goes.
                    And from this point of view there is nothing in the perception of colour
                    analogous to the perception of difference of pitch in music. In speaking of the
                    perception of combinations of notes we shall see that the ear possesses, in a
                    more or less perfect form, the power of analysing combinations and hearing the
                    notes separately. If we admitted the physical analogy between pitch and colour
                    this would correspond to a power of seeing compound colours analysed into their
                    constituents. This of course does not exist. Though we may know by experience
                    what a compound colour consists of, no amount of experience will enable us to
                    see the components separately in the same way in which we hear the notes of a
                    combination separately. The modes of perception are therefore wholly different
                    in the two cases.</p>
                <p>When one note is produced by a motion whose frequency is twice that of another, a
                    relation subsists between the sounds of the two notes which appears not to be
                    capable of further explanation. They are said to form octaves with one another.
                    It is easy to give some account of the formation of the octave regarded as a
                    concord, but the inexplicable peculiarity of the relation consists in a sort of
                    quasi-identity between the sounds of the two notes. Many persons cannot
                    distinguish with certainty two notes an octave apart, particularly if the
                    quality of tone employed be one in the use of which the observer is not
                    practised, and this is the case even with ears of considerable acuteness and
                    cultivation; but it does not apply to those ears of the highest class which
                    possess the power of the recollection of absolute pitch. Such ears can usually
                    distinguish octaves with certainty. But in all cases the similarity of effect
                    between notes differing in pitch by one or more octaves will be admitted. It is
                    a purely mental phenomenon, and no explanation can be given of it. If for a
                    moment we recur to the physical analogy of colour simply for the purpose of
                    illustration, the whole range of visible colour corresponds to less than an
                    octave. The musical phenomenon of the similarity of octaves is as if part of the
                    invisible spectrum, say in the ultra-red, excited a sensation having some
                    similarity to the sensation of its octave in the visible spectrum, the two
                    sensations being such that there is a continuous change from the one to the
                    other. Nothing of the kind actually exists in the case of light. The actual
                    impression on the nervous system of the ear which is concerned with the
                    perception of pitch is believed to be substantially the same in different
                    individuals. But the mental processes attached to this perception differ so
                    widely that for all practical purposes the results are different in different
                    individuals. The chief difference appears to consist in the different
                    development of the memory of the actual sound of definite notes, which we may
                    speak of as the perception of absolute pitch. This is developed in all degrees:
                    from almost complete absence, in which case we have a want of musical ear
                    arising from the failure to retain the pitch of a note heard even for the
                    shortest time, to that highest degree of perfection in. which the memory retains
                    permanently the sound of every note that is once heard. It is not believed that
                    the possession of this memory is capable of cultivation to any considerable
                    extent. It appears rather to be a natural gift, as it usually appears at once in
                    childhood where it is possessed at all. Roughly speaking, and in the absence of
                    reliable statistics, we may say that the possession of the perception of
                    absolute pitch is distributed as follows :—say 1 per cent, possess it, 1 per
                    cent, are entirely destitute of it, so as to be said to have no ear, and the
                    remaining 98 per cent, or so possess it in a more or less modified form. Of this
                    usual condition we may take as a type cases in which the mental effect of a
                    musical note can be retained in the memory for some minutes.</p>
                <p>We have to consider the musical perception of the class possessing the power, and
                    of the numerically much larger class who only possess it in a modified form. A
                    simple tune or melody produces the same effect in all cases as far as we know,
                    except that those who have the perception of absolute pitch know what notes are
                    employed, while others are only conscious of the intervals, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> of the relative pitch. All the analytical perceptions are as a rule
                    much better <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0114-0103"/> developed in the case of those who possess the
                    perception of absolute pitch than in other cases. In those whose perceptions
                    fall below a certain mark the analysis of combinations of notes by the ear fails
                    more or less entirely. In this particular, however, cultivation is generally
                    possible. And this agrees with the assumption that the mechanism of the ear is
                    generally the same. For the perception of differences of pitch is conceived to
                    be due to a mechanism universally present, which effects the analysis of
                    combinations by the same means by which the pitch is distinguished. The
                    phenomena which give rise to this belief may be stated as follows. If we sound
                    two notes together and cause one of them to change its pitch, we can examine the
                    sensations produced by all sorts of binary combinations. If the two notes have
                    the same pitch at starting, then when they separate beats are heard. Up to a
                    certain point, which is not very far from the point where the two notes are half
                    a semitone apart, the effect in the ear is as if one note was heard, having the
                    alternations of intensity which constitute beats and a pitch generally
                    intermediate between the constituent notes. At this distance of about half a
                    semitone the ear begins to perceive the two separate notes beside the beats. As
                    the distance between the constituent notes increases the two notes become more
                    prominent, the beats grow fainter, and ultimately, when the constituent notes
                    are a little more than a whole tone apart, the beats disappear and the two notes
                    are recognized as separate and distinct sensations.</p>
                <p>Now this observation is explained by Helmholtz’s hypothesis of the existence of a
                    resonant mechanism in the ear. Just as a harp, or a piano with the dampers
                    raised, will have the strings corresponding to any sound that reaches it set in
                    vibration, so we suppose that there exists a collection of resonant bodies in
                    the ear which respond to vibrations of pitch nearly coincident with their own.
                    The question then arises, Is the range of sympathy, the distance at which a
                    certain response is excited in the vibrating mechanism of the ear, the same in
                    all cases?</p>
                <p>It is easily seen that, if the above phenomena are substantially the same in all
                    cases, the character of the mechanism must also be the same. The interval at
                    which the two notes of a binary combination begin to be separately distinguished
                    can be observed with considerable accuracy, and is critical in the matter. So
                    far as such observations have been hitherto attempted, this interval is very
                    nearly the same in persons of the highest type of ear, who have the perception
                    of absolute pitch in an advanced degree, and in persons occupying a position not
                    high among those who only possess the power of relative perception. In all
                    cases, moreover, where beats are observed, the beats are the same to all
                    persons, so far as our present knowledge goes. And as some of these beats arise
                    within the ear itself, they depend upon the properties of its mechanism. The
                    result is that, so far as ordinary observation goes, the main features of the
                    mechanism of the ear may be safely pronounced to be the same,—in the great
                    majority of cases, at all events. Some slight differences in this respect have
                    been observed; but there can be little doubt that the great differences which
                    exist in the endowment of the ears of different persons do not arise from
                    differences in the receptive mechanism, but have their source in the nervous or
                    mental actions which lie behind the mechanism. In this we are not referring to
                    the differences which exist between the range of hearing in different
                    individuals. These undoubtedly arise from what may be spoken of as differences
                    in the compass of the receptive instrument in different individuals. These
                    differences exist both at the upper and lower extremities of the scale. Those in
                    whom the upward range is defective fail to hear the noises of certain insects,
                    and are also unable to hear organ-pipes of very high pitch. The absence of the
                    lower range of hearing is less well established.</p>
                <p>The complete range of audible musical sounds comprises about nine octaves. It
                    extends from the 32-foot C, two octaves below the lowest note of a bass voice,
                    to somewhere about three octaves above C in alt. The upper notes of this range
                    are not audible to some persons. Organ-pipes are made having notes covering this
                    whole range, except about the top half-octave. The position of notes is so
                    frequently referred to the length of the corresponding organpipe that it is
                    convenient here to give these lengths, with the usual notation for the notes to
                    which they correspond. 2 <hi rend="italic">octaves above.</hi></p>

                <p>The normal perception of pitch does not, however, cover all this range. Its
                    extent varies much in different individuals. We cannot assume that pitch can be
                    completely perceived in the normal manner in either the uppermost octave or the
                    lowest octave of the foregoing range. The lower half of the uppermost octave is
                    easily examined, wherever an organ is available, by drawing the fifteenth alone
                    and sounding the notes of the upper half octave of the keyboard. These notes
                    will generally be heard as sounds, but if a bit of a melody be sounded on them,
                    for instance a simple scale passage, it will generally be found unrecognizable.
                    The same is the case with the lowest octave lying between the 16-foot and
                    32-foot notes. There has been considerable doubt as to the reality of the notes
                    which profess to occupy this position. All instruments sound notes of a complex
                    character, which include sounds of a higher pitch than the nominal note, in fact
                    the harmonics, of which the nominal note is the fundamental. And doubts have
                    been raised, which have in some cases proved to be well founded, whether the
                    deep notes in question really contain any of the nominal note or fundamental at
                    all, and do not rather consist entirely of harmonics, or of sounds whose real
                    pitch is much higher than the nominal one.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n115/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0115-0104"/>
                <p>These doubts have been settled in the case of the low notes of the organ by the
                    process of analysis by beats. Where two notes differing slightly in pitch form
                    beats, the number of beats in a second is equal to the difference of the
                    frequencies. If, then, the frequencies of the notes sounded differ by one
                    vibration per second nearly, there will be one beat per second; if they differ
                    by two or three per second there will be two or three beats. The frequencies of
                    the two lowest notes of the 32-foot range are sufficiently nearly— C =17</p>
                <p>C#=18.</p>
                <p>If, therefore, C and C⅛ are true notes they should give about one beat per
                    second. The octaves of these notes give about two beats per second, and the
                    twelfths give about three beats per second. The notes of large-scale open
                    32-foot pipes when thus tested give one beat per second. The notes of stopped
                    pipes vary very much according to the scale and voicing, but in these low notes
                    no fundamental has as yet been detected. They always present the three beats
                    characteristic of the twelfth.</p>
                <p>This is contrary to the statement, long accepted on the authority of Helmholtz,
                    that large-scale stopped pipes give nearly pure tones. It does not appear that
                    that statement was ever verified, and it appears not to be correct. 32-foot
                    stops are not very common, but these principles can be illustrated with 16-foot
                    stops. Here the fundamental beat is about two per second, the octave four, and
                    the twelfth six for adjoining semitones at the bottom of the range. The same
                    results are easily found. As a rule the large open 16-foot stops of the pedal
                    give their fundamentals quite pure, while stopped pipes professing to speak the
                    same notes almost invariably present the six beats of the twelfth, sometimes
                    with and sometimes without fundamental. The conclusion we may draw is that the
                    enormous power laid on to the lower notes of the organ enables the test of
                    audibility to be made under most favourable circumstances, and that under these
                    circumstances the limit of audible sounds can be carried down to a point close
                    to the 32-foot C, or to a frequency of about 17.</p>
                <p>The determination of the frequency or vibration number of particular notes was
                    first effected by calculations depending on the mechanical theory of strings.
                    Subsequently the method of beats was employed, and the first reliable
                    determinations appear to have been made by this method, which was developed by
                    Scheibler. The usual process consists of providing a series of notes each of
                    which makes four beats with its next neighbour, whence every such pair has
                    vibration numbers differing by four. The series extends over an octave, whence
                    the total difference of frequency between the extreme notes which form the
                    octave is known. And this number is equal to the frequency of the lower note of
                    the octave. This method, however, is difficult of execution, and depends on a
                    number of observations, each of which is liable to error.</p>
                <p>The method described in most of the books depends on the employment of the
                    “siren.” This consists essentially of a circular plate, revolving on an axis
                    through its centre at right angles to its plane. Series of holes are aιτanged in
                    circles, and puffs of air are sent through the holes as they move over fixed
                    holes. In this way a known number of impulses is produced at each revolution.
                    The revolutions are counted by a wheel work. With the more perfect forms of this
                    instrument fair determinations of frequency could be effected by bringing the

                    the impulses delivered during a certain time. But until quite recently there was
                    great uncertainty as to the actual frequency of the notes in use. In particular,
                    the forks sold some time ago as 512 for treble C were for the most part several
                    vibrations higher. And the various forks sold as philharmonic have at different
                    times represented a great variety of pitches. The pitch of treble C has in
                    recent times varied between the limits 512 and 540, being almost exactly a
                    semitone. A few of the principal pitches may be summarized as follows :— ⅞ —
                    =512—old theoretical pitch.</p>
                <p>518—equal temperament equivalent of French diapason normale. A = 435.</p>
                <p>528—Society of Arts. Helmholtz’s theoretical pitch.</p>
                <p>540—Modern concert pitch.</p>
                <p>There is a tendency in practice to keep the pitch rising. This appears to arise
                    from the habit among musicians of considering flatness in the orchestra or in
                    singing a more heinous offence than sharpness. Everybody tries, at all events,
                    not to be flat. Wind instruments made to concert pitch force the pitch up at all
                    public performances. A rise is easily made, but a fall only with great
                    difficulty. It will be seen that the pitch of the French diapason normale is the
                    best part of a semitone below modern concert pitch, and the difficulty of
                    getting it adopted is well known.</p>
                <p>Forks stamped -with the numbers of vibrations are now issued privately by some of
                    the principal musical firms, and they appear to be fairly accurate. Probably
                    they are copied from certain series of forks beating four per second which have
                    been constructed according to Scheiblers process, so as to furnish the vibration
                    numbers.</p>
                <p>The most easy and convenient way of settling the frequency of tuning-forks, or
                    rather of adjusting any vibrating body to a standard note, appears to be by
                    means of a uniform rotation machine controlled by a clock so as to revolve
                    exactly once per second. A disk is mounted on the machine, having say 135 radial
                    slits spokewise. A light behind the disk then throws 135 flashes per second. If
                    a tuning-fork or other vibrating body be placed in front of the disk and looked
                    at against the illuminated background, it presents a pattern which will be
                    stationary if the fork be 135 or 270 or 405 or 540, or any other multiple of
                    135. If the fork is sharp the pattern moves one way, if flat the other. In this
                    way the vibration number of a vibrating body is refeιτed directly to the clock,
                    and the adjustment to the standard note is one easily made, and not requiring
                    great delicacy of observation.</p>
                <p>3. The loudness or intensity of notes undoubtedly increases with the magnitude of
                    the displacements of which the vibrations consist, or rather perhaps with the
                    magnitude of the changes of pressure which occur in the neighbourhood of the
                    ear. It has been customary to speak of the energy of the vibration as affording
                    a measure of intensity, and this is true from a mechanical point of view. But
                    the subjective intensity or loudness is certainly not correctly measured by any
                    of these quantities. Further, the same changes of pressure or the same
                    mechanical intensity cause sounds which vary in loudness according to the pitch.
                    Taking this last point first, it is easy to show that a given mechanical
                    intensity produces a very much louder sound in the higher parts of the scale
                    than in the lower. The simplest way of looking at this is to consider the work
                    employed in exciting the pipes of an organ-stop. The upper pipes take only a
                    small fraction of the wind, and consequently of the power, used by the lower
                    ones, and yet the upper pipes appear quite as loud. It has been shown that with
                    a particular stop the work consumed was proportional to the length of the pipe,
                    and so inversely as the vibration number.</p>
                <p>It has been maintained lately that the loudness of sound is measured by the
                    amplitude of the motion, or by the changes of pressure, rather than by the
                    mechanical intensity. The experiments on which this view is based consist of
                    dropping weights from different heights. A weight <hi rend="italic">m</hi> from
                    a height <hi rend="italic">h</hi> gives a certain loudness. Now let the weight
                    be doubled, the question is whether the loudness remains the same when the
                    height is halved, or when it is divided by √2. The experiments appear to prove
                    that the latter is the case. The estimation of the loudness is difficult on
                    account of the apparent change of timbre, but the experiments are carefully
                    arranged and discussed, and appear to establish a <hi rend="italic"

                    afford proof of its applicability. Fechher’s law may be stated thus :— equal
                    differences of sensation are produced by changes which are equal fractions of
                    the whole excitation. Thus we may take the change in the mechanical excitation
                    to consist in doubling it; then every time that it is doubled a change will be
                    made in the sensation which is in all cases equally recognizable. The general
                    probability of the truth of this will be seen by enumerating ten different
                    magnitudes under which sounds may be classified; these represent fairly equal
                    differences of sensation :—</p>

                    reasonable, without going into detail, to assume that the mechanical ratio of
                    any two consecutive magnitudes is the same. The general expression of this law
                    is, The measure of sensation is the logarithm of the mechanical excitation. It
                    appears probable that the ratio of energy corresponding to one of the above
                    differences of magnitude is somewhere about 2 or 3. The corresponding ratio
                    depending on amplitude or compression would be from 1 ’ 4 to 1*7, but these
                    quantities are not known with any accuracy.</p>
                <p>4. The pitch depending on the period or frequency and the loudness on the
                    amplitude or magnitude of the changes, there remains on the one hand the quality
                    of tone, and on the other the form of the vibration or the manner in which the
                    motion takes place between the prescribed limits. These may be expected to
                    correspond with each other, and in fact they do so. The peculiarities of form of
                    vibration are most easily discussed in the case of a musical string whose
                    vibrations are started or maintained in a given manner. The smoothest and purest
                    quality of tone that can be produced is known as a simple tone. When a string
                    produces a simple tone its motion is such that its shape at any moment is that
                    of a curve of sines, and that every point of the string executes oscillations
                    according to the pendulum law.</p>
                <p>Simple tones are also produced by any vibrating surface which moves according to
                    the pendulum law. The method for producing simple tones given by Helmholtz, and
                    commonly employed, is to use tuning-forks as the sources of sound, and present
                    their extreme faces to the opening of a resonator or air-chamber arranged so as
                    to vibrate to the same note as the fork. Resonators may be conveniently made
                    from wide-mouthed bottles with flat corks having holes bored in them. The
                    dimensions are usually found by trial, though data exist for their calculation.
                    Simple tones have also been produced by fitting a sort of organpipe mouthpiece
                    into the corks of such bottles. The mouths require to be cut up much higher than
                    usual; the notes produced are of an exceedingly full and pure character. Such
                    bottle-notes can be blown from an organbellows, and being easily manipulated are
                    very suitable for experiments on the properties of simple tones.</p>
                <p>The law of Ohm states that the simple tone or pendulum vibration is that to which
                    the sensation of pitch is attached in its simplest form. If the motion which
                    constitutes the vibration of a note be of any other type, it is capable of being
                    analysed by the ear into a series of simple tones according to what is called
                    Fourier’s Theorem. This is most simply described in connexion with stretched
                    strings, assuming that the notes which are exhibited in the form of the string
                    pass over into the air through the sound-board without essential alteration of
                    quality, which appears to be true in a general way. Fourier’s Theorem, as
                    applied to a string, states that the motion of the string is equivalent to the
                    sum of the motions which would result if there were a curve of sines of the
                    whole length, two curves of sines each of half the length, three each of
                    one-third the length, and so on,—the amplitudes being determined when the total
                    motion to be represented is given. This equivalence is true mechanically; the
                    law of Ohm says that it is also true for the ear. Hence a great presumption that
                    the ear acts by a receptive mechanism obeying the laws of mechanics.</p>
                <p>The notes formed by the division of a string into two, three, or more parts are
                    commonly called <hi rend="italic">harmonics.</hi> They are also called <hi
                    rend="italic">overtones;</hi> but this word includes such cases as those of
                    bars, &lt;fcc., where the notes produced by these divisions are not harmonious
                    with the fundamental. Harmonics play an important part in the theory of
                    consonant combinations, but the theory of consonance cannot be rested entirely
                    upon the properties of harmonics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Consonance and Dissonance.</hi></p>
                <p>It was already known in ancient times that lengths of the same stretched string
                    having the ratio of any two small whole numbers form consonant intervals, or
                    perhaps we may more correctly say smooth combinations, since the interval of a
                    fourth (3: 4) is regarded as a dissonance in technical music, though it is a
                    smooth combination. The question why smooth combinations are associated with
                    small whole numbers is known as the Pythagorean question. The modern knowledge
                    that the length of a given string is inversely as the vibration number refers
                    the question more generally to vibration numbers rather than to lengths of
                    string. This question has been answered by Helmholtz; we proceed to give a short
                    account of his answer, with some slight modifications.</p>
                <p>It has been long known that when two notes form an imperfect unison, or nearly
                    form almost any smooth combination, flutterings or beats are heard. These have
                    been already described in the case of imperfect unisons where two notes differ
                    but little from each other in pitch. They exist also, in most cases, where two
                    notes nearly, but not quite, form a smooth combination. According to Helmholtz,
                    beats are the cause of the sensation of dissonance, and to seek further for this
                    cause we must seek the cause of beats. We may note that this must be taken with
                    some limitation, since the fourth is regarded as a dissonance, though it
                    presents no beats. In the case of imperfect unisons there is no difficulty. Such
                    beats have been long explained as arising out of the alternate coincidences and
                    oppositions of the motions or pressures arising from the two sets of
                    vibrations.</p>
                <p>In other cases, however, this explanation is not applicable. Explanations similar
                    in principle have been given by Smith, an English writer of the last century;
                    but these only amount to reckoning the recurrence of certain configurations
                    arising from the superposition of the two sets of motions. No hypothesis is made
                    as to the actual nature of the receptive mechanism of the ear, and no attempt is
                    made to determine of what sounds the beats consist, nor how such sounds arise.
                    We have already seen that the ear receives separately notes which are more than
                    one or two semitones apart. They appear to be received on different parts of the
                    aural mechanism. The production of the beats in the case of imperfect fifths,
                    octaves, &amp;c., where the impulses fall on different parts of the receptive
                    mechanism, appears therefore to be due to secondary causes rather than to the
                    direct superposition of the impulses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Beats of Harmonics.—</hi> This class of beats arises from the
                    fact that in compound notes containing harmonics a pair of notes representing
                    two small whole numbers gives rise to the coincidence of a pair of harmonics
                    forming a unison, and, if the interval be mistuned, the harmonics form an
                    imperfect unison. Beats of this description are easily identified by the pitch
                    of the harmonics. The imperfect unison gives rise to alternations of sound and
                    silence, or to variations of intensity, of a note having the pitch in question.
                    With practice these variations can be heard with the unaided ear. But the
                    employment of resonators, tuned to the pitch in question and connected with the
                    ear, causes the beat to be heard with great intensity.</p>

                    the appearance of certain other notes within the ear, which are called

                    >p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q.</hi> Then the first combination tone (Tartini
                    tone, difference tone) has the frequency <hi rend="italic">p-q.</hi> Other

                    rend="italic">p - 2q, p</hi>- 3&lt;∕, and so on. Each of these has its region of
                    greatest intensity when its frequency is smallest consistently with its forming
                    an audible sound. Thus the first difference tone <hi rend="italic">(p-q)</hi> is
                    most powerful when <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q</hi> differ

                    a fifth or an octave apart. The beats of mistuned consonant intervals other than
                    the beats of harmonics are produced by the formation of imperfect unisons
                    between combination tones and primaries, or among the combination tones

                    and a third inserted, the note two octaves below the lowest note of the triad
                    can generally be heard distinctly. If the third be mistuned, beats are heard on
                    that note.</p>
                <p>Let the notes be 400, 501, 600,</p>
                <p>501-400 = 101 600-501= 99</p>
                <p>2 beats per second, two octaves below the lowest note of the triad.</p>
                <p>There can be little doubt that the definition of consonances as intervals which
                    can be tuned free from beats lies at the basis of almost all music. There can
                    also be little doubt that the power of the perception or memory of absolute
                    pitch, though sparely distributed, must ensure to those musicians who have it
                    influence on the progress of the art. With these persons the influence of
                    consonance or smoothness is generally subordinate to the recognition of the
                    pitch of the notes used. Between these two elements scales of different kinds
                    have been evolved in different parts of the world. These scales have almost
                    invariably a basis of consonances, generally fifths. But when once developed the
                    melodic effects almost invariably supersede the reference to the consonances in
                    the ears of expert persons. The scales of different countries and systems,
                    embodied in melodies, sound atrocious to those accustomed to other scales, quite
                    independently of the consonant relations on which they are all founded in
                    common.</p>
                <p>The subject of Temperament deals with the general theory of the construction of
                    scales from slightly mistuned consonances. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. h. μ.
