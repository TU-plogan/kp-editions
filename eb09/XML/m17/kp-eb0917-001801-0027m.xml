                    Mullets (genus <hi rend="italic">Mullus,</hi> the name given by the ancient
                    Romans) are marine fishes, with two short dorsal fins remote from each other:
                    the first is composed of feeble spines, the second of branched rays; the anal
                    fin is similar to the second dorsal. The body is covered with large thin scales.
                    The form of the head is quite peculiar and characteristic; its anterior profile
                    slopes downwards to the small mouth, which has but very small and feeble teeth,
                    and from which two cylindrical barbels are suspended. These organs of touch are
                    generally laid backwards and hidden in a groove between the branches of the
                    lower jaw, but can be erected and called into action independently of each
                    other. About forty different species of Red Mullets are known, chiefly from the
                    tropical and sub-tropical parts of the Indo-Pacific Ocean. In the Atlantic the
                    species are much less numerous, the most celebrated being the European <hi
                    rend="italic">Mullus barbatus</hi> (see vol. xii. p. 638, fig. 10), which is
                    abundant in the Mediterranean, and tolerably common on the coasts of England and
                    Ireland. Formerly a second species, <hi rend="italic">Mullus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">surιnuletus,</hi> was believed to exist in the European seas, but
                    ichthyologists now incline more and more to the belief that this is only the
                    female of <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">barbatus.</hi></p>
                <p>Red Mullets do not attain to any considerable size, the largest of the tropical
                    species weighing only two or three pounds. They are ground-feeders, evidently
                    using their barbels in discovering their food, which consists of animalcules,
                    worms, and, in the larger species, of small fishes; that they feed on putrid
                    flesh is not borne out by the evidence drawn from their feeble jaws and
                    dentition, but it is very probable that they are attracted to a decomposing body
                    by the presence of the small crustaceans which feast upon it. Although the
                    colours of these fishes are very brilliant, they are simple and evanescent; only
                    a few of the tropical species exhibit ornamentations in the form of black spots
                    or bands. In many, as also in the European species, red colour prevails, and its
                    preservation after death is considered to enhance the fitness of the fish for
                    the table, and consequently its value for the market. To produce the intensity
                    of this red colour, fishermen scale the red mullet immediately before its death,
                    a process by which the red pigment-cells or chromatophores are excited to
                    expand; fishes which are allowed to die in the water show but little red, and
                    therefore red mullets caught by the trawl are less valuable than those obtained
                    in a trammel-net, by which the majority of the fish are secured alive. All the
                    species of Red Mullets seem to be esteemed as food; but none equal in this
                    respect the European species, which was held in exaggerated esteem by the
                    gourmands of the corrupt period of the Roman empire. They exhibited the living
                    fish and allowed them to die at the table immediately before they were consigned
                    to the cook; they kept them in large reservoirs until they were wanted, and paid
                    fabulous prices for fishes somewhat above the average size. In our times red
                    mullets have justly maintained their value as a delicacy for the table; and from
                    a commercial point of view their cultivation in suitable enclosed waters cannot
                    be too strongly recommended to pisciculturists. Unfortunately, very little is
                    known about their habits; during the winter they retire into deep water, late in
                    spring and during the summer they approach the coasts and enter even brackish
                    water, but the state of their sexual organs shows clearly that these fishes do
                    not come towards the shore in order to breed; in fact nothing is known of their
                    propagation.</p>
                <p>The Grey Mullets, like the Red Mullets, belong to the spiny-rayed fishes, but
                    form a widely-different and distinct family, <hi rend="italic">Mugilïdae.</hi>
                    They are not exclusively marine, but freely enter brackish water, live always
                    close to the shore, and some of the tropical forms inhabit the pure fresh water
                    of streams and rivulets, without, however, penetrating far inland. Their body is
                    elegantly formed, wedge-shaped, and covered with scales of moderate size, firmly
                    adherent to the skin. The two short dorsal fins are remote from each other, and
                    the anterior is composed of four stiff spines. The anal fin is similar to the
                    second dorsal; the caudal fin strong and bilobed. The form of the snout is very
                    peculiar and characteristic; the mouth narrow, transverse in the true <hi
                    rend="italic">Mugil,</hi> and without, or with but feeble, teeth.</p>
                <p>About seventy different species are known, from almost every coast of the
                    temperate and tropical zones; they swim in small schools and are abundant
                    wherever they occur. Four species are found on the British coasts— <hi
                    rend="italic">Mugil septentrionalis, Mugil capito, Mugil</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >octoradiatus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mugil auratus,</hi> the first two
                    being about equally and generally distributed, whilst the others are scarcer.
                    Some of the freshwater Grey Mullets of the tropics, especially those of the West
                    Indian and Indo-Pacific islands, have the mouth more lateral or have distinct,
                    though very minute, teeth; they therefore have been formed into separate genera,
                    <hi rend="italic">Agonostoma</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Myxus.</hi></p>
                <p>Grey Mullets, at least some of the species, grow to a weight of 10 or 12 lb; but
                    the fish which usually come into the market rarely exceed half that weight.
                    Those in which distinct teeth are developed feed principally on small aquatic
                    animals, whilst the diet of those without teeth consists of animalcules or
                    minute organic substances mixed with the mud or sand which they swallow in large
                    quantities; also confervoid growths to which small shells adhere are freely
                    taken. To prevent the gills from being clogged by sand or mud, a peculiar
                    apparatus separates these organs from the pharynx. Each branchial arch is
                    provided on each side, in its whole length, with a series of closely-set
                    gill-rakers, each series fitting into the series of the adjoining arch; they
                    constitute together a sieve admirably fitted to permit the passage of the water,
                    and to retain at the same time every other substance in the cavity destined for
                    mastication. Also the structure of the intestinal tract is adapted in a
                    remarkable manner to the peculiar diet of these fishes. One portion of the
                    stomach is globular and surrounded by a thick mass of muscles, the cavity being
                    small and coated with a tough epithelium. In fact this structure reminds us of
                    the stomach of birds, in which it also serves for the trituration of hard
                    substances. The intestine itself is long, six or seven times as long as the
                    fish. Grey Mullets are very plainly coloured, generally greenish on the upper
                    parts and more or less silvery on the side. They are wholesome food, well
                    flavoured when taken out of clean water. As young fish bear transport easily,
                    and rapidly grow to a marketable size in suitable enclosed waters, their
                    cultivation deserves every attention on the part of pisciculturists. Indeed, in
                    the fishfarms of Western Italy, grey mullets,besides eels, red mullets,
                    flat-fish, are the principal fish cultivated.</p>
