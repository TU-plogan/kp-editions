                    extending for about 1200 miles along the east coast of Africa from Cape Delgado
                    (10° 4Γ S. lat.) to Lorenzo Marques on the south side of Delagoa Bay (25° 58' S.
                    lat.). On paper it forms an imposing territory of at least 38,000 square miles
                    without any definite limit towards the interior; but in reality it consists of a
                    few settlements and military posts feebly authoritative over the surrounding
                    tribes. The Portuguese divide the province into the military districts ôf
                    Mozambique, Cape Delgado, Angoche, Quilimane, Tete, Sofala, and Lorenzo Marques,
                    with the presidential territory of Bazaruto. The small coral island of
                    Mozambique, which gives its name to the province and contains the provincial
                    capital, lies in 15° S. lat., about 3 miles off the coast of the peninsula
                    Mossuril. It is defended by three forts, of which the principal, St Sebastian,
                    is built entirely of stone brought from Portugal in 1510. The streets of the
                    town (properly St Sebastian of Mozambique) are narrow and crooked, and the
                    stone-built flat-roofed houses are for the most part dull and lifeless in spite
                    of their being washed with pink, brown, and white. Its principal buildings are
                    the palace of the governorgeneral, formerly a Jesuit college, the custom-house,
                    the hospital, and three churches. The population includes, besides Portuguese
                    and Africans, Banyans, Parsees, and Arabs. The district of Cape Delgado includes
                    the archipelago of the Querimba Islands, and on the opposite mainland Mucimba,
                    Pangane, Lumbo, Quissanga, Montepes, Arimba, besides the colony of Europeans
                    founded in 1857 on the Bay of Pemba. The chief town is Ibo, with over 2000
                    inhabitants, situated on the island of the same name. Of the twenty-eight
                    islands some are nearly deserted, although both their climate and that of the
                    opposite coast is good. Ibo has a considerable trade,—the exports being sesame,
                    calumba root, oil-seeds, ivory, and wax. Turtle fishing is carried on; but
                    little has been done to develop the agricultural capabilities of the district.
                    The district of Angoche extends nominally as far south as the Quirimbo river,
                    and includes the Angoche and Primeira islands and a small settlement on the
                    Angoche river. The trade is very limited. The district of Quilimane is the
                    centre of the commerce of the Zambesi, and the town ranks next to Mozambique as
                    a port. Near the village of St Marçal de Sena, the headquarters of the
                    sub-military government of Sena, there are said to be very rich gold mines.
                    Tete, to the north-west of Sena, is situated in the centre of an immense
                    coal-basin. It includes a number of settlements on the Zambesi reaching as far
                    as Zumbo, where a great native fair is held. The chief town is St Thiajo Major,
                    about 250 miles from the mouth of the Zambesi. The climate is genial, and the
                    soil is specially suitable for wheat, maize, tobacco, cotton, and sugar-cane.
                    The chief town of the Sofala district is Sofala on the island of Chi-loane in
                    the estuary of the Sofala river. It was the original capital of the colony, and
                    still possesses a good harbour, which, however, is not always easily accessible,
                    and requires good piloting. The district is rich in gold mines, and is supposed
                    by some to be the Ophir with which King Solomon traded. Inhambane, opposite
                    Gasa, is very much encroached upon by the Zulu tribes. The natural products are
                    similar to those in the Zambesi valley. A species of oil-plant is very abundant,
                    as well as amber and sarsaparilla. The district of Lorenzo Marques is almost
                    wholly confined to the town of that name <hi rend="italic">{q.v.}.</hi> The
                    archipelago of Bazaruto comprises the islands of Bazaruto, Benguerua, Xegine,
                    Bango, and Santa Carolina. The soil and climate are both excellent, and there
                    are important pearl fisheries.</p>
                <p>Before the 12th century this portion of the east coast of Africa had been partly
                    colonized by Arabs from the Red Sea, who were in possession of the island of
                    Mozambique and other districts when in 1498 the island was sighted by the
                    Portuguese. From that time the Portuguese armadas were in the habit of
                    frequently touching this coast on their way to India, and in 1505 Albuquerque
                    erected a stockade at the mouth of the Sofala river and established the first
                    Portuguese settlement under the name of the captaincy of Sofala. The fortunes of
                    the Portuguese have been frequently chequered with disasters, and in the earlier
                    years of their settlement they had great difficulty in withstanding successive
                    attacks of the Kaffres, the Turks, and the Arabs. The Banyan traders began <pb

                    and were succeeded by the Battias from Hindustan. From Cape Delgado to Quilimane
                    the native race on the coast is the Makua, who, notwithstanding the presence of
                    Arabs, Banyans, and Battias, have preserved in a remarkable degree their purity
                    of descent, although their language has undergone considerable change. The whole
                    of the country between the Rovuma and the Zambesi is thickly populated by
                    branches of this race governed by numerous petty independent despots. The Makua
                    are divided into four families or groups—the Low Makua, the Lomwe or Upper
                    Makua, the Maua, and the Medo. The Makololo, a powerful Basuto tribe who
                    inhabited the valley of the Zambesi, were about twenty-five years ago not only
                    conquered but almost annihilated by the Manganja and Makua races. South of the
                    Zambesi are the Landeens or Northern Zulus, who under Umzeila subdued Gasa, and
                    press closely on the coast settlements of the Portuguese, which again are
                    bounded on the south by Usibepu’s land.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Natural Features and Resources.—</hi> Though the climate of the
                    Mozambique country is subject to sudden and great alterations, the mean annual
                    temperature is high. The cool season lasts from April to August. In the rainy
                    season, which begins in December and sometimes continues to March, the heat when
                    rain is not falling, which is scarcely ever, is almost insupportable. On the
                    rivers and the coast the mangrove swamps cause fever to Europeans, but the
                    climate is not dangerous if moderate care is taken.</p>
                <p>The whole of the country south from the Rovuma to the Zambesi possesses naturally
                    great fertility, the richest portion, however, being that between Angoche and
                    Quilimane. The mountain ranges which flank Lake Shirwa are of great height and
                    towards Quilimane extend almost to the coast. In the basin of the Zambesi the
                    soil is fertilized by the inundations of the river, and yields abundantly with
                    almost no labour. The low coast land of the Gasa country is almost equally
                    fruitful. The whole region of Mozambique is intersected by numerous rivers, some
                    of which are navigable, while at several of the estuaries there are admirable
                    natural harbours. Ebony, the gum-copal tree, the india-rubber climber,
                    sandal-wood, and a large number of valuable timber trees are found in the
                    extensive forests. In the interior elephants, antelopes, and buffaloes aboundy
                    as well as lions and leopards, and the rhinoceros and hippopotamus frequent
                    certain regions. Game in immense variety is plentiful, and the pearl and other
                    fisheries are valuable. The mineral resources of the country are of exceptional
                    importance. There are immense deposits of coal in the neighbourhood of the
                    Zambesi and of Delagoa Bay, and adjoining the coalfields ironstone of the best
                    quality is very plentiful. Malachite and copper are found in the interior,
                    north-west of Mozambique. The gold-mines of Manica, about 120 miles west of
                    8ofala, are supposed to be the richest on the east coast of Africa.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Industry and Commerce.—</hi> Almost nothing has been done to
                    develop the resources of the country, and the Portuguese have scarcely carried
                    their discoveries beyond the regions where they have settled. Journeys through
                    the Makua country have lately been made by H. E. O’Neill and the Rev. Chauncey
                    Maples.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Geog. Soc.,</hi> 1882.</p></note> The Zambesi valley
                    and the districts round Lakes Nyassa and Shirwa have been explored by Kirk and
                    Livingstone. The regions bordering on the Transvaal have been visited by Carl
                    Mauch and St Vincent Erskine. Although a great part of the country is admirably
                    adapted for the growth of cotton, coffee, and sugar, scarcely any attempt has
                    been made to form plantations. The caju tree, which yields an intoxicating
                    liquor, is, however, largely cultivated, and the cocoa-nut tree is also grown.
                    The number of independent chiefs in the Makua country renders it almost
                    inaccessible to traders, but ivory is sold in large quantities for the Indian
                    market, the annual value being about £70,000. The other exports include beeswax,
                    corn, gums, india-rubber, and oil. The financial difficulties of the Portuguese
                    Government have completely retarded the commercial enterprise of the
                    settlements. The trade is almost entirely in the hands of the Banyans, who are
                    supplied by French and Dutch houses with goods, chiefly cotton and silk cloths,
                    brandy, wine, and old guns, which they barter for produce with the natives on
                    the coast. The only river by which there is regular communication with the
                    interior is the Zambesi. On the coast çf Mozambique there are several native
                    ports of call, between which and Madagascar a large surreptitious trade in
                    slaves was carried on until 1877. With this island, and also with Zanzibar,
                    there is a large general coasting trade. The British India Company’s steamers
                    from Zanzibar in connexion with steamers from Aden and Lisbon also call every
                    twenty-eight days at Mozambique, and a monthly steamer from Natal calls at
                    Delagoa Bay, Inhambane, Quilimane, and Mozambique. The general shipping trade is
                    carried on by about 400 vessels, of which about one-half are coasters. English
                    vessels in 1877 were said to number 79 of 30,000 tons, French 72 of 13,000 tons,
                    Portuguese 41, Arab 19, Dutch 8, and German 9.</p>
