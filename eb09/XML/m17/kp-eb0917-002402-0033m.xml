                <p><label type="entry">MUNICH</label> (in German, <hi rend="italic">München),</hi>
                    the capital of the kingdom of Bavaria and the fourth largest town in the German
                    empire, is situated in an elevated and barren plain to the north of the Bavarian
                    Alps, in 48° 8' N. lat. and ll <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 35' E. long. Owing
                    to its lofty site (1700 feet above the sea) and the proximity of the Alps the
                    climate is rather changeable, and its mean annual temperature, 49° to 50° Fahr.,
                    is little higher than that of many places much farther to the north. The annual
                    rainfall is stated at nearly 30 inches. The situation of Munich is devoid of
                    physical advantages, and the surrounding district is in no way remarkable for
                    its wealth, but the construction of roads and railways has counterbalanced the
                    lack of natural highways, while the central position of the town makes it easy
                    of access from all parts of Europe.</p>
                <p>Munich is divided into nineteen municipal districts, fourteen of which, including
                    the old town, lie on the left bank of the small river Isar, while the suburban
                    districts of Au, Haidhausen, Giesing, and Ramersdorf are on the opposite bank.
                    The old town, still containing many narrow and irregular streets, forms a
                    semicircle with its diameter towards the river, while round its periphery has
                    sprung up the greater part of modern Munich, including the handsome Maximilian
                    and Ludwig districts. The wall with which Munich was formerly surrounded has
                    been pulled down, but some of the gates have been left standing. The most
                    interesting of these is the Isar Thor, restored in 1835 and adorned with modern
                    frescos. The Sieges Thor or gate of victory is a modern imitation of the arch of
                    Constantine at Rome, while the stately Propylaea is a reproduction of the gates
                    of the Athenian Acropolis.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the present century Munich was in no way distinguishable from
                    the crowd of second-rate German towns, but since the accession of Louis I. in
                    1825 it has undergone a metamorphosis of the most remarkable character. This
                    splendour-loving prince devoted himself heart and soul to the embellishment of
                    his “residence,” and his successors have followed in his footsteps with such
                    zeal that Munich is now almost unrivalled for architectural magnificence among
                    the smaller capitals of Europe, while its collections of art entitle it to rank
                    alongside of Dresden and Berlin. Most of the modern buildings have been erected,
                    after celebrated prototypes of other countries and eras, so that, as has been
                    said by Carrière, a walk through Munich affords a picture of the architecture
                    and art of two thousand years. The want of local colouring is perhaps a blemish
                    in this “museum of architecture,” and it has also been objected that the
                    prevailing uniformity of surface in the buildings does not produce sufficient
                    contrast of light and shade. In carrying out his plans Louis I. was ably
                    seconded by the architect Klenze, while the external decorations of painting and
                    sculpture were mainly designed by Cornelius, Kaulbach, and Schwanthaler.</p>
                <p>A large proportion of the most notable buildings in Munich are in two streets,
                    the Ludwigstrasse and the Maximilianstrasse, the creations of the monarchs whose
                    names they bear. The former, three-quarters of a mile long and 60 yards wide,
                    chiefly contains buildings in the Renaissance style by Gärtner. The most
                    striking of these are the palaces of Duke Max and Prince Luitpold; the Odeon, a
                    large building for concerts, adorned with frescos and marble busts; the war
                    office; the royal library, in the Florentine Palatial style; the blind asylum;
                    the Ludwigskirche, a successful reproduction of the Italian Romanesque style,
                    containing a huge fresco of the Last Judgment by Cornelius; and, lastly, the
                    university. At one end this street is terminated by the above-mentioned Sieges
                    Thor, while at the other is the Feldherrnhalle or hall of the marshals, a copy
                    of the Loggia dei Lanzi at Florence, containing statues of Tilly and Wrede.
                    Adjacent is the church of the Theatines, an imposing though somewhat
                    over-ornamented example of the Italian Rococo style; it contains the royal
                    burial-vaults. In the Maximilianstrasse, which extends from Haidhausen on the
                    right bank of the Isar to the Max-Joseph Platz, King Maximilian II. tried to
                    introduce an entirely novel style of domestic architecture, formed by the
                    combination of older forms. At the east end it is closed by the Maximilianeum,
                    an extensive and imposing edifice for the instruction of civil servants, adorned
                    externally with large sculptural groups and internally with huge paintings
                    representing the chief scenes in the history of the world. Descending the street
                    towards the west we pass in succession the national museum, the new gymnasium,
                    the provincial government buildings for Upper Bavaria (in which the composite
                    style of Maximilian has been most consistently carried out), and the mint. On
                    the north side of the Max-Joseph Platz lies the royal palace, an extensive
                    building, consisting of the Alte Residenz, the Königsbau, and the Festsaalbau.
                    The old palace, dating from 1601 to 1616, was designed by Peter Candid, and was
                    formerly considered a very fine building. The apartments are handsomely fitted
                    up in the Rococo style, and the private chapel and the treasury contain numerous
                    interesting and valuable objects. The Festsaalbau, erected by Klenze in the
                    Italian Renaissance style, is profusely adorned with mural paintings and
                    sculptures, while the Königsbau, a reduced copy of the Pitti Palace, contains a
                    series of admirable frescos from the <hi rend="italic">Niebélungenlied</hi> by
                    Schnorr. Adjoining the palace are two theatres, the Residenz or private theatre,
                    and the handsome Hoftheater, the largest theatre in Germany, accommodating 2500
                    spectators. The Allerheiligen-Hofkirche or court-church is a tasteful little
                    edifice in the Byzantine style with a Romanesque façade, somewhat recalling St
                    Mark’s at Venice.</p>
                <p>The Ludwigstrasse and the Maximilianstrasse both end at no great distance from
                    the Marien Platz in the centre of the old town. Here stands the Frauenkirche,
                    the cathedral-church of the archbishop of Munich-Freising, with its lofty
                    cupola-capped towers dominating the whole town. Though scarcely a pleasing piece
                    of architecture, it is imposing from its size, and interesting as one of the few
                    examples of indigenous Munich art. On other sides of this square are the old
                    town-house, restored in 1865, and the new town-house, the latter a handsome
                    modern Gothic erection, freely embellished with statues, frescos, and
                    stained-glass windows. The column in the centre of the square was erected to
                    commemorate the defeat of the Protestants near Prague in the Thirty Years’ War
                    (1638).</p>
                <p>Among the other churches of Munich—the town contains about forty in all—the chief
                    place is perhaps due to St Boniface’s, an admirable copy of an early Christian
                    basilica. It is adorned with a cycle of religious paintings by Hess, and the
                    dome is supported by sixty-four monoliths of grey Tyrolese marble. The new
                    parish church of Au, in the Early Gothic style, contains gigantic stainedglass
                    windows and some excellent wood-carving; and the church of St John in Haidhausen
                    is another fine Gothic structure. St Michael’s, in the Renaissance style,
                    erected for the Jesuits in 1583 to 1595, contains the monument of Eugène
                    Beauharnais by Thorwaldsen. The façade is divided into stories, and the general
                    effect is by no means ecclesiastical. St Peter’s is interesting as the oldest
                    church in Munich (12th century), though no trace of the original basilica
                    remains. One of the two Protestant churches is also a tasteful Gothic
                    building.</p>
                <p>The valuable collections of Munich, in virtue of which it ranks among the
                    art-centres of Europe, are enshrined in handsome and appropriate buildings, most
                    of them in <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n34/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0034-0025"/> the new Maximilian suburb on the north side of
                    the town. The old Pinakothek, erected by Klenze in 1826-1836 and somewhat
                    resembling the Vatican, is embellished externally with frescos by Cornelius and
                    statues of twenty-four celebrated painters by Schwanthaler. It contains a very
                    valuable and extensive collection of pictures by the earlier masters, the chief
                    treasures being the early German and Flemish works and the unusually numerous
                    examples of Rubens. It also affords accommodation to 300,000 engravings, 10,000
                    drawings, and a large collection of vases. Opposite stands the new Pinakothek,
                    the frescos on which, designed by Kaulbach, already show the effects of wind and
                    weather. It is devoted to works by painters of the present century, among which
                    Rottmann’s Greek landscapes are perhaps the most important. The Glyptothek, a
                    building by Klenze in the Ionic style and adorned with several groups and single
                    statues, contains a valuable series of sculptures, extending from Assyrian and
                    Egyptian monuments down to works by Rauch, Thorwaldsen, and other modern
                    masters. The celebrated Aeginetan marbles preserved here, found in the island of
                    Aegina in 1811, are perhaps the most important remains of archaic Greek
                    sculpture. Opposite the Glyptothek stands the exhibition building, in the
                    Corinthian style, used for periodic exhibitions of art. Munich also contains
                    several important private galleries, among which is Count Schack’s unequalled
                    collection of modern German pictures. The Kaulbach museum contains a selection
                    of the pictures and sketches left by the painter of that name; and a collection
                    has also been made of the models of Schwanthaler’s works.</p>
                <p>The scientific collections of Munich are on a par with its galleries of art. The
                    immense collection in the above-mentioned Bavarian national museum, illustrative
                    of the march of progress from the Roman period down to the present day, is
                    superior in completeness and proportion to the similar collections at South
                    Kensington and the Hôtel de Cluny. On the walls is a series of well-executed
                    frescos of scenes from Bavarian history, occupying a space of 16,000 square
                    feet. The ethnographical museum, the museum of plaster casts, the cabinet of
                    coins, and the collections of fossils, minerals, and physical and optical
                    instruments are also worthy of mention. The art union, the oldest and most
                    extensive in Germany, possesses good collections of modern works. The chief
                    place among the scientific institutions is due to the Academy of Science,
                    founded in 1759, to which some of the above-mentioned collections belong. The
                    royal library, containing 1,000,000 printed volumes and numerous valuable
                    manuscripts, occupies the third place among the libraries of the world. The
                    antiquarium is a collection of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman antiquities in the old
                    palace. The observatory is admirably equipped with fine instruments by the
                    celebrated Fraunhofer.</p>
                <p>At the head of the educational institutions of Munich stands the university,
                    founded at Ingolstadt in 1472, removed to Landshut in 1800, and transferred
                    thence to Munich in 1826. It has a staff of about 130 professors and lecturers,
                    and in 1882 was attended by 2183 students. In addition to the four usual
                    faculties there is a fifth, of political economy. In connexion with the
                    university are medical and other schools, a priests’ seminary, and a library of
                    200,000 volumes. The polytechnic institute, contained in a handsome brick
                    edifice, adorned with medallions of celebrated architects, mathematicians, and
                    naturalists, is also attended by a large number of students. Munich contains
                    three gymnasia or grammar-schools, a real-gymnasium, a military academy, a
                    veterinary college, two industrial schools, a commercial school, a school for
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n35/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0035-0026"/> architects and builders, several normal schools,
                    a conservatory of music, a dramatic training school, and about twenty-five
                    elementary schools. Among the numerous benevolent institutions the most
                    prominent are the asylums for the blind, the deaf and dumb, and the insane, and
                    the general hospital. The general prison in the suburb of Au is considered a
                    model of its kind; and a large military prison has just been erected. Amongst
                    the other public buildings which call for mention are the crystal palace, 765
                    feet in length, erected for the great exhibition of 1854; the slaughter-houses,
                    covering 9 acres of ground; the Wittelsbach palace, in the Early English Pointed
                    style; the post-office; the arsenal, containing a military museum; the new
                    railway station, the art-industrial institution, the Maximilian barracks, the
                    corn hall, and the aquarium. Among the numerous monuments with which the squares
                    and streets are adorned, the most important are the colossal statue of
                    Maximilian II. in the Maximilianstrasse, the equestrian statues of Louis I. and
                    the elector Maximilian, and the obelisk erected to the 30,000 Bavarians who
                    perished in Napoleon’s expedition to Moscow.</p>
                <p>Munich is well supplied with public parks. The English garden, to the north-east
                    of the town, is 600 acres in extent, and was laid out by the celebrated Count
                    Rumford in imitation of an English park. On the opposite bank of the Isar, above
                    and below the Maximilianeum, extend the Gasteig promenades, commanding fine
                    views of the town. To the south-west of the town is the Theresienwiese, a large
                    common where the popular festivals are celebrated. Here is situated the
                    Ruhmeshalle or hall of fame, a Doric colonnade containing busts of eminent
                    Bavarians. In front of it is a colossal bronze statue of Bavaria, 170 feet high,
                    designed by Schwanthaler. An admirable view is obtained from its summit. The
                    finest of the cemeteries of Munich is the southern cemetery, outside the
                    Sendlinger Thor. The dead-houses in the cemeteries are used for the strange
                    custom of keeping the corpses several days before interment, dressed in their
                    usual attire and exposed to public view. The botanical garden, with its large
                    palmhouse, and the Hofgarten, surrounded with arcades containing fine frescos of
                    Greek landscapes by Rottmann, complete the list of public parks.</p>
                <p>The population of Munich amounted at the census of 1880 to 230,023 inhabitants,
                    of whom 110,033 were males and 119,990 females. These lived in 8791
                    dwellinghouses, and formed 53,457 households. The garrison numbers about 7000
                    men. Only 37 per cent, of the inhabitants are born in Munich, most of the
                    remainder coming from the country districts of Bavaria (53 per cent.) and other
                    parts of Germany (5∣ per cent.). Another census was taken in 1882 to elicit the
                    occupations of the inhabitants, when it was found that 148,913 persons, or
                    considerably more than half the population (64 per cent.), were supported by
                    trading and manufacturing, while of the remainder 27,592 (12 per cent.) belonged
                    to the official, military, and professional classes, 30,038 (13 per cent.) had
                    no profession, and 24,237 (10 ’ 5 percent.) were engaged in domestic service.
                    The population has been quintupled since 1801, when it was only 48,885. In 1680
                    it was 20,000, in 1783 it was 38,000. The annual death-rate is high, exceeding
                    30 per thousand. This is, however, mainly accounted for by the abnormal
                    mortality among children, after allowance for which the rate is not over 20 per
                    thousand. About 85 per cent, of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics, and many of
                    Munich’s most characteristic features are due to the fact that it is the centre
                    of Roman Catholicism in southern Germany. Since the census of 1875 the number of
                    Protestants in Munich has increased by 32 per cent., while the Roman Catholics
                    have increased by 13⅜ per cent. only.</p>
                <p>Munich is the seat of the archbishop of Munich-Freising, and of the general
                    Protestant consistory for Bavaria. About thirty newspapers are published here,
                    including the principal Ultramontane sheets of south Germany. Some of the
                    festivals of the Roman Church are celebrated with considerable pomp; and the
                    people also cling to various national fêtes, such as the Metzgersprung, the
                    Schäfflertanz (occurring septennially), and the great October festival in the
                    Theresienwiese. The popular life of Munich may be said to revolve round its
                    breweries and beer-gardens, where the manners and customs of the people may be
                    conveniently studied.</p>
                <p>The commerce and manufactures of Munich are scarcely commensurate with its
                    artistic importance, though it has lately begun to take rank among the great
                    industrial centres. It has long been celebrated for its artistic handicrafts,
                    such as bronze-founding, glass-staining, silversmith’s work, and wood-carving,
                    while the astronomical instruments of Fraunhofer and the mathematical
                    instruments of Ertl are also widely known. Lithography, which was invented at
                    Munich at the end of last century, is still extensively practised here. The
                    other industrial products include wall-paper, railway plant, machinery, gloves,
                    and artificial flowers. Perhaps the most characteristic industry, however, is
                    the preparation of the national beverage. In 1879 upwards of 28 million gallons
                    of beer were brewed in Munich, only one-fifth of which was sent to other parts
                    of Bavaria or exported. This represents an annual consumption of at least 125
                    gallons per head of population, while the rate in England is only 40 gallons per
                    head. Trade, especially in grain and artistic goods, is now rapidly growing.
                    Four important markets are held at Munich annually.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The history of Munich, as distinct from that of
                    Bavaria, has been very uneventful. The Villa Munichen or <hi rend="italic">Forum
                    ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Monachos,</hi> so called from the monkish owners of the
                    ground on which it lay, was first called into prominence by Duke Henry the Lion,
                    who established a mint here in 1158, and made it the emporium for the salt of
                    Hallein and Reichenhall. The dukes of the Wittelsbach house occasionally resided
                    at Munich, and in 1255 Louis the Severe made it his capital, having previously
                    surrounded it with walls and a moat. The town was almost entirely destroyed by
                    fire in 1327, after which the emperor Louis the Bavarian, in recognition of the
                    devoted loyalty of the citizens, rebuilt it very much on the scale it retained
                    down to the beginning of the present century. Among the following rulers those
                    who did most for the town in the erection of handsome buildings and the
                    foundation of schools and scientific institutions were Albert V. (1550-1579),
                    William V. (1579-1596), Maximilian I. (1597-1651), Max Joseph (1745-1777), and
                    Charles Theodore (1778-1799). In 1632 Munich was occupied by Gustavus Adolphus,
                    and from 1705 to 1715, and again in 1742, it was in possession of the Austrians.
                    In 1791 the fortifications were razed, and room thus made for the enormous
                    development the city has since experienced. The modern history of Munich may be
                    dated from the accession of King Louis I. in 1825, since which, as already
                    indicated, nearly all the most handsome streets and buildings of the town have
                    been constructed. Like the Bavarians in general, the citizens of Munich are
                    naturally inclined to adhere to the traditionary both in politics and in
                    religion, but of late the population has become permeated with more advanced
                    ideas. *</p>
                <p>Munich’s importance in the history of art is entirely of modern growth, and may
                    be dated from the acquisition of the Aeginetan marbles by Louis I., then crown
                    prince, in 1812. Among the eminent artists of this period whose names are more
                    or less identified with Munich were Klenze, Ohlmiiller, Gartner, and Ziebland,
                    the architects; Cornelius, Kaulbach, Schnorr, and Rottmann, the painters; and
                    Schwanthaler, the sculptor. The art of frescopainting may be said to have been
                    resuscitated in Munich during this reign, and the artistic handicrafts of bronze
                    - founding and glass-staining were also practised with a success previously
                    unknown in modern days. Munich is still the leading school of painting in
                    Germany, but the romanticism of the earlier masters has been abandoned for
                    drawing and colouring of a thoroughly realistic character. Piloty and W. Diez
                    stand at the head of this school.</p>
