                    reproductions of his early attempts in this direction are given, along with
                    details of his life, in a scarce volume for the young, entitled <hi

                    rend="italic">nom-</hi><hi rend="italic">deplume</hi> of Theophilus Marcliffe,
                    and published in 1805.</p></note> When eleven years old Mulready was employed by
                    an artist named Graham as the model for a figure in his picture of Solomon
                    Blessed by his Father David. The painter’s interest in the lad did much to
                    confirm his artistic proclivities; and, having studied at home for two years,
                    Mulready applied for advice to Banks the sculptor, who sent him to a
                    drawing-school and permitted him to work in his own studio. In 1800 he was
                    admitted a student of the Academy, and two years later he gained the silver
                    palette of the Society of Arts. About this time he was associated with John
                    Varley, the eccentric water-colour painter and drawing-master, whom he assisted
                    in the tuition of his band of talented pupils, which included Cox, Fielding,
                    Linnell, William Hunt, and Turner of Oxford. At eighteen he married a sister of
                    Varley’s, and at twenty-four he was the father of four sons. The marriage was a
                    singularly unhappy one, and the pair separated before many years. With all these
                    “hostages to fortune” he had a hard struggle, but he was blessed with unfailing
                    energy and the power of steady application. He “tried his hand at everything,”
                    as he said, “from a miniature to a panorama.” He painted portraits, taught
                    drawing, and up till 1809 designed illustrations to a long series of children’s
                    penny books. His first pictures were classical and religious subjects of no
                    great merit, and the early works which he sent to the Academy were mainly
                    landscapes; but he soon discovered his special aptitude for genre-painting, and
                    in 1809 produced the Carpenter’s Shop, and in 1811 the Barber’s Shop, pictures
                    influenced by the example of Wilkie and the Dutch painters. In 1813 he exhibited
                    his Punch, a work more original and spontaneous in treatment, which brought the
                    artist into notice, and two years later his Idle Boys procured his election as
                    associate. Next year he received full academic honours, and the election was
                    fully justified by the Fight Interrupted which he then exhibited. It was
                    followed by the Wolf and the Lamb (1820), the Convalescent (1822), Interior of
                    an English Cottage (1828), Dogs of Two Minds (1830), the Seven Ages (1838), and
                    in 1839 and 1840 by the Sonnet and First Love, two of the most perfect and
                    poetical of the artist’s works. In 1840 he designed the well-known postal
                    envelope for Rowland Hill, and a set of illustrations to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vicar of Wakefield,</hi> which were succeeded by his paintings of the
                    Whistonian Controversy (1844), Choosing the Wedding Gown (1846), and Sophia and
                    Burchell Haymaking (1849). His later works, like the Bathers (1849), Mother
                    teaching her Children (1859), and the Toy Seller (1862) show declining powers,
                    mainly attributable to failing health. The last evening of his life was spent at
                    a meeting of the Academy, of which, for nearly fifty years, he had been a most
                    active and efficient member. He died of heart-disease on the 7th July 1863.</p>
                <p>In his way of work Mulready was most painstaking and conscientious, executing for
                    each picture very elaborate studies for the several parts, and many sketches for
                    colour and effect. His productions are characterized by accuracy of drawing and
                    richness of colouring; but they want something of the force and fire which come
                    of less considered and elaborate, but more instinctive and inspired,
                    workmanship.</p>
