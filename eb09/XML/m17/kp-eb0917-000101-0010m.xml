                    the most famous representative of the last period of Arabic poetry, though some
                    Eastern critics place him below Abιi Tammâm. He was the son of a water-carrier,
                    and is said to have picked up much of the literary knowledge for which he was
                    afterwards famous by haunting the bookstalls of his native city. He spent, too,
                    some years of his youth among the nomads of the Syro-Arabian desert, learning
                    their purer dialect and becoming imbued with their self-reliant spirit. Thus he
                    grew up a brave proud man, a gallant warrior as well as a poet, full of
                    ambition, not easily satisfied either with wealth or honours, indifferent to the
                    Koran and to the fasts and prayers of Islam, but untainted by the looseness of
                    morals common to the poets of those days. Such a character was not well fitted
                    for the part of a courtier, the only career that then lay open to a poet; for,
                    though no Arab poet deems himself humiliated by the most extravagant praises of
                    a generous patron, and none has written in this vein more extravagantly than
                    Abιi Ί-Tayyib, he was as exacting of due acknowledgment as prodigal of
                    adulation, and was too proud to endure a slight, even where it was dangerous to
                    show resentment. At first he essayed a greater and more perilous road to
                    distinction, appearing in the character of a prophet in the desert between the
                    Euphrates and Syria, where he formed a considerable party, but was arrested by
                    the governor of Emesa. A prison and the pillory cooled his enthusiasm; his
                    prophetic pretensions indeed are hardly a proof of genuine religious fervour,
                    for in the lands of Islam a revolutionary popular leader almost necessarily
                    seeks a supernatural sanction for his attempt. The name of Al-Motanabbi (he who
                    plays the prophet) clung to him, however, and is that by which he is still
                    commonly known. Regaining his liberty, he had to struggle for a time with
                    poverty and neglect. But his poetical talents at length found him patrons, and
                    in 337 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (948/9 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> he
                    became attached to the court of that famous warrior and patron of letters, Saif
                    al-Dawla, prince of Aleppo, to whom many of the best fruits of his muse were
                    dedicated, and by whose side he approved his valour in the field. But he had
                    rivals who knew how to inspire jealousy between him and the prince, and an angry
                    scene with the grammarian Khâla-waih, in which the latter closed a philological
                    dispute by striking Motanabbi on the face with a key which he had in his sleeve,
                    in the very presence of the prince and without rebuke from him, led the poet to
                    leave the court and seek a new career in the realm of the Ikhshidites. He now
                    took as his patron and the object of his eulogies Kâfùr, the regent of Egypt—a
                    hideous black eunuch whom it was indeed a humiliation to praise, but who knew
                    how to open the poet’s lips by great gifts and honours. Motanabbi, however,
                    sought a higher reward, the government of Sidon, and at length broke with Kâfùr,
                    wrote satires against him, and had to fly for his life to Cufa. A curious
                    anecdote relating to this part of his career will be found in Lane’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Arabian Nights,</hi> chap. viii. note 18. His next great patron
                    was 'Adud al-Dawla of Shirâz, and on a journey from Shirâz to Cufa he was
                    waylaid and slain, fighting bravely, by a chieftain of the Asad named Fâtik,
                    whose kinsfolk he had satirized (Sept. 965).</p>
                <p>The poetry of Motanabbi is to European taste much less attractive than the verses
                    of the ancient Arab poets, being essentially artificial and generally unreal,
                    though it has great technical merits and displays lively fancy and considerable
                    inventive power. It is mainly court poetry, but the poet has the credit of never
                    losing his self-respect in the presence of his patrons. Oriental taste, on the
                    other hand, places him on a very high pedestal, as may be judged from the fact
                    that more than four hundred commentaries were written on his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diwan</hi> (H. Khal., iii. 306). Dieterici’s edition of the poet, Berlin,
                    1858-6Ï, gives the commentary of Wâhidi; the Egyptian edition of 1870 has the
                    commentary of Okbari.</p>
