                    musicians the world has ever produced, was born at Salzburg, 27th January 1756.
                    He was educated by his father, Leopold Mozart, a violinist of high repute, in
                    the service of the archbishop of Salzburg. When only three years old he shared
                    the harpsichord lessons of his sister Maria, five years his senior. A year later
                    he played minuets, and composed little pieces, some of which are still preserved
                    in Maria’s music-book. Not long afterwards he attempted to write a concerto.
                    This, his father said, was so difficult that no one could play it, whereupon
                    Wolfgang replied that no one could be expected to play a great work like a
                    concerto without having first diligently practised it. When five years old he
                    performed in public, for the first time, in the hall of the university. In 1762
                    Leopold Mozart took Wolfgang and Maria on a musical tour, during the course of
                    which they played before most of the sovereigns of Germany. The little
                    “Wolferl’s”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The German
                    diminutive of Wolfgans.</p></note> charming appearance and disposition endeared
                    him to every one; and so innocent and natural were his manners that at Vienna he
                    sprang upon the empress’s lap and kissed her heartily. The emperor Francis I.
                    sat by his side while he played, and called him his “little magician.” When he
                    slipped one day on the polished floor the archduchess Marie Antoinette,
                    afterwards queen of France, lifted him up, whereupon he said, “You are very
                    kind; when I grow up I will marry you.” The favour shown to him at court was
                    almost incredible; yet he remained as gentle and docile as ever, and so amenable
                    to parental authority that he used to say, “Next after God comes my father.” In
                    1763 the whole family started again. Wolferl now sang, cotnposed, and played on
                    the harpsichord, the organ, and the violin, winning golden opinions everywhere.
                    At every court he visited he was loaded with caresses and presents; but the
                    journeys were expensive, and the family terribly poor. In Paris they lodged at
                    the Bavarian embassy, giving performances on a grand scale both there and at
                    Versailles, where Wolferl’s organplaying was even more admired than his
                    performance on the harpsichord. Here, also, he published his first
                    compositions—two sets of sonatas for the harpsichord and violin.</p>
                <p>On 10th April 1764 Leopold Mozart brought his family to England, engaging a
                    lodging in Cecil Court, St Martin’s Lane, whence he afterwards removed to Frith
                    Street, Soho. On 27th April and 19th May Wolferl played before the royal family
                    with immense success, accompanying the queen in a song and playing at sight
                    anything that the king set before him. “Our treatment here,” says Leopold Mozart
                    in one of his letters, “exceeds all our previous experience. We could not
                    believe ourselves in the presence of the king and queen of England, so friendly
                    were their manners.” Wolferl gave a public concert at the Great Room in Spring
                    Gardens on 5th June, and on the 29th played a concerto at Ranelagh. He now made
                    his first attempt at the composition of a symphony; published a <pb break="no"

                    wrote an anthem for four voices entitled <hi rend="italic">God is our

                    numbered “Select case C, 21, d.”</p></note> In July 1764 he played at Tunbridge
                    Wells, and soon afterwards Leopold Mozart caught a severe illness, during the
                    continuance of which he stayed with Dr Randall in Five Fields Row, now Lower
                    Ebury Street, Chelsea. On 12th February 1765 the children gave a concert at the
                    Little Theatre in the Haymarket, and another on 13th May at Hickford’s Room.
                    After this they gave private performances at the Swan and Hoop Tavern, Cornhill;
                    and on 17th September the family left England for the Hague, where they remained
                    some time, and where in March 1766 the young composer made his first attempt at
                    an oratorio, commanding in Holland a success as great as that he had already
                    attained in London, and astonishing his hearers at Haarlem by performing on the
                    then largest organ in the world. It would be impossible within the limits of a
                    sketch like the present to follow the history of this gifted boy through all its
                    extraordinary details. Towards the close of 1766 we find him at home in
                    Salzburg, diligently studying Fux’s <hi rend="italic">Gradus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Parnassum.</hi> In September 1767 he paid
                    a second visit to Vienna, and at the suggestion of the emperor Joseph II.
                    composed an opera bιιffa, <hi rend="italic">La Finta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Semplice,</hi> which, though acknowledged by the company for which it was
                    written to be “an incomparable work,” was suppressed by a miserable cabal. The
                    archbishop of Salzburg hearing of this commanded a representation of the
                    rejected work in his palace, and appointed the young composer his “maestro di
                    capella.” The office, however, was merely an honorary one, and, since it did not
                    involve compulsory residence, Leopold Mozart determined to complete his son’s
                    education in Italy, to which country he himself accompanied him in December
                    1769.</p>
                <p>Wolfgang, now nearly fourteen years old, was already an accomplished musician,
                    needing experience rather than instruction, and gaining it every day. His talent
                    was universally acknowledged. At Milan he received a commission to write an
                    opera for the following Christmas. At Bologna he found firm friends in the
                    venerable Padre Martini and the still more famous sopranist Farinelli. At
                    Florence he became so tenderly attached to Thomas Linley, a boy of extraordinary
                    promise and exactly his own age, that he parted from him with tears, which
                    seemed almost prophetic—for Linley was drowned in England at the early age of
                    twenty-two. Arriving in Rome on the Wednesday in Holy Week, he went at once to
                    the Sistine Chapel to hear the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Miserere</hi> of
                    Gregorio Allegri, which, on returning to his hotel, he wrote down from memory
                    note for note—a feat which created an immense sensation, for at that time the
                    singers were forbidden to transcribe the music on pain of excommunication. In
                    May he played at the Conservatorio della Pietà, in Naples, where the audience,
                    attributing his power to the magical effect of a ring, insisted upon its removal
                    from his finger. Returning to Rome towards the end of June, he was invested by
                    the pope with the order of “The Golden Spur,” of which he was made a
                    cavalière,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Auratae militiae</hi><hi rend="italic">eques.</hi></p></note> an
                    honour which he prized the more highly because, not many years before, it had
                    been conferred upon Gluck. In July he paid a second visit to Bologna, when the
                    Accademia Filarmonica, after subjecting him to a severe examination, admitted
                    him to the rank of “compositore,” notwithstanding a statute restricting this
                    preferment to candidates of at least twenty years old. The exercise which gained
                    him this distinction is a four-part composition in strict counterpoint on the
                    antiphon <hi rend="italic">Quaerite</hi><hi rend="italic">primum,</hi> written
                    in the severe ecclesiastical style of the 16th century and abounding in points
                    of ingenious imitation and device.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In October 1770 Wolfgang and his father returned to Milan for the completion and
                    production of the new opera. The libretto, entitled <hi rend="italic">Mitridate,
                    Re di</hi><hi rend="italic">Ponto,</hi> was furnished by an obscure poet from
                    Turin, to the great disappointment of the young maestro, who had hoped to set a
                    drama by Metastasio. The progress of the work was interrupted from time to time
                    by the miserable intrigues which seem inseparable from the lyric stage,
                    exacerbated in this particular case by the jealousy of the resident professors,
                    who refused to believe either that an Italian opera could be written by a native
                    of Germany, or that a boy of fourteen could manage the orchestra of La Scala, at
                    that time the largest in Europe. Fortunately the detractors were effectively
                    silenced at the first full rehearsal; and on the 26th of December Wolfgang took
                    his seat at the harpsichord and directed his work amidst a storm of genuine
                    applause. The success of the piece was unprecedented. It had a continuous run of
                    twenty nights, and delighted even the most captious critics.</p>
                <p>Wolfgang’s triumph was now complete. After playing with his usual success in
                    Turin, Verona, Venice, Padua, and other Italian cities, he returned with his
                    father to Salzburg in March 1771, commissioned to compose a grand dramatic
                    serenata for the approaching marriage of the archduke Ferdinand, and an opera
                    for La Scala, to be performed during the season of 1773. The wedding took place
                    at Milan on 21st October; and the serenata, <hi rend="italic">Ascanio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in Alba,</hi> was produced with an effect which completely
                    eclipsed Hasse’s new opera, <hi rend="italic">Ruggiero,</hi> composed for the
                    same festivity. The empress Maria Theresa was so delighted with it that in
                    addition to his fee she presented Wolfgang with a watch set with diamonds and
                    enamelled with her portrait; and Hasse, forgetful of his own defeat, generously
                    uttered the often-quoted prophecy, “This boy will cause us all to be
                    forgotten.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Questo
                    ragazzo ci farà dimenticar tutti.”</p></note></p>
                <p>During the absence of Wolfgang and his father the good archbishop of Salzburg
                    died; and in the spring of the year 1772 Hieronymus, count of Colloredo, was
                    elected in his stead, to the horror of all who were acquainted with his real
                    character. The Mozart family did their best to propitiate their new lord, for
                    whose installation Wolfgang, after his return from Milan, composed an opera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Il Sogno di</hi><hi rend="italic">Scipione</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but the newly-elected prelate had no taste for art, and was utterly
                    incapable of appreciating the charm of any intellectual pursuit whatever. For
                    the present, however, things went on smoothly. In October the father and son
                    once more visited Milan for the preparation and production of the new opera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lucio Silla,</hi> which was produced at Christmas with a success
                    quite equal to that of <hi rend="italic">Mitridate,</hi> and ran between twenty
                    and thirty nights. Unfortunately, however, these artistic triumphs were far from
                    profitable in their pecuniary aspect. The family grew poorer and poorer; and the
                    archbishop Hieronymus was not the man to rescue them from penury.</p>
                <p>In the meantime Wolfgang continued to produce new works with incredible rapidity.
                    In 1775 he composed an opera for Munich, <hi rend="italic">La Finta
                    Giardiniera,</hi> produced on 13th January. In the following March he set to
                    music Metastasio’s dramatic cantata, <hi rend="italic">Il Re Pastore.</hi>
                    Concertos, masses, symphonies, sonatas, and other important works, both vocal
                    and instrumental, followed each other without a pause. And this fertility of
                    invention, instead of exhausting<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n19/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0019-0010"/> his genius, seemed only to stimulate it to still
                    more indefatigable exertions. But the pecuniary return was so inconsiderable
                    that in 1777 Leopold Mozart asked the archbishop for leave of absence for the
                    purpose of making a professional tour. This was refused on the ground of the
                    prelate’s dislike to “that system of begging.” Wolfgang then requested
                    permission to resign his appointment, which was only an honorary one, for the
                    purpose of making the tour with his mother. The archbishop was furious; but the
                    plan was carried out at last, and on the 23d September the mother and son
                    started for Munich. The results were not encouraging. Leopold hoped that his
                    son, now twenty-one years old, might obtain some profitable court appointment;
                    but in this he was disappointed. And, worse still, poor Wolfgang fell in love at
                    Mannheim with a promising young vocalist named Aloysia Weber, whose father, the
                    prompter of the theatre, was very nearly penniless. On hearing of this Leopold
                    ordered his wife and son to start instantly for Paris, where they arrived on 23d
                    March 1778. Wolfgang’s usual success, however, seemed on this occasion to have
                    deserted him. His reception was a cold one; and, to add to his misery, his
                    mother fell seriously ill. He wrote home in unspeakable distress; but the worst
                    had not yet come. On 3d July the parent to whom he was so tenderly attached
                    expired in his arms. Reduced almost to despair by this new trouble, he left
                    Paris in September, rested for a while on his way home in Mannheim and Munich,
                    was received by Aloysia Weber with coldness almost amounting to contempt; and in
                    June 1779 he returned to Salzburg, hoping against hope that he might make some
                    better terms with the archbishop, who relented so far as to attach a salary of
                    500 florins (about &lt;£50) to his “concertmeister’s” appointment, with leave of
                    absence in case he should be engaged to write an opera elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Two years later the desired opportunity presented itself. He was engaged to
                    compose an opera for Munich for the carnival of 1781. The libretto was furnished
                    by the abbate Varesco, court chaplain at Salzburg, a truly sympathetic
                    collaborateur. On 29th January 1781 the work was produced under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Idomeneo,</hi><hi rend="italic">Re di Creta,</hi> with triumphant
                    success, and thenceforth Mozart’s position as an artist was assured; for this
                    was not only the finest work he had ever written but incontestably the finest
                    opera that had ever yet been placed upon the stage in any age or country. It
                    marked an era in the history of art, and raised the lyric drama to a level till
                    then unknown.</p>
                <p>And now the archbishop’s character exhibited itself in its true colours. Art for
                    its own sake he utterly disdained; but it flattered his vanity to retain a
                    famous artist in his service with the power of insulting him at will. On hearing
                    of the success of <hi rend="italic">Idomeneo</hi> he instantly summoned the
                    composer to Vienna, where he was spending the season. Mozart lost not a moment
                    in presenting himself, but he soon found his position intolerable. That he
                    should be condemned to dine with his patron’s servants was the fault of the age,
                    but the open disrespect with which the lowest menials treated him was due to the
                    archbishop’s example. Though received as an honoured guest in the houses of the
                    <hi rend="italic">haute noblesse</hi> of Vienna, he was uniformly addressed by
                    the archbishop in the third person singular, a form used in Germany to express
                    the utmost possible contempt. His salary was reduced from 500 to 400 florins, he
                    was left to pay his own travelling expenses, and he was not permitted to add to
                    his means by giving a concert on his own account or to play anywhere but at the
                    archiépiscopal palace; indeed it was only at the instance of a large number of
                    the nobility that he obtained leave to take part, gratuitously, in a concert
                    given for the poor. Archbishop Hieronymus was hated at court, and most of all by
                    the emperor Joseph, who, on retiring to Laxenburg for the summer, did not place
                    his name on the list of invited guests. This offended him so deeply that he left
                    Vienna in disgust. The household were sent on to Salzburg, but Mozart was left
                    to find lodgings at his own expense. Thereupon he sent in his resignation; and
                    for this act of contumacy was insulted by the archbishop in terms too vulgar for
                    translation. He persevered, however, in his resolution, taking lodgings in a
                    house rented by his old friends the Webers, and vainly hoping for pupils, since
                    Vienna at this season was perfectly empty. Happily he had a sincere though not a
                    generous well-wisher in the emperor, and a firm friend in the archduke
                    Maximilian, who, in common with many noblemen of rank, were disgusted with the
                    archbishop’s behaviour. By the emperor’s command he wrote a German opera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Entführung aus dem Serail,</hi> which on
                    16th July 1782 was received with acclamation, and not long afterwards was
                    performed with equal success at Prague. This great work raised the national
                    “singspiel” to a level commensurate with that which <hi rend="italic"
                    >Id&lt;rmeneo</hi> had already attained for the Italian “opera seria.” Gluck’s
                    great reform of the lyric drama (based, not, as is sometimes erroneously
                    supposed, on new principles invented by himself, but on those enunciated by Peri
                    and his associates as early as the year 1600, when the first Italian opera was
                    produced at Florence) had already attracted immense attention in Paris, and was
                    everywhere producing good fruit. It was impossible that it should do otherwise,
                    for it was founded on pure dramatic truth. But what Gluck worked out in
                    obedience to a carefully-elaborated theory Mozart effected by simple force of
                    natural dramatic instinct. Moreover, with all his love for graceful melody, his
                    power of expression, and dramatic force, Gluck was not great as a constructive
                    musician. On the other hand, the erudition which in 1770 had won Mozart’s
                    diploma from the Accademia at Bologna was no mere rusty exhibition of scholastic
                    pedantry. It enabled him to cast his music into symmetrical and well-considered
                    form, without sacrificing the demands of dramatic consistency; to enchant the
                    unlearned hearer with an endless flow of melody, while satisfying the cultivated
                    musician with the most ingenious part-writing that had ever been imagined in
                    connexion with the stage; to construct the grand finales that have made his
                    operas the finest in the world;—and all this with equal reverence for the claims
                    of legitimate art on the one side and those of passionate expression on the
                    other. For the finales are no dead forms, but living scenes developing the
                    action of the drama. And the impassioned utterances are no poor passagesof
                    “sound and fury,signifying nothing,” but well-constructed music, shapely and
                    beautiful,—music which Gluck himself, with all his genius, could no more hope to
                    rival than Hasse could hope to rival the choruses in <hi rend="italic">Israel in
                    Egypt.</hi> For Gluck, though his taste was as refined and his intellect as
                    highly cultivated as Mozart’s, was, as Handel justly observed, no contrapuntist;
                    and works like Mozart’s needed an intimate acquaintance with the mysteries of
                    counterpoint, no less than purity of taste and intellectual culture. And so it
                    comes to pass that Mozart’s operas still retain a stronger hold upon the
                    affections, both of the general public and the initiated worshipper of art, than
                    any other dramatic music that has ever been written.</p>
                <p>The next great event in Mozart’s life was a disastrous one. Though Aloysia Weber
                    had long since rejected him, his renewed intimacy with the family led to a most
                    unfortunate marriage with her younger sister, Constance, a woman who, neither
                    his equal in intellect nor his superior in prudence, added little to the
                    happiness of his life and less than nothing to its prosperity. The wedding took
                    place at St Stephen’s on 16th August 1782. By the end of the year the thriftless
                    pair were deenlv in debt. Mozart <pb break="no"

                    concerts, and was in greater favour than ever at court and with the nobility;
                    but to the last day of his life his purse was^ empty. He had, however, many kind
                    friends, not the least affectionate of whom was the veteran Haydn, who was
                    sincerely attached to him. With Gluck he was on terms of courteous intercourse
                    only. Salieri detested him, and made no secret of his dislike.</p>
                <p>Mozart’s next dramatic venture was a German singspiel in one act, <hi
                    rend="italic">Der Schauspieldirektor,</hi> produced at Schönbrunn, 7th February
                    1786. Not quite three months later, on 1st May, he produced his marvellous <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Nozze di Figaro,</hi> the libretto for
                    which was adapted from Beaumarchais by the abbé Da Ponte. The reception of this
                    magnificent work was enthusiastic. But Vienna was a hotbed of intrigue.
                    Everything that could be done by jealous plotters to mar the composer’s success
                    was done, and that so effectively that Mozart declared he would never bring out
                    another opera in the city which treated him so meanly. Fortunately, <hi
                    rend="italic">Figaro,</hi> like <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Entführung,</hi> was repeated with brilliant success at Prague. Mozart went
                    there to hear it, and received a commission to write an opera for the next
                    season, with a fee of 100 ducats. Da Ponte furnished a libretto, founded on
                    Tirso de Molina’s tale, <hi rend="italic">El Convidado de Piedra,</hi> and
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">II Don Giovanni.</hi> By 28th October 1787 the whole
                    was ready with the exception of the overture, not a note of which was written on
                    the evening before the performance. This circumstance has led to the idea that
                    it was composed in haste, but it is certain that Mozart knew it all by heart and
                    transcribed it during the night from memory, while his wife told fairy tales to
                    keep him awake. The opera was produced on 29th October with extraordinary
                    effect, and the overture, though played without rehearsal, was as successful as
                    the rest of the music.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Michael Kelly, in his <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi> has left a
                    delightful account of the circumstances.</p></note> Yet, when reproduced in
                    Vienna, <hi rend="italic">Don Giovanni</hi> pleased less than Salieri’s
                    comparatively worthless <hi rend="italic">Tarare.</hi></p>
                <p>On returning to Vienna Mozart was appointed kammer-compositor to the emperor with
                    a salary of 800 gulden (,£80). He also conducted Baron van Swieten’s concerts,
                    and composed great quantities both of sacred and secular music, but continued
                    miserably poor, while his wife had become a confirmed invalid. In April 1789 he
                    accompanied Prince Lichnowski to Berlin, where King Frederick William II.
                    offered him the post of “kapellmeister” with a salary of 3000 thalers (£450).
                    Though most unwilling to quit the emperor’s service, he informed him of the
                    offer and requested leave to resign his appointment in Vienna. “Are you going to
                    desert me, then <hi rend="italic">1”</hi> asked the emperor; and Mozart, wounded
                    by the reproach, remained to starve. The emperor now commissioned Mozart to
                    compose another Italian opera, which was produced 26th January 1790 under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Cosi fan tutte.</hi> Though the libretto by Da Ponte
                    was too stupid for criticism, the music was delicious, and the opera would
                    probably have had a long run but for the emperor’s death on 7th February. The
                    new emperor, Leopold II., was elected at Frankfort in September, and Mozart went
                    thither in the hope of giving some concerts, but he was obliged to sell his
                    plate to pay the expenses of the journey, and returned in December. In March
                    1791 Mozart consented to write a German opera upon an entirely new plan for
                    Schikaneder, the manager of the little theatre in the Wieden suburb. The piece
                    was addressed especially to the Freemasons and contained ceaseless allusions
                    both in the words and music to the secrets of the brotherhood. Deeply interested
                    in the affairs of a body of which he was himself a member,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Freemasonry did not at that time involve the
                    censure of the Catholic Church, or Mozart would certainly have renounced
                    it.</p></note> Mozart excelled himself in this new work, for the overture of
                    which he invented a new art-form, that of the “symphonic fugue.” He was rewarded
                    for his labours by a brilliant artistic success, but Schikaneder alone reaped
                    the financial benefit of the speculation.</p>
                <p>Before the completion of <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Zauberflöte</hi> a stranger called on Mozart, requesting him to compose a <hi
                    rend="italic">Requiem</hi> and offering to pay for it in advance. He began the
                    work under the influence of superstitious fear, believing that the messenger had
                    been sent from the other world to forewarn him of his own approaching death.
                    Meanwhile he received a commission to compose an opera, <hi rend="italic">La
                    Clemenza di Tito,</hi> for the coronation of the emperor at Prague. He worked
                    incessantly, and far beyond his strength. The coronation took place on 6th
                    September, and its splendours threw the opera very much into the shade. <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Zauberflöte</hi> was produced on 30th
                    September and had a splendid run. But the <hi rend="italic">Requiem</hi> still
                    remained unfinished; the stranger therefore made another appointment, paying a
                    further sum in advance. Mozart worked at it unremittingly, hoping to make it his
                    greatest work. His sacred music, though less florid than Haydn’s, was even more
                    voluptuously beautiful,— perfect in its kind, though showing no trace of the
                    stem grandeur of Handel, or the devotional purity of Palestrina. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Requiem</hi> he surpassed himself, but he was not permitted to
                    finish it. When the stranger called the third time the composer was no more. The
                    score of the <hi rend="italic">Requiem</hi> was completed by Siissmayer, whose
                    task, simplified by the instructions he had received from Mozart on his
                    death-bed, was a purely mechanical one. It is now known that the work was
                    commissioned by Count Walsegg, who wished to perform it as his own.</p>
                <p>Mozart died 5th December 1791, apparently from fever, though he believed himself
                    poisoned. His funeral was a disgrace to the court, the emperor, the public,
                    society itself. On the afternoon of the 6th his body was hurried to a pauper’s
                    grave; and because it rained Van Swieten, Siissmayer, and three other “friends”
                    turned back and left him to be carried to his last long home alone.</p>
                <p>Mozart’s compositions, whether for the church, the theatre, or the concert-room,
                    are pervaded, by an individuality of style which can never be mistaken. Of the
                    truthful expression of his dramatic music we have already spoken. Apart from its
                    innate beauty, its artistic strength consists in its perfect adaptation to the
                    situation for which it is designed. The same great quality characterizes his
                    symphonies, his concertos, and his sonatas for the pianoforte and other solo
                    instruments. Each work presents us with the logical and consistent development
                    of a noble idea, of which we never lose sight for a moment. No trace of
                    indecision or inconsequence is discernible in any part of the composition. Every
                    note is fitted into its place with a definite purpose, and takes its share in
                    the arrangement of the design with a certainty which leaves no doubt as to the
                    object for which it was introduced. The result of this well-considered symmetry
                    is a degree of technical perfection which no composer, ancient or modern, has
                    ever surpassed. But technical perfection does but supply the body into which
                    true genius alone can breathe the living soul. And here it is that we must look
                    for the inexpressible charm which Mozart’s music never fails to exercise upon
                    all who hear it. Its boundless wealth of melody is governed by a refinement of
                    taste which excludes every subject, every phrase, every minutest cadence which
                    is not both beautiful in itself and capable of enhancing the beauty of its
                    fellow-phrases. Mozart himself has left us, in a letter to Baron V , a memorable
                    description of the loving care he exercised in the selection of his charming
                    phrases. He tells us that his ideas flowed best when he was alone and feeling
                    cheerful. Having once conceived an idea he subjected it to a process of mental
                    elaboration which continued until the composition was complete. Then, and not
                    till then, he committed it to paper; and hence it was that he was able to write
                    out the overture to <hi rend="italic">Don Giovanni</hi> on the day of its first
                    performance.</p>
