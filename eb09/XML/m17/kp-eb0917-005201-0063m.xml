                <p><label type="entry">MURDER, MANSLAUGHTER</label>. In the law of England the
                    unlawful killing of a human being is either murder or manslaughter according as
                    it is or is not accompanied by circumstances constituting the element of malice
                    aforethought. That, according to the old definition of Coke, is the criterion by
                    which murder is distinguished from manslaughter.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“When a person of sound memory and discretion
                    unlawfully killeth any reasonable creature in being and under the king’s peace
                    with malice aforethought either express or implied” (Coke. 3 <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inst. ).</hi></p></note> In like manner Blackstone lays it down as a “general
                    rule” that all homicide is in the eye of the law malicious, and therefore
                    murder, unless it is either <hi rend="italic">justified</hi> by the command or
                    permission of the law, <hi rend="italic">excused</hi> on account of accident or
                    self-preservation, or <hi rend="italic">alleviated</hi> into manslaughter by
                    being the involuntary consequence of some act not strictly lawful, or occasioned
                    by some sudden and sufficiently violent provocation. An exact account of these
                    related offences can only be obtained by an examination of a vast number of
                    judicial decisions, most of which are to be found in the ordinary text-books.
                    (See, more particularly, Russell <hi rend="italic">On Crimes and
                    Misdemeanours.')</hi> The task of evolving exact definitions from this mass of
                    material has been successfully undertaken by Mr Justice Stephen, and we cannot
                    do better than present here the conclusions at which he has arrived. Art. 223 of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Digest of the Criminal Law</hi> is as follows
                    :—“Manslaughter is unlawful homicide without malice aforethought. Murder is
                    unlawful homicide with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought means any one or
                    more of the following states of mind preceding or coexisting with the act or
                    omission by which death is caused, and it may exist when that act is
                    unpremeditated :—(a) an intention to cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm
                    to, any person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not; (6)
                    knowledge that the act which causes death will probably cause the death of, or
                    grievous bodily harm to, some person, whether such person is the person actually
                    killed or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether
                    death or grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or by a wish that it may not be
                    caused; (c) an intent to commit any felony whatever; (c?) an intent to oppose by
                    force any officer of justice on his way to, on, or returning from the execution
                    of the duty of arresting, keeping in custody, or imprisoning any person whom he
                    is lawfully entitled to arrest, keep in custody, or imprison, or the duty of
                    keeping the peace or dispersing an unlawful assembly, provided that the offender
                    has notice that the person killed is such an officer so employed.” The
                    expression “officer of justice” in this clause includes every person who has a
                    legal right to do any of the acts mentioned, whether he is an officer or a
                    private person. Notice may be given either by word, by the production of a
                    warrant or other legal authority, by the known official character of the person
                    killed, or by the circumstances of the case. Art. 224 states that “homicide
                    which would <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n64/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0064-0053"/> otherwise be murder is not murder but
                    manslaughter if the act by which death is caused is done in the heat of passion,
                    caused by provocation,” the acts amounting to which are enumerated. But
                    provocation does not extenuate the offence “unless the person provoked is at the
                    time when he does the act deprived of the power of self-control by the
                    provocation which he has received, and in deciding the question whether this was
                    or was not the case regard must be had to the nature of the act by which the
                    offender caused death, to the time which elapsed between the provocation and the
                    act which caused death, to the offender’s conduct during that interval, and to
                    all other circumstances tending to show the state of his mind.”</p>
                <p>The law of the future is almost certainly to be found in the draft code presented
                    by the Criminal Code Bill Commissioners of 1879, and founded on Mr Justice
                    Stephen’s <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> above cited. The enactment of this
                    measure being a mere question of time some of its provisions may usefully be
                    stated here.</p>
                <p>After defining homicide and culpable homicide, the code (sect. 74) declares
                    culpable homicide to be murder in the following cases :—(a) if the offender
                    means to cause the death of the person killed; (5) if the offender means to
                    cause to the person killed any bodily injury which is known to the offender to
                    be likely to cause death, and if the offender, whether he does or does not mean
                    to cause death, is reckless whether death ensues or not; (c) if the offender
                    means to cause death or such bodily injury as aforesaid to one person, so that
                    if that person be killed the offender would be guilty of murder, and by accident
                    or mistake the offender kills another person though he does not mean to hurt the
                    person killed; (&lt;7) if the offender for any unlawful object does an act which
                    he knows or ought to have known to be likely to cause death, and thereby kills
                    any person, though he may have desired that his object should be effected
                    without hurting any one.</p>
                <p>Further (sect. 75), it is murder (whether the offender means or not death to
                    ensue, or knows or not that death is likely to ensue) in the following cases :—“
                    (a) if he means to inflict grievous bodily injury for the purpose of
                    facilitating the commission of any of the offences hereinafter mentioned, or the
                    flight of the offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and
                    death ensues from his violence; (&amp;) if he administers any stupefying thing
                    for either of the purposes aforesaid and death ensues from the effects thereof;
                    (c) if he by any means wilfully stops the breath of any person for either of the
                    purposes aforesaid and death ensues from such stopping of the breath.” The
                    following are the offences referred to: —“high treason and other offences
                    against the queen’s authority, piracy and offences deemed to be piracy, escape
                    or rescue from prison or lawful custody, resisting lawful apprehension, murder,
                    rape, forcible abduction, robbery, burglary, arson.” The code (sect. 76) reduces
                    culpable homicide to manslaughter if the person who causes death does so “in the
                    heat of passion caused by sudden provocation;” and “any <hi rend="italic"
                    >wrongful act or insult</hi> of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive any
                    ordinary person of the power of self-control may be provocation if the offender
                    acts upon it on the sudden, and before there has been time for his passion to
                    cool.” Whether any particular wrongful act or insult amounts to provocation and
                    whether the offender was deprived of self-control shall be questions of fact;
                    but no one shall be deemed to give provocation by doing that which he had a
                    legal right to do, or which the offender incited him to do in order to provide
                    an excuse for killing him or doing grievous bodily harm. Further, “an arrest
                    shall not necessarily reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter because an
                    arrest was illegal, but if the illegality was known to the offender it may be
                    evidence of provocation.” The “provocation” clause is not very happily expressed
                    and will doubtless have to be recast.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">America.—</hi> The most notable difference between England and
                    the United States in regard to the law on this subject is the recognition by
                    recent State legislation of degrees in murder. English law treats all unlawful
                    killing not reducible to manslaughter as of the same degree of guilt. American
                    statutes seek to discriminate between the graver and the less serious forms of
                    the crime. Thus an Act of the legislature of Pennsylvania (22d April 1794)
                    declares all murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison or by lying in
                    wait or by any other kind of wilful, deliberate, and premeditated killing, or
                    which shall be committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate any
                    arson, rape, robbery, or burglary shall be deemed murder of the first degree;
                    and all other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder of the second degree. This
                    statute, says Bishop <hi rend="italic">(Commentaries on the Criminal Law,</hi>
                    vol. ii. § 745), “is the parent of all the others.” In Michigan it has been
                    enacted in exact words; and in most of the other States which have adopted this
                    line of legislation the departure from the language of the Pennsylvania
                    provision is not such as calls for the application of different principles of
                    interpretation. It is pointed out by Bishop that the language used in these
                    statutes to discriminate the degrees of murder is similar to that by which the
                    common law distinction between murder and manslaughter is usually expressed.
                    Thus in Massachusetts murder committed with “deliberately premeditated malice
                    aforethought” is in the first degree. In Indiana the expression used is
                    “purposely and of deliberate and premeditated malice.” The technical
                    interpretation of “malice aforethought” in English law is of course inapplicable
                    to these phrases. There are also statutory degrees of manslaughter in the
                    legislation of some of the States, but Bishop observes that ‘‘ the books do not
                    contain sufficient adjudications to direct us into a profitable discussion of
                    this subject.”</p>
                <p>For some historical account of the law reference should be made to Mr Justice
                    Stephen’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Criminal Law of England</hi> (London,
                    1883), vol. iii. c. 26. Stephen finds in the laws of Alfred the earliest and
                    most important recognition of the properly criminal consequences of homicide as
                    distinguished from the damages to be paid to the family of the deceased and the
                    compensation to be made to the person whose peace had been broken, which are the
                    prominent points of the early law of homicide. (E. R.)</p>
