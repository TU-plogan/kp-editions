                    barbarous origin induced liliger to substitute for it the word <hi rend="italic"

                    purists.</p></note> though Motmot has been retained as the English form.
                    Linnaeus knew of only one species of Motmot, and referred it to his genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Ramphastos</hi> (properly <hi rend="italic">Rhamphastus')</hi>
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">R. momota.</hi> This is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Momotus brasiliensis</hi> of modern ornithologists, and from its
                    geographical range cannot be the original <hi rend="italic">Motmot</hi> of
                    Hernandez, but is most likely the “<hi rend="italic">Guira guainumbi</hi>” of
                    Marcgrave.</p>
                <p>The Motmots have been for many years recognized as forming a distinct family, <hi
                    rend="italic">Momotidae</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Prionitidae,</hi> of the
                    heterogeneous assemblage known as <hi rend="italic">Picariae</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Coccygomorphae∙,</hi> and the only question among systematists has
                    been as to their position in that group. This has been discussed and illustrated
                    with his usual assiduity by Dr Murie <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1872, pp.
                    383-412, pls. xiii.-xv.), who conclusively showed that the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tody</hi> (g-.v.) was the Motmot’s nearest existing relative, while he believed
                    that both <hi rend="italic">Momotidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Todidae</hi>
                    might be placed in one section <hi rend="italic">(Serratirostres')</hi> with the
                    <hi rend="italic">Coraciidae</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Roller,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.~), Mero-</hi><hi rend="italic">pidae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Alcedinidae</hi><hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Kingfisher,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 81). To the latter allocation Garrod <hi
                    rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1878, pp. 100-102) has since partly
                    demurred, though admitting the Kingfisher affinity, while upholding the former,
                    and even declaring that Motmots and Todies form but a single family. As the
                    conclusions of both these investigators are based on the sure ground of
                    anatomical structure, they are of incomparably greater value than most of those
                    arrived at by prior systematists who judged from external characters alone.</p>
                <p>In outward appearance the Motmots have an undoubted resemblance to Bee-eaters,
                    but, though beautiful birds, various shades of blue and green predominating in
                    their plumage, they do not exhibit such decided and brilliant colours; and,
                    while the Bee-eaters are only found in the Old World, the Motmots are a purely
                    Neotropical form, extending from southern Mexico to Paraguay, and the majority
                    of species inhabit Central America. They are said to be solitary birds, or at
                    most living in pairs, among the gloomy forests, where they sit on the underwood
                    nearly motionless, or only jerking their long tail as the cry “houtou” (or
                    something like it) is uttered. Their ordinary food is small reptiles, insects,
                    and fruits. The nest of one species, as observed by Mr Robert Owen, is at the
                    end of a hole bored in the bank of a watercourse, and the eggs are pure white
                    and glossy <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1861, p. 65). Little else has been
                    recorded of their ways.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Momotidae</hi> form but a small group, containing,
                    according to the latest enumeration of them in 1873 by Messrs Sclater and Salvin
                    <hi rend="italic">(Nomenclator,</hi> pp. 102, 103), but seventeen species,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The same number was
                    recognized by the first-named of these gentlemen in his review of the Family <hi

                    Murie <hi rend="italic">(l.cf</hi> would only recognize four— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Momotus, Baryphthengus, Hylomanes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Eumomota</hi>

                    require more space to indicate than can here be allowed; but it may be stated
                    that, while all have a general resemblance in the serrated edges of the bill and
                    many other characters, <hi rend="italic">Momotus</hi> has the normal number of
                    twelve rectrices, while the rest have only ten, which in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hylomanes</hi> have the ordinary configuration, but in adult examples of all
                    the others the shaft of the median pair is devoid of barbs for the space of
                    about an inch a little above the extremity, so as to produce a spatulate
                    appearance, such as is afforded by certain humming-birds known as “Racquettails”
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(Humming-bird,</hi> vol. xii. p. 357), Kingfishers of the

                    long ago asserted that this peculiarity was produced by the Motmot itself
                    nibbling off the barbs, and this extraordinary statement, though for <pb

                    Salvin <hi rend="italic">{Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1873, pp. 429-433), on Mr
                    Bartlett’s authority, to be perfectly true. The object with which the operation
                    is performed is wholly unknown. It is sometimes incompletely executed, and the
                    tail has then an asymmetrical form. This must have been the case with the
                    example that Hernandez described (Z.c.), and brought on himself the criticism of
                    Willughby <hi rend="italic">{Ornithologia,</hi> p. 298) for so doing. Much of
                    the bibliography of the family is given in Dr Murie’s paper already quoted; and
                    it may be remarked that in 1734 Seba, probably misled by wrong information,
