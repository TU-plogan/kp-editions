                <p><label type="entry">MUNICIPALITY</label>. A municipality is an organization for
                    the self-government of a city or town by means of a corporation empowered
                    generally to maintain peace and order, and to manage the affairs of the
                    inhabitants. Such a corporation consists of a head as a mayor or provost, and of
                    superior members as aidermen and councillors, together with the simple
                    corporators who are represented by the governing body; it acts as a person by
                    its common seal and has a perpetual succession with power to hold lands subject
                    to the restrictions of the Mortmain Laws, and it can sue or be sued or be
                    indicted, although there are of course many personal matters which do not come
                    within the functions and liabilities of such bodies politic. Where necessary for
                    its primary objects, every corporation has power to make byelaws and to enforce
                    them by penalties, provided they are not unjust or unreasonable or otherwise
                    inconsistent with the objects of the incorporation or charter or other
                    instrument of foundation; and in the case of a municipality such byelaws will be
                    binding even upon strangers within the district.</p>
                <p>Great Britain has no general system of self-government. A certain number of
                    cities and towns have been from time to time incorporated by the crown, or have
                    successfully claimed the privilege as existing from time immemorial, either
                    because in fact they have governed themselves from very ancient times, or
                    because they have had such a representation in parliament as led to a
                    presumption of their having been incorporated like the rest. The other urban
                    districts have been regarded as mere “upland towns” or populous townships, with
                    nothing but a parochial organization, or the faint semblance of municipal
                    institutions which grew out of the administration of fairs and markets. These
                    are now comprised in the various local government districts existing under the
                    Public Health Acts, “lighting and watching districts” constituted under an Act
                    passed for the purpose in 1833, and improvement districts governed under the
                    powers given by a number of local Acts. Provision has been made by the Acts
                    which regulate these corporations for the grant of powers of self-government to
                    new municipal boroughs subject to the approval of the committee of the privy
                    council. The making of corporations, however, is regarded as one of the highest
                    prerogatives of the crown, and the legislature has always been careful to avoid
                    unnecessary interference with the right; the functions of the committee are
                    therefore confined to the allowance or refusal of municipal powers as
                    constituted by statute, the right of the crown to make corporations of other
                    kinds being left in theory untouched.</p>
                <p>The term “municipal borough” was introduced when the larger corporations were
                    reformed in 1835 to denote a place to which the new powers of self-government
                    were applied, whether such a place were a parliamentary borough or not. It has
                    now become nearly equivalent to “municipality” owing to the provisions of the
                    Act of 1883 for extinguishing the less important of the small unreformed
                    municipalities, and for bringing the rest within the purview of the Municipal
                    Corporations Act, 1882, by which the provisions of the statute of 1835 and its
                    forty-two amending Acts were consolidated. The meaning of the word “borough” has
                    undergone many changes. It seems at first to have denoted a walled town or city,
                    but it was soon applied especially to such of them as possessed some kind of
                    organization for the transaction of the local business. At a later period the
                    term implied the right to be represented in parliament. This may be illustrated
                    by the proceedings in the case of Torrington in the reign of Edward III. This
                    place, whether a “burgh” or a mere “vill,” had in fact sent burgesses to
                    parliament, but after it was determined that such representation was improper
                    the town was omitted from the category of boroughs. In summoning the commons to
                    parliament each sheriff was directed to procure the election of two citizens
                    from every city and two burgesses from every borough in his bailiwick. But it
                    soon became the practice to omit places which had been represented, and to
                    include others with no title to the privilege except their situation on the
                    royal demesnes, or their political or commercial importance. It resulted that
                    the word “borough” came to denote only those places which were usually
                    represented in parliament, whether they were walled towns or not, and whether
                    they had or had not received charters of incorporation; and in course of time it
                    was taken for granted that every parliamentary borough must have been
                    incorporated at some ancient time, or in other words was entitled to the
                    privileges of a borough by prescription. The first Reform Act changed the
                    meaning of the word again by depriving the smaller boroughs of their
                    parliamentary functions and reducing them to the same position as those
                    districts which were known as boroughs in a popular sense, as having originally
                    had a representation which had been lost, or as being important places enjoying
                    municipal rights under charters like those which had been granted to the
                    parliamentary boroughs.</p>
                <p>We shall now proceed to describe the ordinary constitution of an English
                    municipal borough, omitting the small municipalities which are now in course of
                    extinguishment, and for other reasons omitting the city of London, which, on
                    account of its singular importance and its peculiar circumstances, will probably
                    become without much delay the subject of separate legislation (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">London).</hi></p>
                <p>These boroughs are governed by corporations composed in each case of a mayor,
                    aidermen, and burgesses, acting by a council elected by the general body of
                    qualified corporators. If the borough is a city, the burgesses are described as
                    the “citizens.” With a few exceptions arising under local Acts, the following
                    description applies to all the municipal boroughs in England and Wales, similar
                    provisions having been made for the boroughs of Scotland and Ireland (see vol.
                    iv. p. 63) by Acts of Parliament passed for those parts of the United Kingdom.
                    The powers and duties of the council are defined by the Municipal Corporations
                    Act, 1882, which forms a complete municipal code. The number of councillors
                    varies from twelve to forty-eight according to the size of the borough, and in
                    the case of a new incorporation the number is fixed by a provision in the
                    charter. The qualification of a councillor is to be an enrolled resident
                    burgess, or, if not resident within the district, residing within 15 miles of
                    the borough and having in either case the property qualification required by the
                    Act, provided that he is not a clergyman or a regular dissenting minister, or
                    interested in any office, place, or contract with which the corporation is
                    concerned. The qualification of a burgess is to be enrolled on the burgessroll
                    as the rate-paying occupier of a house or other building in the borough or
                    within 7 miles distance from it. Women may be burgesses, but are not qualified
                    for corporate office. In many boroughs there are ancient classes of freemen
                    qualified as such by birth, servitude, or marriage (and formerly in many cases
                    qualified by gift or purchase); but these freemen as such have not the rights of
                    burgesses, though they are entitled to the parliamentary franchise and to their
                    share in the charities and corporation property under titles accruing to their
                    class before the reform of 1835. The qualification of an aiderman is the same as
                    that of a councillor, and the mayor is chosen from the aidermen, or councillors,
                    or persons qualified for such positions.</p>
                <p>The councillors hold office for three years, one-third of their number being
                    annually renewed by ballot. If the borough is divided into wards, an aiderman
                    acts as returning-officer for the elections in each ward; if not, the mayor <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n37/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0917-0037-0028"/> acts as the returning-officer for the
                    borough. Municipal elections fall within the provisions of the Corrupt Practices
                    Act, 1883. The aidermen hold office for six years, one-half of their number
                    retiring every three years in rotation. The mayor holds office for one year. His
                    election is the first business at the quarterly meeting held on the 9th day of
                    November, when the amount of his remuneration is fixed by the council. He is the
                    only member of the corporation who receives a salary. The council chooses the
                    mayor and aidermen and appoints the officers of the corporation, as the
                    town-clerk and treasurer, the sheriff when the borough is a county of itself,
                    and the coroner and clerk of the peace when it has separate quarter-sessions.
                    The council appoints such general and special committees as may be required, and
                    has the general management of the corporate property, subject to the supervision
                    of the treasury; it makes all necessary byelaws, subject to disallowance by the
                    privy council if necessary. With exceptions arising from the provisions of local
                    Acts, the council regulates the police force, the lighting and watching of the
                    borough, the management of markets and burial-grounds, and the execution of the
                    laws relating to public health. The expenses are defrayed out of the borough
                    fund, which includes the income of the general corporate estate, supplemented by
                    a boroughrate paid out of the poor-rate or assessed upon a similar basis. A
                    watch-rate, if required, may be levied on the whole borough or on a selected
                    portion of the district. When expenditure is required for objects of a permanent
                    character, the council is empowered to raise the amount by loans, charged on the
                    rates and repayable by instalments, subject to the approval of the treasury or
                    other public department entrusted with the control of the matter, according to
                    the nature of the improvement required. The whole of the accounts are audited by
                    borough auditors, of whom one must be a councillor appointed by the mayor, and
                    the other two elected by the burgesses from persons qualified to be councillors.
                    A return is made to the Local Government Board of the receipts and expenditure
                    for the year, and an abstract of all these returns is laid every year before
                    parliament. Some control over the expenditure is also reserved to the High Court
                    of Justice by a provision that all orders for payment must be signed by three
                    councillors and the town-clerk, and that any such order may be moved by <hi
                        rend="italic">certiorari</hi> into the Queen’s Bench Division. The aidermen
                    have no greater powers than other councillors, excepting that they may act as
                    the returning-officers for wards as above mentioned, and that an aiderman may
                    act for the mayor if he is temporarily unable to discharge his duty and has not
                    appointed a deputy. The mayor is the head of the corporation, and is <hi
                        rend="italic">ex officio</hi> a magistrate for the borough and a member of
                    the watch committee. He is the returning-officer at parliamentary elections, and
                    acts with two elected revising assessors as the revising officer if the borough
                    is not represented in parliament. His office is vacated by death or bankruptcy,
                    and must be filled up with all convenient speed after any such vacancy occurs.
                    The last ex-mayor is also <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> a magistrate for the
                    borough.</p>
                <p>Where the borough has a separate commission of the peace, the borough justices,
                    with the last-mentioned exceptions, are appointed by the crown. A separate
                    commission does not of itself exempt the borough from the concurrent
                    jurisdiction of the county justices. A stipendiary magistrate may be appointed
                    by a secretary of state on the application of the council, and when appointed he
                    is <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> a justice for the borough. When the borough
                    has a separate court of quarter-sessions the recorder is the judge, but in
                    certain cases may appoint an assistant or deputy; the recorder must be a
                    barrister of five years’ standing, and is appointed by the crown on the
                    recommendation of the home secretary; the recorder is also <hi rend="italic">ex
                        officio</hi> a justice for the borough. When the borough has such a court it
                    ceases to be liable to the county-rate, but must contribute to the expenses
                    arising from prosecution and conviction of prisoners from the borough at the
                    assizes. In the case of boroughs which were liable before 1832 to contribute to
                    the county-rate, a contribution to the expenses of the county is still required.
                    Subject to an exception as to judges and assessors appointed before 1835, and to
                    the provisions of various local Acts, the recorder is the judge of any civil
                    court existing in the borough by prescription.</p>
                <p>We shall now discuss more generally the origin of these municipalities upon the
                    Continent as well as in the United Kingdom. The conception of the borough as it
                    now exists has obviously been copied from the Roman <hi rend="italic"
                        >municipium.</hi> As to England, however, the coincidence is in one sense
                    accidental, inasmuch as it had a municipal system before the lawyers adopted the
                    notion of a corporation from the civilians, though it may be true that no such
                    system could grow up without being influenced by ideas which were familiar to
                    the churchmen. In some parts of the West the Roman system appears to have lived
                    on without an actual breach of continuity. The “curia” seems to have continued
                    in the cities of Provence until the outbreak of the great revolution. At Treves
                    and Cologne “the Roman language perished, but the institutions survived;” and
                    the <hi rend="italic">libertas Romana</hi> or full body of municipal privileges
                    was extended gradually to other cities on the Rhine and the trading communities
                    of Holland and Brabant. It is possible also that some relics of the imperial
                    administration may have continued in southern Italy and in a few of the Lombard
                    cities. One element at least in the corporation of Paris can be traced back to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nautae</hi><hi rend="italic">Parisiaci,</hi> a college of
                    merchants established in the first period of the empire. But the English
                    municipalities are in no sense a legacy from the imperial times, or a
                    continuation of the system which prevailed in the cities of Britain, even in the
                    few instances, as in London, York, and Exeter, where there may have been an
                    unbroken succession of occupancy. Almost all the towns were destroyed in the
                    course of the English conquest, and some which became important again, as Bath,
                    Cambridge, and Chester, are known to have lain waste for centuries. In other
                    instances the English kings soon learned to hold their courts in the fortresses,
                    and to set up their farmsteads in the desolated palaces, or elsewhere a Roman
                    camp may have been taken as a convenient point for a garrison, which in time
                    became a “civil centre” and the site of a municipal borough.</p>
                <p>The French municipalities can be traced to several distinct sources of origin.
                    The chief activity was in the north; the southern cities kept their Roman
                    traditions or imitated the Italian model, as those in the east endeavoured to
                    secure the same privileges as the mercantile communities on the Rhine; in the
                    central provinces the towns for the most part retained the organization of the
                    parish, and were rather <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisies</hi> or privileged
                    market-towns than <hi rend="italic">communes</hi> with powers of
                    self-government. The rise of the communes began under Philip I., and they became
                    general in the 13th century. The first charter was granted to Le Mans in 1072,
                    and another to Cambray in 1076; these were followed by grants to Laon, Beauvais,
                    Amiens, Soissons, and many other places; and similar privileges were granted in
                    the 12th century by the counts of Flanders, the dukes of Burgundy, and other
                    princes,—the general effect of the grants being to fix the lord’s rent or
                    tribute, to commute the military service, and to give jurisdiction to
                    magistrates either freely elected or chosen by the townsmen in conjunction with
                    their feudal lords. Specimens<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0917-0038-0029"/> of these charters can be seen in the <hi

                        <hi rend="italic">Amiens.</hi> They show us a political revolution directed
                    against the feudal lord by townsmen associated in merchant-guilds or sworn into
                    a new sort of brotherhood. To break the oath of loyalty to the commune is a
                    crime of the gravest kind. “If any of us aid or comfort our enemies he is guilty
                    of <hi rend="italic">lèse-commune,</hi> and we will pull down his house, if we
                    can. . . . Whoever wounds with weapon any of his fellows shall lose his fist or
                    pay nine livres” (Amiens). “The men shall take what wives they please, first
                    asking leave; if their lord refuse, and a man take a wife from another lordship,
                    he shall pay but five sous for a fine. Every one living within the district
                    shall take the communal oath or answer with house or goods” (Soissons). These
                    charters are important because the <hi rend="italic">communa</hi> of London was
                    founded under Richard I. in direct imitation of the French example, and soon
                    became the type of the independence which the other boroughs continually
                    struggled to attain; and, as in France, the great men deplored the revolt as <hi
                        rend="italic">tumor</hi><hi rend="italic">plebis, timor regis, tepor
                        sacerdotii,</hi> while the kings for their own purposes encouraged the
                    popular movement. And in the same way Γhilip Augustus and his successors were so
                    ready to protect the communes that they eventually claimed and obtained an
                    immediate seigniory over all the chartered boroughs to the exclusion of any
                    private lords to whom the towns had formerly belonged. Another point of
                    importance lies in the fact that the lords not only settled the local laws of
                    inheritance and other customs “running with the land,” but sometimes changed
                    them at the townsmen’s request, as if it were merely an affair between lord and
                    tenant. There are English examples of the same practice, which seems to have
                    been not entirely discontinued until the reign of Edward I. A prerogative of
                    this nature was exercised by the archbishop in Kent, and Simon de Montfort in
                    1255, at the request of his burgesses of Leicester, abolished the custom of
                    descent to the youngest son. Fitzosberne appears by Domesday Book to have
                    granted a separate set of customs to his “Frenchmen” in Hereford, and a
                    difference of the same kind which existed at Stafford and Nottingham must have
                    been caused by similar grants; in the latter place it was found on a trial in
                    the reign of Edward III. that there were two districts in the town, the one
                    called the “French borough” and the other the “English borough,” where descent
                    was to the youngest son, a circumstance which gave its name to the custom of
                    “borough-English.”</p>
                <p>Municipal freedom was granted in Spain at an earlier date and on an ampler scale,
                    as beseemed the poverty of the kings, the weakness of the nobles, and the
                    constant danger from the Moors. The Visigothic laws were imbued with the
                    principles of the Theodosian code, and it was easy for the Spaniards to regard
                    the incorporated cities as bodies politic of the highest importance. The first
                    instance of the erection of such a community was the grant in 1020 of a code of
                    privileges to Leon. Such grants were treaties between the king and the chartered
                    towns, by which the latter obtained fixed laws, extensive territories, and the
                    choice of their own magistrates in return for a tribute and universal service in
                    the militia. The king appointed a governor to take charge of the fortified
                    places, but in almost every other respect the inhabitants governed themselves.
                    This democratic constitution was after a time impaired by the claims of the
                    knights or “Caballeros” to a monopoly of office; but what actually led to its
                    destruction was the increase in the power of the crown. The disorders
                    inseparable from popular elections were declared, as in England under the
                    Tudors, to be a reason for vesting the government in a small and close
                    corporation, which was soon found to be quite amenable to the influence and
                    dictation of the court.</p>
                <p>The municipalities of every country have a separate history of their own, and it
                    is difficult to find any general law for determining their methods of
                    development. According to their opportunities the oppressed wear out their
                    conquerors’ patience and too often become oppressors in their turn: as the state
                    becomes more complex the old confederacies are broken up, and the scattered
                    communities are reduced to order by a central government, and as privilege
                    begins to disappear the towns are regulated by a common set of rules, or the
                    whole country, as in France, is parcelled out again into a new series of
                    communes or corporate districts. In Spain, as we have seen, the needs of the
                    state gave immediate freedom to its defenders. In Italy the cities grew too soon
                    into a crowd of independent republics. The history of Lincoln and Exeter and the
                    cities of the Danelagh shows that “the tendency of the great cities of England
                    was towards a more than municipal independence” (Freeman, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Engl. Towns,</hi> p. 206). If these movements had not been checked by the
                    Norman Conquest, English history might have been “like that of the imperial
                    kingdoms.” But, as this event turned out, there is little in the record of the
                    German cities which bears upon that of English municipalities, excepting some
                    slight resemblances between the powers acquired by the city of London and those
                    of the Hanse towns and the mercantile principalities of Nuremberg and Augsburg.
                    The free cities of Germany were at first divided between the emperors and their
                    immediate vassals, the former ruling through the bishops as imperial vicars; in
                    the 12th century the citizens began to elect councils and to administer a
                    concurrent jurisdiction; in the next century they either purchased full powers
                    or drove out the vicars and bailiffs by force; the revolutions which followed
                    the fall of the Hohenstauffen family enabled the cities to free themselves from
                    the mediate lords and to hold directly of the empire, and they were soon
                    afterwards admitted to the diet on equal terms with the rest of its sovereign
                    constituents.</p>
                <p>The borough when it appears in English history is essentially a place of defence,
                    and the definition includes the powerful city which formed the metropolis of an
                    ancient kingdom, the border-fortress, the walled seaport, the “burh” erected in
                    a disaffected province, and the fortified village on the private demesne of the
                    king. There is another sense of the word “borough,” as used in Kent and the
                    neighbouring counties, to denote the small rural division which is elsewhere
                    called a “tithing,” the constable or tithing-man being the same officer as the
                    “borsholder” or “borough-elder” of the eastern counties; but the verbal
                    similarity is accidental, the rural “borough” having been the district of the
                    “frank-pledges” or neighbours under a pledge or “borh” to act as bail for each
                    other. The borough or “burh” was confined to the precinct of the walls, though
                    the town or city might extend to a greater distance, or the burgesses might be
                    joint-owners of estates outside the lines of defence. There might even be two
                    “burhs” side by side if the nature of the locality required it. We read in the
                    Chronicle, for instance, of the construction of the “northern burh” at Hertford
                    in 913, and of “burhs” being built five years later on both sides of the river
                    at Buckingham; and many other examples will be found collected in Kemble’s list
                    of the towns.</p>
                <p>Little is known of the civil constitution of the boroughs before the Norman
                    Conquest, and even the Domesday survey fails to give much information as to
                    their internal affairs where the king’s rights were not immediately concerned.
                    It appears indeed that Lincoln and the other cities of the Danelagh were almost
                    independent; an aristocratic commonwealth in each case was governed by twelve
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n39/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0917-0039-0030"/> hereditary judges, and the same kind of
                    organization, but with a less degree of independence, appeared at Chester and
                    Ipswich. The size and the wealth or power of places like Canterbury, Taunton,
                    and Sandwich entitled them to be treated as separate “hundreds,” and the
                    constitution of London must have been based on that of a shire; but, speaking
                    generally, it may be said that the ordinary boroughs were without any powers of
                    self-government. Each borough was administered as if it were a township or
                    cluster of townships, intersected in most cases by a number of separate
                    jurisdictions and subject to the obligations of tenure which bound many of the
                    burgesses to lordships outside the walls. The borough-courts were held by the
                    reeve or bailiff, who may have been in many cases elected, but was always
                    answerable to an external authority. If the place was of mercantile importance
                    it was called a port (from “porta,” the city-gate), and the court and its
                    president, as in London, Canterbury, and Bath, were styled the “port-mote” and
                    “port-reeve.” In the smaller boroughs the reeve’s functions must have resembled
                    those of the steward in the ordinary manorial courts. When municipal rights were
                    granted by the Plantagenet kings this officer was replaced by the “mayor,” whose
                    appearance is always the sign of the establishment of an independent commune.
                    The first steps toward self-government were taken when the burgesses became the
                    owners, as at Oxford and Colchester, of property which they managed in common.
                    But a more important source of municipal privilege is to be found in the
                    institution of the guilds, which in time acquired the control and monopoly of
                    the local commerce, so that in the reign of Henry II. the possession of a
                    merchant-guild, or “hanse” as it was called in the north, became “the token of
                    municipal independence,” the guild being in fact (if not in theory) the
                    governing body of the town. The courts in later times have accordingly held, as
                    in the case of Totnes, that the grant of <hi rend="italic">gilda</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">mercatoria</hi> implies the incorporation of the borough. The
                    guilds appear first in a religious form, and date in all probability from the
                    times when the neighbours met to drink at the pagan festivals or the feasts in
                    honour of the dead. Other voluntary associations of the same kind were formed as
                    clubs and friendly societies for mutual insurance and defence. The “frith-gild”
                    of London, as it existed in the reign of Athelstane, and the later
                    “knighten-guild,” the “thanes’ guild” at Cambridge, and the guilds of Canterbury
                    and Exeter were all fraternities of this kind. The “chapmanguild” (“hanse”- or
                    merchant-guild) was an association on the same model but on a larger scale,
                    comprising all the traders in the town, and assuming the power to make bylaws to
                    regulate all the local business which did not fall within the jurisdiction of
                    the regular courts. The London knighten-guild, until it was suppressed by Henry
                    I., had a legal jurisdiction in the district of Portsoken Ward. The ancient
                    descriptions of Winchester mention two knighten-guilds where the “probi homines”
                    were wont to drink their guild (“potabant gildam suam ”). The “gild-halla” of
                    the men of Dover is mentioned in Domesday Book. When the boroughs were
                    enfranchised as communes upon the French model care was taken to confirm and
                    establish these trading fraternities as forming the most important members of
                    the new corporations. Thus in 1200 King John granted to the burgesses of
                    Nottingham “a merchant-guild with all the liberties and free customs which ought
                    to pertain thereto,” and the grant to Ipswich in the same reign, besides
                    preserving and extending the jurisdiction of the twelve “portmen” or capital
                    burgesses, provides that the common council shall elect a fit man to be aiderman
                    of the merchant-guild. The same king granted to Dublin the right of having
                    guilds “as in Bristol.” York and Beverley had the right to have a “hans-hus”
                    some time before, in the latter case by the grant of Archbishop Thurstan in the
                    reign of Henry I.</p>
                <p>Another valuable franchise was obtained when the boroughs procured a separate
                    assessment of their dues to the crown. Except in the case of the most important
                    cities, the boroughs were regarded as parts of the counties in which they were
                    situate and as answerable accordingly to the sheriff. It was of the highest
                    importance to the burgesses that their share of the county-dues should be
                    ascertained, and even before the Norman Conquest it became the practice for the
                    borough to answer for its own dues under the name of <hi rend="italic">firma
                        burgi.</hi> The Domesday survey shows that Dover, Sandwich, Bath,
                    Huntingdon, and many other boroughs had obtained a privilege of this kind. A
                    borough paying its fixed assessment to the king or other lord, through the reeve
                    or aiderman of the merchant-guild, was regarded as a single tenant holding the
                    borough for years or at will or in perpetuity, according to the nature of the
                    contract. When its dues and services were assessed in perpetuity the borough was
                    said to be “affirmed” or held in fee-farm, and the burgesses were thenceforth
                    treated as freeholders by a burgage tenure. The only rights remaining to
                    complete their municipal independence were attained when the sheriff’s
                    jurisdiction was ousted and the burgesses were allowed to elect their own
                    magistrates to administer justice in the local courts. In the reign of Henry
                    III. the great lords began to enfranchise their boroughs in imitation of the
                    royal example. The statute of <hi rend="italic">Quo Warranto</hi> in 1290 led to
                    the confirmation of these charters by the crown, and the doctrine was soon
                    established that none but the king had authority to erect a commune. The
                    Scottish boroughs obtained complete self-government at an earlier date, King
                    David I. (1124- 1153) having been anxious to attract commerce, and the walled
                    towns having soon been filled with “a crowd of willing settlers from southern
                    Britain and Flanders.” Edinburgh, Stirling, Roxburgh, and Berwick formed an
                    important commercial league, “to which the other burghs conformed as they came
                    into existence” (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">Early Kings,</hi> i. 298). Both in
                    England and Scotland the boroughs, whether founded by the crown or by private
                    lords, were important elements in the state, and in England both classes were
                    summoned to parliament indifferently; in 1298 a writ was issued for
                    Northallerton, which belonged to the bishop of Durham, though by a curious
                    anomaly his city of Durham only acquired the franchise by an Act passed in 1673.
                    The introduction of the metaphysical idea of a corporation may be ascribed to
                    the influence of Bracton, who wrote under Henry III. (De <hi rend="italic"
                        >Legibus,</hi> 57; <hi rend="italic">Fleta,</hi> vi. 13). We find Edward I.
                    in 1284 granting franchises to the burgesses and community of Nottingham and
                    their “successors,” the old form being “to the burgesses and their heirs.” The
                    practice varied according as the feudal or the ecclesiastical way of regarding
                    such grants prevailed, until in 1440 the town of Kingston-upon-Hull was
                    incorporated as a body politic according to the modem form. The government of
                    the boroughs soon fell to close governing bodies, constituted by restraining
                    ordinances, and the Stuarts made incessant attempts to obtain the nomination
                    even of these smaller bodies. After the fall of the corporation of London in
                    1681 the provincial boroughs lost or surrendered their privileges; and, though
                    the charters were revived at the Revolution, the narrow and corrupt system
                    remained. The commissioners of 1835 reported a general and just dissatisfaction
                    with the state of the municipal institutions, great distrust of the self-elected
                    councils, and discontent under the burden of local taxation for purposes which
                    were regarded with suspicion. The reform in England followed swiftly on the
                    famous report, and by Acts passed soon afterwards the Scotch and Irish boroughs,
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n40/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0917-0040-0031"/> which had long been subject to the same
                    evils, were reconstructed under similar schemes.</p>
                <p>The privileges of the cities in the United States illustrate the proposition that
                    the history of every country must determine the type of its municipalities. In
                    almost all parts of Europe the civic franchises arose out of some treaty or
                    contract between the lord and his dependents; in France, however, the character
                    of the corporations was gradually modified as the communal system was extended
                    to the rural districts. In the United States the French model has been followed
                    with the addition of many improvements and where self-government has been
                    impartially granted to the county, the township, and the village the purely
                    municipal organization has lost its special significance. It is regarded in the
                    American courts as a revocable agency established by the State (without contract
                    or consideration for the grant) for the purpose of carrying out the necessary
                    details of civil government among the inhabitants of an urban district. It is
                    considered to have no vested right to any of its powers or franchises, which are
                    only allowed to exist in furtherance of the design for which the municipality
                    was constituted, that object being the exercise in subordination to the
                    legislature of certain minor powers of government over part of the territory of
                    the State (see Philadelphia <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Fox, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Supreme Court of Pennsylvania Rep.,</hi> vol. xiv.). Each city has the
                    general powers of a corporation and no others, in the absence of special laws.
                    It has executive functions and powers of legislation for civic purposes, which
                    are vested in the mayor and his subordinate officers, but it is not in any other
                    way entrusted with judicial authority (see <hi rend="italic">The Political Code
                        of New York,</hi> titles 4, 5, ss. 947-8).</p>
