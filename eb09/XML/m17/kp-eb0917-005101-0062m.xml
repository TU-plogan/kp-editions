                    miles. The total extent of coast is about 7 5 miles; from Cape Palos westwards
                    to Villaricos Point (where Almeria begins) it is fringed by hills reaching their
                    greatest elevation immediately to the east of Cartagena; northwards from Cape
                    Palos to the Alicante boundary a low and sandy tongue of land encloses the
                    shallow lagoon called Mar Menor. Eastward from the Mar Menor and northward from
                    Cartagena stretches the plain known as El Campo de Cartagena, but the surface of
                    the rest of the province is diversified by ranges of hills of which the general
                    direction, connecting the mountains of Almeria and Granada with those of
                    Alicante, is from south-west to north-east, and which reach their highest point
                    (5150 feet) on the Sierra de Espuna, between the Mula and Sangonera valleys.
                    They belong to the Nevada system, and their geology will be best treated in
                    connexion with that of Spain generally; they are rich in iron, copper, and
                    argentiferous lead, and also yield large quantities of alum, sulphur, and
                    saltpetre; and important mineral springs occur at Mula, Archena (hot sulphur),
                    and Alhama (hot chalybeate).</p>

                <p>The greater part of the province drains into the Mediterranean, chiefly by the
                    Segura, which enters it in the northwest below Hellin in Albacete, and leaves it
                    a little above Orihuela in Alicante; within the province it receives on the left
                    the Arroyo del Jua, and on the right the Caravaca, Quipar, Mula, and Sangonera.
                    The insignificant “arroyos” of Nogalte and Albujon fall directly into the
                    Mediterranean and the Mar Menor respectively. The climate is hot and dry, and
                    agriculture is largely dependent on irrigation, which, where practicable, has
                    been carried on since the time of the Moors with great success. Besides the
                    usual cereals (wheat, barley, maize), hemp, oil, and wine (the latter somewhat
                    rough in quality) are produced; fruit, especially the orange, is abundant along
                    the course of the Segura; mulberries for sericulture are extensively grown
                    around the capital; and the number of bees kept throughout the province is
                    exceptionally large. Esparto grass is gathered on the sandy tracts suited to its
                    growth. The live stock consists chiefly of asses, mules, goats, and pigs, horses
                    and sheep being relatively few. Apart from agriculture, the principal industry
                    is that of mining, which has its centre near Cartagena; next comes the culture
                    of the silkworm, the greater part of the crop being exported for manufacture in
                    France. Large quantities of lead and esparto, as well as of zinc, iron, and
                    copper ores and sulphur, are exported from Cartagena; from Aguilas the chief
                    exports are esparto and agricultural produce; the port of Mazarron has some
                    trade in alum as well. The province is traversed by a railway line which
                    connects Albacete with Cieza, Archena, Murcia, Orihuela, and Cartagena; the
                    capital is also connected with Lorca and Alicante by good high roads. The
                    communications otherwise are somewhat defective. The canal to connect Huescar in
                    Granada with Cartagena remains only a project. The population of the province in
                    1877 was 451,611. Besides the cities of Murcia, Cartagena, and Lorca, the
                    following towns in that year had a population exceeding 5000 :— Abanilla,
                    Aguilas, Alhama, Bullas, Caravaca, Cehegin, Cieza, Fortuna, Fuente-Alamo,
                    Jumilla, Mazarron, Molina, Mora-talla, Mula, Torre-Pacheco, Totana, La Union,
                    Yecla.</p>
                <p>The province of Murcia was the first Spanish possession of the Carthaginians, by
                    whom Nova Carthago was founded. The Romans included it in Hispania
                    Tarraconensis. Under the Arabs the province was known as Todmir, which included,
                    according to Edrisi, the cities Murcia, Orihuela, Cartagena, Lorca, Mula, and
                    Chinchilla. The kingdom of Murcia, which came into independent existence after
                    the fall of the Omayyads, included the present Albacete as well as Murcia. It
                    became subject to the crown of Castile in the 13th century. Until 1833 the
                    modern province also included Albacete.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Murcia,</hi> a city of Spain, capital of the above province,
                    stands on the Segura, nearly in the centre of the beautiful and fertile valley
                    known as the “huerta” or garden of Murcia, which is sheltered on the south by
                    the eastward continuation of the Sierras Alcaraz and Segura, and on the north by
                    the low hills of the Sierras de Molina. The main part of the town stands on the
                    left bank of the river, and is connected with the suburb of San Benito on the
                    right by a very fine stone bridge of two arches. The streets are mostly broad,
                    straight, and well paved; the chief shops are in the narrow Calles de Plateria
                    and Traperia, which are also a favourite resort with loungers, being shaded with
                    awnings of canvas in hot weather. The chief square is the Plaza de la
                    Constitucion, which is planted with orange and other trees; other promenades are
                    the Paseos del Carmen and de Florida Blanca. Of public buildings the most
                    prominent is the cathedral, a late Gothic (1388- 1467) structure with a
                    Corinthian façade in the taste of the 17 th century · the tower is also
                    composite, having been begun in 1521 and completed in 1766. Murcia has been the
                    seat of the bishop of Cartagena since 1261; the present palace was erected in
                    1748-52. Near it are the colleges of San Fulgencio and San Isidoro. Other
                    conspicuous public buildings are the hospital of San Juan de Dios, the silk and
                    saltpetre factories, and the “alhondiga” or grain warehouse. The bull-ring is in
                    San Benito. The manufactures of the town are not important; the chief articles
                    of commerce are the silk grown on the huerta, fruit, and agricultural produce.
                    The population in 1877 was 91,805.</p>
                <p>Murcia has been identified by some with the Roman <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vergilia.</hi> In the time of Edrisi it was the populous and strongly-fortified
                    capital of the country of Todmir. It was taken in 1240 by Don Alfonso
                    (afterwards King Alfonso el Sabio), who by his own request lies buried here. The
                    town was plundered by General Sebastiani, and in 1810 and again in 1812 suffered
                    from the attack of a detachment of Soult’s army. In 1829 an earthquake caused
                    considerable injury, especially to the cathedral.</p>
