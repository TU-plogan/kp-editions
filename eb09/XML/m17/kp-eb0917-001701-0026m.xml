                    -1858), one of the most distinguished physiologists of Germany, was born at
                    Coblentz on 14th July 1801. He became a privat-docent in the university of Bonn
                    in 1824. In 1826 he was appointed extraordinary professor of physiology in the
                    same university, and he became the ordinary professor in 1830. In 1833 he was
                    removed to the university of Berlin, where he filled the chair of anatomy and
                    physiology with great distinction until his death on 28th April 1858. Müller
                    made numerous researches in various departments of physiology, and in particular
                    he extended knowledge as to the mechanism of voice and speech and of hearing,
                    and as to the chemical and physical properties of lymph, chyle, and blood. It
                    was, however, less as an original investigator than as a deep and far-seeing
                    thinker that Müller made his mark on physiological science. From about 1740,
                    when Haller flourished, numerous contributions to physiological science had been
                    made by Whytt, Cullen, John Hunter, Spallanzani, Prochaska, Bichat, Charles
                    Bell, Berzelius, Magendie, and others, but in 1830, when Müller may be said to
                    have begun his labours, it was necessary to reduce these facts to order, to
                    educe general principles, and to direct physiologists into new lines of research
                    indicated by the brilliant discoveries made in physics and in chemistry since
                    the beginning of the century. This Müller did, and he may therefore be regarded
                    as the founder of modern physiology. The appearance of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements of Physiology</hi> between 1837 and 1840 (translated into English by
                    Dr William Baly, and published in London in 1842) was the beginning of a new
                    period. In this work Müller shows remarkable power both in marshalling facts and
                    in philosophical reasoning. As a rule he not merely states and criticizes the
                    labours of others but also contributes the results of his own observations.
                    Whilst he is cautious in the acceptance of theories, he always places them
                    before the reader in an original and suggestive light. The most important
                    portion of the work is that dealing with nervous action and with the mechanism
                    of the senses. Here he states the fruitful principle, not before recognized,
                    that the kind of sensation following irritation of a sensory nerve does not
                    depend on the mode of irritation but upon the nature of the sense-organ. Thus
                    light, pressure, or mechanical irritation acting on the retina and optic nerve
                    invariably produce luminous impressions. This is sometimes termed the law of
                    specific nervous energy. As a teacher Müller exercised a powerful influence, and
                    the great majority of the distinguished physiologists, such as Helmholtz, Du
                    Bois Reymond, Ludwig, Volkmann, and Vierordt, who have made Germany famous in
                    physiological science during the past thirty years, owe much to the germinating
                    ideas of their great teacher.</p>

                <p>Two men of the same name, Johannes Müller, have been celebrated in science: (1)
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Müller</hi> (1699-1784), a
                    professor of artillery and fortification at Woolwich, who wrote a mathematical
                    treatise published in 1737; (2) <hi rend="smallcaps">Johannes Müller</hi> (born
                    1806), a writer on pharmacy and physiological chemistry, who published many
                    memoirs from 1840 to 1850.</p>
