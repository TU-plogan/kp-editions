                    (1814-1877), the well-known historian of the Dutch Republic, was born on 15th
                    April 1814 at Dorchester, now a part of Boston, Massachusetts, and from 1827 was
                    educated at Harvard, where he graduated in 1831. He then studied for two years
                    at Göttingen and Berlin, and after a period of European travel, chiefly in
                    Italy, returned to America in 1834, where he became a student of law, and
                    ultimately was called to the bar. In 1837 he married, and two years afterwards
                    he published anonymously his earliest literary work, a two-volume novel,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Morton’s Hope, or the Memoirs of a Young
                    Provincial,</hi> which attained, and indeed deserved, only a moderate success.
                    In 1841 he received his first diplomatic appointment, being made secretary of
                    legation to the Russian mission, but, finding the atmosphere of St Petersburg
                    uncongenial, he resigned his post within a few months and definitely resolved on
                    a literary career. Besides contributing various historical and critical essays
                    to the <hi rend="italic">North American Review,</hi> he published in 1849, again
                    anonymously, a second novel entitled <hi rend="italic">Merry Mount, a Romance of
                    the Massachusetts Colony.</hi> About the year 1846 the project of writing a
                    history of Holland had begun to take shape in his mind, and he had already
                    prepared a considerable quantity of MS., when, finding the materials at his
                    disposal in the United States quite inadequate for the completion of his work,
                    he resolved to migrate to Europe along with his family in 1851. The next five
                    years were spent at Berlin, Dresden, Brussels, and the Hague in laborious
                    investigation of the archives preserved in those capitals, and resulted in 1856
                    in the publication of <hi rend="italic">The Rise of</hi><pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0012-0003"/><hi rend="italic">the, Dutch Republic, a
                    History</hi> (London and New York, 3 vols. 8vo). This work, which, after a large
                    historical introduction, minutely follows the history of the Low Countries from
                    the abdication of Charles in 1555 down to the assassination of William the
                    Silent in 1584, immediately became highly popular by its graphic manner and the
                    warm and sympathetic spirit in which it was written, while at the same time it
                    was frankly recognized by scholars as a painstaking and conscientious piece of
                    original work. It speedily passed through many English editions, was translated
                    into French (with an introduction by Guizot) in 1859, and also into Dutch (with
                    introduction and notes by Bakhuizen van den Brink, himself a distinguished
                    historian), as well as into German and Russian. Pursuing his researches in
                    England, France, Belgium, and Holland, Motley was able to publish in 1860 the
                    first two volumes of the <hi rend="italic">History of the United
                    Netherlands,</hi> covering the period from the death of William the Silent in
                    1584 to shortly after the destruction of the Armada, by which the Spanish
                    project for subjugating England and reconquering the Netherlands was finally
                    defeated. This work, which was on a somewhat larger scale than the preceding,
                    embodied the results of a still greater amount of original research, not only in
                    the Dutch archives, in the copies of the Simancas archives, and in the portions
                    of those archives still retained in Paris, but also in the London State Paper
                    Office, and in the MS. department of the British Museum. By two new volumes
                    published in 1868 the work was brought down to the twelve years’ truce in 1609,
                    and it was announced that the author was engaged in writing a continuation which
                    should embrace the history of the Thirty Years’ War. Meanwhile Motley from the
                    close of 1861 to 1867 had held the post of United States minister at Vienna; in
                    1869 he was appointed to a similar position at the court of St James’s, but was
                    recalled in 1870. After a short visit to Holland he again took up his residence
                    in England, where <hi rend="italic">The Life and Death of John Barneveld,
                    Advocate of Holland, with a view of the primary Causes of the Thirty Years'
                    War</hi> (2 vols.) appeared in 1874. Ill health now began to interfere with
                    sustained literary work, and, after a protracted period of failing vigour, he
                    died at Kingston Russell House, near Dorchester, Dorsetshire, on 29th May
                    1877.</p>
                <p>Motley was member of a number of learned societies in Europe and America, and
                    held a variety of honorary degrees. Among minor works not noticed above may be
                    mentioned a pamphlet on the <hi rend="italic">Causes of the Civil War in
                    America</hi> (1861), which originally appeared in the correspondence columns of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, and <hi rend="italic">Democracy, a
                    Historical Essay</hi> (1869), originally delivered as an address to the New York
                    Historical Society. The merits of Motley as an historian are undeniably great;
                    he has told the story of a stirring period in the history of the world with full
                    attention to the character of the actors and strict fidelity to the numerous
                    vivid details of the action. But it may safely be said that his tale is best
                    where most unvarnished, and probably no writer of the same rank has owed less to
                    the mere sparkle of highly polished literary style.</p>
