                    the view which prevailed among the Greek writers and has become â commonplace of
                    modern literature, were nine goddesses who presided over the nine principal
                    departments of letters: Calliope, Muse of epic poetry; Euterpe, of lyric poetry;
                    Erato, of erotic poetry; Melpomene, of tragedy; Thalia, of comedy; Polyhymnia,
                    of the hymn as used in the worship of the gods; Terpsichore, of choral song and
                    the dance which formed its necessary accompaniment; Clio, of history; and
                    Urania, of astronomy. They are represented in ancient art as fully draped
                    figures characterized by attitude, dress, and symbols appropriate to the
                    departments over which they presided. In the simpler conception that prevails in
                    earlier literature they were said to be daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> memory personified. In chorus round the altar of Zeus
                    they sing the origin of the world, of gods, and of men, the might and the
                    glorious deeds of Zeus. At the banquets of the gods their joyous music is heard.
                    They honour also the great heroes; they sing at the marriage of Cadmus and of
                    Peleus; their mourning song at the death of Achilles drew tears from both gods
                    and men. They know all things past and future and impart to their chosen poets
                    the knowledge and the skill to write. They are usually maiden goddesses, but
                    some of the mythic poets—Orpheus, Linus, Ialemus—are said to be sons of a
                    Muse.</p>
                <p>This conception of the number and character of the Muses is as old as Hesiod and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> (xxiv. 60), yet it is far removed from the
                    genuine religious stratum out of which the poets fashioned it. The religion of
                    the Muses had two chief seats, on the northern slope of Mount Olympus around
                    Dion in Pieria, by the holy springs Leibethron and Pimpleia, and on the slope of
                    Mount Helicon near Ascra and Thespiae. Nothing is known of the cultus in its
                    older form, but it appears to have been connected with the religion of Dionysus.
                    The Muses must have been originally a variety of the Nymphs (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nymphs),</hi> the spirits of nature who live in the fountains
                    and forests; hence they are associated with Pegasus, the winged horse of the
                    thunder-cloud. The half-mythic race called Thracian, which is specially
                    associated with the two localities where the worship of the Muses had its seat,
                    survived in Greek memory as a race of bards; and this character of the race
                    coloured its conception of the spirit-life which it saw in nature. The spirits
                    who know or who remember (Moυσα = Movτιa, from man, to think) sang to them in
                    the voice of the water and the trees. At first they gave no definite number or
                    form to their conception of these spirits; the number nine is the invention of a
                    later time and of a different order of thought, and some accounts speak of three
                    Muses or of a single Muse.</p>
