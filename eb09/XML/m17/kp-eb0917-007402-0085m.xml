                    almost invariably grows in rich, open, breezy pastures, in places where the
                    grass is kept short by the grazing of horses, herds, and flocks. Although this
                    plant is popularly termed the “meadow mushroom,” it never as a rule grows in
                    meadows. It never grows in wet boggy places, never in woods, or on or about
                    stumps of trees. An exceptional specimen or an uncommon variety may sometimes be
                    seen in the above-mentioned abnormal places, but the best, the true, and common
                    variety of our tables is the produce of short, upland, wind-swept pastures. A
                    true mushroom is never large in size; its cap very seldom exceeds 4, at most 5
                    inches in diameter. The large examples measuring from 6 to 9 or more inches
                    across the cap belong to <hi rend="italic">Agaricus arvensis</hi> (Sch.), called
                    from its large size and coarse texture the Horse Mushroom, which grows in
                    meadows and damp shady places, and though generally wholesome is coarse and
                    sometimes indigestible. The mushroom usually grown in gardens or hot-beds, in
                    cellars, sheds, &lt;fcc., is a distinct variety, known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agaricus</hi><hi rend="italic">hortensis</hi> (Cke.). This is a compact and
                    inferior form of the true mushroom, or it may indeed be a hybrid or even a
                    distinct species.</p>
                <p>The parts of a mushroom consist chiefly of stem and cap; the stem is furnished
                    with a clothy ring round its middle, and the cap is furnished underneath with
                    numerous radiating coloured gills. In the accompanying illustration (1)
                    represents a section through an infant mushroom, (2) a mature example, and (3) a
                    longitudinal section through a fully-developed mushroom. The cap <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">d, e</hi> is fleshy, firm, and white within, never thin and
                    watery; externally it is pale brown, dry, often slightly silky or floccose,
                    never viscid. The cuticle of a mushroom readily peels away from the flesh
                    beneath, as shown at <hi rend="smallcaps">f.</hi> The cap has a narrow dependent
                    margin or frill, as shown at <hi rend="smallcaps">g,</hi> and in section at <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">h</hi>; this dependent frill originates in the rupture of a
                    delicate continuous wrapper, which in the infancy of the mushroom entirely wraps
                    the young plant; it is shown in its continuous state at j, and at the moment of
                    rupture at κ. The gills underneath the cap <hi rend="smallcaps">l, μ, n</hi> are
                    at first <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n86/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0086-0075"/> white, then rose-coloured, at length brown-black.
                    A point of great importance is to be noted in the attachment of the gills near
                    the stem at o, p; the gills in the true mushroom are (as shown) usually more or
                    less free from the stem, they never grow boldly against it or run down it; they
                    may sometimes just touch the spot where the stem joins the bottom of the cap,
                    but never more; there is usually a slight channel, as at <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >p,</hi> all round the top of the stem. When a mushroom is perfectly ripe and
                    the gills are brownblack in colour, they throw down a thick dusty deposit of
                    fine brown-black or purple-black spores; it is essential to note the colour. The
                    spores on germination make a white felted mat, more or less dense, of mycelium;
                    this, when compacted with dry, half-decomposed dung, is the mushroom spawn of
                    gardeners (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Horticulture,</hi> vol. xii. p. 284). The
                    stem is firm, slightly pithy up the middle, but never hollow; it is furnished
                    with a floccose ring near its middle, as illustrated at <hi rend="smallcaps">q,
                    q</hi>; this ring originates by the rupture of the thin general wrapper κ of the
                    infant plant. On being cut or broken the flesh of a true mushroom remains white
                    or nearly so, the flesh of the coarser Horse Mushroom changes to buff or
                    sometimes to dark brown. To summarize the characters of a true mushroom :—it
                    grows only in pastures; it is of small size, dry, and with unchangeable flesh;
                    the cap has a frill; the gills are free from the stem, the spores brown-black or
                    deep purple-black in colour, and the stem solid or slightly pithy. When all
                    these characters are taken together no other mushroom-like fungus—and nearly a
                    thousand species grow in Britain— can be confounded with it.</p>
                <p>Like all widely-spread and much-cultivated plants, the edible mushroom has
                    numerous varieties, and it differs in different places and under different modes
                    of culture in much the same way as our kitchen-garden plants differ from the
                    type they have been derived from, and from each other. In some instances these
                    differences are so marked that they have led some botanists to regard as
                    distinct species many forms usually esteemed by others as varieties only.</p>
                <p>A small variety of the common mushroom found in pastures has been named <hi
                    rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic">pratensis</hi> (Vitt.); it differs from
                    the type in having a pale reddish-brown scaly top, and the flesh on being cut or
                    broken changes to pale rose-colour. A variety still more marked, with a darker
                    brown cap and the flesh changing to a deeper rose, and sometimes blood-red, has
                    been described as <hi rend="italic">A. rufescens</hi> (Berk.). The well-known
                    compact variety of mushroom-growers, with its white cap and dull purplish
                    clay-coloured gills is <hi rend="italic">A. hortensis</hi> (Cke. ). Two
                    sub-varieties of this have been described under the names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >A. Bucħanani</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A. elongatus,</hi> and other distinct
                    forms are known to botanists. A variety also grows in woods named <hi
                    rend="italic">A. silvicola</hi> (Vitt.); this can only be distinguished from the
                    Pasture Mushroom by its elongated bulbous stem and its externally smooth cap.
                    There is also a fungus well known to botanists and cultivators which appears to
                    be intermediate between the pasture variety and the wood variety, named <hi
                    rend="italic">A. vaporarius</hi> (Otto). The large rank Horse Mushroom, now
                    generally referred to as <hi rend="italic">A. arvensis</hi> (Sch. ), is probably
                    a variety of the Pasture Mushroom; Sowerby has described it under the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">A. Georgii</hi> and Dr Badham as <hi rend="italic">A.
                    exquisitus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it has also been published as <hi
                    rend="italic">A. edulis.</hi> It grows in rings in woody places and under trees
                    and hedges in meadows; it has a large scaly round cap, and the flesh quickly
                    changes to buff or brown when cut or broken; the stem too is hollow. An
                    unusually scaly form of this has been described as <hi rend="italic">A.
                    villaticus</hi> and another as <hi rend="italic">A. azιgustus.</hi> Dr Badham
                    has also described a variety under the name of <hi rend="italic">A.
                    anceps.</hi></p>
                <p>A species, described by Berkeley and Broome as distinct from both the Pasture
                    Mushroom and Horse Mushroom, has been published under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">A. elvensis.</hi> This grows under oaks, in clusters,—a most
                    unusual character for the mushroom. The species is said to be excellent for the
                    table. An allied fungus peculiar to woods, with a less fleshy cap than the true
                    mushroom, with hollow stem, and strong odour, has been described as a close ally
                    of the Pasture Mushroom under the name of <hi rend="italic">A. silvaticus</hi>
                    (Sch.); its qualities for the table have not been described.</p>
                <p>Many instances are on record of symptoms of poisoning, and even death, having
                    followed the consumption of plants which have passed as true mushrooms; these
                    cases have probably arisen from the examples consumed being in a state of decay,
                    or from some mistake as to the species eaten. It should always be specially
                    noted whether the fungi to be consumed are in a fresh and wholesome condition,
                    otherwise they act as a poison in precisely the same way as does any other
                    semi-putrid vegetable or putrid meat. Many instances are on record where
                    mushroom-beds have been invaded by a growth of strange fungi and the true
                    mushrooms have been ousted to the advantage of the new-comers; such instances
                    are very perplexing, but they tend to show that a proper supervision should be
                    kept over fungi when used for food as over other vegetables, fruit, meat, and
                    fish. When mushrooms are gathered for sale by persons unacquainted with the
                    different species mistakes are of frequent occurrence. A very common spurious
                    mushroom in markets is <hi rend="italic">A. velutinus</hi> (P.), a slender,
                    ringless, hollow-stemmed, black-gilled fungus, common in gardens and about dung
                    and stumps; it is about the size of a mushroom, but thinner in all its parts and
                    far more brittle; it has a black hairy fringe hanging round the edge of the cap
                    when fresh. Another spurious mushroom, and equally common in dealers’ baskets,
                    is <hi rend="italic">A. lacrymabundus</hi> (Fr.); this grows in the same
                    positions as the last, and is somewhat fleshier and more like a true mushroom;
                    it has a hollow stem and a slight ring, the gills are black-brown mottled and
                    generally studded with tearlike drops of moisture. In both these species the
                    gills distinctly touch and grow on to the stem. Besides these there are numerous
                    other black-gilled species which find a place in baskets,—some species far too
                    small to bear any resemblance to a mushroom, others large and deliquescent,
                    generally belonging to the stump-and dung-borne genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coprinus.</hi> The true mushroom itself is to a great extent a dung-borne
                    species, therefore mushroom-beds are always liable to an invasion from other
                    dung-borne forms. The spores of all fungi are constantly floating about in the
                    air, and when the spores of dung-infesting species alight on a mushroom-bed they
                    find a nidus already prepared that exactly suits them; and if the spawn of the
                    new-comer becomes more profuse than that of the mushroom the stranger takes up
                    his position at the expense of the mushroom. There is also a fungus named <hi
                    rend="italic">Xylaria vaporaria</hi> (B. ), which sometimes fixes itself on
                    mushroom-beds and produces such an enormous quantity of string-like spawn that
                    the entire destruction of the bed results. The spawn is sometimes so profuse
                    that it is pulled out of the beds in enormous masses and carted away in
                    barrows.</p>
                <p>Sometimes cases of poisoning follow the consumption ∙of what have really appeared
                    to gardeners to be true bed-mushrooms, and to country folks as small Horse
                    Mushrooms. The case is made more complicated by the fact that these
                    highly-poisonous forms now and then appear upon mushroom-beds to the exclusion
                    of the mushrooms. This dangerous counterfeit is <hi rend="italic"
                    >A.fastibilis</hi> (Fr.), or sometimes <hi rend="italic">A.
                    crustuliniformis</hi> (Bull.), a close ally if not indeed a mere variety of the
                    first. A description of one will do for both, <hi rend="italic">A.
                    fastibilis</hi> being a little the more slender of the two. Both have fleshy
                    caps, whitish, moist, and clammy to the touch; instead of a pleasant odour, they
                    have a disagreeable one; the stems are ringless, or nearly so; and the gills,
                    which are palish clay-brown, distinctly touch and grow on to the solid or pithy
                    stem. These two fungi usually grow in woods, but sometimes in hedges and in
                    shady places in meadows, or even, as has been said, as invaders on
                    mushroom-beds. The pale clay - coloured gills, offensive odour, and clammy or
                    even viscid top are decisive characters. A reference to the accompanying
                    illustration (fig. 2), which is about one-half natural size, will give a good
                    idea of <hi rend="italic">A. fastibilis</hi>; the difference in the nature of
                    the attachment of the gills near the stem is seen at R, the absence of a true
                    ring at s, and of a pendent frill at τ. The colour, with the exception of the
                    gills, is not unlike that of the mushroom. In determining fungi no single
                    character must be relied upon as conclusive, but all the characters must be
                    taken together. Sometimes a beautiful, somewhat slender, fungus peculiar to
                    stumps in woods is mistaken for the mushroom in <hi rend="italic">A.
                    cervinus</hi> (Sch.); it has a tall, solid, white, ringless stem and somewhat
                    thin brown cap, furnished <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n87/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0087-0076"/> underneath with beautiful rose-coloured gills,
                    which are free from the stem as in the mushroom, and which never turn black. It
                    is probably a poisonous plant, belonging, as it does, to a dangerous cohort.
                    Many other species of <hi rend="italic">Agaricus</hi> more or less·resemble <hi
                    rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic">campestris,</hi> notably some of the
                    plants found under the sub-genera <hi rend="italic">Lepiota, Vblυaria,
                    Pholiota,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Psalliota,</hi> but when the characters are
                    noted they may all with a little care be easily distinguished from each other.
                    The better plan is to discard at once all fungi which have not been gathered
                    from open pastures; by this act alone more than nine-tenths of worthless and
                    poisonous species will be excluded.</p>
                <p>In cases of poisoning by mushrooms immediate medical advice should be secured.
                    The dangerous principle is a narcotic, and the symptoms are usually great
                    nausea, drowsiness, stupor, and pains in the joints. A good palliative is sweet
                    oil; this will allay any corrosive irritation of the throat and stomach, and at
                    the same time cause vomiting.</p>
                <p>The mode of cultivating mushrooms artificially out of doors and in sheds is
                    described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Horticulture,</hi> vol. xii. p. 284. Paris
                    mushrooms are cultivated in enormous quantities in dark underground caves at a
                    depth of from 60 to 160 feet from the surface. The stable manure is taken into
                    the tortuous passages of these caves, and the spawn introduced from masses of
                    dry dung where it occurs naturally. In France mushroom - growers do not use the
                    compact blocks or bricks of spawn so familiar in England, but much smaller
                    flakes or “leaves” of dry dung in which the spawn or mycelium can be seen to
                    exist. Less manure is used in these caves than we generally see in the
                    mushroom-houses of England, and the surface of each bed is covered with about an
                    inch of fine white stony soil. The beds are kept artificially moist by the
                    application of water brought from the surface, and the different galleries bear
                    crops in succession. As one is exhausted another is in full bearing, so that by
                    a systematic arrangement a single proprietor will send to the surface from 300
                    lb to 3000 lb of mushrooms per day. The passages sometimes extend over several
                    miles, the beds sometimes occupying over 20 miles, and, as there are many
                    proprietors of caves, the produce of mushrooms is so large that not only is
                    Paris fully supplied, but vast quantities are forwarded to the different large
                    towns of Europe; the mushrooms are not allowed to reach the fully-expanded
                    condition, but are gathered in a large button state, the whole growth of the
                    mushroom being removed and the hole left in the manure covered with fine earth.
                    The beds remain in bearing for six or eight months, and then the spent manure is
                    taken to the surface again for garden and field purposes. The equable
                    temperature of these caves and their freedom from draught is one cause of their
                    great success; to this must be added the natural virgin spawn, for by
                    continually using spawn taken from mushroom-producing beds the potency for
                    reproduction is weakened. The beds produce mushrooms in about six weeks after
                    this spawning.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Fairy-ring Champignon.—This</hi> fungus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Marasmvus</hi><hi rend="italic">Oreades</hi> (Fr.), is more universally used in
                    France and Italy than in England, although it is well known and frequently used
                    both in a fresh and in a dry state in England. It is totally different in
                    appearance from the Pasture Mushroom, and, like it, its characters are so
                    distinct that there is hardly a possibility of making a mistake when its
                    peculiarities are once comprehended. It has more than one advantage over the
                    Meadow Mushroom in its extreme commonness, its profuse growth, the length of the
                    season in which it may be gathered, the total absence of varietal forms, its
                    adaptability for being dried and preserved for years, and its persistent
                    delicious taste. It is by many esteemed as the best of all the edible fungi
                    found in Great Britain. Like the mushroom, it grows in short open pastures and
                    amongst the short grass of open roadsides; sometimes it appears on lawns, but it
                    never occurs in woods or in damp shady places. Its natural habit is to grow in
                    rings, and the grassy fairy-rings so frequent amongst the short grass of downs
                    and pastures in the spring are generally caused by the nitrogenous manure
                    applied to the soil in the previous autumn by the decay of a circle of these
                    fungi. Many other fungi in addition to the Fairy-ring Champignon grow in
                    circles, so that this habit must merely be taken with its other characters in
                    cases of doubt.</p>
                <p>A glance at the illustration (fig. 3) will show how entirely the Fairyring
                    Champignon differs from the mushroom. In the first place, it is about one-half
                    the size of a mushroom, and whitish-buff in every part, the gills always
                    retaining this colour and never becoming salmon-coloured, brown, or black. The
                    stem is solid and corky, much more solid than the flesh of the cap, and
                    perfectly smooth, never being furnished with the slightest trace of a ring. The
                    buffgills are far apart (v), and in this they greatly differ from the somewhat
                    crowded gills of the mushroom; the junction of the gills with the stem (w) also
                    differs in character from the similar junction in the mushroom. The mushroom is
                    a semi-deliquescent fungus which rapidly falls into putridity in decay, whilst
                    the champignon dries up into a leathery substance in the sun, but speedily
                    revives and takes its original form again after the first shower. To this
                    character the fungus owes its generic name <hi rend="italic">(Marasmius)</hi> as
                    well as one of its most valuable qualities for the table, for examples may be
                    gathered from June to November, and if carefully dried may be hung on strings
                    for culinary purposes and preserved without deterioration for several years;
                    indeed, many persons assert that the rich flavour of these fungi increases with
                    years. Champignons are highly esteemed (and especially is this the case abroad)
                    for adding a most delicious flavour to stews, soups, and gravies.</p>
                <p>A fungus which may carelessly be mistaken for the mushroom is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">peronatus</hi> (Fr. ), but this grows in woods amongst
                    dead leaves, and has a hairy base to the stem and a somewhat acrid taste.
                    Another is <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">urens</hi> (Fr. ); this
                    also generally grows in woods, but the gills are not nearly so deep, they soon
                    become brownish, the stem is downy, and the taste is acrid. An <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agaricus</hi> named <hi rend="italic">A. dryophilus</hi> (Bull. ) has sometimes
                    been gathered in mistake for the champignon, but this too grows in woods where
                    the champignon never grows; it has a hollow instead of a solid stem, gills
                    crowded together instead of far apart, and flesh very tender and brittle instead
                    of tough. A small esculent ally of the champignon, named <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    scovodonius</hi> (Fr.), is sometimes found in pastures in Great Britain; this is
                    largely consumed on the Continent, where it is esteemed for its powerful flavour
                    of garlic. In England, where garlic is not used to a large extent, this fungus
                    is not sought for. Another small and common species, <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    porreus</hi> (Fr.), is pervaded with a garlic flavour to an equal extent with
                    the last. A third species, <hi rend="italic">Μ. alliaceus</hi> (Fr. ), is also
                    strongly impregnated with the scent and taste of onions or garlic. Two species,
                    <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">impudicus</hi> (Fr.) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">foetidus</hi> (Fr.), are in all stages of
                    growth highly foetid. The curious little edible <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agaricus</hi><hi rend="italic">esculentus</hi> (Jacq.), although placed under
                    the sub-genus <hi rend="italic">Collybia,</hi> is allied by its structure to <hi
                    rend="italic">Marasmius.</hi> It is a small bitter species common in upland
                    pastures and fir plantations early in the season. Although not gathered for the
                    table in England, it is greatly prized in some parts of the Continent. Fries,
                    the greatest authority on the higher Fungi, writes: “In Austria in cibariis
                    magni aestumatur.” The odour and taste in fungi when raw are often valuable
                    characters in deciding species.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Morel.—</hi> This delicious edible fungus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Morchella</hi><hi rend="italic">esculenta</hi> (Pers.), is more common in
                    Britain than is generally supposed. It grows after warm rains in the spring or
                    early summer in woody places and in orchards and gardens, often in places where
                    the ground has been burnt. Like the champignon, the morel can be easily dried
                    and kept suspended on strings in necklace fashion for winter use. It is
                    generally 3 or 4 inches high, with a hollow stem and a hollow, irregularly
                    globose, honeycombed head, pale buff in colour all over, and furnished with an
                    agreeable odour. There is more than one esculent species of morel: <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">semilibera</hi> (D. C. ) is the next best
                    known, but this is rare in Britain. A large species named <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    crassipes</hi> (Pers.)—the <hi rend="italic">Μ. smithiana</hi> of Cooke—attains
                    a height of from 9 to 12 inches. This is a fragrant and delicious species, but
                    only suitable for use in a fresh state; it cannot be readily dried. Another
                    valuable edible species is <hi rend="italic">Gyromitra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >esculenta</hi> (Fr.), recognized by its brownish-black globose head; it grows
                    amongst firs and is considered rare. (W. G. SM. ) <pb break="no"
