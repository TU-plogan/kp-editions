                    treated of in text-books as one of the classes of the group Arthropoda, being
                    associated in that group with the Crustacea, Arachnida, and Insecta as
                    equivalent divisions of the animal kingdom. In consequence, however, of recent

                    (with the exception of certain minor groups of obscure affinities) into two
                    classes, one consisting of the Crustacea, the other of the Tracheata. If this

                <p>Linnaeus included the Myriapoda in his Insecta Aptera, together with the
                    Crustacea and Arachnida. In 1779 Fabricius first separated the Myriapoda as a
                    distinct order under the name Mitosata, but still retained several separate
                    orders of Crustacea as equivalent. In 1796 Latreille divided the Aptera of
                    Linnaeus into seven orders, one of which was constituted by the Myriapoda (so
                    first named by him), but he included with them the Isopoda. In 1800 Cuvier and
                    Lamarck first separated Linnaeus’s Insecta into three primary natural classes,
                    creating the Crustacea and retaining as the two others the Arachnida and
                    Insecta. In 1825 Latreille, finally following Leach (1815), set up the Myriapoda
                    as a fourth class, separating them from the Insecta connected with them.
                    Subsequently the class Myriapoda was a constant source of controversy amongst
                    naturalists, and many attempts were made to overthrow it altogether. Thus the
                    Myriapoda were connected by Macleay with the Insecta, and also by Kirby in 1826,
                    further by Burmeister in 1837, and by Von Siebold with Crustacea in 1848.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Protracheata</hi> may be defined as—</p>
                <p>Tracheata with imperfectly-jointed appendages, and numerous stigmata indefinite
                    in number, scattered in various regions of the body; the first pair of post-oral
                    appendages only modified to act as jaws; the second pair rudimentary, bearing
                    the opening of the duct of a slimegland; remaining pairs numerous, all alike;
                    ambulatory legs, each provided with a pair of claws; no definite
                    infra-oesophageal nerve-ganglion; ventral nerve-cords imperfectly ganglionated,
                    widely divaricated, united posteriorly dorsad of the rectum; complicated
                    segmental organs present, opening at the bases of the legs; arch-enteron in the
                    embryo formed by invagination; a wide slit-like blastopore formed in the embryo,
                    which gives rise to the mouth anteriorly and anus posteriorly.</p>
                <p>The sole representatives of this group of the Tracheata are the seven or eight
                    known species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Peripatus</hi> (fig. 1 ). These are
                    soft-bodied animals very like lepidopterous caterpillars in form, of a brown or
                    blackish colour, with a series of pairs of short conical legs placed laterally
                    at equal intervals along the entire length of the ventral surface behind the
                    mouth. The legs in advanced embryos show a distinct division into five joints by
                    transverse constrictions, but in the adults this jointing is much obscured. The
                    skin not being protected by chitinous plates, but only by fine papillae armed
                    with chitine, no definite hinge-joints are formed comparable to those so usually
                    present in other Tracheata. The terminal joint of each leg or foot is provided
                    with a pair of curved claws. The number of legs present varies in the different
                    species. The head bears a pair of simple eyes and a pair of antennae composed of
                    very numerous joints. The first pair of legs, which in the embryo closely
                    resembles those developed behind it (fig. 2), becomes in the process of
                    development turned in in front of the mouth, and its claws become modified into
                    a pair of sickleshaped toothed jaws which work against one another in front of
                    the mouth, and are completely enclosed in the adult in a wide buccal cavity.
                    This cavity opens to the exterior ventrally on the under side of the head by the
                    buccal aperture, which is oval in form and is surrounded by tumid lips, and has
                    often been described as the mouth, although the true mouth lies within the
                    buccal cavity underneath the jaws (figs.</p>
                <p>3, 4).</p>
                <p>The second pair of appendages of the embryo becomes converted in the adult into a
                    pair of short papillae,—the oral papillae, which bear at their tips the openings
                    of a pair of large glands secreting a viscid substance. Respiration is effected
                    in <hi rend="italic">Peripatus</hi> by means of an immense number of small
                    tracheal tufts. Each of these tufts consists of a short tubular chamber or sac,
                    opening at one end, which is narrowed, to the exterior by a minute simple
                    aperture <hi rend="italic">{stigma)</hi> in the cuticle, and provided at its
                    opposite enlarged extremity with a tuft of very fine air-tubes. In these fine
                    tracheal tubes only a very faint indication of an imperfect spiral thickening of
                    the chitinous lining membrane can be detected. The tubes are, with very rare
                    exceptions, unbranched; they are freely distributed to the various muscles,
                    viscera, &amp;c. These tracheal tufts closely resemble in structure those of the
                    Diplopod Myriapoda, but their disposition differs from that occurring in all
                    other Tracheata. Instead of a definite small number of stigmata only being
                    present, placed in definite positions on the successive somites, an indefinite
                    number is present in <hi rend="italic">Peripatus.</hi> Certain of these are
                    scattered irregularly over the whole body-surface, whilst others are
                    concentrated more or less thickly in a double row on each side of the dorsal
                    median line, in a corresponding double ventral row, and further on the anterior
                    and posterior aspects of the legs and round the bases of the legs. A series of
                    segmental organs is present, a pair for each pair of legs. They are coiled tubes
                    opening at one end into the body cavity and at the other to the exterior at the
                    bases of the legs on their inner or ventral aspects.</p>
                <p>The nervous system consists of a pair of supra-cesophageal ganglia fused together
                    in the middle line, from which arise the ventral cords, which remain widely
                    divaricated throughout the length of the body to its hinder extremity, where
                    they unite above the dorsal surface of the rectum. The ventral cords appear at
                    first without ganglionic enlargements, but in reality rudimentary ganglionic
                    swellings are present on them corresponding with the origins of the nerves for
                    the jaws, oral papillae, and all the legs. They <pb break="no"

                    forming a so-called rope-ladder nerve-system. Visceral nerves are present, with
                    an arrangement similar to that in Chaetopods rather than that found in
                    Arthropoda. A dorsal and a ventral blood-vessel are present. The· dorsal vessel
                    is, according to Gaffron, a true muscular heart provided with a pair of
                    dorsally-placed valvular openings on each segment of the body, but without any
                    trace of vessels in connexion with these. It lies as in other Tracheata in a
                    pericardial sinus formed by a horizontally-stretched septum, and especially
                    approaches in its general structure the corresponding organ of Diplopoda.</p>
                <p>The ovary in the female is closely similar to that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lithobius</hi> in structure. The animal is viviparous, and the pair of long
                    oviducts function as uterus. In the male the spermatozoa are long and filiform,
                    exactly like those of <hi rend="italic">Lithobius.</hi> They are actively
                    mobile, and perform exactly the same movements as those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lithobius,</hi> and, as in that genus, are formed into rod-like
                    spermatophores.</p>
                <p>In its embryological development, which cannot here be followed, conclusions as
                    to the affinities of <hi rend="italic">Peripatus</hi> with the Tracheates
                    receive strong confirmation. Early embryos of <hi rend="italic">Peripatus</hi>
                    bear a remarkable resemblance to those of scorpions, spiders, and Myriapods, and
                    the mode of formation of the procephalic lobes, nervesystem, and limbs is
                    closely similar. The five-jointing of the limbs of the embryo of <hi
                    rend="italic">Peripatus</hi> is remarkably similar to that occurring in embryo
                    spiders, such as <hi rend="italic">Agelena.</hi> In one important respect the
                    embryonic history of <hi rend="italic">Peripatus</hi> differs most remarkably
                    from that of all other Tracheata, as far as is known. A large, open, slit-like
                    blastopore is, as discovered by Balfour, formed in the very early embryo of <hi
                    rend="italic">P. capensis.</hi> This slit closes in its centre, and ite anterior
                    extremity apparently remains permanently open as the mouth, whilst its posterior
                    region persists as the anus. In the embryos of other Tracheates the only
                    representative of this no doubt ancestral mode of development surviving is the
                    so-called mesoblastic groove.</p>
                <p>The species of <hi rend="italic">Peripatus</hi> live in moist places, in hollows
                    in decayed wood, and under stones and logs. The animals walk with a gait similar
                    to that of caterpillars, with their bodies completely supported from the ground
                    by their legs. When irritated they eject from their oral papillae fine jets of
                    the viscid slime secreted by their slime-glands. These fine jets form networks
                    of fine threads, looking like a spider’s web, which cling to the fingers with
                    the tenacity of bird-lime. The New Zealand species is said to catch insects for
                    food by means of these slime-jets. The animals roll themselves up like <hi
                    rend="italic">J ulus</hi> when quiescent. They appear to be nocturnal in
                    habits.</p>
                <p>The group <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Eutracheata</hi> may be thus defined—</p>
                <p>Tracheata of various form, usually with completely]ointed appendages; never
                    bearing diffuse stigmata indefinite in number, but with not more than two pairs
                    on each somite; ventral nerve-cords closely approximated, with well-marked
                    infra-oesophageal ganglion, never united posteriorly dorsad of the anus; no
                    segmental organs present; no blastopore formed in the embryo; mouth and anus
                    formed as a stomodaeum and a proctodaeum respectively.</p>
                <p>The sub-class <hi rend="smallcaps">Myriapoda</hi> may be defined as follows—</p>
                <p>Eutracheata with a head distinctly separate from the numerous closely similar
                    posterior somites, with a pair of antennae and two pairs of jaws; with numerous
                    similar jointed walking legs; Malpighian tubes present.</p>
                <p>The Myriapoda, like <hi rend="italic">Peripatus,</hi> approach the Annelids in
                    having elongate bodies, either cylindrical or more or less flattened, composed
                    of numerous similar joints or somites. They bear numerous pairs of walking legs
                    on the somites posterior to the head, and in this particular differ most
                    markedly from all insects except some of the most primitive forms, such as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Campodeidae,</hi> which approach them by the possession of
                    rudimentary abdominal legs, and with which, as will be described, they are
                    possibly connected to some extent by such a form as <hi rend="italic"
                    >S&gt;colopendrella.</hi> Some forms <hi rend="italic">(Glomeridae)</hi> most
                    remarkably resemble woodlice in shape, and hence Latreille’s connexion, already
                    referred to, of the Myriapoda with the Isopodous Crustacea. The head of
                    Myriapoda is very like that of Insecta, and bears a single pair of antennae, the
                    eyes when present, and two pairs of jaws. The first pair of jaws, the stout
                    toothed mandibles, are, as in insects, always devoid of palps, but in nearly all
                    cases they are jointed, a primitive condition not occurring in insects. The
                    second pair, the maxillae, are fused together to form a sort of under-lip. In
                    one aberrant family <hi rend="italic">(Poly-</hi><hi rend="italic">zonidae)</hi>
                    the mouth parts are formed into a tubular pricking and sucking apparatus. The
                    body behind the head is composed of distinctly separated similar segments,
                    usually numerous (in <hi rend="italic">Pauropus</hi> nine only). There is no
                    division of the body into thoracic and abdominal regions. The ventral nerve-cord
                    stretches the entire length of the body, and is provided with a ganglion more or
                    less distinct for each somite. The first three of its ganglia are fused
                    together. Eyes are wanting in some forms, in others they are present on the
                    sides of the head as simple ocelli or groups of ocelli. In one form only <hi
                    rend="italic">(Scutigerd)</hi> are they compound and faceted. The structure of
                    the ocelli differs remarkably from that of the simple eyes of spiders, in that
                    the crystalline rods in each ocellus are so placed that their axes lie parallel
                    to the plane of the equator of the simple lens, at right angles to the optic
                    axis of the eye instead of in its direction. They are also not isolated by
                    pigment. Grenacher hence concludes that it is impossible that any definite image
                    can be formed on the rods, so as to convey any impression of it to the retinal
                    cells with which they are in connexion. Hence these eyes must discriminate only
                    variations in intensity of light. In <hi rend="italic">Scutigera</hi> the
                    internal structure of the eyes, though closely simulating that of the compound
                    eyes of insects in many details, is in reality very peculiar and different from
                    that in all other Arthropods. The digestive canal is simple and straight, except
                    in <hi rend="italic">Glomeridae,</hi> and ends in a terminal anus. At the
                    commencement of that portion which acts as a rectum, and which in the embryo is
                    formed from the proctodaeum, two or four long coiled urinary tubes <hi
                    rend="italic">(^Malpighian tubes'),</hi> homologous with those of insects, open
                    into it. There is a dorsal tubular heart, divided into a series of chambers
                    corresponding with the somites, and, as in insects, contained within a blood
                    sinus (pericardium), formed by a horizontal septum stretched across the
                    body-cavity, and provided "with a series of pairs of wing-like muscles <hi
                    rend="italic">(alae</hi><hi rend="italic">cordis),</hi> by which the sinuscavity
                    is dilated. Respiration is effected by means of airtubes or tracheae as in
                    insects. In the Diplopoda, excepting the <hi rend="italic">Glomeridae,</hi> in
                    which they are ramified as in the Chilopoda, these are of essentially the same
                    structure as in <hi rend="italic">Peripatus,</hi> viz., tufts of unbranched
                    tubes with feebly-developed spiral filaments springing from a common short
                    sac-like chamber (fig. 5). Four of these sac-like chambers open on the ventral
                    surface of the body by means of two pairs of stigmata on each somite. In the
                    Chilopods wide tracheal tubes with well-developed spiral thickening of their
                    lining membrane, springing directly from the stigmata, freely branching, and
                    often anastomosing like those in insects, are always present. In all cases
                    single pairs of laterally-placed<pb break="no"

                    aberrant <hi rend="italic">Scolopendrella</hi> possibly a single pair of
                    stigmata only are present on the sides of the head, and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scutigera</hi> there are only seven unpaired stigmata present in the middle
                    dorsal line. In this latter form the tracheae proceeding from the stigmata are
                    very short; they branch a few times dichotomously, and then terminate in blind
                    enlargements. From these the air is conveyed throughout the body in connexion
                    with the fat bodies and peculiar folds of membrane as far as into the tarsi, the
                    arrangement thus approaching somewhat that of the tracheal lungs of Arachnida.
                    Remarkable glandular structures provided with ducts opening to the exterior
                    occur in various Myriapoda. In all the Diplopoda there are rows of apertures
                    placed laterally one on each somite on either side of the body, known <hi
                    rend="italic">as foramina</hi><hi rend="italic">repugnatoria,</hi> because each
                    acts as the opening of the duct of a gland producing an acrid offensive fluid,
                    which is discharged by the animal on irritation. In a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Fontaria,</hi> one of the <hi rend="italic">Polydesmidae,</hi> as
                    has been recently discovered, this secretion contains a chemical body, probably
                    benzol and petroleum ether, which readily breaks up into prussic acid, and
                    another substance, probably benzaldehyde. The animal thus, when irritated,
                    smells strongly of prussic acid. Similar glands are wanting in most Chilopods,
                    but in <hi rend="italic">Geophilus Gabrielis</hi> there are a series of glands
                    opening to the exterior by means of a series of perforated chitinous plates
                    placed ventrally in the median line, which discharge a red fluid, probably of a
                    similar defensive nature.</p>
                <p>The foramina repugnatoria of the Diplopods were by early observers mistaken for
                    stigmata, as they correspond in position with the stigmata of the Chilopods. It
                    is worthy of note that, if Moseley’s hypothesis that tracheal organs have arisen
                    in evolution as modifications of universally scattered cutaneous glands is
                    correct, the lateral foramina repugnatoria and glands of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Julidae</hi> may be after all to some extent homologous with the lateral
                    stigmata and tracheae of the <hi rend="italic">Scolopendridae,</hi> the ventral
                    tracheae of the <hi rend="italic">Julidae</hi> with the ventral glands of <hi
                    rend="italic">Geophilus Gabrielis,</hi> whilst the dorsal stigmata of <hi
                    rend="italic">Scutigera</hi> represent the survival of part of the dorsal
                    tracheae of an ancestral form, with scattered tracheae like <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peripatus.</hi> In some derived forms the glands have survived as tracheae in
                    one region of the body, in others in another region, in some certain of them
                    have remained as glands or reverted to that condition, in others they have
                    developed into enlarged tracheae.</p>
                <p>The generative organs of the Myriapoda are usually elongate, unpaired, tubular
                    organs, often with paired ducts, always provided with accessory glands, and in
                    the female often with a receptaculum seminis. In the Chilopods the ducts open at
                    the hinder extremity of the body; in the Diplopods on the ventral surface of the
                    third somite posterior to the head.</p>
                <p>The Myriapoda are usually divided into two orders— the Diplopoda and the
                    Chilopoda. Of these the former appears to be the most ancient and primitive, as
                    proved by its general structure, and especially by that of its tracheae, and by
                    geological evidence so far as knowledge extends. They may be thus
                    characterized.</p>
                <p>Order Diplopoda ( = Chilognatha).</p>
                <p>Myriapoda with bodies circular or semicircular in section; antennae short, of no
                    more than seven joints; no appendages acting as poison-claws; each somite in the
                    middle and hinder region of the body bearing two pairs of legs; a variable small
                    number of anterior somites always bearing single pairs only; stigmata ventral,
                    two pairs to each somite; tracheal organs tuft-shaped with sac-like main tube,
                    not branching or anastomosing; laterally-placed repugnatorial glands present; a
                    single pair of Malpighian tubes present; generative organs opening on the third
                    post-cephalic somite; larvae at birth provided with only three pairs of
                    functionally active legs.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="italic">Julus,</hi> the well-known Millepedes, which may
                    be taken as types of this order, the body is nearly cylindrical, slightly
                    flattened beneath, and composed of a series of chitinous rings, one to each
                    somite, which are bevelled off at their posterior borders for a certain part of
                    their breadth so as to fit each within the next succeeding ring (fig.</p>
                <p>6). The rings (“terga ”) are not complete, but interrupted by a narrow interval
                    corresponding with the ventral median line, which is closed in each ring by a
                    pair of ventral plates (“sterna ”) placed one in front of the other. Each of
                    these ventral plates, except in the first four post-oral somites, bears a pair
                    of short jointed legs composed each of five joints and a single terminal claw,
                    the bases of the legs of opposite sides being so closely approximated in the
                    middle line as to be in contact. Just in front of the base of each leg is a
                    simple stigma communicating with a tuft-shaped tracheal organ (fig. δ). There
                    are thus two pairs of legs to all except the most anterior somites, and two
                    pairs of tracheae. The mandibles mostly have broad chewing surfaces suited to
                    mastication of vegetable matter. The maxillae of the two sides are fused
                    together to form a four-lobed plate acting as an under-lip. There are no
                    poison-claws as in the Chilopods, but the leg-shaped appendages of the first
                    post-cephalic somite, the tergum of which is in most forms enlarged and
                    shield-like, are turned towards the mouth, and probably assist in the process of
                    feeding. In the males of some forms these appendages are shaped into peculiar
                    short blunt grasping hooks, bearing spines on their bases (fig. 7). Of the
                    succeeding three somites one (the third post-cephalic) is devoid of legs, and
                    also of sternal plates; the other two bear a single pair of legs each only. The
                    remainder of the somites bear each two pairs of legs (hence the term Diplopoda),
                    except the seventh post-oral in the male, on which a complicated paired
                    copulatory organ, formed out of modifications of the sterna and other components
                    of the normal somite, is pre sent. The form of these copulatory organs varies
                    very much in species and genera of Diplopoda, and is of great systematic value.
                    In both male and female <hi rend="italic">Julus</hi> the generative ducts open
                    by a pair of apertures on the ventral surface of the third segment, just behind
                    the bases of the second pair of legs, the copulatory organs in the male being
                    without internal connexion with the ducts oι the testis.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Julidae</hi> coil themselves up spirally when at rest or

                    representatives of the <hi rend="italic">Julidae</hi> occur, especially species
                    of the genus <hi rend="italic">Spirobolus,</hi> which do considerable damage in
                    gardens by devouring leaves. In the <hi rend="italic">Polyzonidae</hi> (fig. 7)
                    the mouth parts are formed into a pricking and sucking beak or tube. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Polydesmidae</hi> the body is semi-cylindrical in section, with
                    the lateral regions of each tergum broadened out into a pair of horizontal
                    projecting plates. In the Palaeozoic Diplopoda, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euphorberiα</hi> and its allies, the terga bore each six stout projecting
                    spines, forming rows of spines along the body (fig. 6); the sterna enclosed
                    one-third of the circuit of the body instead of only an insignificant ventral
                    streak as in the <hi rend="italic">Julidae.</hi> In addition to the stigmata
                    there are found on the ventral aspect of these fossil forms certain paired
                    organs supposed by Scudder, who conjectures that these ancient Diplopoda may
                    have been amphibious in habits, to have given support to gills. In the <hi

                    appearance. The males of <hi rend="italic">Sphaerotherium,</hi> a genus of this
                    family, possess a stridulating apparatus at the hinder end of the body</p>
                <p>Very important from a zoological point of view are the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polyxenus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pαu-ropus,</hi> the species of both of
                    which are extremely small. <hi rend="italic">Polyxenus</hi> (fig. 8) is about
                    one-twelfth of an inch in length, and has fourteen pairs of legs, only the first
                    four pairs of which are borne on the first four post-cephalic somites. The body
                    is covered with bundles of hairy scales. In <hi rend="italic">Pauropus</hi>
                    (fig. 9) only nine pairs of legs are present. The antennae are branched at their
                    tips; the first post-cephalic somite bears a single pair of legs, the second
                    post-cephalic a single pair of legs, and the remaining somites, except the
                    posterior which bears a single pair, two pairs each. Sir John Lubbock, the
                    discoverer of this form, which has many aberrant features besides those
                    described above, referred it to a separate order of Myriapods, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pauropoda.</hi></p>
                <p>Order Chilopoda.</p>
                <p>Myriapoda mostly of dorso-ventrally compressed form, with long multi-articulate
                    antennae; with the second pair of post - cephalic appendages applied to the
                    mouth as poison-claws; only one sternum and one pair of legs to each somite;
                    stigmata lateral (in <hi rend="italic">Scutigera</hi> dorsal); tracheal organs
                    ramified, not tuft-shaped, often anastomosing; generative openings posterior;
                    larvae born with more than three pairs of functionally active legs.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Scolopendra</hi> (fig. 10) the body is band-like and
                    flattened dorso-ventrally. The terga and sterna are nearly flat broad plates of
                    chitinous material, connected laterally by more flexible softer skin, in which
                    in each somite lies on either side a single stigma. The corresponding large
                    ramified tracheal trunks, which are provided internally with well-developed
                    spiral filaments, are connected on each side by lateral longitudinal
                    anastomosing tubes. The antennae are many-jointed, long, and tapering; the head
                    is followed by a second compound somite formed of four embryonic somites fused,
                    termed the “basilar somite,” which is covered by a single enlarged shield-like
                    tergum. The legs are borne at the lateral margin of the ventral surface, their
                    bases being wide apart; one pair is present to every post-basilar somite. The
                    mandibles are provided with sharp cutting teeth; the maxillae are fused together
                    in the middle line as in Diplopods. They do not form a plate, but in the centre
                    a small bilobed process only, and bear a pair of soft palps laterally (fig. 11).
                    The basilar somite bears as the first pair of post-cephalic appendages a pair of
                    palp-like legs turned forwards in front of the mouth, and as the second a pair
                    of large powerful limbs, the poison-claws, provided with a pair of curved claws
                    perforated at their extremities by the ducts of poison-glands embedded in the
                    claλvs and their penultimate joints. The basilar somite may bear posteriorly in
                    addition a pair of walking legs, but this pair is frequently aborted in the
                    adult animal. The last pair of legs at the hinder extremity of the body is
                    elongated and directed backwards in the line of the body posteriorly. The
                    generative ducts open posteriorly beneath the anus.</p>
                <p>The Chilopoda are all carnivorous, catching their prey and killing it by means of
                    the poisonclaws. <hi rend="italic">Eucorybas crotalus</hi> of S. Africa makes
                    with its hind legs a rattling noise like that of the rattlesnake. <hi
                    rend="italic">Arthronomatus longicornis</hi> of Europe is phosphorescent in the
                    dark. The <hi rend="italic">Geophilidae,</hi> which are without eyes, have very
                    long worm-like bodies, composed of very numerous segments. They live
                    gregariously in moist earth. In <hi rend="italic">Lithobius,</hi> the commonest
                    British Centipede, the somites are unequal in size, there being nine larger and
                    six smaller terga and fifteen legs composed each of six joints and a claw. The
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Scutigera</hi> and its allies form a remarkable family,
                    <hi rend="italic">Scutigeridae</hi> (fig. 12), in which the antennae are
                    bristle-like and as long as the body, and the legs are extremely long,
                    increasing in length towards the hinder end of the body. The peculiarities of
                    their eyes and respiratory organs have already been referred to above. Most
                    important is the aberrant genus <hi rend="italic">Scolopendrella,</hi> which has
                    lately been shown to have certain marked features indicating alliance to the
                    primitive insects, <hi rend="italic">Thysanura.</hi> The species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Scolopendrella</hi> are minute forms five or six mm. in length,

                    first sight like small <hi rend="italic">Scolopendras</hi> (fig. 13). The head

                    bears, according to Wood Mason, dorsally fifteen tergites behind the head, the

                    indications of somites only can be detected; and these bear twelve pairs of
                    functional appendages. Two of the tergites appear to be devoid of stemites and
                    appendages. The first post-cephalic appendages ( = third postorals) are small
                    and turned towards the mouth; the eleven following ventrally-indicated somites

                    arrangement of the stigmata is uncertain. Hasse finds only a single pair on the
                    head, Wood Mason and others many pairs on the body somites. Peculiar paired
                    segmental organs are present on the ventral surface which may be excretory. It
                    appears not impossible that <hi rend="italic">Scolo-peιιdrella</hi> may have
                    originally possessed two pairs of appendages to each somite, and may thus
                    represent to some extent a transition form between the ancient Diplopoda and the
                    more recent Chilopodous type; but as theanatomy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scolopendrella</hi> is as yet imperfectly known, and nothing is known as to its
                    embryonic development, its place in classification must remain for the present
                    an open question. By Ryder a separate order <hi rend="italic">(Symphyla)</hi>
                    has been formed for it, whilst Packard has placed it amongst the <hi
                    rend="italic">Thysanura</hi> notwithstanding its numerous jointed legs, which
                    constitute the most essential distinction of Myriapoda from Insecta.</p>
                <p>Remains of representatives of the Chilopoda have not been found in Palaeozoic
                    strata. The earliest known are Secondary from the Solenhofen slate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Development of the Myriapoda.—Scolopendra</hi> is viviparous
                    like <hi rend="italic">Peripatus. Lithobius</hi> lays its eggs loosely amongst
                    earth; they are very hard to find there, and nothing is thus known of its
                    development: The female <hi rend="italic">Geophilus</hi> lays her eggs in heaps
                    and watches over them; in the case of <hi rend="italic">Julus</hi> the process
                    is similar. Information as to the development of the Myriapoda generally is at
                    present very imperfect. In no case as far as yet known is a blastopore formed as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Peripatus.</hi> The first structure to appear in <hi
                    rend="italic">Strongylosoma (Polydesmidse)</hi> is a ventral thickened plate.
                    The appendages are formed in succession from before backwards, and the mouth and
                    anus as stomodaeum and proctodaeum. The embryo when hatched (fig. 14) has nine
                    post-cephalic somites, the second of which is without appendages, whilst the
                    first, third, and fourth each bear a functional pair of limbs, the fifth bears
                    two pairs of rudimentary limbs beneath the larval skin, and the sixth a single
                    pair, which very soon becomes double. The young <hi rend="italic"
                    >Strongylosoma</hi> is thus provided with three pairs of functionally active
                    legs. The young <hi rend="italic">Julus</hi> has a similar number, the third
                    post-cephalic somite being apodous, and it was formerly considered that this
                    fact established a connexion between the Myriapoda and the Insecta, the three
                    pairs of larval legs of the Myriapod being supposed to correspond with the three
                    pairs of legs of insects. Such, however, is not the case; there being no second
                    maxillae in Myriapoda, the first pair of legs in the larva must correspond with
                    the second maxillae of insects; and even if this could be shown to be incorrect,
                    the three pairs of legs would still not correspond with those of insects,
                    because in the young <hi rend="italic">Strongylosoma</hi> the second and in <hi
                    rend="italic">Julus</hi> the third post-cephalic somites are devoid of legs.
                    Moreover, the larvae are only apparently hexapodous, not in reality so. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Pauropus</hi> there is a hexapodous larval stage. In the Chilopoda
                    no functional or real hexapodous larval stage occurs, as far as is known.</p>
