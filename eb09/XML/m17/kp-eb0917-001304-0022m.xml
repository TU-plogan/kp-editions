                <p><label type="entry">MULE</label>. Though this term is not unfrequently applied to
                    the produce of two creatures of different species, and is synonymous with
                    hybrid, yet in its ordinary acceptation it is employed to designate the
                    offspring or “cross” between the equine and asinine species. There are two kinds
                    of mule—the <hi rend="italic">Mule</hi> proper <hi rend="italic">(Equus
                    Asinus,</hi> var. γ; <hi rend="italic">Multis</hi>; Fr., <hi rend="italic"

                    >Kleiner</hi><hi rend="italic">Maulesel),</hi> the offspring of the stallion and
                    female ass. The mule is the more valuable of the two, and to its production the
                    attention of breeders is entirely directed. Indeed, the hinny is so rarely
                    produced, owing to the antipathy of the stallion to the female ass, that many
                    authorities deny its existence.</p>
                <p>Intercourse between the mare and male ass is very seldom voluntary; indeed,
                    horses will not associate with asses, and combats between them are often
                    serious. The male ass will freely mate with the mare, but the latter has a
                    strong repugnance to him, as has also the stallion for the female ass. Hence in
                    mule-breeding the mare has to be blindfolded and otherwise deceived, or secured
                    in a travis or by ropes, before she will allow the ass to approach her.
                    Fecundation is not so certain between the ass and horse species as between the
                    male and female of either species, for, while of four mares three at least will
                    be fecundated by the stallion, as a rule only two will be so by the ass.</p>
                <p>Fecundation of the hybrid female by the male ass or the stallion is not very
                    rare; but it is otherwise with the male hybrid, no instance being recorded in
                    which he has been prolific, though physically the animal appears to be perfect,
                    and often exhibits an intense ardour for the female. The female mule, when
                    fecundated, seldom reaches the natural term of pregnancy, and rarely brings
                    forth a living offspring. The duration of gestation in a mare impregnated by the
                    ass is a little longer than in impregnation by the stallion,— the average being
                    375 days. Abortion readily occurs, and more care is necessary than in breeding
                    horses or asses.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n23/mode/1up"

                <p>In breeding mules the choice in the male parent is limited so far as shape is
                    concerned, as the best-formed asses have, relatively to their height, the head
                    too large, short neck, sides too flat, low shoulders, narrow croup, thin arms
                    and thighs, and very narrow hoofs. To obtain well-shaped mules, therefore, the
                    selection of the mare is of the greatest importance in remedying the defects of
                    the sire. Mares with a small head, round body, short back, wide chest and
                    muscular croup, large thighs and arms, a long neck well set-on, and wide round
                    hoofs are the best. Height is not of so much moment, but a mare measuring from
                    14 to 15 hands high is preferable. A good height for the male ass is between 13
                    and 14 hands. Mules inherit to an extraordinary degree the shape and
                    peculiarities of the sire; from the mare they derive size, but rarely her bad
                    shape or unsoundnesses. This is fortunate, for, though it is always desirable to
                    breed from sound well-formed stock, yet mares so unsound or defective in shape
                    as to be disqualified for horse-breeding may be utilized for mule-breeding.</p>
                <p>The mule foal is not so strong on its limbs as the horse foal, and it does not
                    grow so quickly. It is longer in reaching maturity, for it is of little use
                    under four years of age; but it is useful for a longer period than the horse,
                    often working until it is twenty, thirty, and even forty years of age. When full
                    grown the mule is from 13 to 15, and sometimes 16 hands high; but those from 14
                    to 15 hands are generally preferred.</p>
                <p>The mule is endowed with the chief characteristics of its parents. In its short
                    thick head, long ears, thin limbs, small narrow hoofs, short mane, absence of
                    chestnuts (horny growths) inside the hocks, and tail destitute of hair at the
                    root it is asinine; while in height and body, shape of neck and croup,
                    uniformity of coat, and in teeth it is equine. It has the voice neither of the
                    ass nor of the horse, however, but emits a feeble hoarse noise. The most common
                    colour of the mule is a brown or bay-brown,—bay, or bright bay, or piebald being
                    rare; a chestnut tint is sometimes noticed. It possesses the sobriety, patience,
                    endurance, and sure-footedness of the ass, and the vigour, strength, and courage
                    of the horse. As a beast of burden it is preferable to the horse, being less
                    impatient under the pressure of heavy weights, while the skin being harder and
                    less sensitive renders it more capable of resisting sun and rain. It is very
                    frugal, easily fed, and equally good for carrying as for drawing loads; it walks
                    well and steadily, easily traverses the worst roads or paths, will climb or
                    descend a steep mountain, or pick its steps by the side of a precipice, with the
                    surety and safety of a goat. For hot and dry countries, especially those which
                    are mountainous, it is well adapted, though cold and wet regions are not
                    suitable for it.</p>
                <p>The mule, like the ass, enjoys an extraordinary immunity from disease. After the
                    campaign in Egypt in 1882 the English horses suffered most extensively and
                    severely from a kind of malarious fever, but the mules were entirely exempt. A
                    similar exemption has been noticed during the prevalence of epizootic maladies
                    at other times. Nevertheless those diseases which attack the mule (and the
                    asinine species) run their course with great rapidity; for example, glanders,
                    which often appears in a chronic form in the horse, is most acute in the mule
                    and ass. These are also very liable to tetanus from trifling injuries.</p>
                <p>The mule has been in use from very early times; the inhabitants of Mysia and
                    Paphlagonia are said to have been the first breeders. With the Greeks and
                    Romans, the latter especially, the mule was much valued for its good qualities,
                    being employed to draw carriages and carry loads. At the present day it is
                    extensively used in nearly every part of the world, in some countries almost
                    supplanting the horse, while for military purposes it is undoubtedly the best
                    transport animal.</p>
                <p>The principal mule countries in Europe are the south of France, Spain, Portugal,
                    and Italy, where they are used for pack and draught. The French mules are most
                    numerous on the borders of the Pyrenees, in Gascony, and in Poitou. In Spain
                    mules are used in the Catalan provinces, in the mountainous districts of
                    Andalusia, and in the province of Alicante. Good draught-mules are bred in La
                    Mancha and in the districts on the slopes of the Pyrenees, where they are
                    employed to carry loads. But in Spain, Italy, and some other countries they are
                    also extensively used in carriages; in Spain particularly, where large, fine
                    mules are bred for this purpose, a pair of these animals will often cost more
                    than a pair of horses. The mules of Asia Minor, Syria, Cyprus, Egypt, and
                    Algeria, as well as those of the district between the Tigris and the Persian
                    frontier and in North China, are good. In the Punjab provinces of British India
                    many excellent mules are bred, breeding being largely promoted by the
                    Government. Good mules are reared in North and South America, the principal
                    districts for breeding them in the United States being Kentucky, Missouri, and
                    Kansas. The Kentucky mules are well shaped and showy, being derived from nearly
                    thoroughbred mares known as Kentucky trotters, while those reared in Missouri
                    are hardy, and can endure much privation and hardship. The Mexican mule, bred by
                    a male ass out of a mustang mare, is also a very hardy, strong, and useful
                    animal.</p>
                <p>France is perhaps the most important mule-raising country in Europe, four centres
                    being more particularly devoted to this kind of industry: Poitou, the
                    mountainous districts of central France, the Pyrenees, and Dauphiné. The mules
                    of these different parts chiefly differ in height; those of Poitou are large,
                    powerful, and long in the body, and are mainly exported to the departments of
                    Languedoc and Provence, as well as to Spain, Italy, and America; those of
                    Dauphiné are of medium height, with a short, thick body; while those of the
                    centre and the Pyrenees are lighter and smaller, but more active.</p>
                <p>Mule-breeding in Poitou is one of the most important branches of industry, and is
                    supposed to date from the time of Philip V. of Spain, when the particular breeds
                    of horses and asses were imported into that region and Gascony. But there is
                    evidence to show that so early as the 10th century the mules of Poitou were of
                    excellent quality. Though this industry has for a number of years been in a most
                    flourishing condition, this has not always been the case; more than a century
                    ago it was the object of violent attacks, and, had it not been for the great
                    advantages the breeders derived from it and the comparatively small expense
                    incurred in carrying it on, it must have languished or ceased altogether. The
                    Government could not understand why so many mares should be lost to horse
                    production and kept to breed mules alone; and in 1717 the intendant-general of
                    the <hi rend="italic">haras</hi> went so far as to prohibit male asses being put
                    to mares measuring more than 12 hands from the withers to the top of the hoof
                    under penalty of a fine and confiscation of the ass; and the minister Bertin
                    issued a decree to the effect that all the male asses in Poitou were to be
                    castrated. It was only at a recent period that the <hi rend="italic">haras</hi>
                    administration ceased to oppose mule-breeding, when it found that it could not
                    be successfully suppressed; for, while in the one department of Deux-Sèvres
                    13,000 mares were employed in mule production in 1816, fifty years afterwards
                    there were 23,000. Besides, it was discovered not only that this industry added
                    largely to the national wealth but that mules were extremely useful in the army
                    as pack animals, as well as for draught, especially for mountain artillery.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n24/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0024-0015"/>
                <p>The Poitou mules are large, and strong enough to be used for heavy draught; those
                    produced elsewhere in France, especially in Gascony, are light and better
                    adapted for weight carrying. In Poitou at the present time about 50,000 mares
                    are kept for mule production; of these it is estimated that 38,000 are bred from
                    every year, and of the produce 18,000 are sold annually. In the fairs of Poitou
                    some mules fetch the large price of 1300 to 1500 francs, and many are sold for
                    900 or 1000 francs. If the average price be fixed at only 600 francs, it will be
                    seen that Poitou alone realizes annually from its mulebreeding no less than
                    10,800,000 francs. The statistics of 1840 give the number of mules in France at
                    373,841, of 1852 at 315,331, of 1862 at 330,987, and the census of 1866 at
                    345,243. The average price of a mule in 1840 was reckoned at 172 francs, in 1852
                    at 183 francs, and in 1862 at 278 francs. The total value of the mules in 1840
                    was estimated at 64,284,246 francs, in 1862 it had increased to 92,078,458
                    francs. The total amount of revenue derived from the trade in mules was: in
                    1840, 21,244,148 francs; in 1852, 87,548,310 francs; and in 1862, 162,341,162
                    francs. Since the last-mentioned date it is probable that there has been a
                    further increase.</p>
                <p>In the United Kingdom mules are seldom bred, and their services do not appear to
                    be much appreciated; hence their importation is almost <hi rend="italic"
                    >nil.</hi> After the war in Egypt in 1882 a large number of mules which had been
                    purchased by the British Government for that campaign were brought to England
                    and sold by public auction, but the average price realized was probably not more
                    than one-half the amount they had cost in the countries in which they were
                    originally purchased.</p>
                <p>Mules have in recent times been largely employed in British campaigns, as in the
                    Crimea, India, Abyssinia, South Africa, and Egypt. In the Abyssinian campaign
                    more than 10,000 pack-mules were obtained from Cyprus, Brindisi, Malta, Smyrna,
                    Gibraltar, Alicante, Valencia, Scanderoon, and Beyrout. The order in which these
                    places are enumerated indicates the relative adaptability of the mules for pack
                    transport during that campaign.</p>
                <p>During the Zulu war, South-African or Colonial, South-American, North-American,
                    and French mules were employed; but of these the South-African and
                    South-American were found to be the most suitable.</p>
                <p>In India mules form part of the permanent transport of the Punjab irregular
                    force, and are used as pack animals in the mountain batteries. They have also
                    been largely used for transport in the many expeditions which have taken place
                    on the north-western frontier. During the recent Afghan war it was proved that
                    for mountain warfare the mule was by far the best beast of burden; and the
                    director of transport with the Indian division during the late Egyptian campaign
                    reported highly of the work done by the Punjab mules, which are somewhat famed
                    for undergoing a great amount of exertion on little food. The breeding of
                    pack-mules, as also of those adapted for batteries of mountain artillery, too
                    much neglected hitherto, is now much encouraged by the Government of India,
                    which supplies many good male asses to different districts free of charge. These
                    asses are chiefly Arab, Spanish, French, and Italian; but very good animals are
                    at times obtained from Bokhara. By stimulating the breeding of improved asses an
                    increasing supply of good sires and mules is obtained.</p>
                <p>The experience of British and other European armies in favour of the mule has
                    been corroborated by that of the United States. In the quartermaster-general’s
                    report for 1865 it is stated: “The experience of this (secession) war has
                    convinced all officers of this department that for the army-trains mules are
                    much superior to horses, and of late the horses have almost entirely disappeared
                    from the trains, being transferred to the cavalry or artillery and replaced by
                    mules.”</p>
                <p>Mules are well adapted for the sick or hospital transport of an army in the field
                    as pack animals, being smaller, surer-footed, and shorter-paced than horses; but
                    they should be specially selected and trained for this purpose, animals of
                    sufficient strength and docility being necessary. A loaded mule will walk a
                    little more than 3 miles an hour, though the pace will much depend upon the
                    roads. The pace is slow moving down hill, quick up hill. Mules sleep from three
                    to four hours in the twenty-four, the soundest sleep being towards dawn. The
                    male mule can carry more weight than the female, though the latter is steadier
                    for work, being more docile; male mules are often vicious and carry loads badly,
                    so that to render them more tractable they are sometimes castrated. For saddle
                    purposes those which more resemble the horse than the ass are preferable.</p>
                <p>The carrying power of the mule varies according to a variety of circumstances
                    from 100 lb to 300 ∏&gt;, the average being about 200 lb including the
                    pack-saddle. In a journey made in 1856 from the city of Del Norte to Chihuahua
                    and Durango in Mexico, a distance of about 500 miles, it was found that out of a
                    train of seventy-five mules the most it was possible for any mule to carry was
                    27 5 lb; not more than twenty mules could convey more than 250 lb, the average
                    weight carried by the whole train being a little less than 200 lb. The distance
                    per day was about 15 miles. In another journey it was noted that some of the
                    very best mules, out of a very superior description specially selected, which
                    were loaded with 300 lb, gave out completely at the end of two weeks. In the
                    Abyssinian expedition the load had to be reduced to 100 lb, not including the
                    pack-saddle. It has been stated that a good compact mule, when well trained,
                    properly fitted and handled, will carry in ordinary field service 30 per cent,
                    of its own weight. If the load is in proportion to the size of the animal, small
                    mules have the advantage. A 600 lb mule is quite as good for a 200 tt&gt; load
                    as a 900 lb mule is for a 270 lb load.</p>
                <p>During the Peninsular War mules were hired by the commissariat for a Spanish
                    dollar a day and rations for the driver. The weight of the load was fixed at 200
                    lb, and the length of journey in a mountainous country with bad roads was from
                    10 to 12 miles loaded, 15 to 16 unloaded. The maximum price paid for mules
                    purchased for the Bhutan (India) expedition was 180 rupees; those purchased at
                    Baghdad and Bushire for the Abyssinian expedition averaged 124 rupees 8 annas,
                    in Syria about £20. The mules purchased in the Punjab for the same expedition
                    cost 225 rupees each; those procured in Egypt about £26 10s. per animal. The
                    mules purchased in New York for the Zulu war cost £42 per head, though good
                    serviceable mules can be bought at St Louis for from £25 to £30. A firm in
                    London at the-same time tendered to supply mules from Spain at £35 each for
                    pack, and £37 10s for draught. The South-African mules bought during the Zulu
                    war cost on an average £23 each.</p>
                <p>It has been observed that large mules are not so durable as medium-sized ones,
                    especially for military service. In Algeria it was rare to find a mule over 14
                    hands more than fifteen years of age, and those approaching 15 hands died
                    younger, while those between 13 and 14 hands were frequently more than twenty
                    years old. The older animals were very often mares. (G. FL. )</p>
