                    is exceedingly strong, and it commands all the roads leading from Corinth and
                    Achaia into the Argive plain; this fact, combined with its distance from the
                    sea, shows that the city was founded by a race which came from the direction of
                    Corinth and not by immigrants landing on the coast. The walls of Mycenae are the
                    greatest monument that remains of the Heroic age in Greece; part of them is
                    similar in style and doubtless contemporary in date with the walls of the
                    neighbouring town Tiryns, but other parts seem to be the work of a rather later
                    time. There can therefore be little doubt that the two towns were the
                    strongholds of a single race, Tiryns commanding the sea - coast and Mycenae the
                    inner country. The city of Argos, on the other hand, has no remains to connect
                    it with this early Mycenaean race; and legend tells of the rivalry between the
                    dynasties of the Pelopidae at Mycenae and of the Proetidae at Argos. The long
                    warfare between the two cities lasted till 468 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    when Mycenae was dismantled and its inhabitants dispersed. The city never
                    revived; Strabo asserts that no trace of it remained in his time, but Pausanias
                    describes the ruins.</p>
                <p>Subjoined are the most important monuments. 1. The “Treasuries” of Atreus and his
                    sons, as Pausanias calls them. They were subterranean buildings of beehive
                    shape, in the side of the hill southwest of the city; one of them is still
                    almost perfect. A sloping passage, <hi rend="italic">δρόμ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >-os,</hi> led to the doorway, with its ornamented columns, at the base of the
                    building. The great circular chamber inside was probably covered with plates of
                    bronze; a door in one side admitted to a second smaller chamber. Such buildings,
                    which are found in other parts of Greece— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    Orchomenus, Sparta, Attica, Iolcus, &amp;c.— were undoubtedly the sepulchres of
                    noble families.</p>
                <p>2. The graves discovered by Dr Schliemann in 1876 within the city wall. They are
                    enclosed within a circular <hi rend="italic">πeplβoλos</hi> with a single
                    entrance, and the place was therefore a holy place in the ancient Mycenaean
                    time; on the other hand the part of the city wall which encloses them is a later
                    addition to the original wall. At some period before 468 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> this addition was built; before that time the <hi rend="italic"
                    >πeplβoλos</hi> was outside the Avail. Some heroes of the race were worshipped
                    here by the ancient inhabitants, but their names are not recorded by any
                    trustworthy authority. In the time of Pausanias, six centuries after Mycenae was
                    destroyed, local legend maintained that these were the graves of Atreus,
                    Agamemnon, Cassandra and her children, and Eurymedon; but it is uncertain
                    whether this was the original legend, or a later tale that grew under the
                    influence of Greek literature.</p>
                <p>3. The Lion-Gate. The principal entrance to the city is approached by a <hi
                    rend="italic">δpbμos,</hi> flanked on each side by the city wall and leading up
                    to a gateλvay. Over the entrance is placed a triangular slab of stone on which
                    are carved two lions in relief; they are rampant, facing one another, but
                    separated by an upright column. The art of this relief shows no resemblance to
                    archaic Greek art; it is foreign in character, the work of an immigrant race,
                    which brought with it a well-developed civilization.</p>
                <p>Greek legend always maintains that the Pelopidae of Mycenae came from Phrygia,
                    and this is corroborated by the evidence of archaeology. The objects found in
                    excavations, and the sculptured ornament on the doorways of the “Treasuries” and
                    over the Lion-Gate, all point to foreign influence and particularly to Asia
                    Minor. The same type of the two lions and the column has been recently found
                    over the entrance to a colossal sepulchre in the rocks near the south-western
                    corner of the Sangarius valley in Phrygia. Legend and remains alike show that a
                    rich and powerful dynasty of foreign origin ruled at Mycenae; the only early
                    remains in the Greek world that equal them in interest are the ruins of ancient
                    Troy. It is precisely these two cities which are described in the Homeric poems
                    as the two great cities of the Greek world.</p>
