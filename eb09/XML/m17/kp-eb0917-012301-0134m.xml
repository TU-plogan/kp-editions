                    southern India, lying between 11° 40' and 15° N. lat. and 74° 40' and 78° 30' E.
                    long., and surrounded entirely by British territory, with an area of 24,723
                    square miles. The Mysore country above the Ghâts, though frequently called “the
                    tableland,” is by no means flat or a plain, but is in some parts mountainous and
                    everywhere undulating. Deep ravines are situated in the angle where the Eastern
                    and Western Ghâts converge into the group of the Nilgiri hills. An interesting
                    feature of the country is the large number of isolated rocks <hi rend="italic"
                    >{drug,</hi> “difficult of access”) which often rear their heads as stupendous
                    monoliths to the height of 4000 or 5000 feet above sea-level. Some of these
                    rocks—in particular Nandidrùg (4810 feet) and Savandrιig (4024 feet)—have been
                    the scene of many a hard-fought contest, while Kabaldrιig obtained an evil fame
                    as a state prison. The eight highest peaks in Mysore are Mulâina-girî (6317
                    feet), Kuduri-mukha (6215), Bâbâ Bùdan-giri (6214), Kalhatti (6155), Rudra-giri
                    (5692), Pushpa-giri (5626), Merti-gudda (5451), and Wodin-gudda (5006 feet).
                    Five of these are comprised in the Bâbâ Bûdan or Chandradrona range, a
                    magnificent horse-shoe-shaped cluster of mountains. Mysore is naturally divided
                    into two regions of distinct character—the hill country called the Malnâd, on
                    the west, and the more open country known as the Maidân, comprising the greater
                    part of the state, where the wide-spreading valleys and plains are covered with
                    villages and populous towns. The drainage of the country, with a slight
                    exception, finds its way into the Bay of Bengal, and is divisible into three
                    great river systems—that of the Krishna on the north, the Cauvery on the south,
                    and the Pennair, Penar, and Palar on the east. A few minor streams flow west
                    into the Arabian Sea. Owing to either rocky or shallow beds none of the Mysore
                    rivers are navigable, but some are utilized for floating down timber at certain
                    seasons. The main streams, especially the Cauvery and its tributaries, support
                    an extensive system of irrigation by means of channels drawn from immense dams
                    <hi rend="italic">{anicuts),</hi> which retain the water at a high level and
                    permit only the overflow to pass down stream. The streams which gather from the
                    hill-sides and fertilize the valleys are embanked at every favourable point in
                    such a manner as to form a series of reservoirs or tanks, the outflow from one
                    at a higher level supplying the next lower, and so on, all down the course of
                    the stream at short intervals. These tanks, varying in size from small ponds to
                    extensive lakes, are dispersed throughout the country to the number of 20,000;
                    the largest is the Sulukere Lake, 40 miles in circumference.</p>
                <p>The census of 1881 returned the population of Mysore at 4,186,188 (males
                    2,085,842, females 2,100,346), viz., Hindus 3,956,336, Mohammedans 200,484,
                    Christians 29,249, “others” 119. The population of the chief towns in the
                    executive districts was as follows Bangalore, 155,857; Mysore, 60,292; Shimoga,
                    12,040; Kolar, 11,172; Tumkιir, 9909; Chikmagalur, 7088; Hassan, 5950; and
                    Chitalchoog, 4271. In 1880-81 out of a total of 4,280,674 acres of cultivable
                    land 3,139,560 were occupied by <hi rend="italic">ragi</hi> and other dry crops,
                    554,752 by rice, 21,058 by wheat, 147,464 by oil-seeds, 24,076 by sugar cane,
                    20,893 by cotton, 159,165 by coffee, 135,542 by cocoa-nut and areca-nut, and the
                    remainder by fibres, tobacco, vegetables, mulberry, pepper, and lac. Two
                    cinchona plantations have been recently established, and promise good results.
                    In the Lâl Bâgh or Government garden at Bangalore, attempts have been made with
                    some success to grow vanilla, cocoa, rhea, ipecacuanha, and various other exotic
                    plants, while the culture of apples, peaches, strawberries, and other fruits has
                    been greatly improved.</p>
                <p>The drought which affected all southern India in 1876-78 fell with especial
                    severity upon Mysore. From October 1875 to October 1877 four successive monsoons
                    failed to bring their full supply of rain. The harvest of 1875 was generally
                    below the average, and remissions of revenue were found necessary; but it was
                    not till the close of 1876 that actual famine occurred. During the whole of 1877
                    famine was at work; but in October of that year the monsoon broke with a fair
                    rainfall, and cultivation at last became possible. It will, however, take many
                    years before Mysore recovers its normal condition of prosperity; and it is
                    estimated by competent authorities that one-fourth of the entire population of
                    the state was swept away by starvation or disease, while the mortality among
                    cattle was yet more heavy. In 1880-81 also 200,000 head of cattle perished. In
                    September 1877, when affairs were at their worst, no less than 280,000 persons
                    were in receipt of relief. The total amount expended on state relief, apart from
                    loss of land revenue, was upwards of a million sterling.</p>
                <p>The chief manufacture of Mysore is iron-smelting at Bangalore. Gold-mining is
                    pursued in Kolar and Bangalore (since 1881) districts. Jewellery is a speciality
                    of Bangalore. Carpets, rugs, cotton textures, silk cloths, cumblies, &amp;c.,
                    are also manufactured, the total estimated value being 6,281,651 rupees.
                    Sandal-wood, which forms a state monopoly, yields an average annual income of
                    about £15,000. The Madras railway runs through the state. An excellent net-work
                    of provincial and district roads intersects the state, and great attention has
                    been paid to the numerous passes through the Western Ghâts to the low country
                    beyond.</p>
                <p>The total revenue for 1880-81 was 10,270,383 rupees. Local funds to the extent of
                    700,697 rupees were also levied for the maintenance of district roads and tanks,
                    and for the support of village schools. Municipalities have been established at
                    all district headquarters, and also in sixty-seven other towns. The system of
                    judicial procedure, both civil and criminal, has been assimilated to that in
                    force in British territory. Mysore pays a yearly subsidy to the British
                    Government of 2,450,000 rupees for the maintenance of a force for the defence of
                    its territory. There is also a local force. In 1880-81 the total number of
                    schools of all classes in the state was 899 Government schools and 1881 aided
                    schools, the total number of scholars being 42,657. There are in all 20
                    hospitals or dispensaries; the average daily attendance in 1880-81 was 1500.</p>
                <p>In the earliest historical times the northern part of Mysore was held by the
                    Kadamba dynasty, whose capital, Banawasi, is mentioned by Ptolemy; they reigned
                    with more or less splendour during fourteen centuries, though latterly they
                    became feudatories of the Chalukyas. The Cheras were contemporaries with the
                    Kadambas, and governed the southern part of Mysore till they were subverted by
                    the Cholas in the 8th century. Another ancient race, the Pallavas, held a small
                    portion of the eastern side of Mysore, but were overcome by the Chalukyas in the
                    7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> These were overthrown in the 12th
                    century by the Ballâlas, an enterprising and warlike race professing the Jain
                    faith. They ruled over the greater part of Mysore, and portions of the modern
                    districts of Coimbatore, Salem, and Dhârwâr, with their capital at Dwarâ-samudra
                    (the modern Halebid); but in 1310 the Ballala king was captured by Mâlik Kâfur,
                    the general of Ala-ud-din; and seventeen years later the town was entirely
                    destroyed by another force sent by Muhammad Tughlak. After the subversion of the
                    Ballâla dynasty, a new and powerful Hindu sovereignty arose at Vijâya-nagar on
                    the Tungabhadra (see <hi rend="smallcaps">India,</hi> vol. xii. p. 794). In 1565
                    a confederation of the Mohammedan kingdoms defeated the Vijâya-nagar sovereign,
                    Raja Ram, at the battle of Talikot; and his descendants ultimately became
                    extinct as a ruling house. During the feeble reign of the last king, the petty
                    local chiefs (pâligârs) asserted their independence. The most important of these

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0135-0124"/> the wodeyar (“lord”) of Mysore, who in 1610
                    seized the fort of Seringapatam, and so laid the foundation of the present
                    state. His fourth successor, Chikka Deva Râj, during a reign of thirty-four
                    years, made his kingdom one of the most powerful in southern India. In the 18th
                    century the famous Haidar AH usurped the throne, and by his military prowess
                    made himself one of the most powerful princes of India. His dynasty, however,
                    was as brief as it was brilliant, and ended with the defeat and death of his son
                    Tipu at Seringapatam in 1799. A representative of the ancient Hindu line was
                    then replaced on the throne. Owing to his career of misgovernment, the British
                    administration assumed the authority in his name in 1831. He died in 1868,
                    leaving an adopted son, Chikka Krishna Arasu, a minor, during whose pupilage and
                    training the state management was conducted by British officers. The full
                    sovereignty of the state was handed over to him in March 1881.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mysore,</hi> the ancient capital of the above state, is
                    situated 10 miles south-west of Seringapatam, in 12° 18' N. lat. and 76° 41' E.
                    long., with a population of 60,292 in 1881. The town, which is spread over an
                    area of about 3 square miles, lies at the foot of the Châmundi hill, in a valley
                    formed by two parallel ridges running north and south. The streets generally are
                    broad and regular, except in the fort. The majority of the houses are tiled, and
                    some of them are substantial buildings two or three stories high. Altogether,
                    the town has a clean and prosperous look, and its sanitary condition has been
                    greatly improved of late years. The fort stands in the south of the town,
                    forming a quarter by itself; the groundplan is quadrangular, each of the sides
                    being about 450 yards long. In the interior is the palace of the mahârâjâ, built
                    in an extravagant style of Hindu architecture, and adorned inside with a few
                    paintings by a European artist, the principal object of interest being the
                    throne, which is said to have been presented to Chikka Deva Râj by the emperor
                    Aurangzeb. A new palace has been erected at Bangalore for the young mahârâjâ.
                    Opposite the western gate of the fort is a lofty and handsome building known as
                    the Mohan Mahâl, erected by the late mahârâjâ for the entertainment of the
                    European officers. The houses of the European residents are, for the most part,
                    to the east of the town. The residency was built by Colonel Wilks in the
                    beginning of this century. It has a handsome portico; and a room at the back,
                    added by Sir John Malcolm, is said to be the largest in India. The building now
                    used for the district offices was originally built by Colonel Wellesley (duke of
                    Wellington) for his own occupation. Mysore was the capital of the state up till
                    1831, when on the British occupation the seat of administration was removed to
                    Bangalore. (w. w. H.)</p>
