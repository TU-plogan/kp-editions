                <p><label type="entry">MOUSE</label>. The bright and active, though mischievous,
                    little animal known to us by the name of Mouse and its close relative the Common
                    Rat are the most familiar and also the most typical members of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Murinae,</hi> a subfamily containing about 250 species assignable
                    to no less than 18 distinct genera, all of which, however, are so superficially
                    alike that one or other of the English names rat or mouse would be fairly
                    appropriate to any of them. Together they form one, and that by far the largest
                    and most important, of the 10 sub-families into which the Muridae or Rat family
                    (order <hi rend="italic">Rodentia)</hi> are divisible. Their nearest neighbours
                    are the Tree-mice <hi rend="italic">{Dendromyinae)</hi> and the Hamsters <hi
                    rend="italic">{Cricetinae),</hi> from which they differ by various cranial and
                    dental characters. Among themselves they have for the most part very strong
                    resemblances; nearly all are of very rat-like exterior, of light and active
                    build, with large ears, bright and well-developed eyes, long and scaly tails,
                    and nearly always of dull and inconspicuous coloration, as is suitable to their
                    usually burrowing and nocturnal habits. The more important characteristics of
                    the group, their anatomical, cranial, and dental peculiarities, have already
                    been touched upon in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> (vol. XV. p.
                    415 S5 ’.), and therefore we may now pass to the division of the sub-family into
                    smaller groups.</p>
                <p>Primarily the Murinae are divisible into the Mures, or those with their molar
                    teeth, as in the Common Rat, and the Sigmodontes, or those with their molars,
                    like those of the Rice-rat of America. Fig. 2 will explain this: A represents
                    the upper molars of a Mus, and B the corresponding teeth of a Sigmodont. It will
                    thus be seen that Mus has molars composed essentially of cusps arranged
                    triserially —that is to say, with three series of cusps across each tooth—while
                    in the Sigmodontes the cusps are arranged biserially in pairs along the teeth.
                    To the first of these groups, the Mures, belong the following genera :—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Mus,</hi> I.. Incisors narrow, not grooved. Molars small,
                    their structure as shown in fig. 2, A. Incisive foramina long. Coronoid process
                    of lower jaw well developed. Eyes and ears large. Fur soft, though sometimes
                    mixed with spines; pollex with a short nail instead of a claw. No cheek-pouches.
                    Tail long, nearly naked, with rings of overlapping scales.</p>
                <p>This, the typical genus of the family, is by far the largest of the order, and
                    indeed of the whole class Mammalia, containing not less than 120 species spread
                    over the whole of the O <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> d World with the
                    exception of Madagascar. Of these, about 30 belong to what is known as the
                    Palaearctic zoological region, 40 to the Oriental, 30 to the Ethiopian, and 20
                    to the Australian, the number of species being on the whole much more
                    considerable in tropical than in temperate regions, while but very few are found
                    where the climate is excessively cold. It is an interesting fact in connexion
                    with climate that many of the species living in hot countries have their fur
                    more or less mixed with flattened spines, and that these spines appear to be
                    shed during the winter and to be replaced by hairs, the latter naturally
                    affording a warmer covering for the animal than the former.</p>
                <p>The most important characters that have been used for the determination of the
                    various species of <hi rend="italic">Mus</hi> are the size and proportions of
                    the body, limbs, ears, and tail, the number of mammae, which ranges from 6 to
                    20, and various more or less important differences in the shape and proportions
                    of the skull and teeth. Of the numerous species the following are those most
                    worthy of note :—</p>
                <p>3/us <hi rend="italic">deeumamιs,</hi> Pall., the Common Brown or Norway Rat,
                    distinguished by its large size, brownish grey colour, short tail and ears,
                    powerful skull, and the possession of from 10 to 12 mammae. It is extremely
                    fierce and cunning, and easily overcomes in the struggle for existence all the
                    other allied species with which it comes in contact. Its original home would
                    seem to have been some part of Central Asia, an indigenous species recently
                    described from China, <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >humiliatus,</hi> being in fact so extremely like it that in all probability the
                    latter is the original race from which it has sprung. Thence it has spread to
                    all parts of the world, driving out the house-haunting species everywhere, as it
                    has in England all but exterminated the next species.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Μ. rattus,</hi> I.., the old English Black Rat, readily
                    distinguishable from the Brown Rat by its smaller size, longer ears and tail,
                    and glossy black colour. It shares the roving habits of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">decumanus,</hi> frequenting ships, and from them
                    passing to the land in various parts of the world. On this account it, or its
                    tropical representative <hi rend="italic">Μ. alexandrinus,</hi> Geof., is
                    extremely common in many places to which <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">decumanus</hi> has not yet penetrated, for instance in South
                    America, where it has had only the far less highly-organized Sigmodontes to
                    compete with, and where it has therefore gained a firm footing. It is extremely
                    interesting to observe that this longtailed rat, originally a native of India,
                    would seem to have first penetrated to all parts of the world and to have
                    overcome and nearly or quite exterminated the indigenous rats, and that then <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">decumanus,</hi> a more recent and
                    powerful development of the House-rat type, has followed, and in its turn has
                    overcome and nearly exterminated it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">musculus,</hi> Linn., the Common
                    House-mouse, is, like the last species, originally a native of India, -whence it
                    has spread to all the inhabited parts of the globe. Its habits and appearance
                    are too well known to need any description.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Μ. sylvaticus,</hi> I..,the Wood or Long-tailed Field-mouse,is
                    a species very common in many parts of England, often taking to barns and
                    outhouses for shelter during the winter. It is of about the same size and
                    proportions as <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">musculus,</hi> but of
                    a bright reddish grey colour, with a pure white belly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">minutus,</hi> Pall., the
                    Harvest-mouse, is the smallest of the European mice, seldom exceeding 2⅜ or 3
                    inches in length. It is of a yellowish red colour, with comparatively short ears
                    and tail. It lives entirely away from houses, commonly taking up its abode in
                    wheat or hay fields, where it builds a round grass nest about the size of a
                    cricket-ball, in which it brings up its young.</p>
                <p>These five English species may be taken as types of the 120 species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mus.</hi> None are much larger than <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">decumanus</hi> or smaller than <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">minutus,</hi> and they all have habits generally similar to those
                    of one or other of the English species, although there are some which either
                    live in trees like squirrels, or in the water like the English Water-voles,
                    among which latter is the species shown in fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    fuscipes,</hi> Waterh., the Brown-footed Rat of western and southern
                    Australia.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Nesokia,</hi> like <hi rend="italic">Mτιs,</hi> but with
                    the incisors and molars very much broader, and the transverse laminae of the
                    latter more clearly defined.</p>
                <p>This genus, so closely allied to <hi rend="italic">Mus</hi> as to be barely
                    worthy of separation, contains five or six species of clumsily-built rats spread
                    over southern Asia from Palestine to Formosa, and from Cashmere to Ceylon. The
                    most noteworthy member of the group is the Great Bandicoot or Pig-rat of the
                    continent of India (A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                    >bandicota,</hi> Bechs. ), the largest of all the rat tribe, often considerably
                    exceeding a foot in length. The other species vary in size between this and a
                    brown rat. <hi rend="italic">N. bengalensis,</hi> Gr., the common Field-rat of
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n15/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0015-0006"/> India, has no less than eighteen mammse, nearly
                    the largest number found among the Muridae.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Golunda,</hi> Gray, like <hi rend="italic">Mus,</hi> but
                    with a distinct groove down the front of the upper incisors. There are only two
                    species, one from western India, and the other from eastern Africa.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Uromys,</hi> Peters., differs from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mus</hi> in having the scales of the tail not overlapping, but set edge to
                    edge, so as to form a sort of mosaic work. There are about six species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Uromys,</hi> spread over the northern part of the Australian
                    region from the Aru Islands to Queensland.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Hapalotis,</hi> Licht. Hind-limbs elongated. Incisive
                    foramina very large. No coronoid process to the lower jaw. This genus is
                    confined to Australia, where there are about fifteen species known. They are
                    pretty little animals, with long ears and tail, and in many respects resemble
                    the Jerboas, whose place they seem to take on the sandy Australian deserts.</p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Mastacomys,</hi> Thomas, like <hi rend="italic">Mus,</hi>
                    but with the molars remarkably broadened, and with only four mammae. The single
                    species in the genus is as yet only known from Tasmania, though it has been
                    found fossil in New South Wales; it is somewhat similar in size and general
                    appearance to the English Water-vole, but has much longer and softer fur.</p>
                <p>VII. <hi rend="italic">Acanthomys,</hi> Less. Fur almost entirely composed of
                    flattened spines. Coronoid process very small. There are six species of
                    Spiny-mice known, all of about the size of the Common Mouse. They are found in
                    Syria, Palestine, and eastern Africa as far south as Mozambique.</p>
                <p>VIII. <hi rend="italic">Echinothrix,</hi> Gray, a very remarkable rat with an
                    extremely elongated muzzle, all the bones of the face being much produced. The
                    incisors are faintly grooved. The only species is <hi rend="italic">E.
                    leucura,</hi> an animal of about the size of the Common Bat, with its fur
                    thickly mixed with spines. It is found in Celebes.</p>
                <p>The remaining genera belong to the Sigmodontes; they are rather more numerous
                    than those of the Mures, but, on the whole, present somewhat less strongly
                    marked generic differences.</p>
                <p>IX. <hi rend="italic">Hypogeomys,</hi> Grand., a very peculiar form of large
                    size, with long ears, feet, and tail. There is only one species, <hi
                    rend="italic">H. antimena,</hi> a fawn-coloured rat about 9 inches long.</p>
                <p>X. <hi rend="italic">Nesomys,</hi> Peters., contains two species of long-haired
                    rats, more or less rufous in colour, about the size of the House-rat.</p>
                <p>XI. <hi rend="italic">Brachytarsomys,</hi> Giinther, contains only <hi
                    rend="italic">B. albicauda,</hi> a pretty velvety-haired fawn-coloured rat, with
                    short feet and a long tail.</p>
                <p>XII. <hi rend="italic">Hallomys,</hi> Jent. The only species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >H. audeberti,</hi> is very like a <hi rend="italic">Nesomys,</hi> but has much
                    longer hind-feet. This and the last three genera are confined to Madagascar.</p>
                <p>XIII. <hi rend="italic">Hesperomys,</hi> Waterh. Molar structure as shown in fig.
                    2, B. The <hi rend="italic">Mus</hi> of the New World, containing the great mass
                    of the rats and mice of America, and having no very special generic characters
                    common to all its members. This large genus is composed of at least seventy
                    distinct species spread over all America from Canada to Cape Horn, of which none
                    are quite as large as <hi rend="italic">Mus decumanus,</hi> while several are
                    considerably smaller than <hi rend="italic">Mus musculus.</hi> They have been
                    split up into ten sub-genera, of which perhaps the best marked is <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhipidomys,</hi> a small group containing about ten species,
                    remarkably like Dormice in their habits and general appearance, having soft
                    woolly fur and long hairy tails, and living entirely in trees, bushes, or in the
                    roofs of houses. The other <hi rend="italic">Hesperomys</hi> are all terrestrial
                    in their habits, much as the Old-World rats and mice are. One only, <hi
                    rend="italic">H spinosus,</hi> a native of Peru, has as yet been found with
                    spines in its fur,—a rather remarkable circumstance when we remember how many of
                    the tropical species of the allied genus <hi rend="italic">Mus</hi> have more or
                    less spiny fur.</p>
                <p>XIV. <hi rend="italic">Holocheilus,</hi> Brandt, like <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hesperomys,</hi> but with the third upper molars proportionately larger and the
                    skull more stoutly built. This genus, confined to Brazil, contains about six
                    species, some of which are the largest indigenous rats of America. Two species
                    are aquatic in their habits, and have therefore developed short webs between the
                    toes of their hind-feet.</p>
                <p>XV. <hi rend="italic">Sigmod&lt;m,</hi> Say and Ord, differs from <hi
                    rend="italic">Hesperomys</hi> in the pattern of the molar teeth. It contains one
                    species only, the Ricerat, <hi rend="italic">S.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >hispidus,</hi> which ranges from the United States to Ecuador.</p>
                <p>XVI. and XVII. <hi rend="italic">Reithrodon,</hi> Waterh., and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ochetodon,</hi> Cones., more or less like <hi rend="italic">Hesperomys,</hi>
                    but with grooved upper incisors. The first of these is a South-American genus,
                    and contains four rat-like species, one from Venezuela and the other three from
                    Patagonia. The second consists of three North American mice, of about the size
                    and proportions of the English Wood-mouse, <hi rend="italic">Mus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">syl·vaticus.</hi></p>
                <p>XVIII. <hi rend="italic">Neotoma,</hi> Say and Ord, a peculiar North - American
                    group, in which the teeth have the prismatic appearance of those <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Arvicolae</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Vole).</hi> There are four species known as “Wood-rats,” all of
                    about the size of <hi rend="italic">Mus decumanus,</hi> one of them, <hi
                    rend="italic">N.</hi><hi rend="italic">cinerea,</hi> having a tail almost as
                    bushy as a Squirrel’s; the other three with ordinary scaly rat-like tails.</p>
                <p>From the ranges of the genera given above it will be seen that all the first
                    group, the Mures, are confined to the Old World, and that of the Sigmodontes
                    four genera are found in Madagascar and the rest in America, thus giving us a
                    very remarkable instance of the peculiar affinity that the fauna of Madagascar
                    has with that of the New World. This affinity is usually explained by the fact
                    that those animals which show it belong as a rule to groups formerly distributed
                    over both the Old and New Worlds, and that since the isolation of Madagascar
                    these, owing to the competition of more highly-organized forms, have been
                    exterminated or strongly modified throughout the continents of the eastern
                    hemisphere, while in the western they have been preserved to the present time.
                    Thus in the present case it seems probable that the original ancestors of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Murinae,</hi> if not indeed of the whole family Muridae, were
                    Sigmodontes having molars with their cusps biserially arranged,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The teeth of the extinct
                    genus Cricetodon from the Miocene of France and Germany are in their essential
                    structure quite similar to those of Hesperomys.</p></note> and that these, being
                    less powerful in the struggle for existence, as is shown by the manner in which
                    roving members of the Mures rapidly multiply at the expense of the indigenous
                    Sigmodontes of any place they may be introduced into, have gradually succumbed
                    to the more recently developed Mures wherever the latter were able to
                    penetrate,—Madagascar having previously become an island, and therefore
                    inaccessible to them. Other groups, however, also probably descendants of
                    Sigmodont Muridae, have become so strongly modified either as to structure or
                    habits as to have been able to avoid the rivalry of the Mures, and thus to exist
                    side by side with the latter; such probably are the Hamsters <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Cricetus)</hi> and the Voles <hi rend="italic">{Arvicola),</hi> both of which
                    have modifications of the biserial arrangement of the molars. As to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Murines</hi> from Australia—a region isolated from the rest of the
                    world far earlier than Madagascar—with their very various degrees of
                    specialization, it seems probable, as Mr Wallace has suggested,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Australasia,</hi> p. 53, 1879.</p></note> that from very early times individual
                    rats and mice have drifted on floating trees and other objects from island to
                    island along the Indian archipelago down to Australia, and that the descendants
                    of the earliest arrivals have become the most modified, and that others have
                    been continually joining them, until we get the present state of affairs,
                    namely, one or two genera very markedly different from Mus, others but slightly
                    different, and finally numerous species not generically separable from the
                    European and Asiatic rats and mice. (o. τ.)</p>
