                <p>The town is built upon one broad main canal, where the tidal current runs with
                    great force, and upon several smaller ones. The cathedral, S. Donato, is a fine
                    basilica, probably of the 11th century. The pavement is as richly inlaid as that
                    of St Mark’s, and the mosaics of the tribune are remarkable. The exterior of the
                    tribune is very beautiful, and has been successfully restored. The 15th-century
                    church of St Peter the Martyr contains a fine picture by Gentile Bellini. Murano
                    has from ancient times been celebrated for its glass manufactories. When and how
                    the art was introduced is wrapped in great obscurity, but there are notices of
                    it as early as the 11th century; and in 1250 Cristoforo Briani, encouraged by
                    the accounts of the gems of Guinea which the traveller Marco Polo brought to
                    Venice, attempted the imitation of agate and chalcedony. From the labours of his
                    pupil Miotto sprang the whole of that branch of the glass trade which is
                    concerned with the imitation of gems. In the 15th century the first crystals
                    were made, and in the 17th the various gradations of coloured and iridescent
                    glass were invented, together with the composition called “aventurine”; the
                    manufacture of .beads is now a main branch of the trade. The art of the
                    glass-workers was taken under the protection of the Government in 1275, and
                    regulated by a special code of laws and privileges; two fairs were held
                    annually, and the export of all materials, such as alum and sand, which enter
                    into the composition of glass was absolutely forbidden. With the decay of Venice
                    the importance of the Murano glass-works declined; but at the present time there
                    are signs of renewed activity. As many as eight firms, employing 2500 hands, are
                    engaged in the trade,—the most renowned being “The Venezia Murano Company” and
                    Salviati. The municipal museum contains a collection of glass illustrating the
                    history and progress of the art.</p>
                <p>The island of Murano was first peopled by the inhabitants of Altino, when they
                    fled before their barbarian invaders. It originally enjoyed independence under
                    the rule of its tribunes and judges, and was one of the twelve confederate
                    islands of the lagoons. In the 12th century the doge Vital Micheli II.
                    incorporated Murano in Venice and attached it to the Sestiere of S. Croce. From
                    that date it was governed by a Venetian nobleman with the title of podestà,
                    whose office lasted sixteen months. Murano, however, still retained its original
                    constitution of a greater and a lesser council for the transaction of municipal
                    business, and also the right to coin gold and silver, as well as its judicial
                    powers civil and criminal. The interests of the town were watched at the ducal
                    palace by a nuncio and a solicitor; and this constitution remained in force till
                    the fall of the republic.</p>
