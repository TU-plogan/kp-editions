                <p><label type="entry">ATTWOOD, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, musical
                    composer, was born in London in 1767. As one of the boy choristers in the chapel
                    royal he received his early instruction in music from Nares and Ayrton. In 1783
                    he was sent to study abroad at the expense of the Prince of Wales, who had been
                    favourably impressed by his skill as a performer on the harpsichord. After
                    spending two years at Naples, Attwood proceeded to Vienna, where he became a
                    favourite pupil of Mozart. On his return to London he held for a short time an
                    appointment as one of the chamber musicians to the prince of Wales. In 1795 he
                    was chosen organist of St Paul’s, and in the following year he succeeded Dr
                    Dupuis as composer to the chapels royal. His court connection was further
                    confirmed by his appointment as musical instructor to the duchess of York and
                    afterwards to the princess of Wales. For the coronation of George IV. he
                    composed the anthem, <hi rend="italic">The King shall Rejoice,</hi> a work of
                    high merit. The king, who had neglected him for some years on account of bis
                    connection with the princess of Wales, now restored him to favour, and in 1821
                    appointed him organist to his private chapel at Brighton. Soon after the
                    institution of the Royal Academy of Music, Attwood was chosen one of the
                    professors. He wrote the anthem, <hi rend="italic">0 Lord, grant the King a Long
                        Life,</hi> which was performed at the coronation of William IV., and he was
                    composing a similar work for the coronation of Queen Victoria when he died
                    (March 24, 1838). Attwood’s compositions are favourable specimens of the English
                    school. His services and anthems were published in a collected form after his
                    death by his pupil Walmesley, and are frequently used in cathedral worship. Of
                    his secular compositions several songs and glees are well known and popular. The
                    opera3 which he composed in early life are now almost forgotten, belonging, as
                    they do, to a period when English music was at its lowest ebb.</p>
