                <p><label type="entry">ATLANTIC OCEAN</label></p>
                <p>ΊΊΞΕ designation Atlantic Ocean, originally given to the sea that lies beyond the
                    great range of Atlas in North-western Africa, has come to be applied, with the
                    extension of geographical knowledge, to the whole of that vast ocean which
                    occupies the wide and deep trough that separates the New from the Old World. Its
                    limits are variously defined; some geographers regarding it as extending from
                    pole to pole, whilst others consider it as bounded at its northern and southern
                    extremities by the Arctic and Antarctic circles respectively. As the peculiarity
                    of the physical conditions of the Polar Seas renders it on every account more
                    appropriate to describe them under a separate head <hi rend="smallcaps">(Polar
                    Regions),</hi> the Atlantic will be here treated as bounded at the north by the
                    Arctic circle, which nearly corresponds with the natural closing-in of its basin
                    by the approach of the coasts of Norway and Greenland with Iceland lying between
                    them; while at the south, where the basin is at its widest, its only boundary is
                    the Ant-arctic circle. The line which separates its southern extension from the
                    Indian Ocean may be considered to be the meridian of Cape Agulhas, the
                    southernmost point of the African continent; whilst the boundary between the
                    South Atlantic and South Pacific would be formed in like manner by the meridian
                    of Cape Horn. Although the Baltic and the Mediterranean are commonly regarded as
                    appendages to the Atlantic, yet their physical conditions are so peculiar as to
                    require separate treatment. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Baltic</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mediterranean.)</hi></p>
                <p>Every physical geographer who has written upon the Atlantic has noticed the
                    curious parallelism between its eastern and its western borders,—their salient
                    and retiring angles corresponding very closely to each other. Thus, beginning at
                    the north we see that the projection formed by the British Islands (which
                    extends much further westwards at 100 fathoms below the surface than it does
                    above the sea-level), answers to the wide entrance to Baffin’s Bay; <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n27/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0027-0016"/> whilst, on the other hand, the projection of the
                    American coast at Newfoundland answers to the Bay of Biscay. Further south, the
                    great rounded prominence of Northern Africa corresponds with the vast bay that
                    stretches from Nova Scotia to St Thomas; whilst the angular projection of South
                    America towards the east corresponds with that receding portion of the
                    mic-African coast-line which is known as the Gulf of Guinea.</p>
                <p>This correspondence suggested to Humboldt the idea that the Atlantic basin was
                    originally excavated by a very violent rush of water from the south, which,
                    being repulsed by the mountain ranges of Brazil, was directed by them towards
                    the coast of Africa, and formed the Gulf of Guinea; being there checked and
                    turned to the west by the mountains of Upper Guinea, the stream excavated the
                    Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico; and issuing thence, it ran between the
                    mountains of North America and Western Europe, until it gradually diminished in
                    velocity and force, and at length subsided. Another writer speaks of the basin
                    of the Atlantic as an immense rift, made by some terrible force, which rent the
                    surface-land asunder, but left the edges of th© ravine to show by their form
                    that they had once been connected. For neither of these speculations, however,
                    is there the smallest foundation in fact. What has to be accounted for, indeed,
                    in regard to either of the great areas at present covered by water, is not so
                    much the excavation of its sea-bed, as its segregation from an ocean originally
                    universal by the boundaries that now enclose it; in other words, not so much the
                    depression of the bottom of its basin as the elevation of its sides. Not only is
                    the proportion of the land-surface of the globe to its watersurface scarcely
                    more than one-third (being as 1 to 278), but the entire mass of the land which
                    thus covers little more than one-fourth of the surface of the globe is quite
                    insignificant in comparison with that of the water which covers the remaining
                    three-fourths. For whilst the average elevation of the whole land is certainly
                    less than one-fifth of a mile, giving from 9 to 10 millions of cubic miles as
                    the total mass of land that rises above the sea-level, the average depth of the
                    sea (so far as at present known) may be taken at about 2 miles, giving a total
                    of nearly 290 millions of cubic miles of water, which is therefore about <hi
                    rend="italic">thirty times</hi> the mass of the land. From the computation of
                    Keith Johnston, it appears that, “if we conceive an equalising line, which,
                    passing around the globe, would leave a mass of the earth’s crust above it, just
                    sufficient to fill up the hollow which would be left below it, this line would
                    then fall nearly a mile below the present level of the sea.” This is tantamount
                    to saying that, if the solid crust of the earth could be conceived to be
                    smoothed down to one uniform level, its entire surface would be covered with
                    water to the depth of about a mile. Hence it is obvious that as the elevation of
                    that crust into land over certain areas must be accompanied by a corresponding
                    depression of the sea-bed over other areas, such depression, augmenting in those
                    areas the previous depth of the aqueous covering of the globe, would be quite
                    sufficient to account for the existence of the great oceanic basins, without any
                    excavating action. And a confirmation of this view is found in the fact,
                    ascertained by recent soundings, that the deepest local depressi ans of the
                    sea-bed are met with in the neighbourhood of islands that have been raised by
                    volcanic agency. Further, as the quantity of solid matter that must have been
                    removed (on Humboldt’s hypothesis) in the excavation of the Atlantic valley must
                    have been nearly four times as great as that which forms the whole known land of
                    the globe, and as it is impossible to conceive of any mode in which such a mass
                    can have been disposed of, we may dismiss that hypothesis as not only untenable
                    in regard to the zïtlantic basin, but as equally inapplicable to any other
                    valley of similar w idth and depth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The case of such a shallow trough as that of the English
                    Channel, of the former continuity of whose sides there is ample evidence, whilst
                    its bottom is nowhere 500 feet beneath the surface, is obviously altogether
                    different. The extraordinary depth of the Mediterranean basin, on the other
                    hand, affords strong reason for regarding it as, like the Atlantic, a portion of
                    the original area of depression, cir zumscribed by the elevation of its
                    borders.</p></note></p>
                <p>The general direction of geological opinion, indeed, has of late been, on
                    physical grounds, towards the high antiquity of the great oceanic basins, not
                    exactly as at present bounded, but as areas of depression having the same
                    relation as they have now to the areas of elevation which form the great
                    continents. Thus Sir Charles Lyell was strongly impressed by the fact that the
                    mean depth of the sea is not improbably fifteen times as great as the mean
                    height of the land; and that depressions of the sea-bottom to a depth of three
                    miles or more extend over wide areas, whilst elevations of the land to similar
                    height are confined to a few peaks and narrow ridges. Hence, he remarked, “while
                    the effect of vertical movements equalling 1000 feet in both directions, upward
                    and downward, is to cause a vast transposition of land and sea in those areas
                    which are now continental, and adjoining to which there is much sea not
                    exceeding 1000 feet in depth, movements of equal amount would have no tendency
                    to produce a sensible alteration in the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans, or to cause
                    the oceanic and continental areas to change places. Depressions of 1000 feet
                    would submerge large areas of the existing land; but fifteen times as much
                    movement would be required to convert such land into an ocean of average depth,
                    or to cause an ocean three miles deep to replace any one of the existing
                    continents.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    And Professor Dana, who, more than any other geologist, has studied the
                    structure of the existing continents and the succession of changes concerned in
                    their elevation, has been led, by the consideration of the probable direction of
                    the forces by which that elevation was effected, to conclude that the defining
                    of the present continental and oceanic areas began with the commencement of the
                    solidification of the earth’s crust. “The continental areas are the areas of
                    least contraction, and the oceanic basins those of the greatest, the former
                    having earliest had a solid crust. After the continental part was thus
                    stiffened, and rendered comparatively unyielding, the oceanic part went on
                    cooling, solidifying, and contracting throughout; consequently, it became
                    depressed, with the sides of the depression somewhat abrupt. The formation of
                    the oceanic basins and continental areas was thus due to ‘ unequal radial
                    contraction.’” In the opinion of Professor Dana, there has never been any
                    essential change in the relations of these great features. “It is hardly
                    possible,” he says, “to conceive of any conditions of the contracting forces
                    that should have allowed of the continents and oceans in after time changing
                    places, or of oceans, as deep nearly as existing oceans, being made where are
                    now the continental areas; although it is a necessary incident to the system of
                    things that the continental plateaus should have varied greatly in their outline
                    and outer limits, and perhaps thousands of feet in the depths of some portions
                    of the overlying seas, and also that the oceans should have varied in the extent
                    of their lands.” . . . “The early defining, even in Archaean times, of the final
                    features of North America, and the conformity to one system visibly marked out
                    in every event through the whole history—in the positions of its outlines and
                    the formations of its rocks, in the character of its oscillations, and the
                    courses of the mountains from time to time raised—sustain the statement that the
                    American continent is a regular growth. The same facts also make it evident that
                    the oceanic areas between which the continent <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n28/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0028-0017"/> lies have been chief among the regions of the
                    earth’s crust that have used the pent-up force in the contracting sphere to
                    carry forward the continental developments. If this was true of the North
                    American continent, the same in principle was law for all continents.” <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">Dimensions of the Atlantic.—</hi>
                    The length of the Atlantic basin, considered as extending from the Arctic to the
                    Antarctic circle, is nearly 8000 geographical miles. The nearest approach of its
                    boundaries is between Greenland and Norway, whose coasts are only about 800
                    miles apart. They thence recede from each other towards the south, as far as the
                    parallel of 30° N. lat., where, between the peninsula of Florida and the western
                    coast of Marocco, there is an interval of 70° of longitude, or about 3600
                    geographical miles. The channel then rapidly narrows as it passes southward, so
                    that between Cape St Roque in Brazil (o <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> S. lat.)
                    and the coast of Sierra Leone (between 5° and 8° N. lat.) the African and
                    American continents approach within 1500 miles of each other. The sudden
                    eastward recession of the African coast as it approaches the equator, and the
                    westward trend of the South American coast-line between Cape St Roque and Cape
                    Horn, widen out the South Atlantic basin to the same breadth as that of the
                    North Atlantic in the parallel of 30° N.,—the interval between the Cape of Good
                    Hope and the estuary of La Plata, in the parallel of 35° S., being no less than
                    73∣∙ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> of longitude, or about 3600 geographical
                    miles.</p>
                <p>The depth of the North Atlantic has been more carefully and systematically
                    examined than that of any other oceanic basin; and the general contours of its
                    undulating sea-bed may now be regarded as pretty well determined. Putting aside
                    the older soundings as utterly untrustworthy, and accepting only those taken by
                    the modern methods, whose reliability has been amply tested by the accordance of
                    diversified experiences, we can now assert with confidence that scarcely any
                    portion of its floor has a depth exceeding 3000 fathoms, or about 34 miles, the
                    greatest depth determined by the recent “Challenger” soundings, which was that
                    of a limited depression about a hundred miles to the north of St Thomas, having
                    been 3875 fathoms, or about 44 miles. Except in the neighbourhood of its
                    coast-lines, and in certain shallower areas to be presently specified, the floor
                    of the basin at its widest part seems to lie at a depth of from 2000 to 3000
                    fathoms, its slopes being extremely gradual. The central portion of the
                    principal basin of the North Atlantic, however, is occupied by a plateau of
                    irregular shape, of which a considerable part lies at a less depth than 2000
                    fathoms. Of this plateau the Azores may be regarded as the culmination; and that
                    group being taken as its centre, it may be said to extend to the north as far as
                    lat. 50°, and to the south-west as far as the tropic of Cancer. The northern
                    extension of this plateau narrows out into a sort of isthmus, which connects it
                    with the plateau that occupies a great part of the Atlantic basin to the north
                    of 50° N. lat.; and it is across this isthmus, and along the bottom of the deep
                    narrow valley on either side of it, that the telegraph cables are laid between
                    Ireland and Newfoundland. Whether its south-western prolongation, known as the
                    “Dolphin Rise” (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">infra)</hi> extends to the equator, so
                    as to become continuous with the elevated area which culminates in St Paul’s
                    rocks, and by a further southward extension becomes continuous either with the
                    volcanic elevation of St Helena and Ascension Island, or with the elevation in
                    the middle of the South Atlantic which culminates in the island of Tristan da
                    Cunha (fig. 2), has not yet been ascertained. According to the view already
                    suggested as to the formation of the Atlantic basin, the plateau might be
                    regarded as representing the original sea-bed (from which the Azores have been
                    lifted up by volcanic action), whilst the deep valleys on either side of it are
                    “areas of subsidence” answering to the “areas of elevation” of the land that
                    borders them.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, the depths of these valleys increase pretty rapidly with the
                    distance from the shore-line, so that the contour-lines of one and two miles
                    follow the shore-lines pretty closely. But there are two localities in which
                    shallow water extends to a much greater distance from land than it appears to do
                    elsewhere. One of these lies in the neighbourhood of the British Isles. For a
                    distance of about 230 miles to the westward of Ireland there is a slope of only
                    about 6 feet in a mile; but in the next 20 miles there is a fall of 9000 feet,
                    after which there is little change of level for 1200 miles. Hence as the depth
                    of the sea immediately surrounding the British Isles is nowhere 100 fathoms (so
                    that an elevation of their whole area to that amount would unite these islands
                    not only to each other but also to the continent of Europe), it is obvious that
                    the platform on which they rest is really, although now submerged, a part of the
                    land-mass of Europe. Another of these extensive shallows is that of which the
                    Banks of Newfoundland form the highest part; and of the existence of this a
                    probable explanation may be found in the accumulation of the rock-masses that
                    are brought down by icebergs every summer from the coasts of Greenland and
                    Labrador. For it is now generally admitted that these icebergs are really parts
                    of glaciers, that were originally formed on the mountain-slopes of Greenland and
                    Labrador, and then descended valleys which open out on their coasts, so as, on
                    arriving at the mouths of these valleys, to detach themselves and float away,
                    being borne southwards by the Polar Current to be presently described. Most
                    Arctic icebergs of which a near view can be obtained, are observed to have upon
                    them a considerable number of pieces of rock, sometimes of a very considerable
                    size; and these are of course deposited on the sea-bed when the icebergs melt
                    (which they usually do on the borders of the Gulf Stream), thus forming a vast
                    conglomerate bed, to which parallels are not improbably to be found in various
                    geological epochs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geological Age of the Atlantic Basin.·</hi> —Guided by the
                    principle that great oceanic basins are to be considered rather as original
                    marine areas that have been limited by the elevation of their boundaries, than
                    as having been formed by the excavation of terrestrial areas, we have to inquire
                    what evidence there is that the basin of the Atlantic has undergone any
                    considerable change within a comparatively recent period.</p>
                <p>As has been pointed out by Prof. Wyville Thomson <hi rend="italic">{Depths of the
                    Sea,</hi> p. 473), it is difficult to show that any oscillations have occurred
                    in the north of Europe since the termination of the Secondary period, to a
                    greater extent than from 4000 to 5000 feet,—this being the extreme vertical
                    depth between the base of the Tertiaries and the highest point at which Tertiary
                    or post-Tertiary shells are found on the slopes and ridges of mountains. Such
                    oscillations, while considerably modifying the boundaries of the Atlantic, would
                    not seriously affect the condition of the deeper parts of its sea-bed j and
                    hence it may be concluded that the two deep valleys, one on the European side of
                    the modern volcanic platform of the Azores, and the other on the American, each
                    having a width of 600 or 700 miles, and an average depth of 15,000 feet, could
                    neither have been formed by such oscillations, nor could, when once formed, have
                    been converted into dry land. It will be presently shown that this idea of the
                    existence of an Atlantic basin corresponding generally to that now existing, as
                    far back as the later Secondary period, is strongly supported by the evidence

                <p>Important information as to the changes which the seabed of the Atlantic has
                    undergone within the later geological periods, may be gathered from the
                    structure of the islands which lift themselves above its surface. Along its
                    eastern border, at no considerable distance from the coast of North Africa,
                    there are three principal groups,—the Madeiras, Canaries, and Cape Verd,-all of
                    which have an evidently volcanic origin, and rise up from the eastern slope of
                    the basin, where it is progressively shallowing towards its continental
                    shore-line. Further out, in midocean, lies the group of the Azores, which also
                    is volcanic, and rises from the plateau already spoken of; but between this area
                    and the slope from which the Madeiras and Canaries are based is a very deep
                    channel, ranging downwards to at least 15,000 feet; and a like depth is also
                    found between the Azores and the coast of Portugal. The structure of all these
                    groups of islands gives obvious indications of their formation by separate
                    igneous eruptions in a sea of great depth; and the earliest of these eruptions
                    seems to have taken place in the later Miocene period. As soon as the first
                    solid lavas raised their heads above water, and were thus exposed to the action
                    of the waves, fragments were detached and rounded on the shore; and these being
                    swept off, with the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> resulting from their
                    attrition, formed deposits of various kinds upon the slope of the cone, in which
                    corals, shells, &lt;tc., were embedded. These fossiliferous deposits have been
                    subsequently elevated to heights of from 1500 to 2000 feet above the level of
                    the sea, showing a rise of the base of the craters; progressive additions have
                    been made to their upper part by the piling up of basaltic and trachytic
                    lavas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Sir C.

                    activity still continues is proved by the fact that in 1811 a new island was
                    temporarily formed in the Azores group, off St Michael, by the throwing-up of
                    ashes, and the formation of a cone about 300 feet high, with a crater in the
                    centre. This island, to which the name Sabrina was given, was soon washed away
                    by the waves. And only a few years since, another submarine eruption in this
                    neighbourhood was indicated by earthquakes, jets of steam and columns of smoke,
                    and floating masses of scoriae. All these considerations concur (as Sir Charles
                    Lyell, <hi rend="italic">loc.</hi><hi rend="italic">cit.,</hi> justly urges) to
                    negative on geological grounds the hypothesis which has been advocated by some
                    eminent naturalists, that the Azores, Madeiras, and Canaries are the last
                    remaining fragments of a continuous area of land which once connected them with
                    the west of Europe and North Africa.</p>
                <p>Proceeding to the south of the equator, we meet with similar evidence of volcanic
                    activity in the structure of the only two islands, Ascension and St Helena,
                    which lie near the line stretching from the Cape Verd group to the Cape of Good
                    Hope; and these also arise from a plateau of considerably less depth than the
                    circumjacent area whose eastern slope gradually shallows to the coast of South
                    Africa. This plateau stretches in a north-westerly direction towards the
                    equator, so as to meet it in from 20° to 22° W. long.; and here indications of
                    volcanic activity — earthquakes, troubled water, floating scoriae, and columns
                    of smoke— have been several times observed since the middle of the last century,
                    betokening the probable formation of an island or an archipelago in that
                    locality.</p>
                <p>Nearly midway between the southern prolongations of the African and American
                    continents, the solitary peak of Tristan da Cunha (fig. 2) lifts itself above
                    the ocean; this also is volcanic, and seems to rise from a broad base of general
                    elevation, resembling the plateau of the North Atlantic.</p>
                <p>The entire chain of the Greater and Lesser Antilles, which stretches from the
                    delta of the Orinoco to the peninsula of Florida, and forms the eastern boundary
                    of the Caribbean Sea, seems to have been in like manner elevated by volcanic
                    action. That this elevation, like that of the groups of islands on the eastern
                    side of the Atlantic, took place for the most part during the later Tertiary
                    period, is shown by the occurrence of shells, corals, &lt;fcc., of upper Miocene
                    age, in the upraised sedimentary beds of several of the islands; while the
                    presence of “fringing reefs” of coral around the shores of many of the West
                    India islands is an indication that they lie in an area in which elevation is
                    still proceeding. The channels by which they are separated are so deep as to
                    render it very unlikely that there was ever a continuity of land between them;
                    and the occasional recurrence of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions at different
                    points of this “line of fire,” shows that the plutonic action by which the
                    islands were raised is still going on beneath.</p>
                <p>The case is very different, however, in regard to the Bermuda group, which
                    constitutes a singular exception to the general fact of the absence in the
                    Atlantic of those coral islands that are so numerous in the Pacific. This group
                    consists of about 300 islands, of which, however, only five arc of any
                    considerable size; and these rise from a shoal or platform of about 23 miles
                    long by 13 miles broad, the channels between the islands being very shallow,
                    while at a small distance from the edge of the shoal, the bottom rapidly deepens
                    to 15,000 feet. The islands are entirely composed of upraised beds of coral,
                    shells, &amp;c. (the highest elevation being only about 180 feet above the
                    sea-level); and the shoal itself appears to have the like structure throughout,
                    no traces of any other rock than a limestone formed by the metamorphoses of
                    coral being anywhere met with. Hence, as this insular platform proves to be the
                    summit of a submarine column of 15,000 feet high, rising from a very small base,
                    and as nothing we know of the structure of mountains—volcanic or other— would
                    justify us in supposing that a column of such a height could be formed in any
                    other way than by coral growth, the structure of the Bermuda group would seem to
                    indicate a progressive subsidence of the bed of this part of the Atlantic during
                    its formation, corresponding to that which (according to the well-known views of
                    Mr Darwin) is at present in progress over a large area of the Pacific. It is
                    probable that this coral growth was determined in the first instance by the
                    existence of a submarine mountain, of which the summit lay near the surface, or
                    lifted itself above it; that as soon as this came to be submerged, the coral
                    formation commenced; and that by its continued growth at the summit, at a rate
                    equal to that of the subsidence of its base, the platform has been kept up to
                    the sea-level. The slight elevation which has raised its highest portion above
                    that level may not improbably have taken place in connection with the much
                    larger recent elevations already referred to.</p>
                <p>Thus, then, we have evidence of considerable recent local modifications in the
                    level of the Atlantic sea-bed, without any such change as would affect its
                    general character as an ocean basin; while all geological probability seems in
                    favour of the remoteness of the principal depression of the Atlantic area, even
                    if we do. not regard it a9 dating back to the period when the surface of the
                    globe was first undergoing solidification.</p>

                    rend="italic">vis a tergo</hi> of a drift-current is called a “stream-current.”
                    But there is another source of currentmovement, which has been overlooked by
                    most writers on this subject, namely, the indraught which necessarily takes
                    place to keep up the level of any area from which the surface-water is
                    constantly being drifted away. Such currents, which may be designated as
                    “indraught” or “supply currents,” complete the “horizontal circulation” that
                    must necessarily take place in any oceanic area of which one part is subjected
                    to the action of a wind almost constantly blowing in the same direction. Of such
                    a.circulation we have a very characteristic example in the South Atlantic, the
                    principal currents of which we shall see to be very easily accounted for.</p>
                <p>The initial movement of the current-system, alike of the North and of the South
                    Atlantic, is given by the tradewinds, which are continually driving the water of
                    the inter-tropical region from the African towards the American side of the
                    basin, so as to produce what is known as the <hi rend="italic">Equatorial
                    Current.</hi> The position of the northern and southern boundaries of this
                    current shifts, like the area of the tradewinds, in accordance with the
                    northward and southward declination of the sun;—a steady westward drift being
                    generally met with to the north of the tropic of Cancer in the summer of the
                    northern hemisphere, and to the south of the tropic of Capricorn in the summer
                    of the southern, whilst in the winter of each hemisphere the border of the drift
                    lies within the tropic of that hemisphere. But as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >thermal</hi> equator lies from two to three degrees to the north of the <hi
                    rend="italic">geographical</hi> equator, the entire zone of the tradewinds, and
                    of the Equatorial Current propelled by them, is wider on the northern than on
                    the southern side of the latter; and while the northerly trade often reaches 30°
                    N. in July, and rarely extends south in January within 2 <hi rend="superscript">
                    β</hi> or 3° of the geographical equator, the southerly trade does not extend
                    farther than 25° S. in January, and generally crosses the equator in July, even
                    extending occasionally as far as 5° N. As between the northerly and southerly
                    trades there is a region of “equatorial calms,” so there is a corresponding
                    interval between the northern and southern divisions of the Equatorial Current;
                    and in this interval there is a counter-current (resembling the “back-water”
                    often to be noticed in a stream that is flowing rapidly past some obstacle, such
                    as a vessel at anchor, or a projecting angle of a river-bank), that runs
                    eastwards, sometimes with considerable velocity, towards the Bight of Biafra,
                    which may be considered the “head-water” of the Equatorial Current. From the
                    recent observations of Capt. Nares in the “Challenger,” it appears that the
                    Equatorial Current, like other drift-currents, is very shallow, its depth being
                    not much greater than 50 fathoms. He estimates its rate at the surface to be
                    about 0 ’ 75 miles per hour, or 18 miles per day, whilst at 50 fathoms it only
                    moves at about half that rate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Mr Laughton, however, states the average velocity to be

                    hereafter shown, being kept down by the continual rising of polar water from
                    below.</p>
                <p>The Equatorial Current passes directly across the Atlantic towards the chain of
                    the Antilles and the coast of South America; and as not only the whole of the
                    northern division, but a considerable part of the southern, strikes the American
                    roast-line to the north of the salient angle of Cape St Roque (about 5° S.
                    lat.), the portion of the current which is deflected into the northern
                    hemisphere is much greater than that which is turned to the southward. It is a
                    general fact, that where a current encounters any partial obstruction,—such as a
                    coast-line meeting it obliquely, a narrowing of its channel, the lateral
                    pressure of another current, or even that of a mass of stationary water.—its
                    velocity increases; and so the portion of the Equatorial Current that is pressed
                    to the northward by the coast-line between Cape St Roque and the mouth of the
                    Orinoco (known in the first part of its course as the <hi rend="italic">Cape St
                    Roque Current,</hi> and afterwards as the <hi rend="italic">Guiana Current)</hi>
                    acquires a greatly augmented rate, running ordinarily at the rate of from 30 to
                    50 miles, and occasionally at a rate of 80 miles, in the 24 hours. Entering the
                    Caribbean Sea, it is reinforced by the portion of the Equatorial Current which
                    flow’s in between the Lesser Antilles; and it then passes westwards along the
                    northern coast of South America, until it is deflected northwards by the
                    coast-line of Central America, and driven betw een the peninsula of Yucatan and
                    the western extremity of Cuba into the Gulf of Mexico, at the rate of from 30 to
                    60 miles per day. A por tion of it passes direct to the N.E. along the northern
                    shore of Cuba; but by far the larger part sweeps round the gulf, following the
                    course of its coast-line, and approaches the coast of Cuba from the N.W. as a
                    broad deep stream of no great velocity, seldom running at more than 30 miles per
                    day. The reunited current, being met by the Equatorial Current from the outside,
                    which is pressing to the w est along the north coast of Cuba and between the
                    Bahama isles, is deflected northwards through the passage termed the Florida
                    Channel, which is bounded on the one side by the southern extremity of the
                    peninsula of Florida, and on the other by the coast of Cuba and the Bahamas. The
                    rate of movement of the powerful current that flows through this channel,
                    henceforth known as the <hi rend="italic">Gulf Stream,</hi> is considerably
                    augmented in its narrowest part, which is also its shallowest; but although its
                    velocity sometimes reaches 4 (nautical) miles per hour, or even more, its <hi
                    rend="italic">average</hi> rate through the whole year may be confidently stated
                    at not more than 2 miles per hour, or 48 miles per day.<note anchored="true"

                    that, for six months of the year, the monthly mean averages only 1 <hi

                <p>The Gulf Stream current, however, does not by any means occupy the whole of the
                    sectional area of the Florida Channel; for it is separated from the American
                    coast by a band of cold water, which occupies about three-eighths of its total
                    breadth of 40 miles, and w hich also dipβ under the outflowing current. The
                    movement of the cold superficial band is perceptibly inw ards, and that of the
                    cold understratum is presumably so; and it is the opinion of the American
                    surveyors that the depth of the warm outward current is not more than one-third
                    of that of the channel through which it flow’s. It is probable that the rate of
                    movement decreases from the surface downwards; but upon this point we have as
                    yet no certain information. The meaning of the cold inflow will hereafter become
                    apparent.</p>
                <p>The course taken by the Gulf Stream in the first instance is nearly parallel to
                    the line of the United States coast, from which it iβ everywhere separated by a
                    band of cold water,—the boundary line between the two being so distinct as to be
                    known as the “cold wall.” It does not show for some time any great disposition
                    to spread itself out laterally, though a division into alternate bands of warmer
                    and colder w ater, the cause of which seems to lie in the contour of the bottom
                    of the Florida Channel, becomes perceptible before it reaches Charleston, and is
                    very marked off Cape Hatteras. The Stream there presents the form of a fan, its
                    three warm bands spreading out over the Atlantic surface to an aggregate breadth
                    of 167 miles, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0031-0020"/> whilst two cold bands of an aggregate breadth of
                    52 miles are interposed between them. The innermost warm band is the one which
                    exhibits the highest temperature and greatest rate of flow, its velocity being
                    greatest where it is pressed on laterally by the Arctic Current, so that a rate
                    of 4 miles per hour is occasionally observed. Capt. Nares estimates the depth of
                    the Stream in this part of its course at about 100 fathoms, and its rate of flow
                    in the line of most rapid movement at 3 miles per hour. The outermost band, on
                    the other hand, graduates insensibly, both as to temperature and rate of
                    movement, into the general surface-water of the Atlantic. It is when passing
                    Sandy Hook that the Gulf Stream takes its decided turn eastwards,—this change in
                    its direction, being partly due to the eastward bend of the United States
                    coast-line, and partly to the <hi rend="italic">excess of easterly momentum</hi>
                    which it brings from the lower latitude in which it issued from the Florida
                    Channel. Its general rate of flow past Nantucket seems not to exceed 1 mile per
                    hour, and to be frequently less; but several degrees to the eastward of this,
                    the current has been found occasionally running at the rate of 4 miles an
                    hour,—this acceleration being probably due to the lateral pressure of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arctic Current,</hi> which, during the early months of the year,
                    is driven southwards at the rate of 10 or 12 miles per day by the N. and N.W.
                    winds then prevailing along the coast of Labrador, and which, turning westwards
                    round the south of Newfoundland, keeps close to the coast of the United States
                    (being left behind in the rotation of the earth, in consequence of its <hi
                    rend="italic">deficiency</hi> of easterly momentum), and follows it southwards,
                    everywhere separating it from the Gulf Stream.</p>
                <p>By the gradual thinning-out and expansion of the Gulf Stream after passing the
                    Banks of Newfoundland, by the progressive reduction of its rate of movement, and
                    by the loss of that excess of temperature which previously distinguished it, as
                    well as of its peculiar blue colour (which probably depends on its holding in
                    suspension the finest particles of the river-silt brought down by the
                    Mississippi), this remarkable current so far loses all its special attributes,
                    as to be no longer recognisable to the east of the meridian of 30 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> W. long.,—there degenerating into the general
                    easterly drift of that region of the Atlantic which is kept up by the prevalence
                    of westerly winds, sometimes called “anti-trades.” Where the Florida Current or
                    true Gulf Stream can last be distinctly recognised, it forms a stratum not more
                    than 50 fathoms in thickness; and it is there flowing <hi rend="italic">almost
                    due east,</hi> at a rate which would require about 100 days to bring it to the
                    Land’s End. The only valid evidence of the extension of any part of it to the
                    western shores of Europe (the amelioration of their temperature being otherwise
                    accounted for, while the transport of trunks of trees, drift-timber, fruits,
                    shells, &lt;tc., to the Western Hebrides, the Orkney, Shetland, and Faroe
                    islands, and the coast of Norway, may be fairly set down to the surface-drift
                    sustained by the prevalence of S.W. winds) is afforded by the variable current
                    known as <hi rend="italic">Rennell</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> which,
                    flowing eastwards into the southern part of the Bay of Biscay, is deflected in a
                    N.W. direction by the trend of its coast-line, so as to cross the British
                    Channel towards the Scilly Islands, whence it passes to the S.W. coast of
                    Ireland, its strength mainly depending on the continued prevalence of the
                    westerly anti-trades. (See Plate I.)</p>
                <p>Of the whole mass of water, on the other hand, that is brought into the
                    mid-Atlantic by the Gulf Stream, it may be stated with confidence that the
                    larger proportion turns southward to the east of the Azores, and helps to form
                    the <hi rend="italic">North African Current;</hi> the other tributary of which
                    may be considered as originating as far north as Cape Finisterre, under the
                    influence of the northerly winds which prevail along the coast of Portugal. As
                    this current flows past the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar, a part of it,
                    forming what is known as the <hi rend="italic">Gibraltar Current,</hi> is drawn
                    in to keep up the level of the Mediterranean, which would otherwise be reduced
                    by the excess of evaporation from its surface; but the greater part keeps its
                    course southwards along the Marocco coast, reinforcing the south-flowing
                    extension of the Gulf Stream. On arriving at the border of the northerly trade,
                    the North African Current divides into two parts,—the western division being at
                    once carried into the course of the equatorial drift, whilst the eastern, which
                    may be considered as essentially an indraught or supply current, follows the
                    African coast-line, and turns eastward into the Gulf of Guinea, forming the <hi
                    rend="italic">Guinea Current,</hi> which, coalescing with the eastward
                    “back-water” already mentioned, flows pretty constantly, sometimes with
                    considerable rapidity, towards the Bight of Biafra. There it meets the <hi
                    rend="italic">South African Current,</hi> which forms the other great feeder of
                    the Equatorial Current; and the circulation thus completed may be considered as
                    recommencing from this “head-water.” The large area of comparatively still water
                    which lies in the interior of this North Atlantic circulation is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sargasso Sea,—</hi> a corruption of the name (Mar de Sargaço)
                    which it received from Columbus and the early Spanish navigators, on account of
                    the quantity of sea-weed that floats on its surface. The boundaries of this
                    area, which is of an irregularly elliptical shape, and nearly equals that of
                    Continental Europe, are somewhat variable; but it may be considered to lie
                    between the parallels of 20° and 35° N., and between the meridians of 30° and
                    60° W. Into it is collected a large proportion of the drift or wreck which
                    floats about the North Atlantic.</p>
                <p>Proceeding now to the South Atlantic, we meet with a circulation of the same
                    kind, uncomplicated by any embaying of the Equatorial Current. The smaller
                    division of this current which strikes the coast of South America to the south
                    of Cape St Roque flow’s along the coast of Brazil at the rate of from 12 to 20
                    miles a day, forming the <hi rend="italic">Brazil Current,</hi> which, however,
                    is separated from the land by an intervening band of lower temperature, that
                    has, during the winter months, a distinct flow towards the equator. The Brazil
                    Current can be traced southwards, by its temperature rather than by its
                    movement, as far as the estuary of the La Plata, before reaching which, however,
                    a great part of it takes an easterly direction, and crosses the Atlantic towards
                    the Cape of Good Hope, forming what is known as the <hi rend="italic">Southern
                    Connecting Current.</hi> The easterly movement of this current seems to be
                    partly due to the w esterly anti-trades, and partly to the excess of easterly
                    momentum which is retained by the Brazil Current in its southward course from
                    Cape St Roque; whilst it partly depends also on the junction of an Antarctic
                    current that flow’s N.E. from Cape Horn, meeting the Brazil Current off the
                    estuary of La Plata, just as the Arctic Current meets the Gulf Stream off
                    Newfoundland,—dense fogs being produced, in the one case as in the other,
                    through the precipitation of the vapour overlying the Equatorial Current, by the
                    colder air that overlies the Polar. On meeting the coast of South Africa, the
                    Southern Connecting Current turns northwards, and runs towards the Bight of
                    Biafra, forming the <hi rend="italic">South African Current,</hi> the movement
                    of which is partly sustained by the southerly winds which prevail along that
                    coast, but is partly attributable to the indraught set up to supply the efflux
                    of the Equatorial Current. In its passage thither, however, the part of it most
                    distant from the land is draughted westwards by the southern trade, forming the
                    most southerly portion of the equatorial drift. Between this and the Southern
                    Connecting Current is a central space, lying betw een the <pb break="no"

                    0° and 25° W., over which there are no regular currents; and to this the name
                    Sargasso Sea is sometimes applied by analogy, although its surface has no
                    covering of sea-weed. (See Plate I.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Temperature of the Atlantic.—</hi> The distribution of surface
                    temperature over the area of the Atlantic has now been made out with
                    considerable accuracy; and it corresponds closely with what has been already
                    stated as the course of the surface currents. There is, of course, a seasonal
                    change, alike in its northern and in its southern division, this change being
                    more and more marked as we recede from the equator. Following the course of the
                    mean annual isotherms, however, we find that they cross the South Atlantic at
                    nearly regular intervals, in an east and west direction, the principal departure
                    from that direction being βhown at their western end in the bend they take
                    towards the south under the influence of the warm Brazil Current, and at their
                    eastern in the still stronger bend they take towards the north under the
                    influence of the cold South African Current, which reduces to about 75° the
                    temperature of the southern equatorial that flows alongside the Guinea Current,
                    whose temperature is 82°. In the North Atlantic, however, the influence of the
                    movement of oceanic water on the surface-temperature is very much more marked.
                    The annual isotherms, which cross the Sargasso Sea with nearly regular
                    parallelism, and on the African side tend somewhat to the south, where they meet
                    the colder water of the North African Current, show a strong northward bend on
                    the American side, along the early course of the Gulf Stream; but as its excess
                    of temperature above that of the Atlantic generally diminishes as we trace it
                    towards the Banks of Newfoundland, this northward deflection progressively
                    becomes less. The marked contrast in temperature which is often there exhibited
                    between two contiguous bands of water,—a thermometer hanging from a ship’s bow
                    showing a temperature of 70°, whilst another hanging from the stern shows only
                    40°,—is due not so much to the elevation produced by the Gulf Stream as to the
                    depression produced by the Arctic Current. This depression manifests itself in
                    the southward bend given, on the American side, alike to the summer and the
                    winter isotherms (see Plate), beyond the summer isotherm of 70° and the winter
                    isotherm of 60°, which may be considered as having nearly their normal position;
                    whilst the northward tendency of these same isotherms on the European side not
                    less conspicuously indicates a flow of warm water towards the western coasts of
                    the British Isles, Norway, and even Iceland and Spitzbergen. It has been
                    customary to regard this flow as an extension of the Gulf Stream; but if that
                    term be limited (as it ought) to the current that issues from the Gulf of Mexico
                    through the Florida Channel, the hypothesis is found to be untenable so soon as
                    the thermal phenomena of that current are carefully examined. For, in the first
                    place, the popular idea that the Gulf Stream retains its high temperature with
                    little diminution during its passage first northwards and then eastwards is
                    clearly disproved by observation, as is shown by the following table of average
                    temperatures taken at different seasons in the warmest of its bands :—</p>

                <p>From this it appeals that, while the high surface-tempera ture with which the
                    Gulf Stream leaves the Florida Channel is retained in summer with only 5°
                    reduction as far as Nova Scotia, there is a reduction of <hi rend="italic"
                    >5°</hi> in winter during its northward passage to Cape Hatteras, and a further
                    reduction of no less than 10° during its eastward passage from Cape Hatteras to
                    Nova Scotia, making a total reduction of 15°. In spring, again, there is a total
                    reduction of ll <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>, and in autumn of 13°; and in
                    both cases the reduction during the <hi rend="italic">eastward</hi> flow under
                    the parallel of 35° N. is greater than the reduction in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >northward</hi> flow from 25° N. to 35° N. The explanation of this is plainly to
                    be found in the fact that in the early part of the course of the Gulf Stream its
                    superheated stratum is a thick one, so that when its superficial film is cooled
                    down by a superincumbent atmosphere of lower temperature, it is replaced by the
                    uprising of a deeper stratum having nearly its original temperature. But as the
                    stream spreads out superficially, its superheated stratum becomes proportionally
                    thinner, and will consequently be more and more rapidly cooled down by the
                    superincumbent atmosphere. Even supposing, therefore, that it were not subjected
                    to any special cooling influence, it appears certain that, as the rate of the
                    current slackens and its depth diminishes, the cooling process must continue at
                    an increased rate, so as to bring down the surface-temperature of the stream to
                    the normal isotherm of the locality, long before it could reach the shores of
                    Europe. But it has been shown that when it passes Newfoundland the Gulf Stream
                    <hi rend="italic">is</hi> subjected to a special cooling influence—that of the
                    Labrador Current with its fleet of icebergs, which melt away when borne into it;
                    and this produces such an immediate reduction of its surfacetemperature, that it
                    thenceforth shows very little excess, although its sub-surface stratum still
                    appears to be warmer than that of the ocean through which it flows.</p>
                <p>But, further, the Gulf Stream, where it is last recognisable as a current, is
                    flowing due east, and its southern portion turns first south-east and then
                    south, whilst, on the other hand, the course of the isothermal lines (see Plate)
                    clearly shows that the flow of warm water which carries them northward spreads
                    across the whole breadth of the Atlantic, from the British Isles to Labrador,
                    even extending up to the west of north into Baffin’s Bay. When we contrast this
                    immense body of north-moving water with the thinned-out film of what is by
                    comparison a mere rivulet, it becomes obvious (1) that its northward flow cannot
                    be attributable to the <hi rend="italic">vis a tergo</hi> of the Florida
                    Current, whilst (2) its convection of heat to the Arctic Sea cannot be accounted
                    for by any amount of excess of temperature that is limited to a small depth,
                    since the temperature of such a stratum, moving north-east at a rate of (at
                    most) 4 or 5 miles per day, must soon be brought down to that of the atmosphere
                    above it.</p>
                <p>Influenced by these considerations, several eminent hydrographers, both British
                    and American, have been disposed to deny, not only that the temperature of the
                    North Atlantic is modified in any considerable degree by the true Gulf Stream,
                    but that any other agency than that of warm S.W. winds is concerned in producing
                    the climatic amelioration popularly attributed to it. They maintained, in fact,
                    that the surface-temperature of the North Atlantic and Arctic Seas <hi
                    rend="italic">follows</hi> that of the superincumbent air,— the atmospheric
                    temperature not being in any degree raised by that of warmer water beneath. This
                    doctrine, however, is found to be inconsistent with the results of careful
                    comparisons recently instituted between marine and atmospheric temperatures
                    along the western coasts of Scotland, the Orkney, Shetland, and Faroe Islands,
                    and especially with those obtained along the western coast of Norway. For it is
                    found that during the winter months there is a constant <hi rend="italic"

                    the western coast of Scotland and its islands, and rising to 14° '5 at Fruholm
                    near the North Cape. And it is also a very significant fact (ascertained by the
                    careful inquiries of Mr Buchan), that while the <hi rend="italic">summer</hi>
                    isotherms cross the British Islands nearly east and west (the temperature
                    diminishing pretty regularly from south to north), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >winter</hi> isotherms traverse them nearly north and south (the temperature
                    diminishing from west to east); whilst in Ireland the isotherms seem to envelope
                    the islands in their folds, which increase in warmth from the centre of the
                    island to its sea-board. So in Norway the isothermal lines run parallel to the
                    coast-line, and this alike in summer and in winter,—the temperature falling in
                    winter, and rising in summer, with the increase of distance from the sea.
                    Nothing could prove more conclusively than such facts as these (taken in
                    connection with the absence of ice in the harbours of Norway, even as far north
                    as Hammerfest, through the whole winter) the dependence of the mild wiuter
                    climate of the north-western coasts of Europe upon the proximity of a sea which
                    is warmer than the superincumbent atmosphere; and we have now to inquire how
                    this great N. E. movement of a stratum of warm water sufficiently thick to
                    retain a surface-temperature considerably higher than that of the air above it
                    is to be accounted for.</p>
                <p>The solution of the problem seems to be afforded by the doctrine of a <hi
                    rend="italic">General Oceanic Circulation,</hi> sustained by opposition of
                    temperature only, which was first distinctly propounded in 1845 by Professor
                    Lenz of St Petersburg, on the basis of observations made by him during the
                    second voyage of Kotzebue (1825-1828). Others had been previously led to surmise
                    that “Polar Currents” flow along the floors of the great oceans, even as far as
                    the equator, balancing the superficial counter-currents which are observable in
                    the opposite direction. But Lenz was led to conclude that the whole of the
                    deeper portion of the great 0cean-basin3 in communication with the polar areas
                    is occupied by polar water, which is constantly, though slowly, flowing towards
                    the equator; whilst conversely the whole upper stratum of equatorial water is as
                    constantly, though slowly, flowing towards one or both of the poles. And he
                    particularly dwelt on the existence of a belt of water under the equator, colder
                    than that which lies either north or south of it, as an evidence that polar
                    water is there continually rising from beneath towards the surface,—a phenomenon
                    which, he considered, admits of no other explanation. He further adduced the low
                    salinity of equatorial water (previously noticed by Humboldt, and confirmed by
                    his own observations), compared with that of tropical water, as evidence that
                    the equatorial water of the surface is derived from the polar underflow. And he
                    attributed the maintenance of this circulation to the continually renewed
                    disturbance of equilibrium between the polar and equatorial columns,—the greater
                    lateral (because downward) pressure of the former<note anchored="true"

                    >surface indraught</hi> from the warmer towards the colder areas.</p>
                <p>The doctrine of Lenz, so far from meeting with the general acceptance to which it
                    had a fair claim,—alike on theoretical grounds and from its accordance with the
                    facts ascertained by careful observation,—seems to have been put aside and
                    forgotten, a preference being given to the doctrine of the prevalence of a
                    uniform deep-sea temperature of 39°, which was supposed to be established by the
                    thermometric observations made in the voyages of D’Urville and Sir James Ross.
                    No such precaution was taken, however, in these observations as that to which
                    Lenz had recourse, to obviate the effects of the tremendous pressure (1 ton per
                    square inch for every 800 fathoms of depth) to which deep-sea thermometers are
                    exposed; and it is now certain that the temperatures at great depths recorded by
                    D’Urville and Ross were several degrees too high.</p>
                <p>It was in entire ignorance of the doctrine of Lenz, and under the influence of
                    that of D’Urville and Ross, which had been stamped with the great weight of Sir
                    John Herschel’s weight of authority,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    with Professor Wyville Thomson) a course of inquiry into the thermal condition
                    of the deep sea, which at once convinced him of the fallacy of the uniform 39°
                    doctrine, and led him to conclusions essentially accordant with those of Lenz.
                    For in the channel of from 500 to GOO fathoms’ depth between the north of
                    Scotland and the Faroe Islands, they found the deeper half to be occupied by a
                    stratum of glacial water, whose temperature ranged downwards from 32° to 29 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 5; whilst the upper half was occupied by a stratum
                    warmer than the normal temperature of the latitudes. This phenomenon <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> was interpreted by Carpenter as indicating a deep
                    glacial flow from N.E. to S.W., and a warm upper flow from S.W. to N.E.; and
                    finding that to the west of this channel, on the border of the deep Atlantic
                    basin, the excess of warmth extended to a depth of more than 500 fathoms, he
                    came to the conclusion that the north-moving stratum which brought it could not
                    be an extension of the true Gulf Stream, but must be urged on by some much more
                    general force. A series of temperature-soundings taken along the west of
                    Ireland, the Bay of Biscay, and the coast of Portugal, confirmed him in this
                    view, by showing that the division between an upper warm stratum and a cold
                    under-stratum exists in the North Atlantic at a depth of from 700 to 900
                    fathoms, the whole mass of water below this having either flowed into the basin
                    from the polar area, or having had its temperature brought down to from 39° to
                    36 <hi rend="superscript"> 0-</hi> 5 by mixture with the polar inflow. And this
                    conclusion was confirmed by the result of temperature-soundings taken at
                    corresponding depths and under the same parallels of latitude in the
                    Mediterranean; for as they showed a uniform temperature of from 54° to 56°, from
                    beneath the stratum of 100 fathoms that was superheated by direct insolation, to
                    the very bottom, it became clear that depth <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> could
                    have no effect in reducing the bottom-temperature; and that the cause of the
                    excess of temperature in the mass of water occupying the Mediterranean basin
                    above that of Atlantic water at the same depths, lies in the seclusion of the
                    former from the polar underflow which brings down the deep temperature of the
                    latter. This conclusion having received marked confirmation from
                    temperature-soundings taken in the Eastern seas, was put forward by Carpenter as
                    justifying the doctrine of a <hi rend="italic">vertical</hi> oceanic circulation
                    sustained by opposition of temperature only, quite independent of and distinct
                    from the <hi rend="italic">horizontal</hi> circulation produced by wind,—which
                    doctrine he expressed in terms closely corresponding with those that had been
                    used by Lenz. And the collection of data for the establishment or confutation of
                    this doctrine was one of the objects of the “Challenger” expedition, which has
                    already made, in the determination of the thermal stratification of the Atlantic
                    between 38° N. lat. and 38° S. lat., what may be fairly characterised as the
                    grandest single contribution ever yet made to terrestrial physics.</p>

                    and 600 fathoms’ depth; there is then a stratum between 45° and 40°, of which
                    the thickness varies from about 250 to 450 fathoms, the isotherm of 40° lying at
                    between 750 and 1000 fathoms’ depth, while below this, down to the bottom at
                    between 2000 and 3000 fathoms, the further reduction to 34 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 4 is very gradual.</p>
                <p>The same general condition prevails in the South Atlantic (fig. 2), between
                    Abrolhos Island (lat. 18° S.) on the coast of Brazil, and the Cape of Good Hope
                    (lat. 34⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> S.), this trough also being divided
                    into two basins by the elevation of the bottom w hich culminates in the island
                    of Tristan da Cunha. The temperature of the water that occupies it, however, is
                    lower through its whole vertical range than that of the North Atlantic. The
                    stratification is nearly uniform from the surface downwards to the isotherm of
                    40°, which lies at from 300 to 450 fathoms’ depth, the isotherms of 39° and 38°
                    also lying within about 500 fathoms; there is then a slow*er reduction down to
                    the isotherm of 35°, which lies between 1400 and 1800 fathoms; while the whole
                    sea-bed is covered by a stratum of about 600 fathoms’ thickness, whose
                    temperature ranges downwards from 35° to 33°. The whole of this deepest stratum
                    is colder than any water that is found in the corresponding portion of the North
                    Atlantic, except near St Thomas.</p>
                <p>It is not a little remarkable that the sub-surface stratum of water, having a
                    temperature above 40°, is thinner under the equator than it is in any other part
                    of the Atlantic from the Faroe Islands to the Cape of Good Hope. Notwithstanding
                    the rise of the surface-temperature to 76°-80°, the thermometer descends in the
                    first 300 fathoms more rapidly than anywhere else; so that polar water is met
                    with, as shown in fig. 3, at a much less depth than in the North Atlantic (fig.
                    1), and 100 fathoms nearer to the surface than even in the colder South Atlantic
                    (fig. 2); whilst the temperature of the bottom is but little above 32°. Thus the
                    influence of the polar underflow is more pronounced under the equator than it is
                    elsewhere; as is distinctly seen in the section shown in fig. 4, which is taken
                    in a north and south direction so as to exhibit the relation of the thermal
                    stratification of the North to that <pb break="no"

                    equatorial belt. The isotherm of 40°, which in lat. 22° N. lies at a depth of
                    about 700 fathoms, gradually rises as the equator is approached; and it is
                    between the equator and 7° S., where the surface-temperature rises to nearly
                    80°, that cold water is soonest reached,—the isotherm of 40° rising to within
                    300 fathoms of the surface, while that of 55°, which in lat. 38° N. lies at
                    nearly 400 fathoms’ depth, and in lat. 22° N. at about 250 fathoms, actually
                    comes up under the equator within 100 fathoms of the surface. At the same time,
                    while the bottom-temperature under the equator is the lowest anywhere met with,

                    the temperature-soundings were taken at intervals too wide to detect the deep
                    channel through which the <hi rend="italic">coldest</hi> Antarctic water

                    beneath the isotherm of 35° is not less than 600 fathoms. In passing southwards,
                    the superficial isotherms are observed to separate again from each other, partly
                    by the reduction of the surface-temperature, and partly by the descent of the
                    isotherm of 40° to a depth of something less than 400 fathoms, which it keeps
                    with little reduction as far south as the Cape of Good Hope. The significance of
                    these facts becomes more remarkable, when we consider that if a portion of the
                    oceanic area under the equator were to be secluded, like the Mediterranean or
                    the</p>

                    equatorial zone, would be certainly not below 75°.</p>
                <p>Nothing, Dr Carpenter contends, could more conclusively support the general
                    doctrine of a <hi rend="italic">Vertical Oceanic Circulation</hi> sustained by
                    opposition of temperature, than the precise conformity of the facts thus
                    determined by observation to the predictions which his confidence in the theory
                    had led him to put forth. These predictions were essentially as follows :—</p>
                <p>“1. That instead of the local depressions of bottom-temperature imputed by
                    previous writers to polar currents, the temperature of every part of the deep
                    sea-bed in communication with either of the polar areas would be not many
                    degrees above that of the polar areas themselves.</p>
                <p>“2. That this general depression of bottom-temperature would be found to depend,
                    not upon such a shallow glacial stream as might be maintained to be a return
                    from the polar areas of water propelled towards them by wind-currents, but upon
                    a creeping flow of the whole under-stratum, having a thickness of from 1000 to
                    2000 fathoms.</p>
                <p>‘ ’ 3. That as the depression of bottom-temperature in any part of the general
                    oceanic basin would be proportional to the freedom of communication between its
                    deeper portion and that of one or other of the polar areas, the
                    bottom-temperature of the South Atlantic would probably range downwards to 32°,
                    while that of the North Atlantic would not be below 35°, except where it first
                    receives the Arctic flow, or comes under the influence of the Antarctic
                    underflow, which would very probably extend itself to the north of the
                    equator.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“4.</hi> That as the Arctic and Antarctic underflows must meet
                    at or near the equator, whilst the surface-stratum is there continually being
                    draughted off thence towards either pole, there would be a continual ascent of
                    glacial water under the line, showing itself by a nearer approach of cold water
                    to the surface in the inter-tropical than in the ezirα-tropical zone.”</p>
                <p>It was further pointed out by Lenz, and more recently (in ignorance of his
                    doctrine) by Carpenter, that additional evidence of such ascent is furnished by
                    the low salinity of the surface-water of the equatorial belt corresponding with
                    that of polar water. For, as was originally observed by Humboldt, then by Lenz
                    himself, and subsequently by many other voyagers, the specific gravity of the
                    surfacewater of the Atlantic gradually increases as either tropic is approached
                    from the polar side of its own. hemisphere, reaches its maximum a little nearer
                    the equator, and then rapidly diminishes, coming down under the equator to the
                    standard of polar water. Thus a mean of eight observations taken in the
                    “Challenger” expedition between Bermuda (32° N.) and St Thomas (18⅜ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> N.) gave 1027 ’ 2 as the sp. gr. of <hi rend="italic"

                    sp. <hi rend="italic">gr. of</hi> only 1026 ’ 3. Now, since between St Thomas
                    and Bermuda the eight “Challenger’’ observations of <hi rend="italic"
                    >bottom</hi> (polar) water gave a mean sp. gr. of 1026 ’ 3, whilst between Cape
                    Verd and Bahia the mean sp. gr. of the bottom-water was even slightly lower (the
                    results being <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n36/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0036-0025"/> in all cases expressed according to a common
                    standard of temperature), such a close conformity subsists between the salinity
                    of the equatorial water of the surface and that of the polar waters of the
                    bottom, as can scarcely be accounted for in any other way than by the continual
                    and tolerably rapid ascent of the latter.</p>
                <p>Another indication of this ascent is given by the moder ation of the
                    surface-temperature <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> of oceanic water, even under
                    the equator. If there were no ascent of colder water from beneath, there seems
                    no reason why the constant powerful insolation to which equatorial water is
                    subjected should not raise the temperature of its surface to the highest
                    possible elevation. The limit to that elevation, which is obviously set by the
                    cooling influence of evaporation, is probably that which is met with in the Red
                    Sea, where the monthly average for August rises to 86J <hi rend="superscript">
                    o</hi> and for September to 88°, whilst the maxima rise much higher,
                    temperatures of 100°, 106°, 100°, and 96° having been noted on four consecutive
                    days. Moreover, along the Guinea Coast, and especially in the Bight of Biafra,
                    the surfacetemperature is stated to range as high as 90°. But in these cases
                    there is no reduction of surface-temperature by the upward movement of polar
                    water · for this is altogether excluded from the Red Sea by the shallowness of
                    the Strait of Babelmandeb, whilst the depth of the bottom along the Guinea Coast
                    is too small to allow of its being overflowed by the glacial stratum. Now, over
                    the deeper parts of the equatorial Atlantic the surface-temperature usually
                    ranges between 75° and 80°; and this is its ordinary range in the Mediterranean
                    during the months of August and September. That the temperature of an equatorial
                    ocean should be thus kept down to that of a sea of which the greater part lies
                    between the parallels of 40° and 35°, can scarcely be accounted for in any other
                    way than by the continual uprising of polar waters from beneath.</p>
                <p>The same principle, once admitted, fully accounts for that amelioration of the
                    cold of north-western Europe, which (as already shown) cannot be fairly
                    attributed to the Florida Current or true Gulf Stream. For it is obvious that a
                    continual efflux of the lower stratum from the polar areas towards the
                    equatorial must involve a continual indraught of the upper stratum towards the
                    polar areas; and this indraught wall be much more marked in the Northern than in
                    the Southern Atlantic, on account of the progressive narrowing of the former,
                    whilst the latter progressively widens out. Of such a slow northerly set of a
                    stratum of water, extending downwards to a depth of at least 600 fathoms, we
                    have evidence in a comparison of the temperature-soundings taken in the
                    “Porcupine” expeditione of 1869 arid 1870, between the coast of Portugal (34°
                    N.) and the Faroe Islands (59⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> N.), from which
                    the section fig. 5, has been worked out. For it is there seen that, although the
                    surface-temperature is reduced by the thinning-out of the superficial stratum,
                    there is but a slight change in the position of the bathymetrical isotherms of
                    45° and 40°; so that there is an obvious continuity of a stratum of many hundred
                    fathoms’ thickness between these two points, notwithstanding their separation by
                    25∣ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> of latitude. The contrast between the
                    position of the isotherm of 40° at 800 fathoms’ depth off the Faroes, and its
                    position at less than 300 fathoms’ depth under the equator, is most remarkable.
                    We have seen that the isocheimal in the latter area would not be below 75°, and
                    yet we find water colder than 40° lying at within 300 fathoms of the surface;
                    whilst, on the other hand, the normal isocheimal at 59J <hi rend="superscript">
                    o</hi> N. would certainly be below 40° (probably no more than 35°), and yet we
                    find water above 43° extending downwards to 600 fathoms, and water above 40° to
                    800 fathoms. Thus the vertical oceanic circulation carries a vast mass of water
                    which is <hi rend="italic">below</hi> the normal off the coast of Portugal, into
                    a region where it is <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the normal, "with very little
                    loss of heat by the way, except in its surface-film; and a little consideration
                    will show that such a movement must be much more effectual as a <hi
                    rend="italic">beater</hi> than a corresponding movement of a thin stratum of
                    much warmer water. For the latter, when it passes beneath an atmosphere much
                    colder than itself, will soon be brought down to a like standard, not having
                    warmer water from below to take its place when it has been cooled down; whilst
                    in the former, each surface-layer, when cooled below the temperature of the
                    warmer stratum beneath, will sink and be replaced by it. Now since the true Gulf
                    Stream, when we last know it, has been so thinned out that it could not long
                    retain any excess of temperature, it seems inconceivable that it should exert
                    any decided effect on the temperature of the Faroes and the coast of Norway,
                    unless (as supposed by Dr Petermann and Professor Wyville Thomson) its thickness
                    undergoes an increase from less than 100 fathoms to 600. But since the course of
                    Dr Petermann’s isotherms shows that the northward flow extends across the whole
                    breadth of the Atlantic between Newfoundland and the British Isles—a distance of
                    about 2000 miles—we are required to believe that a rivulet (for such it is by
                    comparison) of 60 miles’ breadth and 100 fathoms’ depth (see section, fig. 5),
                    of which the greater part turns southwards round the Azores, and of which the
                    remainder is flowing due east when we last recognise it, is able to impart a
                    northerly movement to a stratum of 2000 miles in breadth, and at least 600
                    fathoms’ depth. On the other hand, the eastward set of this stratum, considered
                    as a northward <hi rend="italic">indraught</hi> into the polar area, is readily
                    accounted for by the excess of easterly momentum which it derives from the
                    earth’s rotation, this being only half as rapid in lat. 60° as it is under the
                    equator; and since there is a still more rapid reduction in the rate of this
                    rotation in yet higher latitudes, the continually increasing excess of easterly
                    momentum will give to the northward flow a progressively stronger eastward
                    set.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the deficiency of easterly momentum in the cold underflow
                    coming from the pole towards the equator will tend to produce a lagging-behind,
                    or <hi rend="italic">westward</hi> set of that underflow; and this has been
                    shown by the “Challenger” temperature-soundings to be the case,—the cold deep
                    strata of the Western Atlantic surging upwards along the slope of the North
                    American coast-line, as is shown in fig. 6, where we see not only the
                    bathymetrical isotherms of 60°, 55°, and 50°, but the yet deeper isotherms of
                    45° and 40°, successively rising to the surface as we approach the land; while
                    at a depth of only 83 fathoms, a temperature of 35° was encountered, which, at
                    no great distance to the south, would only be found at a depth of 2000 fathoms.

                <p>hill is quite conformable to what we see in other cases, in which a heavier
                    under-stratum has a definite set towards a slope; and whilst the existence of
                    such a westerly set is, <hi rend="italic">ex hypothesis</hi> a necessary
                    consequence of the southerly movement of the Arctic underflow, no other
                    explanation of it has been suggested. We now see that the cold Labrador Current
                    overlies a band of water as cold as itself; and the southward extension of this
                    cold band, far beyond that of any definite current - movement, and its entrance
                    into the Gulf of Mexico, through the Florida Channel, at the side of and beneath
                    the outflowing Gulf Stream, are thus accounted for.</p>
                <p>The remarkable accordance of so many facts of actual observation, in the Atlantic
                    area, with the probabilities deducible from a theory whose soundness can
                    scarcely be disputed, seems now to justify the admission of the general
                    (vertical) oceanic circulation sustained by opposition of temperature as an
                    accepted doctrine of terrestrial physics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Distribution of Organic Life.—</hi> All that will be attempted
                    under this head will be to indicate the general conditions that seem, from
                    recent researches, to have the greatest influence on the distribution of plants
                    and animals through this great oceanic basin.</p>
                <p>The distribution of marine plants seems mainly determined by light, temperature,
                    and depth,—a further influence being exerted by the character of the shores. The
                    diminution of light in its passage through sea-water is so rapid, that the
                    quantity which penetrates to a depth of 250 or 300 fathoms may be regarded as
                    almost infinitesimal; and in conformity with this we find a very rapid
                    diminution of Algal life below the depth of 100 fathoms. The upper stratum is
                    occupied for the most part by the larger and coarser forms of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fucacea?,</hi> or olive-green sea-weeds, whilst the more delicate
                    <hi rend="italic">Ceramiaceoe,</hi> or red sea-weeds, frequent deeper waters;
                    and, as it appears from experiments made in aquaria that the latter do not
                    flourish in full light, but grow well in shadow, it may be concluded that their
                    preference for a moderate depth is rather for reduced light and stillness than
                    for depth <hi rend="italic">per se.</hi> At a depth of 150 fathoms very few
                    ordinary sea-weeds maintain their ground; and below this we seldom find any
                    Algae, save the Corallines and Nulliρorcs consolidated by calcareous deposit.
                    The distribution of particular types over different parts of the Atlantic area
                    appears to be mainly regulated by temperature; and this would seem to be
                    remarkably the case with the floating <hi rend="italic">Diatomacece,</hi> which,
                    though they form green bands in the surface-water of polar seas, have not been
                    enoountered in like abundance in the Atlantic, and do not contribute largely, by
                    the subsidence of their siliceous <hi rend="italic">loricoe,</hi> to the
                    composition of its bottom-deposit. Although it is the habit of the larger Algae
                    to grow from a base of attachment (their roots serving no other purpose however,
                    than that of anchorage), the enormous mass of Gulf-weed found in the »Sargasso
                    Sea seems quite independent of any such attachment. It was at one time supposed
                    that this originally grew on the Bahama and Florida shores, and was torn thence
                    by the powerful current of the Gulf Stream; but it seems certain that if such
                    was its original source, the “Gulf-weed” now lives and propagates whilst freely
                    floating on the ocean-surface, having become adapted by various modifications to
                    its present mode of existence.</p>
                <p>The distribution of the animals that habitually live in that upper stratum of the
                    ocean whose degree of warmth varies with the latitude, seems mainly determined
                    by temperature. Thus the “right whale” of Arctic seas, and its representative in
                    the Antarctic, seems never to enter the inter-tropical area, generally keeping
                    away from even the temperate seas, whilst, on the other hand, the sperm-whale
                    ranges through the parts of the ocean where the “right whales” are never
                    seen.</p>
                <p>The distribution of fishes seems generally to follow the same rule; as does also
                    that of floating mollusks. Thus the little <hi rend="italic">Clio</hi> (a
                    Pteropod mollusk), which is a principal article of the food of the “right
                    whales” in polar seas, is rarely met with in the Atlantic, where, however, other
                    pteropods, as <hi rend="italic">lïyaloea,</hi> present themselves in abundance.
                    On the other hand, the "warmer parts of· its area swarm with Salpa-chains, which
                    are not frequent in higher latitudes; and the few representatives of the
                    Nautiloid Cephalopods, that were so abundant in Cretaceous seas, are now
                    restricted to tropical or sub-tropical areas. And the distribution of the
                    mollusks, echinoderms, and corals, which habitually live on the bottom, seems to
                    be determined, within certain limits at least, by temperature rather than by
                    depth.</p>
                <p>The bathymetrical range to which animal life of any higher type than the
                    Rhizopodal might extend, was until recently quite unknown; but the researches
                    initiated by Prof. Wyville Thomson and Dr Carpenter in 1868, and since
                    prosecuted by the “Challenger” expedition, have fully established the existence
                    of a varied and abundant fauna in ocean-depths ranging downwards to 2000
                    fathoms. And these researches have further established that the distribution of
                    this fauna is mainly determined by the temperature of the sea-bed; so that
                    whilst in the channel between the north of Scotland and the Faroes there were
                    found at the same depths, and within a few miles of each other, two faunae
                    almost entirely distinct—one a boreal and the other a warmer-temperate—on
                    sea-beds having respectively the temperatures of 30° and 43°, various types to
                    which a low temperature is congenial are traceable continuously along the whole
                    abyssal sea-bed that intervenes between those northern and southern polar areas
                    within which they present themselves at or near the surface. And hence it
                    becomes clear that, since glacial types are even now being embedded in the
                    strata which are in process of formation beneath the equator, no inferences as
                    to terrestrial climate can be drawn from the character of marine deposits.</p>
                <p>One very remarkable feature which presents itself over a large proportion of the
                    Atlantic basin is the abundance of the minute <hi rend="italic"
                    >Globigerinae</hi> and other Foraminifera, the accumulation of whose shells, and
                    of their disintegrated remains, is giving rise to a calcareous deposit of
                    unknown thickness, that corresponds in all essential particulars to Chalk. This
                    deposit, in some parts of the North Atlantic, is replaced by an Arctic drift of
                    fine sand, whilst in other parts there is a mixture of arenaceous and of
                    calcareous components, such as is found in certain beds of the Cretaceous
                    formation. Now on the surface of this deposit there have been found so many
                    living types, especially belonging to the groups of Echinoderms, Corals,
                    Siliceous Sponges, and Foraminifera, which closely correspond with types
                    hitherto regarded as characteristic of the Cretaceous epoch, that the question
                    naturally suggests itself whether <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n38/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0038-0027"/> the existing are not the lineal descendants of
                    the fossil type3,—the differences they present being not greater than may be
                    fairly attributed to the prolonged action of differences of temperature, food,
                    pressure, &amp;c. And when these facts are taken in connection with those
                    previously stated as to the probable remoteness of the period when (if ever) the
                    present sea-bed of the Atlantic was dry land, the doctrine first put forth by
                    Prof. Wyville Thomson, that there has been a continuous formation of
                    Globigerina-mud on the bottom of the Atlantic from the Cretaceous epoch to the
                    present time—or, in other words, that the formation of chalk on the sea-bed of
                    the Atlantic did not cease with the elevation of the European area, but has been
                    going on through the whole Tertiary period,—must be admitted as (to say the
                    least) a not improbable hypothesis. That some considerable change took place at
                    the conclusion of the Cretaceous epoch, by which the temperature of the upper
                    stratum was lowered, so as to be no longer compatible with the existence of the
                    fishes and chambered cephalopods characteristic of the Cretaceous fauna, may be
                    fairly assumed from their disappearance; but this would not so much affect the
                    deeper part of the basin, in which those lower types that seem more capable of
                    adapting themselves to changes in external conditions would continue to hold
                    their ground. That the like conditions had prevailed also through long previous
                    geological periods, may be surmised from the persistence, over various parts of
                    the Atlantic sea-bed, of the <hi rend="italic">Apiocrinite</hi> type, which
                    carries us back to the Oolitic formation, and of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pentacrinus</hi> type, which has come down with very little alteration from the
                    Liassic; whilst many existing <hi rend="italic">Tere-bratulidce</hi> do not
                    differ more from Oolitic types than the latter differ among each other. Going
                    back still further, we find in the persistence of certain Foraminiferal types
                    from the Carboniferous limestone to the present time, and in the character of
                    its deep-sea beds, a strong indication that they originated in a Foraminiferal
                    deposit, representing in all essential particulars that which is now going on;
                    while the persistence of the <hi rend="italic">Lingula</hi> from the early
                    Silurian strata to the present time suggests the question whether certain
                    oceanic areas may not have remained in the condition of deep sea throughout the
                    whole subsequent succession of geological changes.</p>
