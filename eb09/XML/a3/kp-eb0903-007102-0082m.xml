                    rapidity of action. To him were due in great measure the brilliant victories of
                    Millesimo, Dego, and Castiglione, and he led the decisive charges at the bloody
                    combats of Lodi and Arcola. In 1797 he took part with Barras and the Directory,
                    and was an active agent in the revolution of the 18th of Fructidor; but his
                    jealousy of his former comrade, Bonaparte, prevented their intimacy; and he was
                    one of the general officers not privy to the noted revolution of the 18th of
                    Brumaire (Nov. 9) 1799. He received, however, the command of the army of Holland
                    and the Lower Rhine, but was superseded in 1801. From that time he lived in
                    retirement, till 1804, when he was made a marshal of the French empire, and in
                    the following year he was appointed to the command of the expedition against the
                    Vorarlberg, which he quickly subdued. He also distinguished himself greatly in
                    the battles of Jenaand Eylau. In 1809-10 he commanded the French in Catalonia,
                    and tarnished his laurels by his great cruelty to the Spaniards; but he was
                    again more honourably conspicuous in the campaign of 1813, especially in the
                    terrible battle of Leipsic. In 1814 he had the command of a reserve army at
                    Lyons, and might have made a diversion in favour of Napoleon, but he preferred
                    to submit, and retained a command under the Bourbons. In the following year he
                    at first refused to join Napoleon on his escape from Elba, and when he would
                    afterwards have accepted a command his services were declined. He also failed to
                    obtain military office under the new dynasty, and after having had the painful
                    task of being one of the commission on the trial of Ney, he returned to his
                    estates, where he died of dropsy in 1816.</p>
