                    two.</p>
                <p>The atomic theory is a theory of the constitution of bodies, which asserts that
                    they are made up of atoms. The opposite theory is that of the homogeneity and
                    continuity of bodies, and asserts, at least in the case of bodies having no
                    apparent organisation, such, for instance, as water, that as we can divide a
                    drop of water into two parts which are each of them drops of water, so we have
                    reason to believe that these smaller drops can be divided again, and the theory
                    goes on to assert that there is nothing in the nature of things to hinder this
                    process of division from being repeated over and over again, times without end.
                    This is the doctrine of the infinite divisibility of bodies, and it is in direct
                    contradiction with the theory of atoms.</p>
                <p>The atomists assert that after a certain number of such divisions the parts would
                    be no longer divisible, because each of them would be an atom. The advocates of
                    the continuity of matter assert that the smallest conceivable body has parts,
                    and that whatever has parts may be divided.</p>
                <p>In ancient times Democritus was the founder of the atomic theory, while
                    Anaxagoras propounded that of continuity, under the name of the doctrine of
                    homoeomeria ('O∕Λoιo∕ιεpια), or of the similarity of the parts of a body to the
                    whole. The arguments of the atomists, and their replies to the objections of
                    Anaxagoras, are to be found in Lucretius.</p>
                <p>In modern times the study of nature has brought to light many properties of
                    bodies which appear to depend on the magnitude and motions of their ultimate
                    constituents, and the question of the existence of atoms has once more become
                    conspicuous among scientific inquiries.</p>
                <p>We shall begin by stating the opposing doctrines of atoms and of continuity
                    before giving an outline of the state of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0048-0037"/> molecular science as it now exists. In the
                    earliest times the most ancient philosophers whose speculations are known to us
                    seem to have discussed the ideas of number and of continuous magnitude, of space
                    and time, of matter and motion, with a native power of thought which has
                    probably never been surpassed. Their actual knowledge, however, and their
                    scientific experience were necessarily limited, because in their days the
                    records of human thought were only beginning to accumulate. It is probable that
                    the first exact notions of quantity were founded on the consideration of number.
                    It is by the help of numbers that concrete quantities are practically measured
                    and calculated. Now, number is discontinuous. We pass from one number to the
                    next <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">saltum.</hi> The magnitudes, on
                    the other hand, which we meet with in geometry, are essentially continuous. The
                    attempt to apply numerical methods to the comparison of geometrical quantities
                    led to the doctrine of incommensurables, and to that of the infinite
                    divisibility of space. Meanwhile, the same considerations had not been appliéd
                    to time, so that in the days of Zeno of Elea time was still regarded as made up
                    of a finite number of “moments,” while space was confessed to be divisible
                    without limit. This was the state of opinion when the celebrated arguments
                    against the possibility of motion, of which that of A.chilles and the tortoise
                    is a specimen, were propounded by Zeno, and such, apparently, continued to be
                    the state of opinion till Aristotle pointed out that time is divisible without
                    limit, in precisely the same sense that space is. - And the slowness of the
                    development of scientific ideas may be estimated from the fact that Bayle does
                    not see any force in this statement of Aristotle, but continues to admire the
                    paradox of Zeno. (Bayle’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary,</hi> art. “Zeno”). Thus
                    the direction of true scientific progress was for many ages towards th⅛
                    recognition of the infinite divisibility of space and time.</p>
                <p>It was easy to attempt to apply similar arguments to matter. If matter is
                    extended and fills space, the same mental operation by which we recognise the
                    divisibility of space may be applied, in imagination at least, to the matter
                    which occupies space. From this point of view the atomic doctrine might be
                    regarded as a relic of the old numerical way of conceiving magnitude, and the
                    opposite doctrine of the infinite divisibility of matter might appear for a time
                    the most scientific. The atomists, on the other hand, asserted very strongly the
                    distinction between matter and space. The atoms, they said, do not fill up the
                    universe; there are void spaces between them. If it were not so, Lucretius tells
                    us, there could be no motion, for the atom which gives way first must have some
                    empty place to move into.</p>

                <p>This identification of extension with substance runs through the whole of
                    Descartes’s works, and it forms one of the ultimate foundations of the system of
                    Spinoza. Descartes, consistently with this doctrine, denied the existence of
                    atoms as parts of matter, which by their own nature are indivisible. lie seems
                    to admit, however, that the Deity might make certain particles of matter
                    indivisible in this sense, that no creature should be able to divide them. These
                    particles, however, would be still divisible by their own nature, because the
                    Deity cannot diminish his own power, and therefore must retain his power of
                    dividing them. Leibnitz, on the other hand, regarded his monad as the ultimate
                    element of everything.</p>
                <p>There are thus two modes of thinking about the constitution of bodies, which have
                    had their adherents both in ancient and in modern times. They correspond to the
                    two methods of regarding quantity—the arithmetical and the geometrical. To the
                    atomist the true method of estimating the quantity of matter in a body is to
                    count the atoms in it. The void spaces between the atoms count for nothing. To
                    those who identify matter with extension, the volume of space occupied by a body
                    is the only measure of the quantity of matter in it.</p>
                <p>Of the different forms of the atomic theory, that of Boscovich may be taken as an
                    example of the purest monadism. According to Boscovich matter is made up of
                    atoms. Each atom is an indivisible point, having position in space, capable of
                    motion in a continuous path, and possessing a certain mass, whereby a certain
                    amount of force is required to produce a given change of motion. Besides this
                    the atom is endowed with potential force, that is to say, that any two atoms
                    attract or repel each other with a force depending on their distance apart. The
                    law of this force, for all distances greater than say the thousandth of an inch,
                    is an attraction varying as the inverse square of the distance. For smaller
                    distances the force is an attraction for one distance and a repulsion for
                    another, according to some law not yet discovered. Boscovich himself, in order
                    to obviate the possibility of two atoms ever being in the same place, asserts
                    that the ultimate force is a repulsion which increases without limit as the
                    distance diminishes without limit, so that two atoms can never coincide. But
                    this seems an unwarrantable concession to the vulgar opinion that two bodies
                    cannot co-exist in the same place. This opinion is deduced from our experience
                    of the behaviour of bodies of sensible size, but we have no experimental
                    evidence that two atoms may not sometimes coincide. For instance, if oxygen and
                    hydrogen combine to form water, we have no experimental evidence that the
                    molecule of oxygen is not in the very same place with the two molecules of
                    hydrogen. Many persons cannot get rid of the opinion that all matter is extended
                    in length, breadih, and depth. This is a prejudice of the same kind with the
                    last, arising from our experience of bodies consisting of immense multitudes of
                    atoms. The system of atoms, according to Boscovich, occupies a certain region of
                    space in virtue of the forces acting between the component atoms of the system
                    and any other atoms when brought near them. No other system of atoms can occupy
                    the same region of space at the same time, because, before it could do so, the
                    mutual <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n49/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0049-0038"/> action of the atoms would have caused a repulsion
                    between the two systems insuperable by any force which we can command. Thus, a
                    number of soldiers with firearms may occupy an extensive region to the exclusion
                    of the enemy’s armies, though the space filled by their bodies is but small. In
                    this way Boscovich explained the apparent extension of bodies consisting of
                    atoms, each of which is devoid of extension. According to Boscovich’s theory,
                    all action between bodies is action at a distance. There is no such thing in
                    nature as actual contact between two bodies. When two bodies are said in
                    ordinary language to be in contact, all that is meant is that they are so near
                    together that the repulsion between the nearest pairs of atoms belonging to the
                    two bodies is very great.</p>
                <p>Thus, in Boscovich’s theory, the atom has continuity of existence in time and
                    space. At any instant of time it is at some point of space, and it is never in
                    more than one place at a time. It passes from one place to another along a
                    continuous path. It has a definite mass which cannot be increased or diminished.
                    Atoms are endowed with the power of acting on one another by attraction or
                    repulsion, the amount of the force depending on the distance between them. On
                    the other hand, the atom itself has no parts or dimensions. In its geometrical
                    aspect it is a mere geometrical point. It has no extension in space. It has not
                    the so-called property of Impenetrability, for two atoms may exist in the same
                    place. This we may regard as one extreme of the various opinions about the
                    constitution of bodies.</p>
                <p>The opposite extreme, that of Anaxagoras—the theory that bodies apparently
                    homogeneous and continuous are so in reality—is, in its extreme form, a theory
                    incapable of development. To explain the properties of any substance by this
                    theory is impossible. We can only admit the observed properties of such
                    substance as ultimate facts. There is a certain stage, however, of scientific
                    progress in which a method corresponding to this theory is of service. In
                    hydrostatics, for instance, we define a fluid by means of one of its known
                    properties, and from this definition we make the system of deductions which
                    constitutes the science of hydrostatics. In this way the science of hydrostatics
                    may be built upon an experimental basis, without any consideration of the
                    constitution of a fluid as to whether it is molecular or continuous. In like
                    manner, after the French mathematicians had attempted, with more or less
                    ingenuity, to construct a theory of elastic solids from the hypothesis that they
                    consist of atoms in equilibrium under the action of their mutual forces, Stokes
                    and others showed that all the results of this hypothesis, so far at least as
                    they agreed with facts, might be deduced from the postulate that elastic bodies
                    exist, and from the hypothesis that the smallest portions into which we can
                    divide them are sensibly homogeneous. In this way the principle of continuity,
                    which is the basis of the method of Fluxions and the whole of modern
                    mathematics, may bo applied to the analysis of problems connected with material
                    bodies by assuming them, for the purpose of this analysis, to be homogeneous.
                    All that is required to make the results applicable to the real case is that the
                    smallest portions of the substance of which we take any notice shall be sensibly
                    of the same kind. Thus, if a railway contractor has to make a tunnel through a
                    hill of gravel, and if one cubic yard of the gravel is so like another cubic
                    yard that for the purposes of the contract they may be taken as equivalent,
                    then, in estimating the work required to remove the gravel from the tunnel, he
                    may, without fear of error, make his calculations as if the gravel were a
                    continuous substance. But if a worm has to make his way through the gravel, it
                    makes the greatest possible difference to him whether he tries to push right
                    against a piece of gravel, or directs his course through one of the intervals
                    between the pieces; to him, therefore, the gravel is by no means a homogeneous
                    and continuous substance.</p>
                <p>In the same way, a theory that some particular substance, say water, is
                    homogeneous and continuous may be a good, working theory up to a certain point,
                    but may fail when we come to deal with quantities so minute or so attenuated
                    that their heterogeneity of structure comes into prominence. Whether this
                    heterogeneity of structure is or is not consistent with homogeneity and
                    continuity of substance is another question.</p>
                <p>The extreme form of the doctrine of continuity is that stated by Descartes, who
                    maintains that the whole universe is equally full of matter, and that this
                    matter is all of one kind, having no essential property besides that of
                    extension. All the properties which we perceive in matter he reduces to its
                    parts being movable among one another, and so capable of all the varieties which
                    we can perceive to follow from the motion of its parts <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Principia,</hi> ii. 23). Descartes’s own attempts to deduce the different
                    qualities and actions of bodies in this way are not of much value. More than a
                    century was required to invent methods of investigating the conditions of the
                    motion of systems of bodies such as Descartes imagined. But the hydrodynamical
                    discovery of Helmholtz that a vortex in a perfect liquid possesses certain
                    permanent characteristics, has been applied by Sir W. Thomson to form a theory
                    of vortex atoms in a homogeneous, incompressible, and frictionless liquid, to
                    which we shall return at the proper time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Outline of Modern Molecular Science, and in particular of
                    the Molecular Theory of Gases.</hi></p>
                <p>We begin by assuming that bodies are made up of parts, each of which is capable
                    of motion, and that these parts act on each other in a manner consistent with
                    the principle of the conservation of energy. In making these assumptions, we are
                    justified by the facts that bodies may be divided into smaller parts, and that
                    all bodies with which we are acquainted are conservative systems, which would
                    not be the case unless their parts were also conservative systems.</p>
                <p>We may also assume that these small parts are in motion. This is the most general
                    assumption we can make, for it includes, as a particular case, the theory that
                    the small parts are at rest. The phenomena of the diffusion of gases and liquids
                    through each other show that there may be a motion of the small parts of a body
                    which is not perceptible to us.</p>
                <p>We make no assumption with respect to the nature of the small parts—whether they
                    are all of one magnitude. We do not even assume them to have extension and
                    figure. Each of them must be measured by its mass, and any two of them must,
                    like visible bodies, have the power of acting on one another when they come near
                    enough to do so. The properties of the body, or medium, are determined by the
                    configuration and motion of its small parts.</p>
                <p>The first step in the investigation is to determine the amount of motion which
                    exists among the small parts, independent of the visible motion of the medium as
                    a whole. F or this purpose it is convenient to make use of a general theorem in
                    dynamics due to Clausius.</p>
                <p>When the motion of a material system is such that the time average of the

                    that of stationary motion. When the motion of a material system is such that the
                    sum of the moments of inertia of the system, about three axes at right angles
                    through its centre of mass, never varies by more than small quantities from a
                    constant value, the system is said to be in a state of stationary motion.</p>

                <p>The kinetic energy of a particle is half the product of its mass into the square
                    of its velocity, and the kinetic energy of a system is the sum of the kinetic
                    energy of all its parts.</p>
                <p>When an attraction or repulsion exists between two points, half the product of
                    this stress into the distance between the two points is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">virial</hi> of the stress, and is reckoned positive when the
                    stress is an attraction, and negative when it is a repulsion. The virial of a
                    system is the sum of the virials of the stresses which exist in it. If the
                    system is subjected to the external stress of the pressure of the sides of a
                    vessel in which it is contained, this stress will introduce an amount of virial
                    ⅜pV, where <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the pressure on unit of area and V is the
                    volume of the vessel.</p>
                <p>The theorem of Clausius may now be stated as follows :— In a material system in a
                    state of stationary motion the time-average of the kinetic energy is equal to
                    the timeaverage of the virial. In the case of a fluid enclosed in a vessel</p>
                <p>⅛S(≡' <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) = ⅛&gt;V + ⅜SS(Rr) , where the first term
                    denotes the kinetic energy, and is half the sum of the product of each mass into
                    the mean square of its velocity. In the second term, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is
                    the pressure on unit of surface of the vessel, whose volume is V, and the third
                    term expresses the virial due to the internal actions between the parts of the
                    system. A double symbol of summation is used, because every pair of parts
                    between which any action exists must be taken into account. We have next to show
                    that in gases the principal part of the pressure arises from the motion of the
                    small parts of the medium, and not from a repulsion between them.</p>
                <p>In the first place, if the pressure of a gas arises from the repulsion of its
                    parts, the law of repulsion must be inversely as the distance. For, consider a
                    cube filled with the gas at pressure <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and let the cube
                    expand till each side is <hi rend="italic">n</hi> times its former length. The
                    pressure on unit of surface according to Boyle’s law is now — , and since the
                    area of a face of the cube is n <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> times what it
                    was, the whole pressure on the face of the cube is - of its original value. But
                    since everything has been expanded symmetrically, the distance between
                    corresponding parts of the air is now <hi rend="italic">n</hi> times what it
                    was, and the force is <hi rend="italic">n</hi> times less than it was. Hence the
                    force must vary inversely as the distance.</p>
                <p>But Newton has shown <hi rend="italic">(^Principia,</hi> bk. i. prop. 93) that
                    this law is inadmissible, as it makes the effect of the distant parts of the
                    medium on a particle greater than that of the neighbouring parts. Indeed, we
                    should arrive at the conclusion that the pressure depends not only on the
                    density of the air but on the form and dimensions of the vessel which contains
                    it, which we know not to be the case.</p>
                <p>If, on the other hand, we suppose the pressure to arise entirely from the motion
                    of the molecules of the gas, the interpretation of Boyle’s law becomes very
                    simple. For, in this case pV = <hi rend="smallcaps">⅜S(jmv</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript smallcaps"> 2</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">) .</hi></p>
                <p>The first term is the product of the pressure and the volume, which according to
                    Boyle’s law is constant for the same quantity of gas at the same temperature.
                    The second term is two-thirds of the kinetic energy of the system, and we have
                    every reason to believe that in gases when the temperature is constant the
                    kinetic energy vf unit of mass is also constant. If we admit that the kinetic
                    energy of unit of mass is in a given gas proportional to the absolute
                    temperature, this equation is the expression of the law of Charles as well as of
                    that of Boyle, and may be written—</p>
                <p>pV = R0, where <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> is the temperature reckoned from absolute
                    zero, and R is a constant. The fact that this equation expresses with
                    considerable accuracy the relation between the volume, pressure, and temperature
                    of a gas when in an extremely rarified state, and that as the gas is more and
                    more compressed the deviation from this equation becomes more apparent, shows
                    that the pressure of a gas is due almost entirely to the motion of its molecules
                    when the gas is rare, and that it is only when the density of the gas is
                    considerably increased that the effect of direct action between the molecules
                    becomes apparent.</p>
                <p>The effect of the direct action of the molecules on each other depends on the
                    number of pairs of molecules which at a given instant are near enough to act on
                    one another. The number of such pairs is proportional to the square of the
                    number of molecules in unit of volume, that is, to the square of the density of
                    the gas. Hence, as long a3 the medium is so rare that the encounter between two
                    molecules is not affected by the presence of others, the deviation from Boyle’s
                    law will be proportional to the square of the density. If the action between the
                    molecules is on the whole repulsive, the pressure will be greater than that
                    given by Boyle’s law. If it is, on the whole, attractive, the pressure will be
                    less than that given by Boyle’s law. It appears, by the experiments of Régnault
                    and others, that the pressure does deviate from Boyle’s law when the density of
                    the gas is increased. In the case of carbonic acid and other gases which are
                    easily liquefied, this deviation is very great. In all cases, however, except
                    that of hydrogen, the pressure is less than that given by Boyle’s law, showing
                    that the virial is on the whole due to <hi rend="italic">attractive</hi> forces
                    between the molecules.</p>
                <p>Another kind of evidence as to the nature of the action between the molecules is
                    furnished by an experiment made by Dr Joule. Of two vessels, one was exhausted
                    and the other filled with a gas at a pressure of 20 atmospheres; and both were
                    placed side by side in a vessel of water, which was constantly stirred. The
                    temperature of the whole was observed. Then a communication was opened between
                    the vessels, the compressed gas expanded to twice its volume, and the work of
                    expansion, which at first produced a strong current in the gas, was soon
                    converted into heat by the internal friction of the gas. When all was again at
                    rest, and the temperature uniform, the temperature was again observed. In Dr
                    Joule’s original experiments the observed temperature was the same as before. In
                    a series of experiments, conducted by Dr Joule and Sir W. Thomson on a different
                    plan, by which the thermal effect of free expansion can be more accurately
                    measured, a slight cooling effect was observed in all the gases examined except
                    hydrogen. Since the temperature depends on the velocity of agitation of the
                    molecules, it appears that when a gas expands without doiüg external work the
                    velocity of agitation is not much affected, but that in most cases it is
                    slightly diminished. Now, if the molecules during their mutual separation act on
                    each other, their velocity will increase or diminish according as the force is
                    repulsive or attractive. It appears, therefore, from the experiments on the free
                    expansion of gases, that the force between the molecules is small but, on the
                    whole, attractive.</p>
                <p>Having thus justified the hypothesis that a gas consists of molecules in motion,
                    which act on each other only when they come very close together during an
                    encounter, but which, during the intervals between their encounters which
                    constitute the greater part of their existence, are describing free paths, and
                    are not acted on by any molecular force, we proceed to investigate the motion of
                    such a system.</p>

                    of molecular science. Clausius was the first to express the relation between the
                    density of the gas, the length of the free paths of its molecules, and the
                    distance at which they encounter each other. He assumed, however, at least in
                    his earlier investigations, that the velocities of all the molecules are equal.
                    The mode in which the velocities are distributed was first investigated by the
                    present writer, who showed that in the moving system the velocities of the
                    molecιdes range from zero to infinity, but that the number of molecules whose
                    velocities lie within given limits can be expressed by a formula identical with
                    that which expresses in the theory of errors the number of errors of observation
                    lying within corresponding limits. The proof of this theorem has been carefully
                    investigated by Boltzmann,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    strengthened it where it appeared weak, and to whom the method of taking into
                    account the action of external forces is entirely due.</p>
                <p>The mean kinetic energy of a molecule, however, has a definite value, which is
                    easily expressed in terms of the quantities which enter into the expression for
                    the distribution of velocities. The most important result of this investigation
                    is that when several kinds of molecules are in motion and acting on one another,
                    the mean kinetic energy of a molecule is the same whatever be its mass, the
                    molecules of greater mass having smaller mean velocities. Now, when gases are
                    mixed their temperatures become equal. Hence we conclude that the physical
                    condition which determines that the temperature of two gases shall be the same
                    is that the mean kinetic energies of agitation of the individual molecules of
                    the two gases are equal. This result is of great importance in the theory of
                    heat, though we are not yet able to establish any similar result for bodies in
                    the liquid or solid state.</p>
                <p>In the next place, we know that in the case in which the whole pressure of the
                    medium is due to the motion of its molecules, the pressure on unit of area is
                    numerically equal to two-thirds of the kinetic energy in unit of volume. Hence,
                    if equal volumes of two gases are at equal pressures the kinetic energy is the
                    same in each. If they are also at equal temperatures the mean kinetic energy of
                    each molecule is the same in each. If, therefore, equal volumes of two gases are
                    at equal temperatures and pressures, the number of molecules in each is the
                    same, and therefore, the masses of the two kinds of molecules are in the same
                    ratio as the densities of the gases to which they belong.</p>
                <p>This statement has been believed by chemists since the time of Gay-Lussac, who
                    first established that the weights of the chemical equivalents of different
                    substances are proportional to the densities of these substances when in the
                    form of gas. The definition of the word molecule, however, as employed in the
                    statement of Gay-Lussac’s law is by no means identical with the definition of
                    the same word as in the kinetic theory of gases. The chemists ascertain by
                    experiment the ratios of the masses of the different substances in a compound.
                    From these they deduce the chemical equivalents of the different substances,
                    that of a particular substance, say hydrogen, being taken as unity. The only
                    evidence made use of is that furnished by chemical combinations. It is also
                    assumed, in order to account for the facts of combination, that the reason why
                    substances combine in definite ratios is that the molecules of the substances
                    are in the ratio of their chemical equivalents, and that what we call
                    combination is an action which takes place by a union of a molecule of one
                    substance to a molecule of the other.</p>
                <p>This kind of reasoning, when presented in a proper form and sustained by proper
                    evidence, has a high degree of cogency. But it is purely chemical reasoning; it
                    is not dynamical reasoning. It is founded on chemical experience, not on the
                    laws of motion.</p>
                <p>Our definition of a molecule is purely dynamical. A molecule is that minute
                    portion of a substance which moves about as a whole, so that its parts, if it
                    has any, do not part company during the motion of agitation of the gas. The
                    result of the kinetic theory, therefore, is to give us information about the
                    relative masses of molecules considered as moving bodies. The consistency of
                    this information with the deductions of chemists from the phenomena of
                    combination, greatly strengthens the evidence in favour of the actual existence
                    and motion of gaseous molecules.</p>
                <p>Another confirmation of the theory of molecules is derived from the experiments
                    of Dulong and Petit on the specific heat of gases, from which they deduced the
                    law which bears their name, and which asserts that the specific heats of equal
                    weights of gases are inversely as their combining weights, or, in other words,
                    that the capacities for heat of the chemical equivalents of different gases are
                    equal. We have seen that the temperature is determined by the kinetic energy of
                    agitation of each molecule. The molecule has also a certain amount of energy of
                    internal motion, whether of rotation or of vibration, but the hypothesis of
                    Clausius, that the mean value of the internal energy always bears a proportion
                    fixed for each gas to the energy of agitation, seems highly probable and
                    consistent with experiment. The whole kinetic energy is therefore equal to the
                    energy of agitation multiplied by a certain factor. Thus the energy communicated
                    to a gas by heating it is divided in a certain proportion between the energy of
                    agitation and that of the internal motion of each molecule. For a given rise of
                    temperature the energy of agitation, say of a million molecules, is increased by
                    the same amount whatever be the gas. The heat spent in raising the temperature
                    is measured by the increase of the whole kinetic energy. The thermal capacities,
                    therefore, of equal numbers of molecules of different gases are in the ratio of
                    the factors by which the energy of agitation must be multiplied to obtain the
                    whole energy. As this factor appears to be nearly the same for all gases of the
                    same degree of atomicity, Dulong and Petit’s law is true for such gases.</p>
                <p>Another result of this investigation is of considerable importance in relation to
                    certain theories,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sec

                    aethers or rare media consisting of molecules very much smaller than those of
                    ordinary gases. According to our result, such a medium would be neither more nor
                    less than a gas. Supposing its molecules so small that they can penetrate
                    between the molecules of solid substances such as glass, a so-called vacuum
                    would be full of this rare gas at the observed temperature, and at the pressure,
                    whatever it may be, of the aetherial medium in space. The specific heat,
                    therefore, of the medium in the so-called vacuum will be equal to that of the
                    same volume of any other gas at the same temperature and pressure. Novz, the
                    purpose for which this molecular aether is assumed in these theories is to act
                    on bodies by its pressure, and for this purpose the pressure is generally
                    assumed to be very great. Hence, according to these theories, we should find the
                    specific heat of a so-called vacuum very considerable compared with that of a
                    quantity of air filling the same space.</p>
                <p>We have now made a certain definite amount of progress towards a complete
                    molecular theory of gases. We know the mean velocity of the molecules of each
                    gas in metres per second, and we know the relative masses of the molecules of
                    different gases. We also know that the molecules of one and the same gas are all
                    equal in mass. For if they <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n52/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0052-0041"/> are not, the method of dialysis, as employed by
                    Graham, would enable us to separate the molecules of smaller mass from those of
                    greater, as they would stream through porous substances with greater velocity.
                    We should thus be able to separate a gas, say hydrogen, into two portions,
                    having different densities and other physical properties, different combining
                    weights, and probably different chemical properties of other kinds. As no
                    chemist has yet obtained specimens of hydrogen differing in this way from other
                    specimens, we conclude that all the molecules of hydrogen are of sensibly the
                    same mass, and not merely that their mean mass is a statistical constant of
                    great stability.</p>
                <p>But as yet we have not considered the phenomena which enable us to form an
                    estimate of the actual mass and dimensions of a molecule. It is to Clausius that
                    we owe the first definite conception of the free path of a molecule and of the
                    mean distance travelled by a molecule between successive encounters. He showed
                    that the number of encounters of a molecule in a given time is proportional to
                    the velocity, to the number of molecules in unit of volume, and to the square of
                    the distance between the centres of two molecules when they act on one another
                    so as to have an encounter. From this it appears that if we call this distance
                    of the centres the diameter of a molecule, and the volume of a sphere having
                    this diameter the volume of a molecule, and the sum of the volumes of all the
                    molecules the molecular volume of the gas, then the diameter of a molecule is a
                    certain multiple of the quantity obtained by diminishing the free path in the
                    ratio of the molecular volume of the gas to the whole volume of the gas. The
                    numerical value of this multiple differs slightly, according to the hypothesis
                    we assume about the law of distribution of velocities. · It also depends on the
                    definition of an encounter. When the molecules are regarded as elastic spheres
                    we know what is meant by an encounter, but if they act on each other at a
                    distance by attractive or repulsive forces of finite magnitude, the distance of
                    their centres varies during an encounter, and is not a definite quantity.
                    Nevertheless, the above statement of Clausius enables us, if we know the length
                    of the mean path and the molecular volume of a gas, to form a toleraυly near
                    estimate of the diameter of the sphere of the intense action of a molecule, and
                    thence of the number of molecules in unit of volume and the actual mass of each
                    molecule. To complete the investigation we have, therefore, to determine the
                    mean path and the molecular volume. The first numerical estimate of the mean
                    path of a gaseous molecule was made by the present writer from data derived from
                    the internal friction of air. There are three phenomena which depend on the
                    length of the free path of the molecules of a gas. It is evident that the
                    greater the free path the more rapidly will the molecules travel from one part
                    of the medium to another, because their direction will not be so often altered
                    by encounters with other molecules. If the molecules in different parts of the
                    medium are of different kinds, their progress from one part of the medium to
                    another can be easily traced by analysing portions of the medium taken from
                    different places. The rate of diffusion thus found furnishes one method of
                    estimating the length of the free path of a molecule. This kind of diffusion
                    goes on not only between the molecules of different gases, but among the
                    molecules of the same gas, only in the latter case the results of the diffusion
                    cannot be traced by analysis. But the diffusing molecules carry with them in
                    their free paths the momentum and the energy which they happen at a given
                    instant to have. The diffusion of momentum tends to equalise the apparent motion
                    of different parts of the medium, and constitutes the phenomenon called the
                    internal friction or viscosity of gases. The diffusion of energy tends to
                    equalise the temperature of different parts of the medium, and constitutes the
                    phenomenon of the conduction of heat in gases.</p>
                <p>These three phenomena—the diffusion of matter, of motion, and of heat in
                    gases—have been experimentally investigated,—the diffusion of matter by Graham
                    and Loschmidt, the diffusion of motion by Oscar Meyer and Clerk Maxwell, and
                    that of heat by Stefan.</p>
                <p>These three kinds of experiments give results which in the present imperfect
                    state of the theory and the extreme difficulty of the experiments, especially
                    those on the conduction of heat, may be regarded as tolerably consistent with
                    each other. At the pressure of our atmosphere, and at the temperature of melting
                    ice, the mean path of a molecule of hydrogen is about the lθ,OOOth of a
                    millimetre, or about the fifth part of a wave-length of green light. The mean
                    path of the molecules of other gases is shorter than that of hydrogen.</p>
                <p>The determination of the molecular volume of a gas is subject as yet to
                    considerable uncertainty. The most obvious method is that of compressing the gas
                    till it assumes the liquid form. It seems probable, from the great resistance of
                    liquids to compression, that their molecules are at about the same distance from
                    each other as that at which two molecules of the same substance in the gaseous
                    form act on each other during an encounter. If this is the case, the molecular
                    volume of a gas is somewhat less than the volume of the liquid into which it
                    would be condensed by pressure, or, in other words, the density of the molecules
                    is somewhat greater than that of the liquid.</p>
                <p>Now, we know the relative weights of different molecules with great accuracy,
                    and, from a knowledge of the mean path, we can calculate their relative
                    diameters approximately. From these we can deduce the relative densities of
                    different kinds of molecules. The relative densities so calculated have been
                    compared by Lorenz Meyer with the observed densities of the liquids into which
                    the gases may be condensed, and he finds a remarkable correspondence between
                    them. There is considerable doubt, however, as to the relation between the
                    molecules of a liquid and those of its vapour, so that till a larger number of
                    comparisons have been made, we must not place too much reliance on the
                    calculated densities of molecules. Another, and perhaps a more refined, method
                    is that adopted by Μ. Van der Waals, who deduces the molecular volume from the
                    deviations of the pressure from Boyle’s law as the gas is compressed.</p>
                <p>The first numerical estimate of the diameter of a molecule was that made by
                    Loschmidt in 1865 from the mean path and the molecular volume. Independently of
                    him and of each other, Mr Stoney, in 1868, and Sir W. Thomson, in 1870,
                    published results of a similar kind—those of Thomson being deduced not only in
                    this way, but from considerations derived from the thickness of soap bubbles,
                    and from the electric action between zinc and copper.</p>
                <p>The diameter and the mass of a molecule, as estimated by these methods, are, of
                    course, very small, but by no means infinitely so. About two millions of
                    molecules of hydrogen in a row would occupy a millimetre, and about two hundred
                    million million million of them would weigh a milligramme. These numbers must be
                    considered as exceedingly rough, guesses; they must be corrected by more
                    extensive and accurate experiments as science advances; but the main result,
                    which appears to be well established, is that the determination of the mass of a
                    molecule is a legitimate object of scientific research, and that this mass is by
                    no means immeasurably small.</p>
                <p>Loschmidt illustrates these molecular measurements by a comparison with the
                    smallest magnitudes visible by means of a microscope. Nobert, he tells us, can
                    draw 4000 lines in the breadth of a millimetre. The intervals between <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n53/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0053-0042"/> these lines can be observed with a good
                    microscope. A cube, whose side is the 4000th of a millimetre, may be taken as
                    the <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi><hi rend="italic">visibile</hi> for observers
                    of the present day. Such a cube would contain from 60 to 100 million molecules
                    of oxygen or of nitrogen; but since the molecules of organised substances
                    contain on an average about 50 of the more elementary atoms, we may assume that
                    the smallest organised particle visible under the microscope contains about two
                    million molecules of organic matter. At least half of every living organism
                    consists of water, so that the smallest living being visible under the
                    microscope does not contain more than about a million organic molecules. Some
                    exceedingly simple organism may be supposed built up of not more than a million
                    similar molecules. It is impossible, however, to conceive so small a number
                    sufficient to form a being furnished with a whole system of specialised
                    organs.</p>
                <p>Thus molecular science sets us face to face with physiological theories. It
                    forbids the physiologist from imagining that structural details of infinitely
                    small dimensions can furnish an explanation of the infinite variety which exists
                    in the properties and functions of the most minute organisms.</p>
                <p>A microscopic germ is, we know, capable of development into a highly organised
                    animal. Another germ, equally microscopic, becomes, when developed, an animal of
                    a totally different kind. Do all the differences, infinite in number, which
                    distinguish the one animal from the other, arise each from some difference in
                    the structure of the respective germs? Even if we admit this as possible, we
                    shall be called upon by the advocates of Pangenesis to admit still greater
                    marvels. For the microscopic germ, according to this theory, is no mere
                    individual, but a representative body, containing members collected from every
                    rank of the long-drawn ramification of the ancestral tree, the number of these
                    members being amply sufficient not only to furnish the hereditary
                    characteristics of every organ of the body and every habit of the animal from
                    birth to death, but also to afford a stock of latent gemmules to be passed on in
                    an inactive state from germ to germ, till at last the ancestral peculiarity
                    which it represents is revived in some remote descendant.</p>
                <p>Some of the exponents of this theory of heredity have attempted to elude the
                    difficulty of placing a whole world of wonders within a body so small and so
                    devoid of visible structure as a germ, by using the phrase structureless
                    germs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Seo F. Galton,
                    “On Blood Relationship,” <hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Soc.,</hi> June 13.

                    configuration and motion which it has at a given instant. To explain differences
                    of function and development of a germ without assuming differences of structure
                    is, therefore, to admit that the properties of a germ are not those of a purely
                    material system.</p>
                <p>The evidence as to the nature and motion of molecules, with which we have
                    hitherto been occupied, has been derived from experiments upon gaseous media,
                    the smallest sensible portion of which contains millions of millions of
                    molecules. The constancy and uniformity of the properties of the gaseous medium
                    is the direct result of the inconceivable irregularity of the motion of
                    agitation of its molecules. Any cause which could introduce regularity into the
                    motion of agitation, and marshal the molecules into order and method in their
                    evolutions, might check oι even reverse that tendency to diffusion of matter,
                    motion, and energy, which is one of the most invariable phenomena of nature, and
                    to which Thomson has given the name oi the dissipation of energy.</p>
                <p>Thus, when a sound-wave is passing through a mass of air, this motion is of a
                    certain definite type, and if left to itself the whole motion is passed on to
                    other masses of air, and the sound-wave passes on, leaving the air behind it at
                    rest. Heat, on the other hand, never passes out of a hot body except to enter a
                    colder body, so that the energy of sound-waves, or any other form of energy
                    which is propagated so as to pass wholly out of one portion of the medium and
                    into another, cannot be called heat.</p>
                <p>We have now to turn our attention to a class of molecular motions, which are as
                    remarkable for their regularity as the motion of agitation is for its
                    irregularity.</p>
                <p>It has been found, by means of the spectroscope, that the light emitted by
                    incandescent substances is different according to their state of condensation.
                    When they are in an extremely rarefied condition the spectrum of their light
                    consists of a set of sharply-defined bright lines. As the substance approaches a
                    denser condition the spectrum tends to become continuous, either by the lines
                    becoming broader and less defined, or by new lines and bands appearing between
                    them, till the spectrum at length loses all its characteristics and becomes
                    identical with that of solid bodies when raised to the same temperature.</p>
                <p>Hence the vibrating systems, which are the source of the emitted light, must be
                    vibrating in a different manner in these two cases. When the spectrum consists
                    of a number of bright lines, the motion of the system must be compounded of a
                    corresponding number of types of harmonic vibration.</p>
                <p>In order that a bright line may be sharply defined, the vibratory motion which
                    produces it must be kept up in a perfectly regular manner for some hundreds or
                    thousands of vibrations. If the motion of each of the vibrating bodies is kept
                    up only during a small number of vibrations, then, however regular may be the
                    vibrations of each body while it lasts, the resultant disturbance.of the
                    luminiferous medium, when analysed by the prism, will be found to contain,
                    besides the part due to the regular vibrations, other motions, depending on the
                    starting and stopping of each particular vibrating body, which will become
                    manifest as a diffused luminosity scattered over the whole length of the
                    spectrum. A spectrum of bright lines, therefore, indicates that the vibrating
                    bodies when set in motion are allowed to vibrate in accordance with the
                    conditions of their internal structure for some time before they are again
                    interfered with by external forces.</p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, from spectroscopic evidence that each molecule of a
                    rarefied gas is, during the greater part of its existence, at such a distance
                    from all other molecules that it cxecutes its vibrations in an undisturbed and
                    regular manner. This is the same conclusion to which we were led by
                    considerations of another kind at p. 39.</p>
                <p>We may therefore regard the bright lines in the spectrum of a gas as the result
                    of the vibrations executed by the molecules while describing their free paths.
                    When two molecules separate from one another after an encounter, each of them is
                    in a state of vibration, arising from the unequal action on different parts of
                    the same molecule during the encounter. Hence, though the centre of mass of the
                    molecule describing its free path moves with uniform velocity, the parts of the
                    molecule have a vibratory motion with respect to the centre of mass of the whole
                    molecule, and it is the disturbance of the luminiferous medium communicated to
                    it by the vibrating molecules which constitutes the emitted light.</p>
                <p>We may compare the vibrating molecule to a bell. When struck, the bell is set in
                    motion. This motion is compounded of harmonic vibrations of many different
                    periods, each of which acts on the air, producing notes of as many different
                    pitches. As the bell communicates its motion to the air, these vibrations

                    contains fewer and fewer notes, till at last it is reduced to the fundamental
                    note of the bell. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> If we suppose that there are a
                    great many bells precisely similar to each other, and that they are struck,
                    first one and then another, in a perfectly irregular manner, yet so that, on an
                    average, as many bells are struck in one second of time as in another, and also
                    in such a way that, on an average, any one bell is not again struck till it has
                    ceased to vibrate, then the audible result will appear a continuous sound,
                    composed of the sound emitted by bells in all states of vibration, from the
                    clang of the actual stroke to the final hum of the dying fundamental tone.</p>
                <p>But now let the number of bells be reduced while the same number of strokes are
                    given in a second. Each bell will now. be struck before it has ceased to
                    vibrate, so that in the resulting sound there will be less of the fundamental
                    tone and more of the original clang, till at last, when the peal is reduced to
                    one bell, on which innumerable hammers are continually plying their strokes all
                    out of time, the sound will become a mere noise, in which no musical note can be
                    distinguished.</p>
                <p>In the case of a gas we have an immense number of molecules, each of which ∙is
                    set in vibration when it encounters another molecule, and continues to vibrate
                    as it describes its free path. The molecule is a material system, the parts of
                    which are connected in some definite way, and from the fact that the bright
                    lines of the emitted light have always the same wave-lengths, we learn that the
                    vibrations corresponding to these lines are always executed in the same periodic
                    time, and therefore the force tending to restore any part of the molecule to its
                    position of equilibrium in the molecule must be proportional to its displacement
                    relative to that position.</p>
                <p>From the mathematical theory of the motion of such a system, it appears that the
                    whole motion may be analysed into the following parts, which may be considered
                    each independently of the others:—In the first place, the centre of mass of the
                    system moves with uniform velocity in a straight line. This velocity may have
                    any value. In the second place, there may be a motion of rotation, the angular
                    momentum of the system about its centre of mass remaining during the free path
                    constant in magnitude and direction. This angular momentum may have any value
                    whatever, and its axis may have any direction. In the third place, the remainder
                    of the motion is made up of a number of component motions, each of which is an
                    harmonic vibration of a given type. In each type of vibration the periodic time
                    of vibration is determined by the nature of the system, and is invariable for
                    the same system. The relative amount of motion in different parts of the system
                    is also determinate for each type, but the absolute amount of motion and the
                    phase of the vibration of each type are determined by the particular
                    circumstances of the last encounter, and may vary in any manner from one
                    encounter to another.</p>
                <p>The values of the periodic times of the different types of vibration are given by
                    the roots of a certain equation, the form of which depends on the nature of the
                    connections of the system. In certain exceptionally simple cases, as, for
                    instance, in that of a uniform string stretched between two fixed points, the
                    roots of the equation are connected by simple arithmetical relations, and if the
                    internal structure of a molecule had an analogous kind of simplicity, we might
                    expect to find in the spectrum of the molecule a series of bright lines, whose
                    wave-lengths are in simple arithmetical ratios.</p>
                <p>But if we suppose the molecule to be constituted according to some different
                    type, as, for instance, if it is an elastic sphere, or if it consists of a
                    finite number of atoms kept in their places by attractive and repulsive forces,
                    the roots of the equation will not be connected with each other by any simple
                    relations, but each may be made to vary independently of the others by a
                    suitable change of the connections of the system. Hence, we have no right to
                    expect any definite numerical relatione among the wavelengths of the bright
                    lines of a gas.</p>
                <p>The bright lines of the spectrum of an incandescent gas are therefore due to the
                    harmonic vibrations of the molecules of the gaβ during their free paths. The
                    only effect of the motion of the centre of mass of the molecule is to alter the
                    time of vibration of the light as received by a stationary observer. When the
                    molecule is coming towards the observer, each successive impulse will have a
                    shorter distance to travel before it reaches his eye, and therefore the impulses
                    will appear to succeed each other more rapidly than if the molecule were at
                    rest, and the contrary will be the case if the molecule is receding from the
                    observer. The bright line corresponding to the vibration will therefore be
                    shifted in the spectrum towards the blue end when the molecule is approaching,
                    and towards’the redend when it is receding from the observer. By observations of
                    the displacement of certain lines in the spectrum, Dr Huggins and others have
                    measured the rate of approach or of recession of certain stars with respect to
                    the earth, and Mr Lockyer has determined the rate of motion of tornadoes in the
                    sun. But Lord Rayleigh has pointed out that according to the dynamical theory of
                    gases the molecules are moving hither and thither with so great velocity that,
                    however narrow and sharply-defined any bright line due to a single molecule may
                    be, the displacement of the line towards the blue by the approaching molecules,
                    and towards the red by the receding molecules, will produce a certain amount of
                    widening and blurring of the line in the spectrum, so that there is a limit to
                    the sharpness of definition of the lines of a gas. The widening of the lines due
                    to this cause will be in proportion to the velocity of agitation of the
                    molecules. It will be greatest for the molecules of smallest mass, as those of
                    hydrogen, and it will increase with the temperature. Hence the measurement of
                    the breadth of the hydrogen lines, such as C or F in the spectrum of the solar
                    prominences, may furnish evidence that the temperature of the sun cannot exceed
                    a certain value.</p>

                <p>The equations which form the foundations of the mathematical theory of fluid
                    motion were fully laid down by Lagrange and the great mathematicians of the end
                    of last century, but the number of solutions of cases of fluid motion which had
                    been actually worked out remained very small, and almost all of these belonged
                    to a particular type of fluid motion, which has been since named the
                    irrota-tional type. It had been shown, indeed, by Lagrange, that a perfect
                    fluid, if its motion is at any time irrotational, will continue in all time
                    coming to move in an irrotational manner, so that, by assuming that the fluid
                    was at one time at rest, the calculation of its subsequent motion may be very
                    much simplified.</p>
                <p>It was reserved for Helmholtz to point out the very remarkable properties of
                    rotational motion in a homogeneous incompressible fluid devoid of all viscosity.
                    M e must first define the physical properties of such a fluid. In the first
                    place, it is a material substance. Itβ motion is <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    Part of the energy of motion is, in the case of the bell, dissipated in the
                    substance of the bell in virtue of the viscosity of the metal, and assumes the
                    form of heat, but it is not necessary, for the purpose of illustration, to take
                    this cause of the decay of vibrations into account.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n55/mode/1up"

                <p>continuous in space and time, and if we follow any portion of it as it moves, the
                    mass of that portion remains invariable. These properties it shares with all
                    material substances. In the next place, it is incompressible. The form of a
                    given portion of the fluid may change, but its volume remains invariable; in
                    other words, the density of the fluid remains the same during its motion.
                    Besides this, the fluid is homogeneous, or the density of all parts of the fluid
                    is the same. It is also continuous, so that the mass of the fluid contained
                    within any closed surface is always <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> proportional
                    to the volume contained within that surface. This is equivalent to asserting
                    that the fluid is not made up of molecules; for, if it were, the mass would vary
                    in a discontinuous manner as the volume increases continuously, because first
                    one and then another molecule would be included within the closed surface.
                    Lastly, it is a perfect fluid, or, in other words, the stress between one
                    portion and a contiguous portion is always normal to the surface which separates
                    these portions, and this whether the fluid is at rest or in motion.</p>
                <p>We have seen that in a molecular fluid the interdiffusion of the molecules causes
                    an interdiffusion of motion of different parts of the fluid, so that the action
                    between contiguous parts is no longer normal but in a direction tending to
                    diminish their relative motion. Hence the perfect fluid cannot be molecular.</p>
                <p>All that is necessary in order to form a correct mathematical theory of a
                    material system is that its properties shall be clearly defined and shall be
                    consistent with each other. This is essential; but whether a substance having
                    such properties actually exists is a question which comes to be considered only
                    when we propose to make some practical application of the results of the
                    mathematical theory. The properties of our perfect liquid are clearly defined
                    and consistent with each other, and from the mathematical theory we can deduce
                    remarkable results, some of which may be illustrated in a rough way by means of
                    fluids which are by no means perfect in the sense of not being viscous, such,
                    for instance, as air and water.</p>
                <p>The motion of a fluid is said to be irrotational when it is such that if a
                    spherical portion of the fluid were suddenly solidified, the solid sphere so
                    formed would not be rotating about any axis. When the motion of the fluid is
                    rotational the axis and angular velocity of the rotation of any small part of
                    the fluid are those of a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> spherical portion suddenly
                    solidified.</p>
                <p>The mathematical expression of these definitions is as follows:—Let <hi
                    rend="italic">u, v,</hi> w be the components of the velocity of the fluid at the
                    point (x, <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> z), and let <hi rend="italic">⅛ o_dw du du

                    rend="italic">y</hi> are the components of the velocity of rotation of the fluid

                    y</hi><hi rend="italic">).</hi> The axis of rotation is in the direction of the
                    resultant of α, <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> and γ, and the velocity of rotation,
                    ω, is measured by this resultant.</p>
                <p>A line drawn in the fluid, so that at every point of the line</p>

                    direction coincides at every point with that of the axis of rotation of the
                    fluid.</p>
                <p>We may now prove the theorem of Helmholtz, that the points of the fluid which at
                    any instant lie in the same vortex line continue to lie in the same vortex line

                    velocity of the fluid itself at the same point, and the same thing may be proved
                    of the other components.</p>
                <p>Hence the velocity of the second point on the vortex line is identical with that
                    of the fluid at that point. In other words, the vortex line swims along with the
                    fluid, and is always formed of the same row of fluid particles. The vortex line
                    is therefore no mere mathematical symbol, but has a physical existence
                    continuous in time and space.</p>
                <p>By differentiating equations (1) with respect to <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">z</hi> respectively, and adding the results, we obtain the
                    equation—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">dx dy dz</hi></p>
                <p>This is an equation of the same form with (6), which expresses the condition of
                    flow of a fluid of invariable density. Hence, if we imagine a fluid, quite
                    independent of the original fluid, whose components of velocity are α, <hi
                    rend="italic">β, γ,</hi> this imaginary fluid will flow without altering its
                    density.</p>
                <p>Now, consider a closed curve in space, and let vortex <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n56/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0056-0045"/> lines be drawn in both directions from every
                    point of this curve. These vortex lines will form a tubular surface, which is
                    called a vortex tube or a vortex filament. Since the imaginary fluid flows along
                    the vortex lines without change of density, the quantity which in unit of time
                    flows through any section of the same vortex tube must be the same. Hence, at
                    any section of a vortex tube the product of the area of the section into the
                    mean velocity of rotation is the same. This quantity is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">strength</hi> of the vortex tube.</p>
                <p>A vortex tube cannot begin or end within the fluid; for, if it did, the imaginary
                    fluid, whose velocity components are α, <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> γ, would be
                    generated from nothing at the beginning of the tube, and reduced to nothing at
                    the end of it. Hence, if the tube has a beginning and an end, they must lie on
                    the surface of the fluid mass. If the fluid is infinite the vortex tube must be
                    infinite, or else it must return into itself.</p>
                <p>We have thus arrived at the following remarkable theorems relating to a finite
                    vortex tube in an infinite fluid:—(1.) It returns into itself, forming a closed
                    ring. We may therefore describe it as a vortex <hi rend="italic">ring.</hi> (2.)
                    It always consists of the same portion of the fluid. Hence its volume is
                    invariable. (3.) Its strength remains always the same. Hence the velocity of
                    rotation at any section varies inversely as the area of that section, and that
                    of any segment varies directly as the length of that segment. (4.) No part of
                    the fluid which is not originally in a state of rotational motion can ever enter
                    into that state, and no part of the fluid whose motion is rotational can ever
                    cease to move rotationally. (5.) No vortex tube can ever pass through any other
                    vortex tube, or through any of its own convolutions. Hence, if two vortex tubes
                    are linked together, they can never be separated, and if a single vortex tube is
                    knotted on itself, it can never become untied. (6.) The motion at any instant of
                    every part of tlm fluid, including the vortex rings themselves, may be
                    accurately represented by conceiving an electric current to occupy the place of
                    each vortex ring, the strength of the current being proportional to that of the
                    ring. The magnetic force at any point of space will then represent in direction
                    and magnitude the velocity of the fluid at the corresponding point of the
                    fluid.</p>
                <p>These properties of vortex rings suggested to Sir William Thomson<note

                    atomic theory. The conditions which must be satisfied by an atom are—permanence
                    in magnitude, capability of internal motion or vibration, and a sufficient
                    amount of possible characteristics to account for the difference between atoms
                    of different kinds.</p>
                <p>The small hard body imagined by Lucretius, and adopted by Newton, was invented
                    for the express purpose of accounting for the permanence of the properties of
                    bodies. But it fails to account for the vibrations of a molecule as revealed by
                    the spectroscope. We may indeed suppose the atom elastic, but this is to endow
                    it with the very property for the explanation of which, as exhibited in
                    aggregate bodies, the atomic constitution was originally assumed. The massive
                    centres of force imagined by Eoscovich may have more to recommend them to the
                    mathematician, who has no scruple in supposing them to be invested with the
                    power of attracting and repelling according to any law of the distance which it
                    may please him to assign. Such centres of force are no doubt in their own nature
                    indivisible, but then they are also, singly, incapable of vibration. To obtain
                    vibrations we must imagine molecules consisting of many such centres, but, in so
                    doing, the possibility of these centres being separated altogether is again
                    introduced.</p>
                <p>Besides, it is in questionable scientific taste, after using atoms so freely to
                    get rid of forces acting at sensible distances, to make the whole function of
                    the atoms an action at insensible distances.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the vortex ring of Helmholtz, imagined as the true form of the
                    atom by Thomson, satisfies more of the conditions than any atom hitherto
                    imagined. In the first place, it is quantitatively permanent, as regards its
                    volume and its strength,—two independent quantities. It is also qualitatively
                    permanent as regards its degree of implication, whether “knottedness” on itself
                    or “linked-ness” with other vortex rings. At the same time, it is capable of
                    infinite changes of form, and may execute vibrations of different periods, as we
                    know that molecules do. And the number of essentially different implications of
                    vortex rings may be very great without supposing the degree of implication of
                    any of them very high.</p>
                <p>But the greatest recommendation of this theory, from a philosophical point of
                    view, is that its success in explaining phenomena does not depend on the
                    ingenuity with which its contrivers “save appearances,” by introducing first one
                    hypothetical force and then another. When the vortex atom is once set in motion,
                    all its properties are absolutely fixed and determined by the laws of motion of
                    the primitive fluid, which are fully expressed in the fundamental equations. The
                    disciple of Lucretius may cut and carve his solid atoms in the hope of getting
                    them to combine into worlds; the follower of Boscovich may imagine new laws of
                    force to meet the requirements of each new phenomenon; but he who dares to plant
                    his feet in the path opened up by Helmholtz and Thomson has no such resources.
                    His primitive fluid has no other properties than inertia, invariable density,
                    and perfect mobility, and the method by which the motion of this fluid is to be
                    traced is pure mathematical analysis. The difficulties of this method are
                    enormous, but the glory of surmounting them would be unique.</p>
                <p>There seems to be little doubt that an encounter between two vortex atoms would
                    be in its general character similar to those which we have already described.
                    Indeed, the encounter between two smoke rings in air gives a verv lively
                    illustration of the elasticity of vortex rings.</p>
                <p>But one of the first, if not the very first desideratum in a complete theory of
                    matter is to explain—first, mass, and second, gravitation. To explain mass may
                    seem an absurd achievement. We generally suppose that it is of the essence of
                    matter to be the receptacle of momentum and energy, and even Thomson, in his
                    definition of his primitive fluid, attributes to it the possession of mass. But
                    according to Thomson, though the primitive fluid is the only true matter, yet
                    that which we call matter is not the primitive fluid itself, but a mode of
                    motion of that primitive fluid. It is the mode of motion which constitutes the
                    vortex rings, and which furnishes us with examples of that permanence and
                    continuity of existence which we are accustomed to attribute to matter itself.
                    The primitive fluid, the only true matter, entirely eludes our perceptions when
                    it is not endued with the mode of motion which converts certain portions of it
                    into vortex rings, and thus renders it molecular.</p>
                <p>In Thomson’s theory, therefore, the mass of bodies requires explanation. We have
                    to explain the inertia of what is only a mode of motion, and inertia is a
                    property of matter, not of modes of motion. It is true that a vortex ring at any
                    given instant has a definite momentum and a definite energy, but to show that
                    bodies built up of vortex rings would have such momentum and energy as we know
                    them to have is, in the present state of the theory, a very difficult task.</p>
                <p>It may seem hard to say of an infant theory that it is bound to explain
                    gravitation. Since the time of Newton, <pb break="no"

                    expounded, till it has gradually acquired the character rather of an ultimate
                    fact than of a fact to be explained.</p>
                <p>It seems doubtful whether Lucretius considers gravitation to be an essential
                    property of matter, as he seems to assert in the very remarkable lines—</p>

                <p>If this is the true opinion of Lucretius, and if the downward flight of the atoms
                    arises, in his view, from their own gravity, it seems very doubtful whether he
                    attributed the weight of sensible bodies to the impact of the atoms. The latter
                    opinion is that of Le Sage, of Geneva, propounded in his <hi rend="italic"

                    with a second treatise of his own, by Pierre Prevost, of Geneva, in 1818.<note

                    Leray, Paris. 1869.</p></note> The theory of Le Sage is that the gravitation of
                    bodies towards each other is caused by the impact of streams of atoms flying in
                    all directions through space. These atoms he calls ultramundane corpuscules,
                    because he conceives them to come in all directions from regions far beyond that
                    part of the system of the world which is in any way known to us. He supposes
                    each of them to be so small that a collision with another ultramundane
                    corpuscule is an event of very rare occurrence. It is by striking against the
                    molecules of gross matter that they discharge their function of drawing bodies
                    towards each other. A body placed by itself in free space and exposed to the
                    impacts of these corpuscules would be bandied about by them in all directions,
                    but because, on the whole, it receives as many blows on one side as on another,
                    it cannot thereby acquire any sensible velocity. But if there are two bodies in
                    space, each of them will screen the other from a certain proportion of the
                    corpuscular bombardment, so that a smaller number of corpuscules will strike
                    either body on that side which is next the other body, while the number of
                    corpuscules which strike it in other directions remains the same.</p>
                <p>Each body will therefore be urged towards the other by the effect of the excess
                    of the impacts it receives on the side furthest from the other. If we take
                    account of the impacts of those corpuscules only which come directly from
                    infinite space, and leave out of consideration those which have already struck
                    mundane bodies, it is easy to calculate the result on the two bodies, supposing
                    their dimensions small compared with the distance between them.</p>
                <p>The force of attraction would vary directly as the product of the areas of the
                    sections of the bodies taken normal to the distance and inversely as the square
                    of the distance between them.</p>
                <p>Now, the attraction of gravitation varies as the product of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >masses</hi> of the bodies between which it acts, and inversely as the square of
                    the distance between them. If, then, we can imagine a constitution of bodies
                    such that the effective areas of the bodies are proportional to their masses, we
                    shall make the two laws coincide. Here, then, seems to be a path leading towards
                    an explanation of the law of gravitation, which, if it can be shown to be in
                    other respects consistent with facts, may turn out to be a royal road into the
                    very arcana of science.</p>
                <p>Le Sage himself shows that, in order to make the effective area of a body, in
                    virtue of which it acts as a screen to the streams of ultramundane corpuscules,
                    proportional to the mass of the body, whether the body be large or small, we
                    must admit that the size of the solid atoms of the body is exceedingly small
                    compared with the distances between them, so that a very small proportion of the
                    corpuscules are stopped even by the densest and largest bodies. W <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> e may picture to ourselves the streams of corpuscules
                    coming in every direction, like light from a uniformly illuminated sky. We may
                    imagine a material body to consist of a congeries of atoms at considerable
                    distances from each other, and we may represent this by a swarm of insects
                    flying in the air. To an observer at a distance this swarm will be visible as a
                    slight darkening of the sky in a certain quarter. This darkening will represent
                    the action of the material body in stopping the flight of the corpuscules. Now,
                    iftl.o proportion of light stopped by the swarm is very small, two such swarms
                    will stop nearly the same amount of light, whether they are in a line with the
                    eye or not, but if one of them stops an appreciable proportion of light, there
                    will not be so much left to be stopped by the other, and the effect of two
                    swarms in a line with the eye will be less than the sum of the tw o effects
                    separately.</p>
                <p>Now, we know that the effect of the attraction of the sun and earth on the moon
                    is not appreciably different when the moon is eclipsed than on other occasions
                    when full moon occurs without an eclipse. This show's that the number of the
                    corpuscules which are stopped by bodies of the size and mass of the earth, and
                    even the sun, is very small compared with the number which pass straight through
                    the earth or the sun without striking a single molecule. To the streams of
                    corpuscules the earth and the sun are mere systems of atoms scattered in space,
                    which present far more openings than obstacles to their rectilinear flight.</p>
                <p>Such is the ingenious doctrine of Le Sage, by which he endeavours to explain
                    universal gravitation. Let us try to form some estimate of this continual
                    bombardment of ultramundane corpuscules which is being kept up on all sides of
                    us.</p>
                <p>We have seen that the sun stops but a very small fraction of the corpuscules
                    which enter it. The earth, being a smaller body, stops a still smaller
                    proportion of them. The proportion of those which are stopped by a small body,
                    say a 1 lb shot, must be smaller still in an enormous degree, because its
                    thickness is exceedingly small compared with that of the earth.</p>
                <p>Now, the weight of the ball, or its tendency towards the earth, is produced,
                    according to this theory, by the excess of the impacts of the corpuscules which
                    come from above over the impacts of those which come from below, and have passed
                    through the earth. Either of these quantities is an exceedingly small fraction
                    of the momentum of the whole number of corpuscules which pass through the ball
                    in a second, and their difference is a small fraction of either, and yet it is
                    equivalent to the weight of a pound. The velocity of the corpuscules must be
                    enormously greater than that of any of the heavenly bodies, otherwise, as may
                    easily be shown, they would act as a resisting medium opposing the motion of the
                    planets. Now, the energy of a moving system is half the product of its momentum
                    into its velocity. Hence the energy of the corpuscules, which by their impacts
                    on the ball during one second urge it towards the earth, must be a number of
                    foot-pounds equal to the number of feet over which a corpuscule travels in a
                    second, that is to say, not less than thousands of millions. But this is only a
                    small fraction of the energy of all the impacts which the atoms of the ball
                    receive from the innumerable streams of corpuscules which fall upon it in all
                    directions.</p>
                <p>Hence the rate at which the energy of the corpuscules is spent in order to
                    maintain the gravitating property of a single pound, is at least millions of
                    millions of foot-pounds per second.</p>
                <p>What becomes of this enormous quantity of energy? If the corpuscules, after
                    striking the atoms, fly off with a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n58/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0058-0047"/> velocity equal to that which they had before,
                    they will carry their energy away with them into the ultramundane regions. But
                    if this be the case, then the corpuscules rebounding from the body in any given
                    direction will be both in number and in velocity exactly equivalent to those
                    which are prevented from proceeding in that direction by being deflected by the
                    body, and it may be shown that this will be the case whatever be the shape of
                    the body, and hθλvever many bodies may be present in the field. Thus, the
                    rebounding corpuscules exactly make up for those which are deflected by the
                    body, and there will be no excess of the impacts on any other body in one
                    direction or another.</p>
                <p>The explanation of gravitation, therefore, falls to the ground if the corpuscules
                    are like perfectly elastic spheres, aud rebound with a velocity of separation
                    equal to that of approach. If, on the other hand, they rebound with a smaller
                    velocity, the effect of attraction between the bodies will no doubt be produced,
                    but then we have to find what becomes of the energy which the molecules have
                    brought with them but have not carried away.</p>
                <p>If any appreciable fraction of this energy is communicated to the body in the
                    form of heat, the amount of heat so generated would in a few seconds raise it,
                    and in like manner the whole material universe, to a white heat.</p>
                <p>It has been suggested by Sir W. Thomson that the corpuscules may be so
                    constructed so to carry off their energy with them, provided that part of their
                    kinetic energy is transformed, during impact, from energy of translation to
                    energy of rotation or vibration. For this purpose the corpuscules must be
                    material systems, not mere points. Thomson suggests that they are vortex atoms,
                    which are set into a state of vibration at impact, and go off with a smaller
                    velocity of translation, but in a state of violent vibration. He has also
                    suggested the possibility of the vortex corpuscule regaining its swiftness and
                    losing part of its vibratory agitation by communion -with its kindred
                    corpuscules in infinite space.</p>
                <p>We have devoted more space to this theory than it seems to deserve, because it is
                    ingenious, and because it is the only theory of the cause of gravitation which
                    has been so far developed as to be capable of being attacked and defended. It
                    does not appear to us that it can account for the temperature of bodies
                    remaining moderate while their atoms are exposed to the bombardment. The
                    temperature of bodies must tend to approach that at which the average kinetic
                    energy of a molecule of the body would be equal to the average kinetic energy of
                    an ultramundane corpuscule.</p>
                <p>Now, suppose a plane surface to exist which stops <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the
                    corpuscules. The pressure on this plane will be <hi rend="italic">p</hi> = NM?t
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> where M is the mass of a corpuscule, N the number
                    in unit of volume, and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> its velocity normal to the
                    plane. Now, we know that the very greatest pressure existing in the universe
                    must be much less than the pressure <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> which would be
                    exerted against a body which stops all the corpuscules. We are also tolerably
                    certain that N, the number of corpuscules which are at any one time within unit
                    of volume, is small compared with the value of N for the molecules of ordinary
                    bodies. Hence, Mu <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> must be enormous compared with
                    the corresponding quantity for ordinary bodies, and it follows that the impact
                    of the corpuscules would raise all bodies to an enormous temperature. We may
                    also observe that according to this theory the habitable universe, which we are
                    accustomed to regard as the scene of a magnificent illustration of the
                    conservation of energy as the fundamental principle of all nature, is in reality
                    maintained in working order only by an enormous expenditure of external power,
                    which would be nothing less than ruinous if the supply were drawn from anywhere
                    else than from the infinitude of space, and which, if the contrivances of the
                    most eminent mathematicians should be found in any respect defective, might at
                    any moment tear the whole universe atom from atom.</p>
                <p>We must now leave these speculations about the nature of molecules and the cause
                    of gravitation, and contemplate the material universe as made up of molecules.
                    Every molecule, so far as we know, belongs to one of a definite number of
                    species. The list of chemical elements may be taken as representing the known
                    species which have been examined in the laboratories. Several of these have been
                    discovered by means of the spectroscope, and more may yet remain to be
                    discovered in the same way. The spectroscope has also been applied to analyse
                    the light of the sun, the brighter stars, and some of the nebulae and comets,
                    and has shown that the character of the light emitted by these bodies is similar
                    in some cases to that emitted by terrestrial molecules, and in others to light
                    from which the molecules have absorbed certain rays. In this way a considerable
                    number of coincidences have been traced between the systems of lines belonging
                    to particular terrestrial substances and corresponding lines in the spectra of
                    the heavenly bodies.</p>
                <p>The value of the evidence furnished by such coincidences may be estimated by
                    considering the degree of accuracy with which one such coincidence may be
                    observed. The interval between the two lines which form Fraunhofer’s line D is
                    about the five hundredth part of the interval between B and G on Kirchhoff’s
                    scale. A discordance between the positions of two lines amounting to the tenth
                    part of this interval, that is to say, the five thousandth part of the length of
                    the bright part of the spectrum, would be very perceptible in a spectroscope of
                    moderate power. We may define the power of the spectroscope to be the number of
                    times which the smallest measurable interval is contained in the length of the
                    visible spectrum. Let us denote this by <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> In the case we
                    have supposed <hi rend="italic">p</hi> will be about 5000.</p>
                <p>If the spectrum of the sun contains <hi rend="italic">n</hi> lines of a certain
                    degree of intensity, the probability that any one line of the spectrum of a gas
                    will coincide with one of these <hi rend="italic">n</hi> lines is and when <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> is large compared with n, this becomes nearly If there are
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi> lines in the spectrum of the gas, the probability that
                    each and every one shall coincide <hi rend="italic superscript"> f</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fli</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi> with a line in the
                    solar spectrum is approximately —* <hi rend="italic">p</hi> Hence, in the case
                    of a gas whose spectrum contains several lines, we have to compare the results
                    of two hypotheses. If a large amount of the gas exists in the sun, we have the
                    strongest reason for expecting to find all the <hi rend="italic">r</hi> lines in
                    the solar spectrum. If it does not exist, the probability that <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> lines out of the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> observed lines shall coincide
                    with the lines of the gas is exceedingly small. If, then, we find all the <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> lines in their proper places in the solar spectrum, we have
                    very strong grounds for believing that the gas exists in the sun. The
                    probability that the gas exists in the sun is greatly strengthened if the
                    character of the lines as to relative intensity and breadth is found to
                    correspond in the two spectra.</p>
                <p>The absence of one or more lines of the gas in the solar spectrum tends of course
                    to weaken the probability, but the amount to be deducted from the probability
                    must depend on what we know of the variation in the relative intensity of the
                    lines when the temperature and the pressure of the gas are made to vary.</p>
                <p>Coincidences observed, in the case of several terrestrial substances, with
                    several systems of lines in the spectra of the heavenly bodies, tend to increase
                    the evidence for the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n59/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0059-0048"/> doctrine that terrestrial substances exist in the
                    heavenly bodies, while the discovery of particular lines in a celestial spectrum
                    which do not coincide with any line in a terrestrial spectrum does not much
                    weaken the general argument, but rather indicates either that a substance exists
                    in the heavenly body not yet detected by chemists on earth, or that the
                    temperature of the heavenly body is such that some substance, undecomposable by
                    our methods, is there split up into components unknown to us in their separate
                    state.</p>
                <p>We are thus led to believe that in widely-separated parts of the visible universe
                    molecules exist of various kinds, the molecules of each kind having their
                    various periods of vibration either identical, or so nearly identical that our
                    spectroscopes cannot distinguish them. We might argue from this that these
                    molecules are alike in all other respects, as, for instance, in mass. But it is
                    sufficient for our present purpose to observe that the same kind of molecule,
                    say that of hydrogen, has the same set of periods of vibration, whether we
                    procure the hydrogen from water, from coal, or from meteoric iron, and that
                    light, having the same set of periods of vibration, comes to us from the sun,
                    from Sirius, and from Arcturus.</p>
                <p>The same kind of reasoning which led us to believe that hydrogen exists in the
                    sun and stars, also leads us to believe that the molecules of hydrogen in all
                    these bodies had a common origin. For a material system capable of vibration may
                    have for its periods of vibration any set of values whatever. The probability,
                    therefore, that two material systems, quite independent of each other, shall
                    have, to the degree of accuracy of modern spectroscopic measurements, the same
                    set of periods of vibration, is so very small that we are forced to believe that
                    the two systems are not independent of each other. When, instead of two such
                    systems, we have innumerable multitudes all having the same set of periods, the
                    argument is immensely strengthened.</p>
                <p>Admitting, then, that there is a real relation between any two molecules of
                    hydrogen, let us consider what this relation may be.</p>
                <p>We may conceive of a mutual action between one body and another tending to
                    assimilate them. Two clocks, for instance, will keep time "with each other if
                    connected by a wooden rod, though they have different rates if they were
                    disconnected. But even if the properties of a molecule were as capable of
                    modification as those of a clock, there is no physical connection of a
                    sufficient kind between Sirius and Arcturus.</p>
                <p>There are also methods by which a large number of bodies differing from each
                    other may be sorted into sets, so that those in each set more or less resemble
                    each other. In the manufacture of small shot this is done by making the shot
                    roll down an inclined plane. The largest specimens acquire the greatest
                    velocities, and are projected farther than the smaller ones. In this way the
                    various pellets, which differ both in size and in roundness, are sorted into
                    different kinds, those belonging to each kind being nearly of the same size, and
                    those which are not tolerably spherical being rejected altogether.</p>
                <p>If the molecules were originally as various as these leaden pellets, and were
                    afterwards sorted into kinds, we should have to account for the disappearance of
                    all the molecules which did not fall under one of the very limited number of
                    kinds known to us; and to get rid of a number of indestructible bodies,
                    exceeding by far the number of the molecules of all the recognised kinds, would
                    be one of the severest labours ever proposed to a cosmogonist.</p>
                <p>It is well known that living beings may be grouped into a certain number of
                    species, defined with more or less precision, and that it is difficult or
                    impossible to find a series of individuals forming the links of a continuous
                    chain between one species and another. In the case of living beings, however,
                    the generation of individuals is always going on, each individual differing more
                    or less from its parents. Each individual during its whole life is undergoing
                    modification, and it either survives and propagates its species, or dies early,
                    accordingly as it is more or less adapted to the circumstances of its
                    environment. Hence, it has been found possible to frame a theory of the
                    distribution of organisms into species by means of generation, variation, and
                    discriminative destruction. But a theory of evolution of this kind cannot be
                    applied to the case of molecules, for the individual molecules neither are born
                    nor die, they have neither parents nor offspring, and so far from being modified
                    by their environment, we find that two molecules of the same kind, say of
                    hydrogen, have the same properties, though one has been compounded with carbon
                    and buried in the earth as coal for untold ages, while the other has been
                    “occluded” in the iron of a meteorite, and after unknown wanderings in the
                    heavens has at last fallen into the hands of some terrestrial chemist.</p>
                <p>The process by which the molecules become distributed into distinct species is
                    not one of which we know any instances going on at present, or of which we have
                    as yet been able to form any mental representation. If we suppose that the
                    molecules known to us are built up each of some moderate number of atoms, these
                    atoms being all of them exactly alike, then we may attribute the limited number
                    of molecular species to the limited number of ways in which the primitive atoms
                    may be combined so as to form a permanent system.</p>
                <p>But though this hypothesis gets rid of the difficulty of accounting for the
                    independent origin of different species of molecules, it merely transfers the
                    difficulty from the known molecules to the primitive atoms. How did the atoms
                    come to be all alike in those properties which are in themselves capable of
                    assuming any value 1</p>
                <p>If we adopt the theory of Boscovich, and assert that the primitive atom is a mere
                    centre of force, having a certain definite mas3, we may get over the difficulty
                    about the equality of the mass of all atoms by laying it down as a doctrine
                    which cannot be disproved by experiment, that mass is not a quantity capable of
                    continuous increase or diminution, but that it is in its own nature
                    discontinuous, like number, the atom being the unit, and all masses being
                    multiples of that unit. We have no evidence that it is possible for the ratio of
                    two masses to be an incommensurable quantity, for the incommensurable quantities
                    in geometry are supposed to be traced out in a continuous medium. If matter is
                    atomic, and therefore discontinuous, it is unfitted for the construction of
                    perfect geometrical models, but in other respects it may fulfil its
                    functions.</p>
                <p>But even if we adopt a theory which makes the equality of the mass of different
                    atoms a result depending on the nature of mass rather than on any quantitative
                    adjustment, the correspondence of the periods of vibration of actual molecules
                    is a fact of a different order.</p>
                <p>We know that radiations exist having periods of vibration of every value between
                    those corresponding to the limits of the visible spectrum, and probably far
                    beyond these limits on both sides. The most powerful spectroscope can detect no
                    gap or discontinuity in the spectrum of the light emitted by incandescent
                    lime.</p>
                <p>The period of vibration of a luminous particle is therefore a quantity which in
                    itself is capable of assuming any one of a series of values, which, if not
                    mathematically continuous, is such that consecutive observed values differ from
                    each other by less than the ten thousandth part of either. There is, therefore,
                    nothing in the nature of time itself to prevent the period of vibration of a
                    molecule from assuming any one of many thousand different observable <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n60/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0060-0049"/> value3. That which determines the period of any
                    particular kind of vibration is the relation which subsists between the
                    corresponding type of displacement and the force of restitution thereby called
                    into play, a relation involving constants of space and time as well as of
                    mas3.</p>
                <p>It is the equality of these space-and time-constants for all molecules of the
                    same kind which we have next to consider. We have seen that the very different
                    circumstances in w hich different molecules of the same kind have been placed
                    have not, even in the course of many ages, produced any appreciable difference
                    in the values of these constants. If, then, the various processes of nature to
                    which these molecules have been subjected since the world began have not been
                    able in all that time to produce any appreciable difference between the
                    constants of one molecule and those of another, we are forced to conclude that
                    it is not to the operation of any of these processes that the uniformity of the
                    constants is due.</p>
                <p>The formation of the molecule is therefore an event not belonging to that order
                    of nature under which we live. It is an operation of a kind which is not, so far
                    as we are aware, going on on earth or in the sun or the stars, either now or
                    since these bodies began to be formed. It must be referred to the epoch, not of
                    the formation of the earth or of the solar system, but of the establishment of
                    the existing order of nature, and till not only these worlds and systems, but
                    the very order of nature itself is dissolved, we have no reason to expect the
                    occurrence of any operation of a similar kind.</p>
                <p>In the present state of science, therefore, we have strong reasons for believing
                    that in a molecule, or if not in a molecule, in one of its component atoms, we
                    have something which has existed either from eternity or at least from times
                    anterior to the existing order of nature. But besides this atom, there are
                    immense numbers of other atoms of the same kind, and the constants of each of
                    these atoms are incapable of adjustment by any process now in action. Each is
                    physically independent of all the others.</p>
                <p>Whether or not the conception of a multitude of beings existing from all eternity
                    is in itself self-contradictory, the conception becomes palpably absurd when we
                    attribute a relation of quantitative equality to all these beings. We are then
                    forced to look beyond them to some common cause or common origin to explain why
                    this singular relation of equality exists, rather than any one of the infinite
                    number of possible relations of inequality.</p>
                <p>Science is incompetent to reason upon the creation of matter itself out of
                    nothing. We have reached the utmost limit of our thinking faculties when we have
                    admitted that, because matter cannot be eternal and self-existent, it must have
                    been created. It is only when we contemplate not matter in itself, but the form
                    in which it actually exists, that our mind finde something on which it can lay
                    hold.</p>
                <p>That matter, as such, should have certain fundamental properties, that it should
                    have a continuous existence in space and time, that all action should be between
                    two portions of matter, and so on, are truths which may, for aught we know, be
                    of the kind which metaphysicians call necessary. We may use our knowledge of
                    such truths for purposes of deduction, but we have no data for speculating on
                    their origin.</p>
                <p>But the equality of the constants of the molecules is a fact of a very different
                    order. It arises from a particular distribution of matter, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >collocation,</hi> to use the expression of Dr Chalmers, of things which we have
                    no difficulty in imagining to have been arranged otherwise. But many of the
                    ordinary instances of collocation are adjustments of constants, which are not
                    only arbitrary in their own nature, but in which variations actually occur; ·
                    and when it is pointed out that these adjustments are beneficial to living
                    beings, and are therefore instances of benevolent design, it is replied that
                    those variations which are not conducive to the growth and multiplication of
                    living beings tend to their destruction, and to the removal thereby of the
                    evidence of any adjustment not beneficial.</p>
                <p>The constitution of an atom, however, is such as to render it, so far as we can
                    judge, independent of all the dangers arising from the struggle for existence.
                    Plausible reasons may, no doubt, be assigned for believing that if the constants
                    had varied from atom to atom through any sensible range, the bodies formed by
                    aggregates of such atoms would not have been so well fitted for the construction
                    of the w orld as the bodies which actually exist. But as we have no experience
                    of bodies formed of such variable atoms this must remain a bare conjecture.</p>
                <p>Atoms have been compared by Sir J. Herschel to manufactured articles, on account
                    of their uniformity. The uniformity of manufactured articles may be traced to
                    very different motives on the part of the manufacturer. In certain cases it is
                    found to be less expensive as regards trouble, as well as cost, to make a great
                    many objects exactly alike than to adapt each to its special requirements. Thus,
                    shoes for soldiers are made in large numbers without any designed adaptation to
                    the feet of particular men. In another class of cases the uniformity is
                    intentional, and is designed to make the manufactured article more valuable.
                    Thus, Whitworth’s bolts are made in a certain number of sizes, so that if one
                    bolt is lost, another may be got at once, and accurately fitted to its place.
                    The identity of the arrangement of the words in the different copies of a
                    document or book is a matter of great practical importance, and it is more
                    perfectly secured by the process of printing than by that of manuscript
                    copying.</p>
                <p>In a third class not a part only but the whole of the value of the object arises
                    from its exact conformity to a given standard. Weights and measures belong to
                    this class, and the existence of many well-adjusted material standards of weight
                    and measure in any country furnishes evidence of the existence of a system of
                    law regulating the transactions of the inhabitants, and enjoining in all
                    professed measures a conformity to the national standard.</p>
                <p>There are thus three kinds of usefulness in manufactured articles—cheapness,
                    serviceableness, and quantitative accuracy. Which of these was present to the
                    mind of Sir J. Herschel we cannot now positively affirm, but it was at least as
                    likely to have been the last as the first, though it seems more probable that he
                    meant to assert that a number of exactly similar things cannot be each of them
                    eternal and self-existent, and must therefore have been made, and that he used
                    the phrase “manufactured article” to suggest the idea of their being made in
                    great numbers.</p>
