                <p><label type="entry">AXIOM</label>, from the Greek <hi rend="italic">αξίωμα,</hi>
                    is a word of great import both in general philosophy and in special science; it
                    also has passed into the language of common life, being applied to any assertion
                    of the truth of which the speaker happens to have a strong conviction, or which
                    is put forward as beyond question. The scientific use of the word is most
                    familiar in mathematics, where it is customary to lay down, under the name of
                    axioms, a number of propositions of which no proof is given or considered
                    necessary, though the reason for such procedure may not be the same in every
                    case, and in the same case may be variously understood by different minds. Thus
                    scientific axioms, mathematical or other, are sometimes held to carry with them
                    an inherent authority or to be self-evident, wherein it is, strictly speaking,
                    implied that they cannot be made the subject of formal proof; sometimes they are
                    held to admit of proof, but not within the particular science in which they are
                    advanced as principles; while, again, sometimes the name of axiom is given to
                    propositions that admit of proof within the science, but so evidently that they
                    may be straightway assumed. Axioms that are genuine principles, though raised
                    above discussion within the science, are not therefore raised above discussion
                    altogether. From the time of Aristotle it has been claimed for general or first
                    philosophy to deal with the principles of special science, and hence have arisen
                    the questions concerning the nature and origin of axioms so much debated among
                    the philosophic schools. Besides, the general philosopher himself, having to
                    treat of human knowledge and its conditions as his particular subject-matter, is
                    called to determine the principles of certitude, which, as there can be none
                    higher, must have in a peculiar sense that character of ultimate authority
                    (however explicable) that is ascribed to axioms; and by this name, accordingly,
                    such highest principles of knowledge have long been called. In the case of a
                    word so variously employed there is, perhaps, no better way of understanding its
                    proper signification than by considering it first in the historical light—not to
                    say that there hangs about the origin and early use of the name an obscurity
                    which it is of importance to dispell.</p>
                <p>The earliest use of the word in a logical sense appears in the works of
                    Aristotle, though, as will presently be shown, it had probably acquired such a
                    meaning before his time, and only received from him a more exact determination.
                    In his theory of demonstration, set forth in the <hi rend="italic">Posterior
                        Analytics,</hi> he gives the name of axiom to that immediate principle of
                    syllogistic reasoning which a learner must bring with him (i. 2, 6); again,
                    axioms are said to be the common principles from which all demonstration takes
                    place—common to all demonstrative sciences, but varying in expression according
                    to the subject-matter of each (i. 10, 4). The principle of all other axioms—the
                    surest of all principles —is that called later the principle of Contradiction,
                    indemonstrable itself, and thus fitted to be the ground of all demonstration <hi
                        rend="italic">(Metaph.,</hi> iii. 2, iv. 3). Aristotle’s followers, and,
                    later on, the commentators, with glosses of their own, repeat his statements.
                    Thus, according to Themistius <hi rend="italic">(ad Post. Anal.),</hi> two
                    species of axioms were distinguished by Theophrastus—one species holding of all
                    things absolutely, as the principle (later known by the name) of Excluded
                    Middle, the other of all things of the same kind, as that the remainders of
                    equals are equal. These, adds Themistius himself, are, as it were, connate and
                    common to all, and hence their name Axiom; “for what is put over either all
                    things absolutely or things of one sort universally, we consider to have
                    precedence with respect to them.” The same view of the origin of the name
                    reappears in Boethius’s Latin substitutes for it— <hi rend="italic"
                        >dignitas</hi><hi rend="italic">anàmaxima</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(propositio),</hi> the latter preserved in the word Maxim, which is often
                    used interchangeably with Axiom. In Aristotle, however, there is no suggestion
                    of such a meaning. As the verb <hi rend="italic">aξ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">aυv</hi> changes its original meaning of <hi
                        rend="italic">deem worthy</hi> into <hi rend="italic">think fit, think</hi>
                    simply, and also <hi rend="italic">claim</hi> or <hi rend="italic">require,</hi>
                    it might as well be maintained that <hi rend="italic">αξίωμα</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">—</hi> which Aristotle himself employe in its original ethical
                    sense of <hi rend="italic">worth,</hi> also in the secondary senses of <hi
                        rend="italic">opinion</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dictum (Metaph.,</hi> iii.
                    4), and of simple <hi rend="italic">proposition (Topics,</hi> viii. 1)—was
                    conferred upon the highest principles of reasoning and science because the
                    teacher might require them to be granted by the learner. In point of fact, later
                    writers, like Proclus and others quoted by him, did attach to Axiom this
                    particular meaning, bringing it into relation with Postulate <hi rend="italic"
                        >(αίτημα.),</hi> as defined by Aristotle in the <hi rend="italic">Posterior
                        Analytics,</hi> or as understood by Euclid in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Elements.</hi> It may here be added that the word was used regularly in the
                    sense of bare <hi rend="italic">proposition</hi> by the Stoics (Diog. Laert.,
                    vii. 65, though Simplicius curiously asserts the contrary, <hi rend="italic">ad
                        Epict. Ench.,</hi> c. 58), herein followed in later times by the Ramist
                    logicians, and also, in effect, by Bacon.</p>
                <p>That Aristotle did not originate the use of the term axiom in the sense of
                    scientific first principle, is the natural conclusion to be drawn from the
                    reference he makes to “what are called axioms in mathematics” <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Metaph.,</hi> iv. 3). Sir William Hamilton (Note A, Reid’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Works,</hi> p. 765) would have it that the reference is to
                    mathematical works of his own now lost, but there is no real ground for such a
                    supposition. True though it be, as Hamilton urges, that the so-called axioms
                    standing at the head of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> acquired the
                    name through the influence of the Aristotelian philosophy, evidence is not
                    wanting that by the time of Aristotle, a generation or more before Euclid, it
                    was already the habit of geometricians to give definite expression to certain
                    fixed principles as the basis of their science. Aristotle himself is the
                    authority for this assertion, when, in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De
                        Ccelo,</hi> iii. 4, he speaks of the advantage of having definite principles
                    of demonstration, and these as few as possible, such as are postulated by
                    mathematicians <hi rend="italic">(κaθdπεp aξcovσL κal oi</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    who always have their principles limited in kind or number. The passage is
                    decisive on the point of general mathematical usage, and so distinctly suggests
                    the very word axiom in the sense of a principle assumed or postulated, that
                    Aristotle’s repeated instance of what he himself calls by the name—If equals be
                    taken from equals, the remainders are equal—can hardly be regarded otherwise
                    than as a citation from recognised mathematical treatises. The conclusion, if
                    warranted, is of no small interest, in view of the famous list of principles set
                    out by Euclid, which has come to be regarded in modern times as the typical
                    specimen of axiomatic foundation for a science.</p>

                    readers are familiar; under the name of <hi rend="italic">αιτήματα,</hi> the
                    three principles of construction now called postulates, together with the three
                    theoretic principles, specially geometrical, now printed as the tenth, eleventh,
                    and twelfth axioms; finally, under the name of <hi rend="italic">κοιναϊ</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">èwoiai,</hi> or common notions, the series of general
                    assertions concerning equality and inequality, having an application to discrete
                    as well as continuous quantity, now printed as the first nine axioms. Now,
                    throughout the <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> there are numerous indications
                    that Euclid could not have been acquainted with the logical doctrines of
                    Aristotle: a most important one has been signalised in the article <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Analysis,</hi> and, in general, it may suffice to point out
                    that Euclid, who is said to have flourished at Alexandria from 323 (the year of
                    Aristotle’s death) to 283 B.c., lived too early to be affected by Aristotle’s
                    work—all the more that he was, by philosophical profession, a Platonist. Yet,
                    although Euclid’s disposition of geometrical principles at the beginning of his
                        <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> is itself one among the signs of his
                    ignorance of Aristotle’s logic, it would seem that he had in view a distinction
                    between his postulates and common notions not unlike the Aristotelian
                    distinction between <hi rend="italic">alτημaτa</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >a⅛,ωμaτa.</hi> All the postulates of Euclid (including the last three
                    so-called axioms) may be brought under Aristotle’s description of <hi
                        rend="italic">alτημaτa—</hi> principles concerning which the learner has, to
                    begin with, neither belief nor disbelief, <hi rend="italic">Post. Anal.,</hi> i.
                    10, 6); being (as De Morgan interprets Euclid’s meaning) such as the “reader
                    must grant or seek another system, whatever be his opinion as to the propriety
                    of the assumption.” Still closer to the Aristotelian conception of axioms come
                    Euclid’s common notions, as principles “which there is no question every one
                    will grant” (De Morgan). From this point of view, the composition of Euclid’s
                    two lists, as they originally stood, becomes intelligible: be this, however, as
                    it may, there is evidence that his enumeration and division of principles were
                    very early subjected to criticism by his followers with more or less reference
                    to Aristotle’s doctrine. Apollonius (250-220 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> is
                    mentioned by Proclus <hi rend="italic">(Com. in Eucl.,</hi> iii.) as having
                    sought to give demonstrations of the common notions under the name of axioms.
                    Further, according to Proclus, Geminus made the distinction between postulates
                    and axioms which has become the familiar one, that they are indemonstrable
                    principles of construction and demonstration respectively. Proclus himself
                    (412-485 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> practically comes to rest in this
                    distinction, and accordingly extrudes from the list of postulates all but the
                    three received in modern times. The list of axioms he reduces to five, striking
                    out as derivative the two that assert inequality (4th and 5 th), also the two
                    that assert equality between the doubles and halves of the same respectively
                    (6th and 7th). Euclid’s postulate regarding the equality of right angles and the
                    other assumed in the doctrine of parallel lines, now printed as the 11th and
                    12th axioms, he holds to be demonstrable: the 10th axiom (regarded as an axiom,
                    not a postulate, by some ancient authorities, and so cited by Proclus
                    himself)—Two straight lines cannot enclose a space—he refuses to print with the
                    others, as being a special principle of geometry. Thus he restricts the name
                    axiom to such principles of demonstration as are common to the science of
                    quantity generally. These, he then declares, are principles immediate and
                    self-manifest— untaught anticipations whose truth is darkened rather than
                    cleared by attempts to demonstrate them.</p>
                <p>The question as to the axiomatic principles, whether of knowledge in general or
                    of special science, remained where it had thus been left by the ancients till
                    modern times, when new advances began to be made in positive scientific inquiry
                    and a new philosophy took the place of the peripatetic system, as it had been
                    continued through the Middle Ages. It was characteristic alike of the
                    philosophic and of the various scientific movements begun by Descartes to be
                    guided by a consideration of mathematical method—that method which had led in
                    ancient times to special conclusions of exceptional certainty, and which showed
                    itself, as soon as it was seriously taken up again, more fruitful than ever in
                    new results. To establish philosophical and all special truth after the model of
                    mathematics became the direct object of the new school of thought and inquiry,
                    and the first step thither consisted in positing principles of immediate
                    certainty whence deduction might proceed. Descartes accordingly devised his
                    criterion of perfect clearness and distinctness of thought for the determination
                    of ultimate objective truth, and his followers, if not himself, adopted the
                    ancient word axiom for the principles which, with the help of the criterion,
                    they proceeded freely to excogitate. About the same time the authority of all
                    general principles began to be considered more explicitly in the light of their
                    origin. Not that ever such consideration had been wholly overlooked, for, on the
                    contrary, Aristotle, in pronouncing the principles of demonstration to be
                    themselves indemonstrable, had suggested, however obscurely, a theory of their
                    development, and his followers, having obscure sayings to interpret, had been
                    left free to take different sides on the question; but, as undoubtedly the
                    philosophic investigation of knowledge has in the modern period become more and
                    more an inquiry into its genesis, it was inevitable that principles claiming to
                    be axiomatic should have their pretensions scanned from this point of view with
                    closer vision than ever before. Locke it was who, when the Cartesian movement
                    was well advanced, more especially gave this direction to modern philosophic
                    thought, turning attention in particular upon the character of axioms; nor was
                    his original impulse weakened—rather it was greatly strengthened—by his
                    followers’ substitution of positive psychological research for his method of
                    general criticism. The expressly critical inquiry undertaken by Kant, at however
                    different a level, had a like bearing on the question as to the nature of
                    axiomatic principles; and thus it has come to pass that the chief philosophic
                    interest now attached to them turns upon the point whether or not they have
                    their origin in experience.</p>
                <p>It is maintained, on the one hand, that axioms, like other general propositions,
                    result from an elaboration of particular experiences, and that, if they possess
                    an exceptional certainty, the ground of this is to be sought in the character of
                    the experiences, as that they are exceptionally simple, frequent, and uniform.
                    On the other hand, it is held that the special certainty, amounting, as it does,
                    to positive necessity, is what no experience, under any circumstances, can
                    explain, but is conditioned by the nature of human reason. More it is hardly
                    possible to assert generally concerning the position of the rival schools of
                    thought, for on each side the representative thinkers differ greatly in the
                    details of their explanation, and there is, moreover, on both sides much
                    difference of opinion as to the scope of the question. Thus Kant would limit the
                    application of the name axiom to principles of mathematical science, denying
                    that in philosophy (whether metaphysical or natural), which works with
                    discursive concepts, not with intuitions, there can be any principles
                    immediately certain; and, as a matter of fact, it is to mathematical principles
                    only that the name is universally accorded in the language of special
                    science—not generally, in spite of Newton’s lead, to the laws of motion, and
                    hardly ever to scientific principles of more special range like the atomic
                    theory. Other thinkers, however, notably Leibnitz, lay stress on the ultimate
                    principles of all thinking as the only true axioms, and would <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n175/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0175-0160"/> contend tor the possibility of reducing to
                    these (with the help of definitions) the special principles of mathematics,
                    commonly allowed to pass and do duty as axiomatic. Still others apply the name
                    equally and in the same sense to the general principles of thought and to some
                    principles of special science. In view of such differences of opinion as to the
                    actual matter in question, it is not to be expected that there should be
                    agreement as to the marks characteristic of axioms, nor surprising that
                    agreement, where it appears to exist, should often be only verbal. The character
                    of necessity, for example, so much relied upon for excluding the possibility of
                    an experiential origin, may either, as by Kant, be carefully limited to that
                    which can be claimed for propositions that are at the same time synthetic, or
                    may be vaguely taken (as too frequently by Leibnitz) to cover necessity of mere
                    logical implication— the necessity of analytic, including identical,
                    propositions— which Kant allowed to be quite consistent with origin in
                    experience. The question being so perplexed, no other course seems open than to
                    try to determine the nature of axioms mainly upon such instances as are, at
                    least practically, admitted by all, and these are mathematical principles.</p>
                <p>That propositions with an exceptional character of certainty are assumed in
                    mathematical science is notorious; that such propositions must be assumed as
                    principles of the science, if it is to be at once general and demonstrative, is
                    now conceded even by extreme experientialists; while it is, farther, universally
                    held that it is the exceptional character of the subject-matter of mathematics
                    that renders possible such determinate assumption. What the actual principles to
                    be assumed are, has, indeed, always been more or less disputed; but this is a
                    point of secondary importance, since it is possible from different sets of
                    assumption to arrive at results practically the same. The particular list of
                    propositions passing current in modern times as Euclid’s axioms, like his
                    original list of common notions, is open to objection, not so much for mixing up
                    assertions not equally underivative (as the ancient critics remarked), but for
                    including two—the 8th and 9th—which are unlike all the others in being mere
                    definitions (viz., of equals and of whole or part). Being intended as a body of
                    principles of geometry in particular within the general science of mathematics,
                    the modern list is not open to exception in that it adds to the propositions of
                    general mathematical import, forming Euclid’s original list, others specially
                    geometrical, provided the additions made are sufficient for the purpose. It
                    does, in any case, contain what may be taken as good representative instances of
                    mathematical axioms both general and special; for example, the 1st. Things equal
                    to the same are equal to one another, applicable to all quantity; and the 10th,
                    Two straight lines cannot enclose a space, specially geometrical. (The latter
                    has been regarded by some writers as either a mere definition of straight lines,
                    or as contained by direct implication in the definition; but incorrectly. If it
                    is held to be a definition, nothing is too complex to be so called, and the very
                    meaning of a definition as a principle of science is abandoned; while, if it is
                    held to be a logical implication of the definition, the whole science of
                    geometry may as well be pronounced a congeries of analytic propositions. When
                    straight line is strictly defined, the assertion is clearly seen to be
                    synthetic.) Now of such propositions as the two just quoted it is commonly said
                    that they are self-evident, that they are seen to be true as soon as stated,
                    that their opposites are inconceivable; and the expressions are not too strong
                    as descriptive of the peculiar certainty pertaining to them. Nothing, however,
                    is thereby settled as to the ground of the certainty, which is the real point in
                    dispute between the experiential and rational schools, as these have become
                    determinately opposed since the time and mainly through the influence of Kant.
                    Such axioms, according to Kant, being necessary as well as synthetic, cannot be
                    got from experience, but depend on the nature of the knowing faculty; being
                    immediately synthetic, they are not thought discursively but apprehended by way
                    of direct intuition. According to the experientialists, as represented by J. S.
                    Mill, they are, for all their certainty, inductive generalisations from
                    particular experiences; only the experiences are peculiar (as already said) in
                    being extremely simple and uniform, while the experience of space—Mill does not
                    urge the like point as regards number —is farther to be distinguished from
                    common physical experience in that it supplies matter for induction no less in
                    the imaginative (representative) than in the presentative form. Mill thus agrees
                    with Kant on a vital point in holding the axioms to be synthetic propositions,
                    but takes little or no account of that which, in Kant’s eyes, is their
                    distinctive characteristic—their validity as universal truths in the guise of
                    direct intuitions or singular acts of perception, presentative or
                    representative. The synthesis of subject and predicate, thus universally valid
                    though, immediately effected, Kant explains by supposing the singular
                    presentation or representation to be wholly determined from within through the
                    mind’s spontaneous act, instead of being received as sensible experience from
                    without; to speak more precisely, he refers the apprehension of quantity,
                    whether continuous or discrete, to “productive imagination,” and regards it
                    always as a pure mental construction. Mill, who supposes all experience alike to
                    be passively received, or, at all events, makes no distinction in point of
                    original apprehension between quantity and physical qualities, fails to explain
                    what must be allowed as the specific character of mathematical axioms. Our
                    conviction of their truth cannot be said to depend upon the amount of supporting
                    experience, for increased experience (which is all that Mill secures and secures
                    only for figured magnitude, without psychological reason given) does not make it
                    stronger; and, if they are conceded on being merely stated, which, unless they
                    are held to be analytic propositions, amounts to their being granted upon direct
                    inspection of a particular case, it can be only because the case, so decisive,
                    is made and not found—is constituted or constructed by ourselves, as Kant
                    maintains, with the guarantee for uniformity and adequacy which direct
                    construction alone gives. Still it does not therefore follow that the
                    construction whereby synthesis of subject and predicate is directly made is of
                    the nature described by Kant—due to the activity of the pure <hi rend="italic"
                        >ego,</hi> opposed to the very notion of sensible experience, and absolutely
                        <hi rend="italic">a priori.</hi> As we have a natural psychological
                    experience of sensations passively received through bodily organs, we also have
                    what is not less a natural psychological experience of motor activity exerted
                    through the muscular system. Only by muscular movements, of which we are
                    conscious in the act of performing them, have we perception of objects as
                    extended and figured, and in itself the activity of the describing and
                    circumscribing movements is as much matter of experience as is the accompanying
                    content of passive sensation. At the same time, the conditions of the active
                    exertion -and of the passive affection are profoundly different. While, in
                    objective perception, within the same or similar movements, the content of
                    passive sensation may indefinitely vary beyond any control of ours, it is at all
                    times in our power to describe forms by actual movement w ith or without a
                    content of sensation, still more by represented or imagined movement. Our
                    knowledge of the physical qualities of objects thus becomes a reproduction of
                    our manifold sensible experience, as this in its variety can alone be
                    reproduced, by way of general concepts; our knowledge of their mathematical
                    attributes is, first <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0176-0161"/> and last, an act of conscious production or
                    construction. It is manifestly so, as movement actual or imaginary, in the case
                    of magnitude or continuous quantity; nor is it otherwise in the case of number
                    or discrete quantity, when the units are objects (points or anything else)
                    standing apart from each other in space. When the units are not objects
                    presented to the senses or represented as coexistent in space, but are mere
                    subjective occurrences succeeding each other in time, the numerical synthesis,
                    doubtless, proceeds differently, but it is still an act of construction,
                    dependent on the power we have of voluntarily determining the flow of subjective
                    consciousness. Thus acting constructively in our experience both of number and
                    form, we, in a manner, <hi rend="italic">make</hi> the ultimate relations of
                    both to be what for us they must be in all circumstances, and such relations
                    when expressed are truly axiomatic in every sense that has been ascribed to the
                    name.</p>
                <p>Beyond the mathematical principles which may be thus accounted for, there are, as
                    was before remarked, no other principles of special science to which the name of
                    axiom is uniformly applied. It may now be understood why the name should be
                    withheld from such a fundamental generalisation as the atomic theory in
                    chemistry, even when we have become so familiar with the facts as to seem to see
                    clearly that the various kinds of matter must combine with each other regularly
                    in definite proportions: the proposition answers to no intuition or direct
                    apprehension. At most could it be called axiomatic in the sense, of course
                    applicable to mathematical principles also, that it is assumed as true in the
                    body of science compacted by means of it. The laws of motion, however,
                    formulated by Newton as principles of general physics, not only were called by
                    him axiomatic in this latter sense, but have been given out by others since his
                    time as propositions intuitively certain; and, though it cannot seriously be
                    pretended that there is the same case for ascribing to them the character of <hi
                        rend="italic">a priori</hi> truths, there must be some reason why the name
                    of axiom in the full sense has been claimed for them alone by the side of the
                    mathematical principles. The <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> character, it is
                    clear, can only in a peculiar sense be claimed for truths which all the genius
                    of the ancients failed to grasp, and which were established in far later times
                    as inductions from actual experiments; Newton, certainly, in calling them
                    axioms, by no means claimed for them aught but an experiential origin. On the
                    other hand, it must be conceded that motion as an experience has in it a
                    character of simplicity, like that belonging to number and form, consisting
                    mainly in a clear apprehension of the circumstances under which the phenomenon
                    varies, while, again, such apprehension is conditioned by the psychological
                    nature of the experience, namely, that it is one depending on activity of our
                    own which we can control, and does not come to us as bare passive affection
                    which we must take a3 we find it. We do in truth make or constitute motion, as
                    we construct number and space; moving, as we please, without external occasion,
                    and, when apprehending objective movements, following these with conscious
                    motions of our members. Notwithstanding, our proper motions far less adequately
                    correspond to the reality of external motions than do our subjective
                    constructions of space and number answer to the reality of things figured and
                    numbered. With limited store of nervous energy and muscles of confined sweep, we
                    cannot execute at all such continued unvarying movements as occur, at least
                    approximately, in nature; we cannot, by any such combinations of movements as we
                    are able to make, determine beforehand the result of such complex motions as
                    nature in endless variety exhibits; nor, again, can we with any accuracy
                    appreciate the relation between action and reaction by opposing our muscular
                    organs to one another. We must wait long upon experience that comes to us, or
                    rather, in face of the objective complexity presented by nature, sally forth to
                    make varied experiments with moving things, and thereupon generalise, before
                    anything can be determined positively respecting motion. This is precisely what
                    inquirers, until about the time of Galileo, were by no means content to do, and
                    they had accordingly laws of motion which were, indeed, devised <hi
                        rend="italic">a priori,</hi> but which were not objectively true. Since the
                    time of Galileo true, or at least effective, laws of motion have been
                    established inductively, like all other physical laws; only it is more easy than
                    in the case of the others, which are less simple, to come near to an adequate
                    subjective construction of them, and hence the claim sometimes set up for them
                    to be in fact <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> and in the full sense
                    axiomatic.</p>
                <p>It remains to inquire in what sense the general principles of all knowledge or
                    principles of certitude may be called, as they often are called, axioms. The
                    laws of Contradiction and of Excluded Middle, noted though not named by
                    Aristotle, together with that formulated as the law of Identity, presupposed as
                    they are in all consistent thinking, have, with a character of widest
                    generality, also a character of extreme simplicity, and may fitly be denominated
                    axioms in the sense of immediate principles. They stand, however, as pure
                    logical principles, apart from all others, being wholly formal, without a shade
                    of material content. There can be no question, therefore, of their certainty
                    being guaranteed by a direct intuition, valid for all cases because fully
                    representative of all; as little does there appear valid ground for calling
                    them, in the proper sense, inductive generalisations from experience. They may
                    rather be held to admit only of the kind of proof that Aristotle calls
                    dialectical: whoever denies them will find that he cannot argue at all or be
                    argued with; he cuts himself off from all part in rational discourse, and is no
                    better, as Aristotle forcibly expresses it, than a plant. The like position of
                    being postulated as the condition of making progress belongs to the very
                    different principle or principles (which may, however, be called logical, in the
                    wider sense) implied in the establishment of truth of fact, more particularly
                    the inductive investigation of nature. Whether expressed in the form of a
                    principle of Sufficient Reason, as by Leibnitz, or, as is now more common, in
                    the form of a principle of Uniformity of Nature, with or without a pendant
                    principle of Causality for the special class of uniformities of succession, some
                    assumption is indispensable for knitting together into general truths the
                    discrete and particular elements of experience. Such postulates must be declared
                    to have an experiential origin rather than to be <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>
                    principles, but experience may more truly be said to suggest them than to be
                    their ground or foundation, since they are themselves the ground, express or
                    implied, of all ordered experience. Their case is perhaps best met by
                    pronouncing them hypothetical principles, and as there are no axioms—not even
                    those of mathematics—that are thought of without reference to their proved
                    efficiency as principles leading to definite conclusions, they may be called
                    axiomatic on account of their extreme generality, however little they possess
                    the character of immediacy.</p>
                <p>The name axiom, at the end of the inquiry, is thus left undeniably equivocal, and
                    it clearly behoves those wh^ employ it, whether in philosophy or science, always
                    to make plain in what sense it is meant to be taken. Before closing, it is,
                    perhaps, necessary to add why, in dealing with the question of origin, no
                    account has been taken of the doctrine of evolution which has become so
                    prominent in the latest scientific and philosophical speculation. From the point
                    of view of the present article, that doctrine has only an indirect bearing on
                    the inquiry. If the conditions of experience as they are found in the <pb

                    assurance with λvhich general assertions are made in different departments of
                    knowlege, there is no need to carry the psychological consideration farther
                    back. The effect of such difference in the conditions of experience may, of
                    course, be accumulated in the life of the race, and the accumulation may go far
                    to determine the psychological history of the individual, but the question, as a
                    rational one, must be decided upon analysis of the conditions as they are. <hi
