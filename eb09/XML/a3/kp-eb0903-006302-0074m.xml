                    those in which we can trace a continuous material bond of union between the
                    bodies. The mutual action between two bodies is called stress. When the mutual
                    action tends to bring the bodies nearer, or to prevent them from separating, it
                    is called tension or attraction. When it tends to separate the bodies, or to
                    prevent them from approaching, it is called pressure or repulsion. The names
                    tension and pressure are used when the action is seen to take place through a
                    medium. Attraction and repulsion are reserved for cases of action at a distance.
                    The configuration of a material system can always be defined in terms of the
                    mutual distances of the parts of the system. Any change of configuration must
                    alter one or more of these distances. Hence the force which produces or resists
                    such a change may be resolved into attractions or repulsions between those parts
                    of the system whose distance is altered.</p>
                <p>There has been a great deal of speculation as to the cause of such forces, one of
                    them, namely, the pressure between bodies in contact, being supposed to be more
                    easily conceived than any other kind of stress. Many attempts have therefore
                    been made to resolve cases of apparent attraction and repulsion at a distance
                    into cases of pressure. At one time the possibility of attraction at a distance
                    was supposed to be refuted by asserting that a body cannot act where it is not,
                    and that therefore all action between different portions of matter must be by
                    direct contact. To this it was replied that we have no evidence that real
                    contact ever takes place between two bodies, and that, in fact, when bodies are
                    pressed against each other and in apparent contact, we may sometimes actually
                    measure the distance between them, as when one piece of glass is laid on
                    another, in which case a considerable pressure must be applied to bring the
                    surfaces near enough to show the black spot of Newton’s rings, which indicates a
                    distance of about a ten thousandth of a millimetre. If, in order tc get rid of
                    the idea of action at a distance, we imagine a material medium through which the
                    action is transmitted, all that we have done is to substitute for a single
                    action at a great distance a series of actions at smaller distances between the
                    parts of the medium, so that we cannot even thus get rid of action at a
                    distance.</p>
                <p>The study of the mutual action between the parts of a material system has, in
                    modern times, been greatly simplified by the introduction of the idea of the
                    energy of the system. The energy of the system is measured by the amount of work
                    which it can do in overcoming external resistances. It depends on the present
                    configuration and motion of the system, and not on the manner in which the
                    system has acquired that configuration and motion. A complete knowledge of the
                    manner in which the energy of the system depends on its configuration and
                    motion, is sufficient to determine all the forces acting between the parts of
                    the system. For instance, if the system consists of two bodies, and if the
                    energy depends on the distance between them, then if the energy increases when
                    the distance increases, there must be attraction between the bodies, and if the
                    energy diminishes when the distance increases, there must be repulsion between
                    them. In the case of two gravitating masses <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">m'</hi> at a distance r, the part of the energy which depends on
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is - · We may therefore express the fact that there is
                    attraction between the two bodies by saying that the energy of the system
                    consisting of the two bodies increases when their distance increases. The
                    question, therefore, Why do the two bodies attract each other <hi rend="italic"
                    >ι</hi> may be expressed in a different form. Why does the energy of the system
                    increase when the distance increases!</p>
                <p>But we must bear in mind that the scientific or scienceproducing value of the
                    efforts made to answer these old standing questions is not to be measured by the
                    prospect they afford us of ultimately obtaining a solution, but by their effect
                    in stimulating men to a thorough investigation of nature. To propose a
                    scientific question presupposes scientific knowledge, and the questions which
                    exercise men’s minds in the present state of science may very likely be such
                    that a little more knowledge would show us that no answer is possible. The
                    scientific value of the question, How do bodies act on one another at a
                    distance? is to be found in the stimulus it has given to investigations into the
                    properties of the intervening medium.</p>
                <p>Newton, in his <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> deduces from the observed
                    motions of the heavenly bodies the fact that they attract one another according
                    to a definite law. This he gives as a result of strict dynamical reasoning, and
                    by it he shows how not only the more conspicuous phenomena, but all the apparent
                    irregularities of the celestial motions are the calculable results of a single
                    principle. In his <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> he confines himself to the
                    demonstration and development of this great step in the science of the mutual
                    action of bodies. He says nothing there about the means by which bodies
                    gravitate towurds each other. But his mind did not rest at this point. We know
                    that he did not believe in the direct action of bodies at a distance.</p>

                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Optical Queries,</hi> indeed, he shows that if the
                    pressure of this medium is less in the neighbourhood of dense bodies than at
                    great distances from them, dense bodies will be drawn towards each other, and
                    that if the diminution of pressure is inversely as the distance from the dense
                    body the law will be that of gravitation. The next step, as he points out, is to
                    account for this inequality of pressure in the medium; and as he was not able to
                    do this, he left the explanation of the cause of gravity as a problem to
                    succeeding ages. As regards gravitation the progress made towards the solution
                    of the problem since the time of Newton has been almost imperceptible. Faraday
                    showed that the transmission of electric and magnetic forces is accompanied by
                    phenomena occurring in every part of the intervening medium. He traced the lines
                    of force through the medium; and he ascribed to them a tendency to shorten
                    themselves and to separate from their neighbours, thus introducing the idea of
                    stress in the medium in a different form from that suggested by Newton; for,
                    whereas Newton’s stress was a hydrostatic pressure in every direction, Faraday’s
                    is a tension along the lines of force, combined with a pressure in all normal
                    directions. By showing that the plane of polarisation of a ray of light passing
                    through a transparent medium in the direction of the magnetic force is made to
                    rotate, Faraday not only demonstrated the action of magnetism on light, but by
                    using light to reveal the state of magnetisation of the medium, he
                    “illuminated,” to use his own phrase, “the lines of magnetic force.”</p>
                <p>From this phenomenon Thomson afterwards proved, by strict dynamical reasoning,
                    that the transmission of magnetic force is associated with a rotatory motion of
                    the small parts of the medium. He showed, at the same time, how the centrifugal
                    force due to this motion would account for magnetic attraction.</p>
                <p>A theory of this kind is worked out in greater detail in Clerk Maxwell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism.</hi> It is there shown
                    that, if we assume that the medium is in a state of stress, consisting of
                    tension along the lines of force and pressure in all directions at right angles
                    to the lines of force, the tension and the pressure being equal in numerical
                    value and proportional to the square of the intensity of the field at the given
                    point, the observed electrostatic and electromagnetic forces will be completely
                    accounted for.</p>
                <p>The next step is to account for this state of stress in the medium. In the case
                    of electromagnetic force we avail ourselves of Thomson’s deduction from
                    Faraday’s discovery stated above. We assume that the small parts of the medium
                    are rotating about axes parallel to the lines of force. The centrifugal force
                    due to this rotation produces the excess of pressure perpendicular to the lines
                    of force. The explanation of electrostatic stress is less satisfactory, but
                    there can be no doubt that a path is now open by which we may trace to the
                    action of a medium all forces which, like the electric and magnetic forces, vary
                    inversely as the square of the distance, and are attractive between bodies of
                    different names, and repulsive between bodies of the same names.</p>
                <p>The force of gravitation is also inversely as the square of the distance, but it
                    differs from the electric and magnetic forces in this respect, that the bodies
                    between which it acts cannot be divided into two opposite kinds, one positive
                    and the other negative, but are in respect of gravitation all of the same kind,
                    and that the force between them is in every case attractive. To account for such
                    a force by means of stress in an intervening medium, on the plan adopted for
                    electric and magnetic forces, we must assume a stress of an opposite kind from
                    that already mentioned. We must suppose that there is a pressure in the
                    direction of the lines of force, combined with a tension in all directions at
                    right angles to the lines of force. Such a state of stress would, no doubt,
                    account for the observed effects of gravitation. We have not, however, been able
                    hitherto to imagine any physical cause for such a state of stress. It is easy to
                    calculate the amount of this stress which would be required to account for the
                    actual effects of gravity at the surface of the earth. It would require a
                    pressure of 37,000 tons’ weight on the square inch in a vertical direction,
                    combined with a tension of the same numerical value in all horizontal
                    directions. The state of stress, therefore, which we must suppose to exist in
                    the invisible medium, is 3000 times greater than that which the strongest steel
                    could support.</p>
                <p>Another theory of the mechanism of gravitation, that of Le Sage, who attributes
                    it to the impact of ‘^ultramun-dane corpuscules,” has been already discussed in

                    incompressible fluid, and if we further suppose either that material bodies are
                    always generating and emitting this fluid at a constant rate, the fluid flowing
                    off to infinity, or that material bodies are always absorbing and annihilating
                    the fluid, the deficiency flowing in from infinite space, then, in either of
                    these cases, there would be an attraction between any two bodies inversely as
                    the square of the distance. If, however, one of the bodies were a generator of
                    the fluid and the other an abeorber of it. the bodies would repel each
                    other.</p>
                <p>Here, then, we have a hydrodynamical illustration of action at a distance, which
                    is so far promising that it shows how bodies of the same kind may attract each
                    other. But the conception of a fluid constantly flowing out of a body without
                    any supply from without, or flowing into it without any way of escape, is so
                    contradictory to all our experience, that an hypothesis, of which it is an
                    essential part, cannot be called an <hi rend="italic">explanation</hi> of the
                    phenomenon of gravitation.</p>
                <p>Dr Robert Hooke, a man of singular inventive power, in 1671 endeavoured to trace
                    the cause of gravitation to waves propagated in a medium. He found that bodies
                    floating on water agitated by waves were drawn towards the centre of
                    agitation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    observation in such a way as to determine completely the action of waves on an
                    immersed body.</p>
                <p>Professor Challis has investigated the mathematical theory of the effect of waves
                    of condensation and rarefaction in an elastic fluid on bodies immersed in the
                    fluid. He found the difficulties of the investigation to be so great that he has
                    not been able to arrive at numerical results. He concludes, however, that the
                    effect of such waves would be to attract the body towards the centre of
                    agitation, or to repel it from that centre, according as the wave’s length is
                    very large or very small compared with the dimensions of the body. Practical
                    illustrations of the effect of such waves have been given by Guyot, Schellbach,
                    Guthrie, and Thomson.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    tuning-fork is itself suspended, it is seen to be attracted towards any body
                    placed near it.</p>
                <p>Sir W. Thomson has shown that this action can in all cases be explained by the
                    general principle that in fluid motion the average pressure is least where the
                    average energy of motion is greatest. Now, the wave motion is greatest neaιest
                    the tuning-fork, the pressure is therefore least there; and the suspended body
                    being pressed unequally on opposite sides, moves from the side of greater
                    pressure to the side of less pressure, that is towards the tuning-fork. He has
                    also succeeded in producing repulsion in the case of a small body lighter than
                    the surrounding medium.</p>
                <p>It is remarkable that of the three hypotheses, which go some way towards a
                    physical explanation of gravitation, every one involves a constant expenditure
                    of work. Le Sage’s hypothesis of ultramundane corpuscules does so, as we have
                    shown in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Atom.</hi> That of the generation or
                    absorption of fluid requires, not only constant expenditure of work in emitting
                    fluid under pressure, but actual creation and destruction of matter. That of
                    waves requires some agent in a remote part of the universe capable of generating
                    the waves.</p>
                <p>According to such hypotheses we must regard the processes of nature not as
                    illustrations of the great principle of the conservation of energy, but as
                    instances in which, by a nice adjustment of powerful agencies not subject to
                    this principle, an apparent conservation of energy is maintained. Hence, we are
                    forced to conclude that the explanation of the cause of gravitation is not to be
                    found in any of these hypotheses.</p>
