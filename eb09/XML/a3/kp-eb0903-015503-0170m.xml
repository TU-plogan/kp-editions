                    boulevards planted with trees. A precipitous rock rises from the river’s edge;
                    and from its summit the cathedral of <hi rend="italic">Λ otre</hi><hi

                    the city, but is almost thrown into insignificance by the Palace of the Popes,
                    which rises by its side, and stretches in sombre grandeur along the southern
                    slope. This building, or congeries of buildings, was commenced by Benedict XII.
                    in 1336, and continued by successive popes for sixty years. It covers an area of
                    rather more than 1∣ acree. The paintings with which it was profusely adorned are
                    in great measure destroyed, and even the grandeur of its dismantled interiors
                    was for a long time broken in upon by the carpentry and plaster-work of French
                    barracks. A restoration has, however, been for some time in progress; and the
                    building will again be appropriated for ecclesiastical and civic purposes. The
                    churches of St Agricol, St Didier, and St Pierre may be mentioned as of some
                    importance; also the papal mint, now known as a music academy; the town-hall,
                    built in 1862; the Calvet museum, rich in Boman remains; the Requien museum of
                    natural history; and the Hôtel des Invalides. Of the church of the Cordeliers,
                    in which Petrarch’s Laura was buried, only a small part is standing, and the
                    tomb itself has been entirely destroyed. The city is the seat of an archbishop,
                    and has tribunals of primary jurisdiction and commerce, a royal college, a
                    theological seminary, a society of arts, the Vaucluse academy, a public library,
                    a theatre, &amp;c. The chief object of industry is the preparation of silk and
                    the manufacture of silk goods; there are also manufactures of paper, leather,
                    hats, jewellery, iron-ware <hi rend="italic">&lt;kc.</hi> Avignon is remarkably
                    subject to violent winds, of which the most disastrous is the <hi rend="italic"

                    (windy Avignon, liable to plague when it has not the wind, and plagued with the
                    wind when it has it). The town was a place of some importance in the times of
                    Roman supremacy, and seems to have had some special connection with the Greek
                    colony at Massilia. It was incorporated with the Burgundian kingdom, and on its
                    dissolution became a free republic, after the Italian type. As late, indeed, as
                    1790, it retained its consuls, though its republican constitution was really
                    destroyed by Charles of Anjou. From 1309, when Clement V. took up his abode in
                    the city, to 1377, when Gregory XI. returned to Rome, Avignon was the seat of
                    the papal court, and it continued from 1378 to 1418 to be the seat of French
                    anti-popes. In 1348 it was purchased by Pope Clement VI. from Joanna of Sicily
                    for the sum of 80,000 florins, and it remained in possession of the popes till
                    the French Revolution. Population in 1872, 38,196.</p>
