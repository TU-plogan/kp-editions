                    Atropatene. It is separated from a division of the Russian Empire on the N. by
                    the River Araxes, and from Irak on the S. by the Kizil-Uzen, or Golden Stream,
                    while it has the Caspian Sea and Ghilan on the E., and Asiatic Turkey on the W.
                    Its area is estimated at 25,280 square miles. The country is superior in
                    fertility to the southern provinces of Persia. It differs entirely from the
                    provinces of Fars and Irak, as it consists of a regular succession of undulating
                    eminences, partially cultivated, and opening into extensive plains such as
                    Anjan, Tabreez, and Urumiyah or Van. Near the centre of the province the
                    mountains of Sahend or Serhund rise in an accumulated mass to the height of 9000
                    feet above the sea. The highest point, Mount Sevellan, towards its eastern
                    frontier, attains a height of about 12,000 feet according to some authorities,
                    but according to Khani-koff, it is 15,400; and the Talish Mountains, which run
                    from N. to S. parallel to, and at no great distance from, the Caspian, have an
                    altitude of 7000 feet. Except the boundary rivers already mentioned, there are
                    none of any great extent; but these both receive a number of tributaries from
                    the province, and several streams of considerable volume, such as the Jughutu,
                    the Agi, and the Shar, belong to the basin of the Lake Urumiyah. This lake is
                    about 300 miles in circumference, and 4200 feet above the sea. Its waters are
                    more intensely salt than the sea, and it is “supposed to contain no living
                    creature except a kind of polype but it is the resort of great flocks of the
                    flamingo. The country to the N. and W., namely, the districts of Urumiyah and
                    Seimart, is the most picturesque and prosperous part of Azerbijan; yet even here
                    the traveller from the more civilised regions of Europe laments the want of
                    enterprise among the inhabitants. Azerbijan is on the whole, however, reckoned
                    one of the most productive provinces of Persia, and the villages have a more
                    pleasing appearance than those of Irak. The orchards and gardens, in which they
                    are for the most part embosomed, yield delicious fruits of almost every
                    description, which are dried in large quantities. Provisions are cheap and
                    abundant, and wine is made in considerable quantities. There is throughout the
                    district a lack of forests and of timber trees. Lead, copper·, saltpetre,
                    sulphur, and coal are found within the confines of Azerbijan; also a kind of
                    beautiful transparent marble or jasper, which takes the highest polish, and is
                    used in the buildings of Tabreez, Shiraz, and Ispahan, under the name of Tabreez
                    or Belghami marble. There ∙are exports of silk and cotton, textile fabrics,
                    leather, hides and lambskins, dry-fruits, sugar, drugs, tobacco, and wax,
                    &amp;c., the total value in 1870, a year of great trade depression, being
                    &lt;£422,632. In the same year the Imports amounted to £1,094,717. The chief
                    towns are Tabreez, Urumiyah (the supposed birthplace of Zoroaster), Ardebil,
                    Khoee, Maragha, Oilman, Abbasabad, Mehrand, Siral, and Souj-Bolak. The climate
                    is healthful—in summer and autumn hot, but cold in winter. The cold is severely
                    felt by the lower orders, owing to the want of fuel, for which there is no
                    substitute except dried cow-dung, mixed with straw. The spring is temperate and
                    delightful in the plains, but on the mountains snow lies eight months in the
                    year; and hail-storms are so violent as frequently to destroy the cattle in the
                    fields. The best soils yield from fifty to sixty fold when abundantly irrigated;
                    and supplies of water for this purpose are drawn from the many small rivers by
                    which the province is intersected. Oxen are generally used to draw the plough.
                    The population is of a very varied character, comprising Kurds, Armenians,
                    Syrians, Tatars, Persians proper, and other tribes or nationalities, and is
                    roughly estimated at 2,000,000. The Persian army is largely composed of natives
                    of Azerbijan, who make excellent soldiers; they are subject to compulsory
                    enlistment. The province is under the government of the heir-apparent to the
                    Persian throne. (Kinneir’s <hi rend="italic">Geographical Memoir of the Persian
