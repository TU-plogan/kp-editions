                    School, and carried thence to Christ Church a stock of learning which, though
                    really scanty, he through life exhibited with such judicious ostentation that
                    superficial observers believed his attainments to be immense. At Oxford, his
                    parts, his taste, and his bold, contemptuous, and imperious spirit soon made him
                    conspicuous. Here he published, at twenty, his first work, a translation of the
                    noble poem of <hi rend="italic">Absalom and Ahithophel</hi> into Latin verse.
                    Neither the style nor the versification of the young scholar was that of the
                    2lugustan age. In English composition he succeeded much better. In 1687 he
                    distinguished himself among many able men who wrote in defence of the Church of
                    England, then persecuted by James IL, and calumniated by apostates who had for
                    lucre quitted her communion. Among these apostates none was more active or
                    malignant than Obadiah Walker, who was master of University College, and who had
                    set up there, under the royal patronage, a press for printing tracts against the
                    established religion. In one of these tracts, written apparently by Walker
                    himself, many aspersions were thrown on Martin Luther. Atterbury undertook to
                    defend the great Saxon Reformer, and performed that task in a manner singularly
                    characteristic. Whoever examines his reply to Walker will be struck by the
                    contrast between the feebleness of those parts which are argumentative and
                    defensive, and the vigour of those parts which are rhetorical and aggressive.
                    The Papists were so much galled by the sarcasms and invectives of the young
                    polemic, that they raised a cry of treason, and accused him of having, by
                    implication, called King James a Judas.</p>
                <p>After the Revolution, Atterbury, though bred in the doctrines of non-resistance
                    and passive obedience, readily swore fealty to the new Government. In no long
                    time he took holy orders. He occasionally preached in London with an eloquence
                    which raised his reputation, and soon had the honour of being appointed one of
                    the royal chaplains. But he ordinarily resided at Oxford, where he took an
                    active part in academical business, directed the classical studies of the
                    undergraduates of his college, and was the chief adviser and assistant of Dean
                    Aldrich, a divine now chiefly remembered by his catches, but renowned among his
                    contemporaries as a scholar, a Tory, and a High-Churchman. It was the practice,
                    not a very judicious practice, of Aldrich, to employ the most promising youths
                    of his college in editing Greek and Latin books. Among the studious and
                    well-disposed lads who were, unfortunately for themselves, induced to become
                    teachers of philology when they should have been content to be learners, waβ
                    Charles Boyle, son of the earl of Orrery, and nephew of Robert Boyle, the great
                    experimental philosopher. The task assigned to Charles Boyle was to prepare a
                    new edition of one of the most worthless books in existence. It was a fashion
                    among those Greeks and Romans who cultivated rhetoric as an art, to compose
                    epistles and harangues in the name3 of eminent men. Some of these counterfeits
                    are fabricated with such exquisite taste and skill, that it is the highest
                    achievement of criticism to distinguish them from originals. Others are so
                    feebly and rudely executed, that they can hardly impose on an intelligent
                    schoolboy. The best specimen which has come down to us is perhaps the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oration for Marcellus,</hi> such an imitation of Tully’s eloquence
                    as Tully would himself have read with wonder and delight. The worst specimen is
                    perhaps a collection of letters purporting to have been written by that Phalaris
                    who governed Agrigentum more than 500 years before the Christian era. The
                    evidence, both internal and external, against the genuineness of these letters
                    is overwhelming. When, in the 15th century, they emerged, in company with much
                    that was far more valuable, from their obscurity, they were pronounced spurious
                    by Politian, the greatest scholar of Italy, and by Erasmus, the greatest scholar
                    on our side of the Alps. In truth, it would be as easy to persuade an educated
                    Englishman, that one of Johnson’s <hi rend="italic">Ramblers</hi> was the w ork
                    of William Wallace, as to persuade a man like Erasmus, that a pedantic exercise,
                    composed in the trim and artificial Attic of the time of Julian, was a despatch
                    written by a crafty and ferocious Dorian, who roasted people alive many years
                    before there existed a volume of prose in the Greek language. But though Christ
                    Church could boast of many good Latinists, of many good English writers, and of
                    a greater number of clever and fashionable men of the world than belonged to any
                    other academic body, there was not then in the college a single man capable of
                    distinguishing between the infancy and the dotage of Greek literature. So
                    superficial, indeed, was the learning of the rulers of this celebrated society,
                    that they were charmed by an essay which Sir William Temple published in praise
                    of the ancient writers. It now seems strange, that even the eminent public
                    services, the deserved popularity, and the graceful style of Temple, should have
                    saved <hi rend="smallcaps">sq</hi> silly a performance from universal contempt.
                    Of the books which he most vehemently eulogised, his eulogies proved that he
                    knew nothing. In fact, he could not read a line of the language in which they
                    were written. Among many other foolish things, he said that the letters of
                    Phalaris were the oldest letters and also the best in the world. Whatever Temple
                    wrote attracted notice. People who had never heard of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistles of</hi><hi rend="italic">Phalaris</hi> began to inquire about them.
                    Aldrich, who knew very little Greek, took the word of Temple who knew none, and
                    desired Boyle to prepare a new edition of these admirable compositions which,
                    having long slept in obscurity, had become on a sudden objects of general
                    interest.</p>
                <p>The edition was prepared with the help of Atterbury, who was Boyle’s tutor, and
                    of some other members of the college. It was an edition such as might be
                    expected from people who would stoop to edit such a book. The notes were worthy
                    of the text; the Latin version worthy of the Greek original. The volume would
                    have been forgotten in a month, had not a misunderstanding about a manuscript
                    arisen between the young editor and the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n65/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0065-0054"/> greatest scholar that had appeared in Europe
                    since the revival of letters, Richard Bentley. The manuscript was in Bentley’s
                    keeping. Boyle wished it to be collated. A mischief-making bookseller informed
                    him that Bentley had refused to lend it, which was false, and also that Bentley
                    had spoken contemptuously of the letters attributed to Phalaris, and of the
                    critics who were taken in by such counterfeits, which was perfectly true. Boyle,
                    much provoked, paid, in his preface, a bitterly ironical compliment to Bentley’s
                    courtesy. Bentley revenged himself by a short dissertation, in λvhich he proved
                    that the epistles were spurious, and the new edition of them worthless; but he
                    treated Boyle personally with civility as a young gentleman of great hopes,
                    whose love of learning was highly commendable, and who deserved to have had
                    better instructors.</p>
                <p>Few things in literary history are more extraordinary than the storm which this
                    little dissertation raised. Bentley had treated Boyle with forbearance; but he
                    had treated Christ Church with contempt; and the Christ Churchmen, wherever
                    dispersed, were as much attached to their college as a Scotchman to his country,
                    or a Jesuit to his order. Their influence was great. They were dominant at
                    Oxford, powerful in the Inns of Court and in the College of Physicians,
                    conspicuous in Parliament and in the literary and fashionable circles of London.
                    Their unanimous cry was that the honour of the college must be vindicated, that
                    the insolent Cambridge pedant must be put down. Poor Boyle was unequal to the
                    task, and disinclined to it. It was, therefore, assigned to his tutor
                    Atterbury.</p>
                <p>The answer to Bentley, which bears the name of Boyle, but which was, in truth, no
                    more the work of .Boyle than the letters to which the controversy related were
                    the work of Phalaris, is now read only by the curious, and will in all
                    probability never be reprinted again. But it had its day of noisy popularity. It
                    was to be found not only in the studies of men of letters, but on the tables of
                    the most brilliant drawing-rooms of Soho Square and Covent Garden. Even the
                    beaux and coquettes of that age, the Wildairs and the Lady Lurewells, the
                    Mirabells, and the Millamants, congratulated each other on the way in which the
                    gay young gentleman, whose erudition sate so easily upon him, and who wrote with
                    so much pleasantry and good breeding about the Attic dialect and the anapaestic
                    measure, Sicilian talents and Thericlean cups, had bantered the queer prig of a
                    doctor. Nor was the applause of the multitude undeserved. The book is, indeed,
                    Atterbury’s masterpiece, and gives a higher notion of his powers than any of
                    those works to which he put his name. That he was altogether in the wrong on the
                    main question, and on all the collateral questions springing out of it, that his
                    knowledge of the language, the literature, and the history of Greece, was not
                    equal to what many freshmen now bring up every year to Cambridge and Oxford, and
                    that some of his blunders seem rather to deserve a flogging than a refutation,
                    is true; and therefore it is that his performance is, in the highest degree,
                    interesting and valuable to a judicious reader. It is good by reason of its
                    exceeding badness. It is the most extraordinary instance that exists of the art
                    of making much show with little substance. There is no difficulty, says the
                    steward of Molière’s miser, in giving a fine dinner with plenty of money: the
                    really great cook is he who can set out a banquet with no money at all. That
                    Bentley should have written excellently on ancient chronology and geography, on
                    the development of the Greek language, and the origin of the Greek drama, is not
                    strange. But that Atterbury should, during some years, have been thought to have
                    treated these subjects much better than Bentley, is strange indeed. It is true
                    that the champion of Christ Church had all the help which the most celebrated
                    members of that society could give him. Smalridge contributed some very good
                    wit; Friend and others some very bad archaeology and philology. But the greater
                    part of the volume was entirely Atterbury’s: what was not his own was revised
                    and retouched by him; and the whole bears the mark of his mind—a mind
                    inexhaustibly rich in all the resources of controversy, and familiar with all
                    the artifices which make falsehood look like truth, and ignorance like
                    knowledge. He had little gold; but he beat that little out to the very thinnest
                    leaf, and spread it over so vast a surface, that to those who judged by a
                    glance, and who did not resort to balances and tests, the glittering heap of
                    worthless matter which he produced seemed to be an inestimable treasure of massy
                    bullion. Such arguments as he had he placed in the clearest light. Where he had
                    no arguments, he resorted to personalities, sometimes serious, generally
                    ludicrous, always clever and cutting. But, whether he was grave or merry,
                    whether he reasoned or sneered, his style was always pure, polished, and
                    easy.</p>
                <p>Party spirit then ran high; yet, though Bentley ranked among Whigs, and Christ
                    Church was a stronghold of Toryism, Whigs joined with Tories in applauding
                    Atterbury’s volume. Garth insulted Bentley, and extolled Boyle in lines which
                    are now never quoted except to be laughed at. Swift, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Battle of the Books,</hi> introduced with much pleasantry Boyle, clad in
                    armour, the gift of all the gods, and directed by Apollo in the form of a human
                    friend, for whose name a blank is left which may easily be filled up. The youth,
                    so accoutred and so assisted, gains an easy victory over his uncourteous and
                    boastful antagonist. Bentley, meanwhile, was supported by the consciousness of
                    an immeasurable superiority, and encouraged by the voices of the few who were
                    really competent to judge the combat. “No man,” he said, justly and nobly, “was
                    ever written down but by himself.” He spent two years in preparing a reply,
                    which will never cease to be read and prized while the literature of ancient
                    Greece is studied in any part of the world. This reply proved not only that the
                    letters ascribed to Phalaris were spurious, but that Atterbury, with all his
                    wit, his eloquence, his skill in controversial fence, was the most audacious
                    pretender that ever wrote about what he did not understand. But to Atterbury
                    this exposure w as matter of indifference. He was now engaged in a dispute about
                    matters far more important and exciting than the laws of Zaleucus and the laws
                    of Charondas. The rage of religious factions was extreme. High Church and Low
                    Church divided the nation. The great majority of the clergy were on the High
                    Church side; the majority of King William’s bishops were inclined to
                    latitudiuarianism. A dispute arose between the two parties touching the extent
                    of the powers of the Lower House of Convocation. Atterbury thrust himself
                    eagerly into the front rank of the High Churchmen. Those who take a
                    comprehensive and impartial view of his whole career will not be disposed to
                    give him credit for religious zeal. But it was his nature to be vehement and
                    pugnacious in the cause of every fraternity of which he was a member. He had
                    defended the genuineness of a spurious book simply because Christ Church had put
                    forth an edition of that book; he now stood up for the clergy against the civil
                    pow er, simply because he was a clergyman, and for the priests against the
                    episcopal order, simply because he. was as yet only a priest. He asserted the
                    pretensions of the class to w hich he belonged in several treatises written with
                    much wit, ingenuity, audacity, and acrimony. In this, as in his first
                    controversy, he was opposed to antagonists whose knowledge of the subject in
                    dispute was far superior to his; but in this, as in his first controversy, he
                    imposed on the multitude by bold assertion, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n66/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0066-0055"/> by sarcasm, by declamation, and, above all, by
                    his peculiar knack of exhibiting a little erudition in such a manner as to make
                    it look like a great deal. Having passed himself off on the world as a greater
                    master of classical learning than Bentley, he now passed himself off as a
                    greater master of ecclesiastical learning than Wake or Gibson. By the great body
                    of the clergy he was regarded as the ablest and most intrepid tribune that had
                    ever defended their rights against the oligarchy of prelates. The Lower House of
                    Convocation voted him thanks for his services; the University of Oxford created
                    him a doctor of divinity; and soon after the accession of Anne, while the Tories
                    still had the chief weight in the Government, he was promoted to the deanery of
                    Carlisle.</p>
                <p>Soon after he had obtained this preferment the Whig party rose to ascendency in
                    the state. From that party he could expect no favour. Six years elapsed before a
                    change of fortune took place. At length, in the year 1710, the prosecution of
                    Sacheverell produced a formidable explosion of High Church fanaticism At such a
                    moment Atterbury could not fail to be conspicuous. His inordinate zeal for the
                    body to which he belonged, his turbulent and aspiring temper, his rare talents
                    for agitation and for controversy, were again signally displayed. He bore a
                    chief part in framing that artful and eloquent speech which the accused divine
                    pronounced at the bar of the Lords, and which presents a singular contrast to
                    the absurd and scurrilous sermon which had very unwisely been honoured with,
                    impeachment. During the troubled and anxious months which followed the trial,
                    Atterbury was among the most active of those pamphleteers who inflamed the
                    nation against the Whig ministry and the Whig Parliament. When the ministry had
                    been changed and the Parliament dissolved, rewards were showered upon him. The
                    Lower House of Convocation elected him prolocutor. The Queen appointed him dean
                    of Christ Church on the death of his old friend and patron Aldrich. The college
                    would have preferred a gentler ruler. Nevertheless, the new head was received
                    with every mark of honour. A congratulatory oration in Latin was addressed to
                    him in the magnificent vestibule of the hall; and he in reply professed the
                    warmest attachment to the venerable house in which he had been educated, and
                    paid many gracious compliments to those over whom he was to preside. But it was
                    not in his nature to be a mild or an equitable governor. He had left the chapter
                    of Carlisle distracted by quarrels. He found Christ Church at peace; but in
                    three months his despotic and contentious temper did at Christ Church what it
                    had done at Carlisle. He was succeeded in both his deaneries by the humane and
                    accomplished Smalridge, who gently complained of the state in which both had
                    been left. “Atterbury goes before, and sets everything on fire. I come after him
                    with a bucket of water.” It was said by Atterbury’s enemies that he was made a
                    bishop because he was so bad a dean. Under his administration Christ Church was
                    in confusion, scandalous altercations took place, opprobrious words were
                    exchanged; and there was reason to fear that the great Tory college would be
                    ruined by the tyranny of the great Tory doctor. He was soon removed to the
                    bishopric of Rochester, which was then always united with the deanery of
                    Westminster. Still higher dignities seemed to be before him. For, though there
                    were many able men on the Episcopal bench, there were none who equalled or
                    approached him in parliamentary talents. Had his party continued in power it is
                    not. “improbable that he would have been raised to the archbishopric of
                    Canterbury. The more splendid his prospects the more reason he had to dread the
                    accession of a family which was well known to be partial to the Whigs. There is
                    every reason to believe that he was one of those politicians who hoped that they
                    might be able, during the life of Anne, to prepare matters in such a way that at
                    her decease there might be little difficulty in setting aside the Act of
                    Settlement and placing the Pretender on the throne. Her sudden death confounded
                    the projects of these conspirators. Atterbury, who wanted no kind of courage,
                    implored his confederates to proclaim James III., and offered to accompany the
                    heralds in lawn sleeves. But he found even the bravest soldiers of his party
                    irresolute, and exclaimed, not, it is said, without interjections which ill
                    became the mouth of a father of the church, that the best of all causes and the
                    most precious of all moments had been pusillanimously thrown away. He acquiesced
                    in what he could not prevent, took the oaths to the House of Hanover, and at the
                    coronation officiated with the outward show of zeal, and did his best to
                    ingratiate himself with the royal family. But his servility was requited with
                    cold contempt. No creature is so revengeful as a proud man who has humbled
                    himself in vain. Atterbury became the most factious and pertinacious of all the
                    opponents of the Government. In the House of Lords his oratory, lucid, pointed,
                    lively, and set off with every grace of pronunciation and of gesture, extorted
                    the attention and admiration even of a hostile majority. Some of the most
                    remarkable protests which appear in the journals of the peers were drawn up by
                    him; and, in some of the bitterest of those pamphlets which called on the
                    English to stand up for their country against the aliens who had come from
                    beyond the seas to oppress and plunder her, critics easily detected his style.
                    When the rebellion of 1715 broke out, he refused to sign the paper in which the
                    bishops of the province of Canterbury declared their attachment to the
                    Protestant succession. He busied himself in electioneering, especially at
                    Westminster, where as dean he possessed great influence; and was, indeed,
                    strongly suspected of having once set on a riotous mob to prevent his Whig
                    fellow-citizens from polling.</p>
                <p>After having been long in indirect communication with the exiled family, he, in
                    1717, began to correspond directly with the Pretender. The first letter of the
                    correspondence is extant. In that letter Atterbury boasts of having, during many
                    years past, neglected no opportunity of serving the Jacobite cause. “My daily
                    prayer,” he says, “is that you may have success. May I live to see that day, and
                    live no longer than I do what is in my power to forward it.” It is to be
                    remembered that he who wrote thus was a man bound to set to the church of which
                    he was overseer an example of strict probity; that he had repeatedly sworn
                    allegiance to the House of Brunswick; that he had assisted in placing the crown
                    on the head of George I., and that he had abjured James III., “without
                    equivocation or mental reservation, on the true faith of a Christian.”</p>
                <p>It is agreeable to turn from his public to his private life. His turbulent
                    spirit, wearied with faction and treason, now and then required repose, and
                    found it in domestic endearments, and in the society of the most illustrious of
                    the living and of the dead. Of his wife little is known; but between him and his
                    daughter there was an affection singularly close aud tender. The gentleness of
                    his manners when he was in the company of a few friends was such as seemed
                    hardly credible to those who knew him only by his writings and speeches. The
                    charm of his “softer hour” has been commemorated by one of those friends in
                    imperishable verse. Though Atterbury’s classical attainments were not great, his
                    taste in English literature was excellent; and his admiration of genius was so
                    strong that it overpowered even his political and religious antipathies. His
                    fondness for Milton, the mortal enemy of the Stuarts and of the church, was such
                    as to <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n67/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0067-0056"/> many Tories seemed a crime. On the sad night on
                    which Addison was laid in the chapel of Henry VII., the Westminster boys
                    remarked that Atterbury read the funeral service with a peculiar tenderness and
                    solemnity. The favourite companions, however, of the great Tory prelate were, as
                    might have been expected, men whose politics had at least a tinge of Toryism. He
                    lived on friendly terms with Swift, Arbuthnot, and Gay. With Prior he had a
                    close intimacy, which some misunderstanding about public affairs at last
                    dissolved. Pope found in Atterbury not only a warm admirer, but a most faithful,
                    fearless, and judicious adviser. The poet was a frequent guest at the episcopal
                    palace among the elms of Bromley, and entertained not the slightest suspicion
                    that his host, now declining in years, confined to an easy chair by gout, and
                    apparently devoted to literature, was deeply concerned in criminal and perilous
                    designs against the Government.</p>
                <p>The spirit of the Jac0bite3 had been cowed by the events of 1715. It revived in
                    1721. The failure of the South Sea project, the panic in the money market, the
                    downfall of great commercial houses, the distress from which no part of the
                    kingdom was exempt, had produced general discontent. It seemed not improbable
                    that at such a moment an insurrection might be successful. An insurrection was
                    planned. The streets of London were to be barricaded; the Tower and the Bank
                    were to be surprised; King George, his family, and his chief captains and
                    councillors w ere to be arrested, and King James was to be proclaimed. The
                    design became known to the duke of Orleans, regent of France, who was on terms
                    of friendship with the house of Hanover. He put the English Government on its
                    guard. Some of the chief malcontents were committed to prison; and among them
                    was Atterbury. No bishop of the Church of England had been taken into custody
                    since that memorable day when the applauses and prayers of all London had
                    followed the seven bishope to the gate of the Tower. The Opposition entertained
                    some hope that it might be possible to excite among the people an enthusiasm
                    resembling that of their fathers, who rushed into the waters of the Thames to
                    implore the blessing of Sancroft. Pictures of the heroic confessor in his cell
                    were exhibited at the shop windows. Verses in his praise were sung about the
                    streets. The restraints by which he was prevented from communicating with his
                    accomplices were represented as cruelties worthy of the dungeons of the
                    Inquisition. Strong appeals w ere made to the priesthood. Would they tamely
                    permit so gross an insult to be offered to their cloth Î Would they suffer the
                    ablest, the most eloquent member of their profession, the man who had so often
                    stood up for their rights against the civil power, to be treated like the vilest
                    of mankind! There was considerable excitement: but it was allayed by a temperate
                    and artful letter to the clergy, the work, in all probability, of Bishop Gibson,
                    who stood high in the favour of Walpole, and shortly after became minister for
                    ecclesiastical affairs.</p>
                <p>Atterbury remained in close confinement during some months. He had carried on his
                    correspondence with the exiled family so cautiously that the circumstantial
                    proofs of his guilt, though sufficient to produce entire moral conviction, were
                    not sufficient to justify legal conviction. He could be reached only by a bill
                    of pains and penalties. Such a bill the Whig party, then decidedly predominant
                    in both Houses, was quite prepared to support. Many hot-headed members of that
                    party were eager to follow the precedent which had been set in the case of Sir
                    John Fenwick, and to pass an act for cutting off the bishop’s head. Cadogan, who
                    commanded the army, a brave soldier, but a headstrong politician, is said to
                    have exclaimed with great vehemence, “Fling him to the lions in the Tower.” But
                    the wiser and more humane Walpole was always unwilling to shed blood, and his
                    influence prevailed. When Parliament met, the evidence against the bishop was
                    laid before committees of both Houses. Those committees reported that his guilt
                    was proved. In the Commons a resolution pronouncing him a traitor was carried by
                    nearly two to one. A bill was then introduced which provided that he should be
                    deprived of his spiritual dignities, that he should be banished for life, and
                    that no British subject should hold any intercourse with him except by the royal
                    permission. This bill passed the Commons with little difficulty; for the bishop,
                    though invited to defend himself, chose to reserve his defence for the assembly
                    of which he was a member. In the Lords the contest was sharp. The young duke of
                    Wharton, distinguished by his parts, his dissoluteness, and his versatility,
                    spoke for Atterbury with great effect; and Atterbury’s own voice wa3 heard for
                    the last time by that unfriendly audience which had so often listened to him
                    with mingled aversion and delight. He produced few witnesses, nor did those
                    witnesses say much that could be of service to him. Among them was Pope. He was
                    called to prove that, while he was an inmate of the palace at Bromley, the
                    bishop’s time was completely occupied by literary and domestic matters, and that
                    no leisure was left for plotting. But Pope, who was quite unaccustomed to speak
                    in public, lost his head, and, as he afterwards owned, though he had only ten
                    words to say, made two or three blunders.</p>
                <p>The bill finally passed the Lords by eighty-three votes to forty-three. The
                    bishops, with a single exception, were in the majority. Their conduct drew on
                    them a sharp taunt from Lord Bathurst, a warm friend of Atterbury and a zealous
                    Tory. “The wild Indians,” he said, “give no quarter, because they believe that
                    they shall inherit the skill and prowess of every adversary whom they destroy.
                    Perhaps the animosity of the right reverend prelates to their brother may be
                    explained in the same way.”</p>
                <p>Atterbury took leave of those whom he loved with a dignity and tenderness worthy
                    of a better man. Three fine lines of his favourite poet were often in his
                    mouth—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> “Some natural tears lie dropped, but wiped them soon: </l>
                    <l part="N"> The world was all before him, where to chuse </l>
                    <l part="N"> His place of rest, and Providence his guide. " </l>
                </lg>
                <p>At parting he presented Pope with a Bible, and said, with a disingenuousness of
                    which no man who had studied the Bible to much purpose would have been guilty,
                    “If ever you learn that I have any dealings with the Pretender, I give you leave
                    to say that my punishment is just.” Pope at this time really believed the bishop
                    to be an injured man. Arbuthnot seems to have been of the same opinion. Swift, a
                    few months later, ridiculed with great bitterness, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voyage to Lapute,</hi> the evidence which had satisfied the two Houses of
                    Parliament. Soon, however, the most partial friends of the banished prelate
                    ceased to assert his innocence, and contented themselves with lamenting and
                    excusing what they could not defend. After a short stay at Brussels he had taken
                    up his abode at Paris, and had become the leading man among the Jacobite
                    refugees who were assembled there. He was invited to Rome by the Pretender, who
                    then held his mock court under the immediate protection of the Pope. But
                    Atterbury felt that a bishop of the Church of England would be strangely out of
                    place at the Vatican, and declined the invitation. During some months, however,
                    he might flatter himself that he stood high in the good graces of James. The
                    correspondence between the master and the servant was constant. Atterbury’s
                    merits were warmly acknowledged, his advice was respectfully received, and he
                    was, as Bolingbroke had been before him, the prime minister of a king without a
                    kingdom.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n68/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0068-0057"/>
                <p>Cut the new favourite found, as Bolingbroke had found before him, that it was
                    quite as hard to keep the shadow of power under a vagrant and mendicant prince
                    as to keep the reality of power at Westminster. Though James had neither
                    territories nor revenues, neither army nor navy, there was more faction and more
                    intrigue among his courtiers than among those of his successful rival. Atterbury
                    soon perceived that his counsels were disregarded, if not distrusted. His proud
                    spirit was deeply wounded. He quitted Paris, fixed his residence at Montpellier,
                    gave up politics, and devoted himself entirely to letters. In the sixth year of
                    his exile he had so severe an illness that his daughter, herself in very
                    delicate health, determined to run all risks that she might see him once more.
                    Having obtained a licence from the English Government, she went by sea to
                    Bordeaux, but landed there in such a state that she could travel only by boat or
                    in a litter. Her father, in spite of his infirmities, set out from Montpellier
                    to meet her; and she, with the impatience which is often the sign of approaching
                    death, hastened towards him. Those who were about her in vain implored her to
                    travel slowly. She said that every hour was precious, that she only wished to
                    see her papa and to die. She met him at Toulouse, embraced him, received from
                    his hand the sacred bread and wine, and thanked God that they had passed one day
                    in each other’s society before they parted for ever. She died that night.</p>
                <p>It was some time before even the strong mind of Atterbury recovered from this
                    cruel blow. As soon as he was himself again he became eager for action and
                    conflict <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> grief, which disposée gentle natures to
                    retirement, to inaction, and to meditation, only makes restless spirits more
                    restless. The Pretender, dull and bigoted as he was, had found out that he had
                    not acted wisely in parting with one who, though a heretic, was, in abilities
                    and accomplishments, the foremost man of the Jacobite party. The bishop was
                    courted back, and was without much difficulty induced to return to Paris, and to
                    become once more the phantom minister of a phantom monarchy. But his long and
                    troubled life was drawing to a close. To the last, however, his intellect
                    retained all its keenness and vigour. He learned, in the ninth year of his
                    banishment, that he had been accused by Oldmixon, as dishonest and malignant a
                    scribbler as any that has been saved from oblivion by the Dunciad, of having, in
                    concert with other Christ Churchmen, garbled Clarendon’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Rebellion.</hi> The charge, as respected Atterbury, had not the
                    slightest foundation; for he was not one of the editors of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History,</hi> and never saw it till it was printed. He published a short
                    vindication of himself, which is a model in its kind, luminous, temperate, and
                    dignified. A copy of this little work he sent to the Pretender, with a letter
                    singularly eloquent and graceful. It was impossible, the old man said, that he
                    should write anything on such a subject without being reminded of the
                    resemblance between his own fate and that of Clarendon. They were the only two
                    English subjects that had ever been banished from their country and debarred
                    from all communication -with their friends by Act of Parliament. But here the
                    resemblance ended. One of the exiles had been so happy to bear a chief part in
                    the restoration of the royal house. All that the other could now do was to die
                    asserting the rights of that house to the last. A few weeks after this letter
                    was written Atterbury died. He had just completed his seventieth year.</p>
                <p>His body was brought to England, and laid, with great privacy, under the nave of
                    Westminster Abbey. Only three mourners followed the coffin. No inscription marks
                    the grave. That the epitaph with which Pope honoured the memory of his friend
                    does not appear on the walls of the great national cemetery is no subject of
                    regret, for nothing worse was ever written by Colley Cibber.</p>
                <p>Those who wish for more complete information about Atterbury may easily collect
                    it from his sermons and his controversial writings, from the report of the
                    parliamentary proceedings against him, which will be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">State Trials;</hi> from the five volumes of his correspondence,
                    edited by Mr Nichols, and from the first volume of the Stuart papers, edited by
                    Mr Glover. A very indulgent but a very interesting account of the bishop’s
                    political career will be found in Lord Stanhope’s valuable <hi rend="italic"
