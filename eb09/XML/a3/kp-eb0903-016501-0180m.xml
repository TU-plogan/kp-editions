                    earliest dramatists of Germany, was born in 1560, probably at Nuremberg,—at
                    least he resided there when a mere boy. His first occupation was keeping an
                    iron-store, which he did with considerable success. After studying law for some
                    time at Bamberg, where he attained a good position as a lawyer, he returned to
                    Nuremberg, and continued to practise there, acquiring the freedom of the city in
                    1594, and ultimately becoming an imperial notary. He died 26th March 1605.
                    Ayrer’s works consist of numerous small poems, and of the series of dramas on
                    which his fame rests. Like other dramas of the time, his productions are, for
                    the most part, spectacular displays, with laboured dialogue, and vary in length
                    from five to twenty-eight acts. The plots are plainly taken from the Latin and
                    Italian tales which supplied material to nearly all the early European
                    dramatists. The chief interest of Ayrer’s works for English readers arise from
                    their connection with Shakespeare. Ayrer adopted several of Shakespeare’s plots,
                    as well a3 his method of representing the characters on the stage after life,
                    “and so produced,” says his editor, “according to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >neιυ</hi> English manner and art, that all can be personally acted and placed
                    so that it shall seem to the spectators to be really happening.” In Ayrer’s time
                    the dramatic spirit in England was strong, and good plays and players abounded.
                    Some of the latter took circuits through Germany, and though performing in their
                    native tongue, excited enthusiasm by their vivacity. Ayrer caught this
                    enthusiasm, and adapted several of the English dramas to the German stage. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Opus</hi><hi rend="italic">Theatricum,</hi> in one folio
                    volume of 1262 pages, was published posthumously in 1618. It contained thirty
                    plays and thirty-six carnival interludes. A second volume to contain forty more,
                    though promised, did not appear. Of the comedies and tragedies of Ayrer, six
                    have been reproduced with an English translation in Cohn’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shakespeare in Germany.</hi> These contain respectively plots resembling <hi
                    rend="italic">The Tempest, Much Ado about Noticing, The Two Gentlemen of Verona,
                    Titus</hi><hi rend="italic">Andronicus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Romeo and
                    Juliet,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hamlet.</hi> In 1601, a comic prose work by
                    Ayrer was published, giving an account of an <hi rend="italic">Imaginary Suit of
                    the Devil against Jesus Christ for Destroying Hell.</hi> Some of his plays were
                    published prior to 1585, but these are not now to be had, and even the folio of
                    1618 is extremely rare. Further information about Ayrer may be gained from

                <p>ΑΥΤΟΝ, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Robert</hi> (1570-1638), a Scottish lyrical poet,
                    the second son of Andrew Ayton of Kinaldie in Fifeshire, was educated at the
                    University of St Andrews, and seems afterwards to have resided for several years
                    in France, where he gained considerable reputation as a poet and scholar. On the
                    accession of James VI. in 1603, Ayton published a very elegant Latin panegyric,
                    which at once brought him into notice and favour at court. He was knighted by
                    the king, and held various important offices, particularly that of private
                    secretary to the queen. He was of an exceedingly amiable disposition, and was
                    much beloved by his contemporaries; even Ben Jonson, w ho criticised all other
                    poets so severely, seems to have made an exception in his favour, for he told
                    Drummond that Sir Robert loved him dearly. Ayton’s extant works consist of some
                    Latin poems, and of a few pieces in the English dialect, which are distinguished
                    by smoothness of rhythm and delicacy of fancy. His best ode, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inconstancy Reproved,</hi> beginning, “I do confess thou’rt smooth and fair,”
                    may take rank w ith the finest pieces of Herrick or Suckling, while a few others
                    are but little inferior. His poems have been collected and published by C.
                    Rogers (Edin. 1844).</p>
