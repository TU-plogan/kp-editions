                    >,</hi> an eminent Italian author and statesman, was born in October 1798, at
                    Turin. He was descended from an ancient and noble family of Piedmont, and was
                    the son of a military officer, who, when the subject of this notice was in his
                    fifteenth year, was appointed ambassador to Rome. The boy went with him, and,
                    being thus introduced to the magnificent works of art for which the Eternal City
                    is famous, contracted a love for painting, as well as for music. He desired to
                    become a painter, and, although his studies were for a time interrupted by his
                    receiving a commission in a Piedmontese cavalry regiment, and by a subsequent
                    illness, brought on by the severity of his scientific investigations and
                    resulting in his quitting the service, he eventually returned to Rome, and, with
                    some difficulty, obtained his father’s permission to devote himself to art. He
                    remained at the Papal capital eight years, and acquired great skill and some
                    fame as a landscape-painter. At the close of that period events directed his
                    mind into other channels. His father died in 1830, and the younger Azeglio then
                    removed to Milan, where he became acquainted with Alessandro Manzoni, the poet
                    and novelist, whose daughter he married. In this way his thoughts were turned
                    towards literature and politics. At that time, Italy was profoundly agitated by
                    the views of the national and liberal party. The country was divided into
                    several distinct states, of which the greater number, even of those that were
                    nominally independent, were under the influence of Austria. Lombardy and Venetia
                    formed parts of the Austrian dominions. The petty monarchies of the north were
                    little better than vassals to the house of Haps-burg; the Papacy, in the centre,
                    was opposed to all national aspirations; and the kingdom of the Two Sicilies, in
                    the south, was a despotism, which for cruelty and mental darkness could not have
                    been exceeded in Asia itself. The French revolution of July 1830 gave additional
                    force to the movements of the Italian liberal party, and the young men of the
                    day threw themselves with fervour into the crusade against old abuses and
                    foreign domination. Mazzini was just beginning his career as an agitator, and
                    the whole air was surcharged with revolutionary enthusiasm. This was especially
                    the case in the north of Italy, where Massimo d’Azeglio was now settled. Art was
                    abandoned by him for literature, and literature was practised with a view to
                    stimulating the sense of national independence and unity. In 1833, Μ. d’Azeglio
                    published a novel called <hi rend="italic">Ettore Fieramosca,</hi> which was
                    followed in 1841 by another, entitled <hi rend="italic">Niccolo di Lapi.</hi>
                    Both had a political tendency, and, between the two dates at which they
                    appeared, Μ. d’Azeglio visited various parts of Italy,diffusing those liberal
                    principles w hich he saw were the only hope of the future. His views, however,
                    were very different from those of the republican party. He was a constitutional
                    monarchist, and strongly opposed to the insurrections and secret conspiracies
                    which Mazzini and others so frequently fostered at that time, and which always
                    resulted in failure and renewed oppression. His treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >Degli</hi><hi rend="italic">Ultimi Casi</hi><hi rend="italic">di Romagna</hi>
                    (Of the Last Events in the Romagna), published in 1846, before the death of Pope
                    Gregory XVI., was at once a satire on the Papal Government, a denunciation of
                    the republican attempts at insurrection, and an exhortation to the Italian
                    princes to adopt a national policy. Μ. d’Azeglio returned to Rome in 1846, after
                    the death of Pope Gregory, in June, and, it is thought, had considerable
                    influence in persuading the new Pope (Pius IX.) to conduct his government in
                    accordance with liberal principles. He supported measures relating to the
                    freedom of the press, the reform of the Papacy, and the emancipation of the
                    Jews. In 1848 he accompanied the Papal army of observation sent from Rome to
                    watch the insurgent forces in Lombardy and Venetia, which had temporarily
                    discomfited the Austrians, and were being supported by Charles Albert, king of
                    Sardinia. General Durando, who had the command of the Papal army, actively
                    assisted the rebels, in defiance, it is said, of his instructions; and Azeglio
                    was severely wounded in the leg at the battle of Vicenza, where he commanded a
                    legion. In the same year (1848), he published a work on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Austrian Assassinations in Lombardy;</hi> and on the opening of the first
                    Sardinian parhament he was chosen a member of the chamber of deputies. After the
                    crushing defeat of the Sardinians at Novara, March 23, 1849,—a defeat which
                    brought the second of the two brief wars with Austria to a disastrous close,—
                    D’Azeglio was made president of the cabinet by Victor Emmanuel, in whose favour
                    his father, Charles Albert, had just resigned. In this position the marquis used
                    his high powers with great advantage to the progress and consolidation of the
                    Sardinian kingdom. His occupation of the office lasted from the 11th of May 1849
                    to the 20th of October 1852, when he was replaced by Count Cavour. At the
                    termination of the war of 1859, when a large portion of the States of the Church
                    shook off the dominion of the Pope, and declared for annexation to the kingdom
                    of Northern Italy, Azeglio was appointed general and commissioner-extraordinary,
                    purely military, for the Roman States—a temporary office, which he administered
                    in a conciliatory and sagacious spirit. He died on the 11th of January 1866,
                    leaving a reputation for probity and wisdom, which his countrymen will not
                    forget to cherish. His writings, chiefly of a polemical character, were
                    numerous. In addition to those already mentioned, the most noteworthy was a work
                    on <hi rend="italic">The Court of Rome and the Gospels,</hi> of which an English
                    translation, with a preface by Dr Layard, appeared in 1859. A volume of personal
                    recollections w as issued, in 1867, after Μ. d Azeglio s death.</p>
