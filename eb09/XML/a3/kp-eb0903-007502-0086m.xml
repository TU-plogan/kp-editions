                    correspondent, and intellectually far more distinguished than Gregory the Great,
                    the last of the series. The theological position and influence of Augustine may
                    be said to be unrivalled. No single name has ever exercised such power over the
                    Christian church, and no one mind ever made such an impression upon Christian
                    thought.</p>
                <p>Aurelius Augustinus was born at Tagaste (Tajelt), a town of Numidia, on the 13th
                    of November 354 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> His father, Patricius, was a
                    burgess of this town, and was still a pagan at the time of his son’s birth. His
                    mother, Monica, was not only a Christian, but a woman of the most elevated,
                    tender, and devoted piety, whose patient prayerfulness for both her husband and
                    son (at length crowned with success in both cases), and whose affectionate and
                    beautiful enthusiasm, have passed into a touching type of womanly saintliness
                    for all ages. She early instructed her son in the faith and love of Jesus
                    Christ, and for a time her instruction seems to have impressed his youthful
                    mind. Falling ill he wished to be baptised; but when the danger was past, the
                    rite was deferred, and, notwithstanding all his mother’s admonitions and
                    prayers, he grew up without any profession of Christian piety, or any devotion
                    to Christian principles. Inheriting from his father a vehement and sensual
                    disposition, he early gave way to the unbridled impulses of passion, and while
                    still a mere youth, formed a connection, common enough at the time, but at
                    variance with the principles of Christian morality. As the result of the
                    connection he became the father of a son, whom he named Adeodatus in a fit of
                    pious emotion, and to whom he was passionately attached.</p>
                <p>In the midst of all his youthful pleasures Augustine was an earnest student. His
                    father, observing the early development of his talents, formed the ambition of
                    training him to the brilliant and lucrative career of a rhetorician, and he
                    seems to have spared no expense to equip him for this career. The youth studied
                    not only at his native town, but at Madaura and Carthage, and especially devoted
                    himself to the Latin poets—many traces of his love for which are to be found in
                    his writings. His acquaintance with Greek literature was much more limited, and,
                    indeed, it has been doubted whether he could use, in the original, either the
                    Hebrew or Greek Scriptures.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“Augustinus extitit, ut alii, Ebraeae ac Graecae linguae ignarus.” (Walch,

                    >Hist. Interpret.,</hi> iii. 40.)</p></note> Apparently, he was in the habit of
                    using translations of Flato <hi rend="italic">(Confess.,</hi> viii. 2), but, on
                    the other hand, Greek words frequently occur in his writings correctly rendered
                    and discriminated; and he speaks in one of his epistles to Marcellinus (LIX.
                    tom. ii. 294) of referring to the Greek Psalter and finding, in reference to
                    certain difficulties, that it agreed with the Vulgate. Clausen, who has
                    particularly investigated the point, sums up the evidence to the effect that
                    Augustine was “fairly instructed in Greek grammar, and a subtle distinguisher of
                    words,” but that beyond this his knowledge was insufficient for a thorough
                    comprehension of Greek books, and especially for those in the Hellenistic
                    dialect.</p>
                <p>While a student at Carthage he was particularly attracted by the theatre, the
                    spectacles at which were of unusual magnificence. To his enthusiastic and
                    sensuous spirit they were irresistible, and the extent to which he seems to have
                    yielded to the fascination is sufficient proof of his active alienation from
                    Christianity at this period. The Christian church, as it has been said,
                    “abhorred the pagan theatre. The idolatrous rites, the lascivious attitudes, the
                    gladiatorial shows, which were its inseparable accompaniments, were equally
                    opposed to the dogmatic monotheism, to the piety, and to the mercy of the
                    gospel.” One of the most significant signs of a man having become a Christian
                    was his habitual absence from the theatre. No one was more emphatic on this
                    point afterwards than Augustine himself, and as the result of his own
                    experience, he seems to have doubted, apart from the gross immoralities of the
                    pagan stage, whether the indulgence in fictitious joys and woes is a warrantable
                    excitement <hi rend="italic">(Confess.,</hi> iii. 2).</p>
                <p>Cicero’s <hi rend="italic">Hortensius,</hi> which he read in his nineteenth year,
                    first awakened in Augustine’s mind the spirit of speculation<pb break="no"

                    and passed from one phase of thought to another, unable to find satisfaction in
                    any. Manichaeism first enthralled him. Its doctrine of two principles, one of
                    good and one of evil, seemed to answer to the wild confusion of his own heart,
                    and the conflict of higher and lower impulses which raged within him. It seemed
                    to solve the mysteries which perplexed him in his own experience and in the
                    world. He became a member of the sect, and entered into the class of <hi
                    rend="italic">auditors.</hi> His ambition was to be received among the number of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Elect,</hi> and so get to the heart of what he believed to
                    be their higher knowledge. But falling in with Faustus, a distinguished
                    Manichaean bishop and disputant, and entering into discussion with him, he was
                    greatly disappointed. The system lost its attraction for him; he gradually
                    became disgusted, and abandoned it. But before this he had left Carthage,
                    shocked with the licence of the students, and had betaken himself for a time to
                    Rome in the pursuit of his profession. There he also soon became dissatisfied,
                    and accepted an invitation to proceed to Milan, where the people were in search
                    of a teacher of rhetoric. He travelled thither at the public expense, and was
                    welcomed by friends who already seem to have recognised his distinction <hi
                    rend="italic">(Confess.,</hi> i. 16).</p>
                <p>At Milan the conflict of his mind in search of truth still continued. He was now
                    in his thirtieth year, and for eleven years he had been seeking for mental rest,
                    unable to find it. “To-morrow,” he said to himself, “I shall find it: it will
                    appear manifestly, and I shall grasp it” <hi rend="italic">(Confess.,</hi> vi.
                    18). But it still eluded his grasp, and he sunk back again into despondency. The
                    way, however, was being prepared for his conversion. Ambrose was bishop of
                    Milan, and, although he had a weak voice, was noted for his eloquence. Augustine
                    was attracted by his reputation, and went to hear the famous Christian preacher
                    in order, as he himself relates <hi rend="italic">(Confess.,</hi> v. 23), “to
                    see whether his eloquence answ ered what was reported of it. I hung on his words
                    attentively,” he adds, “but of the matter I was but an unconcerned and
                    contemptuous hearer.” He confesses his delight so far: “The bishop’s eloquence
                    was more full of knowledge, yet in manner less pleasurable and soothing, than
                    that of Faustus.” He wished an opportunity of conversation with him, but this
                    was not easily found. Ambrose had no leisure for philosophic discussion. He was
                    accessible to all who sought him, but never for a moment free from study or the
                    cares of duty. “Augustine used to enter, as all persons might, without being
                    announced; but after staying for a while, afraid of interrupting him, he
                    departed again.” He continued, however, to hear Ambrose preach, and gradually
                    the gospel of divine truth and grace was received into his heart. First Plato
                    and then St Paul opened his mind to higher thoughts, and at length certain words
                    of the latter were driven home with irresistible force to his conscience. He was
                    busy with his friend Alypius in studying the Pauline epiBtles. His struggle of
                    mind became intolerable; the thought of divine purity fighting in his heart with
                    the love of the world and of the flesh. He burst into an incon-trollable flood
                    of tears and rushed out into his garden, flinging himself under a fig tree that
                    he might allow his tears to have full vent, and pour out his heart to God.
                    Suddenly he seemed to hear a voice calling upon him to consult the divine
                    oracle, “Take up and read, take up and read.” He left off weeping, rose up, and
                    sought the volume where Alypius was sitting, and opening it read in silence the
                    following passage: “Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and
                    wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
                    make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof” (Rom. xiii. 13,
                    14). He adds, “I had neither desire nor need to read farther. As I finished the
                    sentence, as though the light of peace had been poured into my heart, all the
                    shadows of doubt dispersed. Thus hast Thou converted me to Thee, so as no longer
                    to seek either for wife or other hope of the world, standing fast in that rule
                    of faith in which Thou so many years before hadst revealed me to my mother” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Confess.,</hi> viii. 30).</p>
                <p>After his conversion, which is supposed to have occurred in the summer of 386,
                    Augustine gave up his profession as a teacher of rhetoric, and retired to a
                    friend’s house in the country, in order to prepare himself for baptism. His
                    religious opinions were still to some extent unformed, and even his habits by no
                    means altogether such as his great change demanded. He mentions, for example,
                    that during this time he broke himself off a habit of profane swearing, and in
                    other ways sought to discipline his character and conduct for the reception of
                    the sacred rite. He received baptism in Easter following, in his thirty-third
                    year; and along with him his son Adeodatus and his friend Alypius were admitted
                    to the Christian church. Monica, his mother, had rejoined him, and at length
                    rejoiced in the fulfilment of her prayers. Dying before his return to his native
                    country, her last hours were gladdened by his Christian sympathy. She implored
                    him to lay her body anywhere, but wherever he might be to remember her “at the
                    altar of the Lord,” a devout duty which he invites others to share with him, so
                    that her last request may, “through the prayers of many,” receive a more
                    abundant fulfilment.</p>
                <p>Augustine went back to Rome for a short period and then returned to his native
                    city, where he took up his aboda in retirement, forming, with some friends who
                    joined him in devotion, a small religious community, which looked to him as its
                    head. They had all things in common, as in the early church, and fasting and
                    prayer, Scripture reading and almsgiving, formed their regular occupations.
                    Their mode of life was not formally monastic according to any special rule, but
                    the experience of this time of seclusion was, no doubt, the basis of that
                    monastic system which Augustine afterwards sketched, and which derived from him
                    its name. Solitary monasticism had sprang up in the Egyptian deserts before
                    this. The life of St Anthony by Athanasius had widely diffused the fervour for
                    religious solitariness, and greatly touched Augustine at this period of his
                    profession. It did not remain for him, therefore, to originate the monastic
                    idea; but the association of monks in communities under a definite order and
                    head received a special impulse both from Ambrose and his illustrious convert.
                    As may be imagined, the fame of such a convert in such a position soon spread,
                    and invitations to a more active ecclesiastical life came to him from many
                    quarters. He shrank from the responsibility, but his destiny was not to be
                    avoided. After three years spent in retirement he took a journey to Hippo, to
                    see a Christian friend, who desired to converse with him as to his design of.
                    quitting the world and devoting himself to a religious life. He was the less
                    reluctant to make this journey, because there being already a bishop at Hippo he
                    hoped to escape all solicitation. But although the Christian community there had
                    a bishop, they w*anted a presbyter; and Augustine being present at the meeting
                    called to choose a presbyter, the people unanimously chose him. He burst into
                    tears, and would fain have escaped; but the church could not spare his services.
                    He was ordained to the presbyterate, and in a few years afterwards he was made
                    coadjutor to the bishop, and finally became sole bishop of the see.</p>
                <p>Henceforth Augustine’s life is filled up with his ecclesiastical labours, and is
                    more marked by the series of his numerous writings and the great controversies
                    in which they engaged him than by anything else. Already he had distinguished
                    himself as an author. He had written several <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0088-0077"/> philosophical treatises; he had combated the

                    >Academicos</hi><hi rend="italic">libià très,</hi> 386 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.);</hi> he had treated of the “Blessed Life” <hi rend="italic">(De

                    doctrines he had formerly professed. “When I was at Rome,” he says <hi
                    rend="italic">(Retract.,</hi> i. 7), “after my baptism, and could not hear in
                    silence the vaunting of the Manichaeans over true Christians, to whom they are
                    not to be compared, I wrote two books, one on <hi rend="italic">The Morals of
                    the Catholic Church,</hi> and the other on <hi rend="italic">The Morals of the
                    Mani-</hi><hi rend="italic">choeans."</hi> These tract3 or pamphlets, for they
                    are little more, were written in the year 388, about two years after his
                    conversion. Later, in 395, and again in 400, he pursued the controversy with the
                    Manichaeans, making an elaborate reply, in the latter year, to his old associate
                    and friend Faustus. The reply was provoked by an attack made by Faustus on the
                    Catholic faith, which the “brethren” invited Augustine to answer. This he did
                    characteristically and energetically by giving in succession “the opinions of
                    Faustus, as if stated by himself,” and his own in response. It was natural that
                    the Manichaean heresy, which had so long enslaved his own mind, should have
                    first exercised Augustine’s great powers a3 a theological thinker and disputant.
                    He was able from his own experience to give force to his arguments for the unity
                    of creation and of spiritual life, and to strengthen the mind of the Christian
                    church in its last struggle with that dualistic spirit which had animated and
                    moulded in succession so many forms of thought at variance with
                    Christianity.</p>
                <p>But the time was one of almost universal ecclesiastical and intellectual
                    excitement; and so powerful a mental activity as his was naturally drawn forth
                    in all directions. Following his writings against the Manichaeans come those
                    against the Donatists. This controversy was one which strongly interested him,
                    involving as it did the whole question of the constitution of the church and the
                    idea of catholic order, to which the circumstances of the age gave special
                    prominence. The Donatist schism sprang out of the Diocletian persecutions in the
                    beginning of the century. A party in the Church of Carthage, fired with
                    fanatical zeal on behalf of those who had distinguished themselves by resistance
                    to the imperial mandates and courted martyrdom, resented deeply the appointment
                    of a bishop of moderate opinions, whose consecration had been performed, they
                    alleged, by a <hi rend="italic">traditor.</hi> They set up, in consequence, a
                    bishop of their own, of the name of Majorinus, succeeded in 315 by Donatus. The
                    party made great pretensions to purity of discipline, and rapidly rose in
                    popular favour, notwithstanding a decision given against them both by the bishop
                    of Rome and by the Emperor Con-tantine, to whom they personally appealed.
                    Augustine was strongly moved by the lawlessness of the party, and launched forth
                    a series of writings against them, the most important of which survive, though
                    some are lost. Amongst these are <hi rend="italic">Seven Books on Baptism,</hi>
                    and a lengthened answer, in three books, to Petilian, bishop of Cirta, who was
                    the most eminent theologian amongst the Donatist divines. At a somewhat later
                    period, about 417, he wrote a treatise concerning the correction of the
                    Donatists <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Correctione</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Donatistarum),</hi> “for the sake of those,” he says in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Retractations,</hi> ii. c. 48, “who were not willing that the
                    Donatists should be subjected to the correction of the imperial laws.” In these
                    writings, while vigorously maintaining the validity of the Catholic Church as it
                    then stood in the Roman world, and the necessity for moderation in the exercise
                    of church discipline, Augustine yet gave currency, in his zeal against the
                    Donatists, to certain maxima as to the duty of the civil power to control
                    schism, which were of evil omen, and have been productive of much disaster in
                    the history of Christianity.</p>
                <p>The third controversy in which Augustine engaged was the most important, and the
                    most intimately associated with his distinctive greatness as a theologian. As
                    may be supposed, from the conflicts through which he had passed, the bishop of
                    Hippo was intensely interested in what may be called the anthropological aspects
                    of the great Christian idea of redemption. He had himself been brought out of
                    darkness into “marvellous light,” only by entering into the depths of his own
                    soul, and finding, after many struggles, that there was no power but divine
                    grace, as revealed in the life and death of the Son of God, which could bring
                    rest to human weariness, or pardon and peace for human guilt. He had found human
                    nature in his own case too weak and sinful to find any good for itself. In God
                    alone he had found good. This deep sense of human sinfulness coloured, all his
                    theology, and gave to it at once its depth —its profound and sympathetic
                    adaptation to all who feel the reality of sin—and that tinge of darkness and
                    exaggeration which as surely have repelled others. When the expression
                    Augustinianism is used, it points especially to those opinions of the great
                    teacher which were evoked in the Pelagian controversy, to which he devoted the
                    most mature and powerful period of his life. His opponents in this controversy
                    were Pelagius, from whom it derives its name, and Coelestius and Julianu3,
                    pupils of the former. Pelagius was a British monk. Augustine calls him Brito;
                    and Jerome points to his Scottish descent, in such terms, however, as to leave
                    it uncertain whether he was a native of Scotland or Ireland <hi rend="italic"
                    >(habet progeniem Scotice gentis</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannorum vicinia).</hi> He was a man of blameless character, devoted to the
                    reformation of society, full of enthusiasm, and that confidence in the natural
                    impulses of humanity which often accompanies philanthropic enthusiasm.
                    Travelling to Rome about the beginning of the 5th century, he took up his abode
                    for a time there, and soon made himself conspicuous by his activity and
                    opinions. His pupil Coelestius carried out the views of his master with a more
                    outspoken logic, and was at length arraigned before the bishop of Carthage for
                    the following, amongst other, heretical opinions :—(1.) That Adam’s sin was
                    purely personal, and affected none but himself; (2.) That each man,
                    consequently, is born with powers as incorrupt as those of Adam, and only falls
                    into sin under the force of temptation and evil example; (3.) That children who
                    die in infancy, being untainted by sin, are saved without baptism. Views such as
                    these were obviously in conflict with the whole course of Augustine’s
                    experience, as well as with his interpretation of the catholic doctrine of the
                    church. And when his attention was drawn to them by the trial and
                    excommunication of Coelestius, he undertook their refutation, first of all, in
                    three books on <hi rend="italic">Forgiveness of Sins and Baptism,</hi> addressed
                    to his friend Marcellinus, in which he vindicated the necessity of the baptism
                    of infants because of original sin and the grace of God by which we are
                    justified <hi rend="italic">(Retract.,</hi> ii. c. 23). This was in 412. In the
                    same year he addressed a further treatise to the same person, “My beloved son
                    Marcellinus,” on <hi rend="italic">The Spirit and the Letter.</hi> Three years
                    later he composed two further treatises on <hi rend="italic">Nature and
                    Grace,</hi> and the relation of the <hi rend="italic">Human to the Divine
                    Righteousness.</hi> The controversy was continued during many years in no fewer
                    than fifteen treatises. Upon no subject did Augustine bestow more of his
                    intellectual strength, and in relation to no other have his views so deeply and
                    permanently affected the course of Christian thought. Even those who most
                    usually agree with his theological stand-point will hardly deny that, while he
                    did much in these writings to vindicate divine truth and to expound the true
                    relations of the divine and human, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n89/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0089-0078"/> he also, here as elsewhere, was hurried into
                    extreme expressions as to the absoluteness of divine grace and the extent of
                    human corruption. Like his great disciple in a later age—Luther—Augustine was
                    prone to emphasise the side of truth which he had most realised in his own
                    experience, and, in contradistinction to the Pelagian exaltation of human
                    nature, to depreciate its capabilities beyond measure. There are few thoughtful
                    minds who would not concede the deeper truthfulness of Augustine’s spiritual and
                    theological analysis, in comparison with that of his opponent, as well as its
                    greater consistency with Scripture; but there are also few who would now be
                    disposed to identify themselves with the dogmatism of the orthodox bishop any
                    more than with the dogmatism of the heretical monk. And on one particular point,
                    which more or less runs through all the controversy—the salvation of infants—the
                    Christian consciousness, in its later and higher growth, may be said to have
                    pronounced itself decisively on the side of the monk rather than of the
                    bishop.</p>
                <p>In addition to these controversial writings, which mark the great epochs of
                    Augustine’s life and ecclesiastical activity after his settlement as a bishop at
                    Hippo, he was the author of other works, some of them better known and even more
                    important. His great work, the most elaborate, and in some respects the most
                    significant, that came from his pen, is <hi rend="italic">The. City of God.</hi>
                    It is designed as a great apologetic treatise in vindication of Christianity and
                    the Christian church,—the latter conceived as rising in the form of a new civic
                    order on the crumbling ruins of the Roman empire,—but it is also, perhaps, the
                    earliest contribution to the philosophy of history, as it is a repertory
                    throughout of his cherished theological opinions. This work and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Confessions</hi> are, probably, those by which he is best known,
                    the one as the highest expression of his thought, and the other as the best
                    monument of his living piety and Christian experience. <hi rend="italic">The
                    City of God</hi> was begun in 413, and continued to be issued in its several
                    portions for a period of thirteen years, or till 426. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confessions</hi> were written shortly after he became a bishop, about 397, and
                    give a vivid sketch of his early career. To the devout utterances and
                    aspirations of a great soul they add the charm of personal disclosure, and have
                    never ceased to excite admiration in all spirits of kindred piety. His
                    systematic treatise on <hi rend="italic">The Trinity,</hi> which extends to
                    fifteen books, and occupied him for nearly thirty years, must not be passed
                    over. “I began,” he says <hi rend="italic">{Retract.,</hi> ii. 15), “as a very
                    young man, and have published in my old age some books concerning the Trinity.”
                    This important dogmatic work, unlike most of his dogmatic writings, was not
                    provoked by any special controversial emergency, but grew up silently during
                    this long period in the author’s mind. This has given it something more of
                    completeness and organic arrangement than is usual with him, if it has also led
                    him into the prolonged discussion of various analogies, more curious than apt in
                    their bearing on the doctrine which he expounds. The exegetical writings of
                    Augustine,—his lengthened <hi rend="italic">Commentary on St John</hi> and on
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sermon on the Mount,</hi> &amp;c.,—and then his <hi
                    rend="italic">Letters,</hi> remain to be mentioned. The former have a value from
                    his insight into the deeper spiritual meanings of Scripture, but hardly for
                    their exegetical characteristics. The latter are full of interest in reference
                    to many points in the ecclesiastical history of the time, and his relation to
                    contemporary theologians like Jerome. They have neither the liveliness nor
                    variety of interest, however, which belong to the letters of Jerome himself. The
                    closing years of the great bishop were full of sorrow. The Vandals, who had been
                    gradually enclosing the Roman empire, appeared before the gates of Hippo, and
                    laid siege to it. Augustine was ill with his last illness, and could only pray
                    for his fellow-citizens. He passed away during the progress of the siege, on the
                    28th of August 430, at the age of seventy-five, and was spared the indignity of
                    seeing the city in the hands of the enemy.</p>
                <p>The character of Augustine, both as a man and a theologian, has been briefly
                    indicated in the course of our sketch. Little remains to be added without
                    entering into discussions too extended for our space. None can deny the
                    greatness of Augustine’s soul—his enthusiasm, his unceasing search after truth,
                    his affectionateness, his ardour, his self-devotion. And even those who may
                    doubt the soundness or value of some of his dogmatic conclusions, cannot
                    hesitate to acknowledge the depth of his spiritual convictions, and the
                    strength, solidity, and penetration with which he handled the most difficult
                    questions, and wrought all the elements of his experience and of his profound
                    Scriptural knowledge into a great system of Christian thought.</p>
                <p>The best complete edition of Augustine’s writings is that of the Benedictines, in
                    11 vols, folio, published at Paris, 1679-1800, and reprinted in 1836-38 in 22
                    half-volumes. Tillemont, in his <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History,</hi>
                    has devoted a quarto volume to his life and writings. Two extensive monographs
                    have appeared on him; the one by Kloth, a Roman Catholic (Aachen, 1840), and the
                    other by Bindemann, a Protestant (Berlin, 1844, 1855). See also Ritter’s <hi
