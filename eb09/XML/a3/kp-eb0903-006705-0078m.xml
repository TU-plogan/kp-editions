                <p><label type="entry">AUCKLAND</label>, a province of New Zealand, consisting of
                    the northern portion of North Island, and bounded for the most part on the S. by
                    the 39th parallel of latitude. In the N.W. it runs out into a peninsula between
                    200 and 300 miles in length, with a very irregular coast-line, especially on the
                    eastern side. The total area of the province is about 17,000,000 acres, of which
                    nearly 11,275,000 are still in possession of the Maoris, who are, however,
                    continually disposing of their claims to the Government. The surface of the
                    province is of a very varied character, presenting wide and fertile plains,
                    stretches of fern-heath and swamp, mountain ranges and isolated peaks, tracts of
                    richly-wooded jungle, rocky plateaus, and districts of strange volcanic
                    activity. All round the coast there are a large number of natural harbours, and
                    the most of the interior is traversed by navigable streams. The principal
                    river-system is that of the Waikato (or Rushing Water), which rises in the Taupo
                    Lake, in the south of the province, forces its way though an extensive rocky
                    table-land, flows onwards for about 35 miles through a rich but marshy basin,
                    joins its waters with the Waipa (or Peaceful Water), its largest tributary, cuts
                    a passage through the Taupiri range, and after traversing the fertile expanse
                    'of its lower basin, turns abruptly to the W. and falls into the sea about 35
                    miles S. of the city of Auckland. The value of the Waikato as a commercial
                    highway is greatly lessened by its mouth being encumbered with sandbanks, that
                    prevent the entrance of ships. To the E. of this river lies the valley of the
                    Thames, fertile and well watered by several streams, and still further eastward
                    extends the versant of the Bay of Plenty. The course of settlement has hitherto
                    advanced for the most part along the valleys of the Waikato and the
                    Thames,—Cambridge, about 104 miles S. of the city of Auckland, being the
                    frontier station in the former, and Tapapa, a little further to the S. in the
                    latter. Nearly the whole of the N.W. peninsula is occupied by a scattered
                    population, and various flourishing townships are situated along the coast on
                    all sides. In 1873 there were 3842 holdings in the province, and about 225,000
                    acres had been broken up. Hitherto the cultivation of the cereals has not proved
                    sufficiently remunerative, though climate and soil are equally favourable, and
                    the attention of the farmer has principally been turned to the rearing of the
                    various descriptions of live stock, more especially sheep. The natural wealth of
                    the province consists principally in its gold and timber. Coal has been found in
                    several districts, and a few mines have been successfully worked, as Kawakawa
                    (at the Bay of Islands), Drury, and Whangarei; but the most important deposits
                    are comparatively undisturbed. It is believed that iron may eventually be found
                    in considerable quantities, and various minerals have been pointed out in the
                    interior by scientific travellers. The chief seats of the gold-diggings are the
                    Coromandel peninsula and the Thames valley. ~ The quantity exported in 1871 was
                    valued at £1,888,708. The most important timber tree is the kauri-pine, which is
                    peculiar to Auckland, and does not grow further south than 37° 30'. It is of
                    magnificent dimensions, and valuable, not only as the most extensively used
                    building material, but on account of the fossil gum which is found wherever the
                    kauri forest has been. This gum forms one of the chief articles of export, about
                    14,277 tons being the amount in the three years 1870, 1871, and 1872. There are
                    various other trees of considerable value, such as the rimu, the kahikatca, and
                    the totara. The timber trade, both domestic and foreign, is increasing in
                    importance, and shipbuilding is extensively carried on. There are large
                    districts overgrown with the <hi rend="italic">phormium</hi> or New Zealand
                    flax, and the right to cut it on the waste lands is granted, by the Government
                    at a low price. In 1873, 1497 tons <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0079-0068"/> of the prepared fibre, valued at £27,783, were
                    exported, besides a considerable quantity of manufactured rope. Those great
                    necessities of commerce, roads and railways, are being constructed in various
                    directions. A line is in course of formation from Auckland up the valley of the
                    Waikato, as far as Newcastle, at the confluence of the Waipa, and a survey has
                    been made for about 20 miles further. A road runs from Bowen, on the Bay of
                    Plenty, across the country, through the wonderful lake district, with its
                    boiling fountains, steam geysers, and mud-baths, round by the east coast of
                    Taupo Lake, and over the highlands to Napier, in Hawke’s Bay province. The
                    history of Auckland was for long the history of New Zealand, and will be fully
                    treated under that heading. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">New Zealand.)</hi></p>
                <p>For a descriptive account of a large part of the province, the reader is referred
                    to Dr Hochstetter’s valuable works, especially to his <hi rend="italic">New
                    Zealand,</hi> 1863. A very graphic sketch of some of the natural curiosities is
                    furnished by Anthony Trollope in his <hi rend="italic">Australia and New

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Auckland,</hi> the capital of the above province, is finely
                    situated on an isthmus in the N.W. peninsula, on the S. shore of the Waitemata
                    harbour, which is formed by an inlet of the Hauraki Gulf. Lat. 36° 51 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> z</hi> S., long. 174° 50'. On the other side of the isthmus
                    lies the harbour and town of Manukau, which serves as a supplementary port to
                    the city. Auckland was founded in 1840 by Governor Hobson, and became a burgh in
                    1851. It was till 1865 the seat of the Government, which is now situated at
                    Wellington. The city has a fine appearance, especially from the harbour, and is
                    surrounded by a number of flourishing suburban villages, with several of which
                    it is connected by railway. Among the public buildings in the city and
                    neighbourhood may be mentioned the governor’s house, the cathedral, St John’s
                    Episcopal college, about 4 miles distant, the Auckland college and grammar
                    school, the Episcopal grammar school, in the suburb of Parnell, the provincial
                    hospital, the provincial lunatic asylum, and the orphanage at Parnell. A wharf,
                    1690 feet in length, has been built opposite the centre of the city, and affords
                    excellent accommodation for the gradually increasing traffic of the harbour. In
                    1872, 170 non-colonial vessels, with a tonnage of 54,257 tons, entered the port,
                    besides a large number of coasting ships. There are registered at Auckland 167
                    sailing vessels and 20 steamships, most of them of provincial build. The
                    population, which was 7989 in 1862, had increased by 1871 to 12,937 (with the
                    suburbs to 18,000), and is now estimated at about 21,000.</p>
