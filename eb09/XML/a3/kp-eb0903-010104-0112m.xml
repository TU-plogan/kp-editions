                    with English literature, her favourite authors being Richardson, Johnson,
                    Cowper, and Crabbe; she knew French well and Italian slightly, had some taste
                    for music, and was noted for her skill in needlework. She was a particular
                    favourite with all her younger relatives, especially on account of her wonderful
                    power of extemporising long and circumstantial narratives. At a very early age
                    she seems to have begun to exercise her faculty for composition, and wrote
                    several short tales and fragments of larger works, some of which have been found
                    among her papers. These first essays are written in a remarkably pure and
                    vigorous style, and are not unworthy of her later reputation. In 1796 her first
                    large work, <hi rend="italic">Pride and Prejudice,</hi> was begun and completed
                    in about ten months <hi rend="italic">; Sense and Sensibility</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Northanger Abbey</hi> were written soon after, during 1797 and
                    1798. Many years elapsed before these works were published, for the first
                    attempts to introduce them to the public were badly received. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pride and Prejudice</hi> was summarily rejected by Mr Cadell; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Northanger Abbey</hi> was sold for £10 to a Bath publisher, but was never
                    printed, and, many years after, was bought back by the author. From 1801 to 1805
                    the Austen family resided in Bath, they then removed to Southampton, and
                    finally, in 1809, settled at Chawton. There Miss Austen, who for some years had
                    written nothing, resumed her pen, and began to prepare for publication her early
                    novels. <hi rend="italic">Sense and Sensibility</hi> was published in 1811, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pride and Prejudice</hi> in 1813, <hi rend="italic">Mansfield
                    Parkin</hi> 1814, <hi rend="italic">.Emma</hi> in 1816. These four were
                    anonymous. <hi rend="italic">Northanger Abbey</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Persuasion</hi> appeared together under Miss Austen’s name in 1818, after her
                    death. Early in 1816 her health had begun to give way; her strength gradually
                    declined, and on the 18th July 1817, she died at Winchester, whither she had
                    removed for change of air and scenery. She was buried in the cathedral of that
                    town.</p>
                <p>Miss Austen’s works at the time of their appearance were on the whole well
                    received, and brought her considerable reputation,—more, indeed, than she had
                    herself anticipated; but their full merits were not then so generally recognised
                    as they have since been. The novels most popular at that time belonged to the
                    class of which Mrs Radcliffe’s <hi rend="italic">IJdolpho,</hi> Godwin’s <hi
                    rend="italic">St Leon</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Caleb Williams,</hi> and Lewis’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Monk</hi> are the best known representatives. Against this
                    style of fiction Miss Austen from the first set her face; she had a remarkably
                    keen sense of humour, and the ludicrous aspect of these thrilling incidents,
                    mysterious situations, and unnatural characters, presented itself very strongly
                    to her mind. <hi rend="italic">Northanger Abbey,</hi> one of her earliest
                    productions, is a clever and well-sustained parody on romances of this type. She
                    did not, however, confine herself to mere negative criticism, but resolved to
                    show that the interest of readers could be roused and sustained by a story
                    absolutely free from the whole machinery of romance and exaggerated sentiment,
                    but presenting an accurately-drawn picture_of quiet, natural life. This task she
                    accomplished with complete success; she was the first <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n113/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0113-0102"/> to introduce the novel of domestic life, and her
                    writings are still the best specimens of that class of fiction. It could hardly
                    be expected that such works would become immediately popular; the characters,
                    the motives of action, and the plot itself were too ordinary, one may say too
                    commonplace, to appeal strongly to the sympathies of the general mass of
                    readers. Her colours were not showy enough to strike the vulgar eye. It is
                    probable, indeed, that her admirers will always be few in number; for not only
                    does it require a somewhat cultivated taste to appreciate the rare skill with
                    which the scanty materials of her tales are handled, but the author’s experience
                    of life was so limited that her works are entirely wanting in certain elements—
                    such as depth of feeling and breadth of sympathy—which are indispensable before
                    a work of fiction can exercise any considerable influence on the public
                    mind.</p>
                <p>The framework in nearly all Miss Austen’s novels is the same, taken as they are
                    from ordinary English middle-class life; her characters are in no way
                    distinguished by any remarkable qualities, they are such persons as one would
                    readily expect to meet in every-day life; the plot is exceedingly simple, and
                    the incidents, never rising above the level of the most common-place
                    occurrences, flow naturally from the characters of the actors. In the hands of
                    most writers such materials would infallibly become monotonous and tiresome; but
                    from any danger of this Miss Austen is completely freed by her wonderful power
                    of exciting interest in the “involvements and feelings of ordinary life,” and
                    the skill with which, by a series of imperceptible but effective touches, she
                    discriminates her characters, rounds them off, and makes them stand out from the
                    canvas real and living personages. Her gallery of portraits is certainly small,
                    and the same character appears over and over again, but each figure is so
                    distinctly drawn, and has such marked individuality, that one is never struck
                    with a sense of repetition. A warm admirer of her works, Archbishop Whately, has
                    compared them to the carefully-executed pictures of the Dutch school; perhaps
                    the analogy of miniature painting, suggested by the author herself, is more
                    happy and expressive.</p>
                <p>Miss Austen’s life has been written by her nephew, Bev. J. Austen-Leigh (1870, 2d
                    ed., 1871), who has also published some extracts from her papers, including a
                    short tale, <hi rend="italic">Lady Susan,</hi> written in the form of letters; a
                    fragment of a larger work called <hi rend="italic">The Watsons;</hi> the first
                    draft of a chapter in <hi rend="italic">Persuasion;</hi> and the beginning of a
                    novel, on which she was engaged at the time of her death.</p>
