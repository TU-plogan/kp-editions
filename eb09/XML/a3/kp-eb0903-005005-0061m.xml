                    nourishment), a term in medicine used to describe a state of wasting due to some
                    interference with the function of healthy nutrition. In the living organism
                    there are ever at work changes involving the waste of its component tissues,
                    which render necessary, in order to the preservation of life, the supply and
                    proper assimilation of nutritive material. It is also essential for the
                    maintenance of health that a due relation exist between these processes of waste
                    and repair, so that the one may not be in excess of the other. When the
                    appropriation of nutriment exceeds the waste, hypertrophy or increase in bulk of
                    the tissues takes place. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Hypertrophy.)</hi> When, on
                    the other hand, the supply of nutritive matter is suspended or diminished, or
                    when the power of assimilation is impaired, atrophy or wasting is the result.
                    Thus the whole body becomes atrophied in many diseases; and in old age every
                    part of the frame, with the single exception of the heart, undergoes atrophic
                    change. Atrophy may, however, affect single organs or parts of the body,
                    irrespective of the general state of nutrition, and this may be brought about in
                    a variety of ways. One of the most frequently observed of such instances is
                    atrophy from disuse, or cessation of function. Thus, when a limb is deprived of
                    the natural power of motion, either by paralysis or by painful joint disease,
                    the condition of exercise essential to its nutrition being no longer fulfilled,
                    atrophy of all its textures sooner or later takes place. The brain in imbeciles
                    is frequently observed to be shrivelled, and in many cases of blindness there is
                    atrophy of the optic nerve and optic tract. This form of atrophy is likewise
                    well exemplified in the case of those organs and structures of the body which
                    subserve important ends during foetal life, but which, ceasing to be necessary
                    after birth, undergo a sort of natural atrophy, such as the thymus gland, and
                    certain vessels specially concerned in the foetal circulation. The uterus after
                    parturition undergoes a certain amount of atrophy, and the ovaries, after the
                    child-bearing period, become, shrunken. Atrophy of a part may also be caused by
                    interruption to its normal blood supply, as in the case of the ligature or
                    obstruction of an artery. Again, long standing disease, by affecting the
                    nutrition of an organ and by inducing the deposit of morbid products, may result
                    in atrophy, as frequently happens in affections of the liver and kidneys. Parts
                    that are subjected to continuous pressure are liable to become atrophied, as is
                    sometimes seen in internal organs which have been pressed upon by tumours or
                    other morbid growths, and is well illustrated in the case of the feet of Chinese
                    ladies, which are prevented from growing by persistent compression exercised
                    from birth. Atrophy may manifest itself simply by loss of substance; but, on the
                    other hand, it is often found to co-exist with degenerative changes in the
                    textures affected and the formation of adventitious growth, so that the part may
                    not be reduced in bulk although atrophied as regards its proper structure. Thus,
                    in the case of the heart, when affected with fatty degeneration, there is
                    atrophy of the proper muscular texture, which, however, being largely replaced
                    by fatty matter, the organ may undergo no diminution in volume, but may, on the
                    contrary, be increased in size. Atrophy is usually a gradual and slow process,
                    but sometimes it proceeds rapidly. In the disease known by the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0062-0051"/> name of <hi rend="italic">acute yellow atrophy of
                    the liver,</hi> that organ undergoes such rapidly destructive change as results
                    in its shrinking to half, or one-third, of its normal size in the course of a
                    few days.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">progressive muscular atrophy</hi> (synonyms, <hi
                    rend="italic">wasting</hi> or <hi rend="italic">creeping palsy)</hi> is applied
                    to an affection of the muscular system, which is characterised by the atrophy
                    and subsequent paralysis of certain muscles, or groups of muscles, and is
                    associated with morbid changes in the anterior roots of the nerves of the spinal
                    cord. This disease begins insidiously, and is often first observed to affect the
                    muscles of one hand, generally the right. The attention of the sufferer is first
                    attracted by the power of the hand becoming weakened, and then there is found to
                    be a wasting of certain of its muscles, particularly those of the ball of the
                    thumb. Gradually other muscles in the arms and legs become affected in a similar
                    manner, their atrophy being attended with a corresponding diminution in power.
                    Although sometimes arrested, this disease tends to progress, involving
                    additional muscles, until in course of time the greater part of the muscular
                    system is implicated, and a fatal result ensues. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi>
