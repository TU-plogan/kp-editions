                    Edmonstoune</hi></label>, a Scottish poet, humourist, and miscellaneous writer,
                    was born at Edinburgh, 21st June 1813. He was the only son of Roger Aytoun, a
                    writer to the Signet, and the family was of the same stock as Sir Robert Ayton
                    noticed above. From his mother, a woman of marked originality of character and
                    considerable culture, he derived his distinctive qualities, his early tastes in
                    literature, and his political sympathies, his love for ballad poetry, and his
                    admiration for the Stuarts. At the age of eleven he was sent to the Edinburgh
                    Academy, whence he passed in due time to the University, studied the classics
                    under Professors Pillans and Dunbar, and attended the course of Professor John
                    Wilson on Moral Philosophy. In 1833 he spent a few months in London for the
                    purpose of studying the law; but in September of that year he went to study
                    German at Aschaffenburg, where he remained till April 1834. He then resumed his
                    legal pursuits in his father’s chambers, was admitted a writer to the Signet in
                    1835, and five years later was called to the Scottish bar. But, by his own
                    confession, though he “followed the law, he never could overtake it.” He
                    disliked his profession, and allowed his literary tastes to predominate. His
                    first publication—a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Poland, Homer, and other
                    Poems,</hi> in which he gave expression to his eager interest in the state of
                    Poland—appeared in 1832. While in Germany he made a translation in blank verse
                    of the first part of <hi rend="italic">Faust;</hi> but, forestalled by other
                    translations, it was never published. In 1836 he made his earliest contributions
                    to <hi rend="italic">Blackwood’s Magazine,</hi> in translations from Uhland; and
                    from 1839 till his death he remained on the staff of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Blackwood.</hi> About 1841 he became acquainted with Mr Theodore<pb break="no"

                    series of light humorous papers on the tastes and follies of the day, in which
                    were interspersed the verses which afterwards became popular as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bon</hi><hi rend="italic">G</hi><hi rend="italic">ualtιer
                    Ballads.</hi> 1 he work on which his reputation as a poet chiefly rests is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers.</hi> The first of these
                    appeared in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood’s Magazine</hi> in April 1843, and the
                    whole were published in a collected edition in 1848. They became very popular,
                    and have passed through nineteen editions, the last of which has spirited and
                    beautiful illustrations by Sir J. Noel Paton and W. H. Paton. Meanwhile, he
                    obtained, in 1845, the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh
                    University, which he filled honourably and successfully till 1864. He devoted
                    himself conscientiously to the duties of the office, and his pupils increased in
                    number from 30 to 150. In 1849 he married the youngest daughter of Professor
                    John Wilson (Christopher North), whose death, in 1859, was the great calamity of
                    his life. His services in support of the Tory party, especially during the
                    Anti-Corn-Law struggle, received official recognition in his appointment (1852)
                    as sheriff of Orkney and Zetland. In 1854 appeared <hi rend="italic">Firmilian,
                    a Spasmodic Tragedy,</hi> in which he attacked and parodied the writings of
                    Bailey, Sydney Dobell, and Alexander Smith; and two years later he published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Bothwell, a Poem.</hi> Among his other literary works are a
                    <hi rend="italic">Collection of the Ballads of Scotland,</hi> a translation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Poems and Ballads of Goethe,</hi> executed in co-operation
                    with his friend Theodore Martin, a small volume on the <hi rend="italic">Life
                    and Times of Richard I.,</hi> written for the <hi rend="italic">Family
                    Library,</hi> and a novel entitled <hi rend="italic">Norman Sinclair,</hi> many
                    of the details in which are taken from incidents in his own experience. In 1860
                    Aytoun was elected honorary president of the Associated Societies of Edinburgh
                    University. The death of his mother took place in November 1861, and his own
                    health was failing. In December 1863 he married Miss Kinnear, and health and
                    happiness for a time revived; but his malady recurred, and he died at
                    Blackhills, near Elgin, 4th August 1865. His remains were interred at Edinburgh.
                    A memoir of Aytoun by Theodore Martin, with an appendix containing some of his
                    prose essays, was published in 1867. (w. L. R. c.)</p>
