                    perpendicularly from the arches, but are sometimes seen detached, or when the
                    arch is below the horizon. They are parallel to the dipping needle, or, in other
                    words, to the curves of magnetic force; and the boreal crown, at which they
                    appear to meet, is merely an effect of perspective. This point is in England
                    about 70° in altitude, and nearly S.S.E. of the zenith. The rays are seldom
                    stationary, but appear and disappear suddenly, shooting with great velocity up
                    to the zenith, and moving slowly eastward or westward, but most .commonly the
                    latter. They sometimes cover the whole sky, and frequently have a strong
                    tremulous motion from end to end. This tremulous motion is sometimes seen also
                    in the arches when near the zenith; and Benjamin V. Marsh mentions a case in
                    which the matter of the arch had the appearance of a rapid torrent flowing from
                    east to west. A rare form of aurora is that in which the rays appear to hang
                    from the sky like fringes or the folds of a mantle. The ordinary colour of the
                    aurora is a pale greenish-yellow, but crimson, violet, and steel-colour are not
                    uncommon. Crimson auroras have often been imagined by the superstitious to be
                    omens of war, pestilence, and famine; and lively imaginations have seen in their
                    motions—</p>

                    like it, is occasionally visible in Ceylon, and that the natives call it the <hi
                        rend="italic">Buddha lights.</hi> Mr Jansen says, however, that the great
                    aurora of 4th February 1872, which was seen at Bombay, was not visible in
                    Ceylon. In many parts of Ireland a scarlet aurora is supposed to be a shower of
                    blood, and under this name is not unfrequently mentioned in the old annals,
                    always in connection with some battle or the murder of a great chief. The
                    earliest mentioned was in 688, in the <hi rend="italic">Annals of C
                        loon-mac-noise,</hi> after a battle between Leinster and Munster, in which
                    Foylcher O’Moyloyer was slain. It was observed at Edessa in 502, and in Syria in
                    1097, 1098, and 1117.</p>
                <p>The only thing resembling a distinct history of this phenomenon is that which has
                    been given by Dr Halley, in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                        Transactions,</hi> No. 347. The first account he gives, taken from a book
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">A Description of Meteors,</hi> by W. F., D.D.,
                    reprinted at London in 1654, describes the appearance of what is called by him
                        <hi rend="italic">burning spears,</hi> which were seen at London on the 30th
                    January 1560. The next appearance, according to the testimony of Stow, was on
                    the 7th October 1564. In 1574 also, according to Camden and Stow, an aurora
                    borealis was observed two nights successively, viz., on the 14th and 15th of
                    November, having much the same appearances as that described by Dr Halley in
                    1716. Again, an aurora <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0102-0091"/> was twice seen in Brabant, in the year 1575,
                    viz., on the 13th of February and 28th of September. Both appearances were
                    described by Cornelius Gemm, professor of medicine at Louvain, who compares them
                    to spears, fortified cities, and armies fighting in the air. Michael Maestlin,
                    tutor to Kepler, states that at Backnang in λViirtemberg these phenomena, which
                    he styles <hi rend="italic">chasmata,</hi> were seen by himself no less than
                    seven times in 1580. In 1581 they again appeared in great splendour in April and
                    September, and in a less degree in some other months of the same year. In
                    September 1621, a similar phenomenon was observed all over France, and described
                    by Gassendi, who gave it the name of <hi rend="italic">aurora borealis;</hi> yet
                    neither this, nor any similar appearance posterior to 1574, is described by
                    English writers till the year 1707. From 1621 to 1707, indeed, there is no
                    mention made of an aurora borealis having been seen at all; and, considering the
                    number of astronomers who during that period were continually scanning the
                    heavens, it might almost be supposed that nothing oi the kind really made its
                    appearance until after an interval of eighty-six years. A small one was seen in
                    November 1707; and during that and the following year the same appearances were
                    repeated five times. The next on record is that mentioned by Dr Halley in March
                    1716, which from its brilliancy attracted universal attention, and was
                    considered by the common people as marking the introduction of a foreign race of
                    princes. Since that time these meteors have been much more frequent, and most
                    of-our readers must have seen the brilliant displays within the last few years
                    which have been visible over the whole of Europe.</p>
                <p>One singular phenomenon which seems to be connected with the aurora is that of a
                    dark bank of cloud below the arches, and usually just above the northern
                    horizon. Although this appears decidedly darker than the uncovered portion of
                    the sky, it is of so thin a character that stars can be seen through it, as well
                    as through the auroral arches and rays, with but little diminution of
                    brightness. It is, however, quite possible that this cloud is only the somewhat
                    misty open sky near the horizon, which appears darker by contrast with the
                    bright arch above it.</p>
                <p>It has been repeatedly affirmed that cracking, hissing, or whizzing sounds have
                    been heard proceeding from the polar lights, and the natives of high latitudes
                    are almost unanimous in alleging that this is sometimes the case. Scoresby,
                    Richardson, Franklin, Parry, Hood, and later observers seem to have listened in
                    vain for such noises, and it seems that in the intense cold of the Arctic night
                    the contraction of the ice, or its cleavage under the pressure of approaching
                    tempests, produces sounds exactly such as are described. Still, mere negative
                    evidence must be received with caution, and it is very possible that in high
                    latitudes such sounds may occasionally be heard, since the electric discharge
                    seems to originate near the poles. The aurora, too, seems to vary greatly in
                    height, and in lower latitudes is usually at such an altitude that audible
                    sounds from it are quite impossible. Musschenbroeck says that the Greenland
                    fishers in his time assured him that they had frequently heard noises proceeding
                    from the aurora borealis, and his testimony is confirmed by that of many others.
                    There is no <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> improbability of such sounds being
                    occasionally heard, since a somewhat similar phenomenon accompanies the brush
                    discharge of the electric machine, to which the aurora bears considerable
                    resemblance.</p>
                <p>Numerous observers <hi rend="italic">{Nature,</hi> iv. 27, 47) have attested the
                    occasional visibility of aurora by daylight. In the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy,</hi> 1788, Dr Ξ. Ussher notices
                    that aurora makes the stars “flutter” very much in the telescope, and states
                    that, having noticed this affect strongly one day at 11 A.M., he examined the
                    sky, and saw an auroral corona with rays to the horizon. J. Glaisher, Franklin,
                    and others, have also observed the phenomenon. It is scarcely possible that a
                    light so faint as not even to obscure the stars should be visible in sunlight,
                    and euch facts would seem to suggest that the auroral light is developed in
                    cloud or mist of some sort, which may become visible by reflected light, as well
                    as by its own. Franklin says, “Upon one occasion the aurora was seen immediately
                    after sunset, while bright daylight was still remaining. A circumstance to which
                    I attach some importance must not be omitted. Clouds have sometimes been
                    observed during the day to assume the forms of aurora, and I am inclined to
                    connect with these clouds the deviation of the needle, which was occasionally
                    remarked at such times.” The writer has seen aurora which could not be
                    distinguished from clouds, till the further development of the display made
                    their real nature evident. Dr Richardson thinks he has observed a polarity in
                    the masses of cloud belonging to a certain kind of cirro-stratus approaching to
                    cirrus, by which their long diameters, having all the same direction, were made
                    to cross the magnetic meridian nearly at right angles. But the apparent
                    convergence of such masses of cloud towards the opposite points of the horizon,
                    which have been so frequently noticed by meteorologists, is an optical
                    deception, produced when they are situated in a plane parallel to that on which
                    the observer stands. These circumstances, says Dr Richardson, are here noticed,
                    because if it shall hereafter be proved that the aurora depends upon the
                    existence of certain clouds, its apparent polarity may, perhaps, with more
                    propriety, be ascribed to the clouds themselves which emit the light; <hi
                        rend="italic">or,</hi> in other words, the clouds may assume their peculiar
                    arrangement through the operation of one cause (magnetism, for example), while
                    the emission of light may be produced by another, namely, a change in their
                    internal constitution, perhaps connected with a motion of the electrical fluid.
                    D. Low <hi rend="italic">{Nat.,</hi> iv. 121) states that he has witnessed as
                    complete a display of auroral motions in the cirrus cloud as he ever beheld in a
                    midnight sky. He thinks that all clouds are subject to magnetic or diamagnetic
                    polarisation, and states that when the lines converge towards the magnetic pole,
                    fine weather follows; when they are at right angles to this position, wet and
                    stormy. The aurora appears in these latitudes usually to occur at a height much
                    greater than that of ordinary clouds. Dr Richardson’s observations (Franklin and
                    Richardson’s <hi rend="italic">Journey to the Shores of the Polar Sea)</hi> seem
                    to show, however, that, in the Arctic regions, the aurora is occasionally seated
                    in a region of the atmosphere below a kind of cloud which is known to possess no
                    great altitude, namely, that modification of cirro-stratus which, descending low
                    in the atmosphere, produces a hazy sheet of cloud over head, or a fogbank in the
                    horizon. Indeed, Dr Richardson is inclined to infer that the aurora borealis is
                    constantly accompanied by, or immediately precedes, the formation of one or
                    other of the forms of cirro-stratus. On the 13th of November and 18th December
                    1826, at Fort Enterprise, its connection with a cloud intermediate between
                    cirrus and cirro-stratus is mentioned; but the most vivid coruscations of the
                    aurora were observed when there were only a few thin attenuated shoots of
                    cirro-stratus floating in the air, or when that cloud was so rare that its
                    existence was only known by the production of a halo round the moon. The natives
                    of the Arctic regions of North America pretend to foretell wind by the rapidity
                    of the motions of the aurora; and they say that when it spreads over the sky in
                    a uniform sheet of light, it is followed by fine weather, and that the changes
                    thus indicated are more or less speedy, according as the appearance of the
                    meteor is early or late in the evening,—an opinion not improbable, when it is
                    recollected <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0103-0092"/> that certain kinds of cirro-stratus are also
                    regarded by meteorologists as sure indications of rain and wind. Dr Richardson
                    frequently observed the lower surface of nebulous masses illuminated by polar
                    lights,—a fact illustrative of the comparatively low situation of these aurorae.
                    Biot, also, in the island of Unst, observed many aurorae that could not be
                    higher than the region of clouds. Sir John Franklin in like manner observed low
                    aurorae. “The important fact,” says he, “of the existence of the aurora at a
                    less elevation than that of dense clouds was evinced on two or three occasions
                    this night (13th February 1821, at Fort Enterprise), and particularly at 11
                    hours 50 min., when a brilliant mass of light, variegated with the prismatic
                    colours, passed between a uniform steady dense cloud and the earth, and in its
                    progress completely concealed that portion of the cloud which the stream of
                    light covered, until the coruscation had passed over it, when the cloud appeared
                    as before.” Captain Parry, as stated in his third voyage, observed aurorae near
                    to the earth’s surface. It is said that while Lieutenants Scherer and Ross and
                    Captain Parry were admiring the extreme beauty of a polar light, they all
                    simultaneously uttered an exclamation of surprise at seeing a bright ray of the
                    aurora shoot suddenly downward from the general mass of light, and between them
                    and the land, which was only 3000 yards distant. The ray or beam of the polar
                    light thus passed within a distance of 3000 yards, or less than 2 miles, of
                    them. Further, Mr Farquharson observed in Aberdeenshire an aurora borealis not
                    more than 4000 feet above the level of the sea. Fitzroy believed that aurora in
                    northern latitudes indicates and accompanies stormy weather at a distance, and
                    that straining and cracking of the ice may cause the hissing and whizzing
                    sounds.</p>
                <p>Μ. Silbermann <hi rend="italic">{Comptes Rendus,</hi> lxviii. p. 1051) notes
                    facts which strongly confirm the connection of aurora with some form of cirrus
                    cloud He says (of the aurora of 15th April 1869),—“At 11 hours 16 min. the
                    phenomenon disappeared in a singular fashion. It appeared as if the columns of
                    the aurora were still visible, but the stars were hidden, and it soon became
                    obvious that fan-like cirrus clouds, with their point of divergence in the
                    north, had taken the place of the aurora. Between 1 and 2 in the morning these
                    clouds had passed the zenith, and let fall a very fine rain. On stretching out
                    the back of the hand one felt a pricking of cold, and now and then there were
                    minute scintillations in the nearest strata of air, like a hail of tiny crystals
                    of ice, which afterwards turned to a rain of larger and larger drops. At 4
                    o’clock in the morning the cirru3 of the false aurora was still visible, but
                    deformed towards the top, and presenting a flaky aspect. One interesting point
                    is, that the cirrus never appeared to replace the aurora either from the right
                    or the left, but to substitute itself for it, like the slow changes of a
                    dioramic view.” “I had previously observed a fall of small ice crystals on the
                    30th April 1865. At 6 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> Paris seemed enveloped in a
                    cirrus of vertical fibres, recalling those of amianthus, and more or less wavy.
                    It was a rain of little sparkling prisms. At the same time I heard a rustling or
                    crepitation, and on extending my hand I felt a pricking sensation of cold, and
                    distinguished the crystals which fell and melted immediately.”</p>
                <p>In a later memoir <hi rend="italic">{Ibid.,</hi> p. 1120) he remarks that many
                    storm-clouds throw out tufts of cirri from their tops, which extend over a great
                    portion of the sky, and resolve themselves into a very fine and cold drizzle,
                    which frequently degenerates into a warmer and more abundant rain. Usually the
                    fibres are more or less sinuous, but in much rarer case3 they become perfectly
                    rectilinear, and surround the cloud like a glory, and occasionally shine with a
                    sort of phosphorescence. As an illustration he quotes his observations on the
                    night of the 6th September 1865:—“A stormy cloud was observed about 11 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> in the N.N.W., and lightning was distinctly
                    visible in the dark cumulous mass. Around this mass extended <hi rend="italic"
                        >glories</hi> of a phosphorescent whiteness, which melted away into the
                    darkness of the starry sky. Round the cloud was a single and uninterrupted
                    corona, and outside this, two fainter coronae broken by rifts which corresponded
                    with each other. After the cloud had sunk below the horizon the <hi

                    light could not have been due to the moon or any foreign cause. The rays showed
                    great mobility, and a sort of vibration intermediate between that of the aurora
                    and the <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> brush discharge ’ of the electric
                    machine.” He goes on to say that—</p>
                <quote> “Luminous clouds have been frequently observed. There are many examples in
                    Gilbert’s <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> and we may recall also the observations
                    of Becaria, Deluc, the Abbé Rozier, Nicholson, and Colla, Mists also are
                    occasionally luminous, as, for instance, that observed by Dr Verdeil at Lausanne
                    in 1753, and by Dr Robinson in Ireland.” </quote>
                <p>A still more curious fact is mentioned by Sabine, who, during his magnetic
                    survey, anchored some days at Loch Scavaig in Skye. This loch is surrounded by
                    high and bare mountains, one of which was nearly always enveloped in a cloud,
                    resulting from the vapours which almost constant west winds brought from the
                    Atlantic. This cloud at nights was permanently self-luminous, and Sabine
                    frequently saw rays similar to those of the aurora. He entirely repudiates the
                    idea that the rays could be due to aurorae beyond the mountain, and is sure that
                    these phenomena, whatever their nature, were produced in the cloud itself.</p>
                <p>Silbermann asserts that aurorae are preceded by the same general phenomena as
                    thunderstorms, and concludes that everything had happened as if the aurorae of
                    1859 and 1869 had been storm-clouds, which, instead of bursting in thunder, had
                    been drawn into the upper parts of the atmosphere, and their vapour being
                    crystallised in tiny prisms by the intense cold, the electricity had become
                    luminous in flowing over these icy particles. This view is very strongly
                    supported by the observation of Professor Piazzi Smyth that the monthly
                    frequency of aurora varies inversely with that of thunderstorms. The following
                    are his numbers of relative frequency, the means of all observations of the
                    Scottish Meteorological Society prior to 1871 :—·</p>

                <p>It must, however, be remembered that the observed frequency of aurorae is much
                    affected in Scotland by the continuous twilight during the summer months. If
                    there be this connection between thunder-clouds and aurorae, it is not
                    improbable that the “dark segment” is sometimes a real cloud or mist, situated
                    at a height where the density of the air is too great for luminous discharge;
                    and in several cases Silbermann has seen auroral rays rise from small clouds,
                    which gradually melted entirely away, or left a small non-luminous nucleus when
                    their electricity was discharged.</p>
                <p>If, as would certainly be the case in a mist, any portion <pb break="no"

                    be its own or derived from some other body, it should be polarised; but so far
                    polariscope observations are deficient, and give no certain information. It is
                    difficult to separate the proper polarisation of the aurora from the mere
                    atmospheric polarisation of the sky. Mr Ranyard, who appears to have used a
                    double-imaged prism and Savart during the great aurora of Feb. 4, 1872, and also
                    to have made some observations on that of Nov. 11, 1871, did not detect
                    polarisation. On the other hand, Prof. Stephen Alexander, in his report on his
                    expedition to Labrador (App. 21, <hi rend="italic">U.</hi><hi rend="italic">S.
                        Coast Survey Rep.,</hi> 1860), found strong polarisation with a Savart, and,
                    singularly enough, thought it strongest in the dark parts of the aurora. The
                    observations were made in lat. about 60 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, in the
                    beginning of July, and near midnight, but he does not state whether there was
                    twilight or any trace of air polarisation at the time, nor does he give the
                    plane of polarisation.</p>
                <p>With regard to the height of aurorae, Sir W. R. Grove <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Nature,</hi> vol. iii. p. 28) states that he saw an aurora some years ago
                    at Chester in which the rays came between him and the houses; and Mr Ladd
                    observed a similar case in which the lighthouse at Margate was visible through a
                    ray. The evidence, however, appears strong that aurora is usually at a very
                    great height. Dalton calculated the height of an auroral arch, which was seen as
                    far north as Edinburgh, and as far south as Doncaster, and at most intermediate
                    places, from its apparent altitude, as measured by its position in relation to
                    the stars as seen from Kendal and Warrington, 83 miles apart. The resulting
                    height was about 100 miles, and the position slightly south of Kendal. An
                    observation at Jedburgh confirmed this, but some taken at Edinburgh placed it
                    above Carlisle at a height of 150 miles. Dalton, however, considered the former
                    reckoning the more trustworthy. Backhouse has made many calculations, and
                    considers that the average height of aurorae ranges from 50 to 100 miles, and
                    numerous other observers have calculated similar heights. All these
                    observations, however, are liable to the objection, that different observers may
                    really have seen different arches, of which, as has been remarked, there are
                    often several concentric ones. It is not likely that this was really the case in
                    most instances, but it has, no doubt, sometimes occurred, and may account for
                    the heights of 500 to 1000 miles calculated by early observers. This difficulty
                    is met by a method proposed by Prof. H. A. Newton <hi rend="italic">{Sill.
                        Jour,</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi><hi rend="italic">Sc.,</hi> 2d ser. vol.
                    xxxix. p. 286) for calculating the height by one observation of altitude and
                    amplitude of an arch. It seems almost certain that the auroral arches are arcs
                    of circles, of which the centre is the magnetic axis of the earth; or, at least,
                    that they are nearly parallel to the earth’s surface, and probably also to the
                    narrow belt or ring surrounding the magnetic and astronomical poles, and passing
                    through Faroe, the North Cape, and the north of Nova Zembla, which Loomis and
                    Fritz have found to be the region of most frequent aurora. This being assumed,
                    Prof. Newton finds that, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> being the distance from the
                    observer to the centre of curvature of the nearest part of this belt (which for

                <p>He gives the heights of twenty-eight aurorae calculated by this method, ranging
                    from 33 to 281 miles, with a mean of 130 miles. The method, of course, rests on
                    the assumption that auroral arches are arcs of circles, but it is decidedly
                    confirmatory both of this assumption and of the heights calculated by other
                    methods. It cannot well be objected, that such altitudes are beyond the limits
                    of our atmosphère, since Prof. A. S. Herschel <hi rend="italic">{Nature,</hi>
                    vol. iv. 504) gives the height of twenty meteors varying from 40 to 118 miles,
                    with an average of about 70 miles, and it is almost certain that these bodies
                    are rendered incandescent by atmospheric friction. Assuming 0° C. as the
                    temperature at the earth’s surface, and the absolute zero, —273° C., as a
                    minimum for the auroral region, the pressure would be about 0 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 millimetre (0 ’ 0078 inch) at a height of 100
                    kilometres (62 miles) above the earth’s surface. This result, of course, assumes
                    a good deal; but if correct, it implies a vacuum attainable with difficulty even
                    with the Sprengel pump. The pressure may, however, be much greater in the path
                    of the auroral beams, since, as Prof. A. S. Herschel suggests, electrical
                    repulsion may carry air or other matter up to a great height. A similar effect
                    is observed in the so-called vacuum tubes, in which the pressure becomes much
                    greater in the narrow central part, while the discharge is passing. It is found
                    that the apparent altitude of the auroral corona is always a little less than
                    that indicated by the dipping needle, owing to the curvature of the lines of
                    magnetic force, or, in other words, because its altitude corresponds with the
                    inclination of the parallel of latitude over which it is actually situated; and
                    Galle has suggested <hi rend="italic">{Pogg. Ann.,</hi> cxlvi. 133), that from
                    this divergence the height may be calculated, and, indeed, gives a series of
                    heights so determined, which do not differ materially from Prof. Newton’s. It
                    is, however, doubtful if the position of these coronae, and consequently the
                    value of the small angle (not more than 4° or 5°), admit of sufficiently
                    accurate determination for such a use.</p>
                <p>Early observers, and especially Mr Canton, conjectured that the aurora was an
                    electric discharge in the rarefied upper atmosphere, and the resemblance between
                    it and the phenomena exhibited by discharges in an air-pump vacuum confirmed the
                    idea. Recent spectroscopic observations have thrown some little doubt on this
                    conclusion, or at least have shown that there is still a mystery left
                    unexplained. When the light of any glowing gas is analysed by the prism, it is
                    found to consist of a series of coloured lines and bands, of which the number
                    and position is dependent on the nature of the gas, and which is called its
                    spectrum. The light of the aurora gives a spectrum usually consisting of a
                    single line in the greenish yellow, which does not coincide with a principal
                    line of any known substance, —a spectrum totally different from those of the
                    gases of the atmosphere. Besides this line there is occasionally visible a sharp
                    line in the red, and several fainter and more refrangible bands. The following
                    table includes most of the principal determinations of the auroral lines, which
                    have hitherto been published :—</p>

                <p>Vogel remarks that the line at 5569, which is often the only one visible, as well
                    as the faint band at 4667, become noticeably fainter when the red line is
                    visible, while under the same circumstances that near 5189, as well as the red
                    line, is very brilliant. This fact, which has also been noted by other
                    observers, makes it almost certain that the auroral spectrum is not a simple
                    one, but is derived either from two or more sources, or from the same source
                    under very varying conditions. Angström says <hi rend="italic">(Nature, x.</hi>
                    211)—</p>
                <p>* ‘ It may be assumed that the spectrum of the aurora is composed of <hi
                        rend="italic">two</hi> different spectra, which, even although appearing
                    sometimes simultaneously, have in all probability different origins. The one
                    spectrum consists of the homogeneous yellow light which is so characteristic of
                    the aurora, and which is found even in its weakest manifestation. The other
                    spectrum consists of extremely feeble bands of light, which only in the stronger
                    aurora attain such intensity as enables one to fix their position even
                    approximately. As to the yellow line in the aurora, or the one-coloured
                    spectrum, we are as little able now as when it was first observed to point out a
                    corresponding line in any known spectrum. True, Piazzi Smyth <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Comptes Rendus,</hi> lxxiv. 597) has asserted that it corresponds to one
                    of the bands in the spectrum of hydrocarbons; but a more exact observation shows
                    that the line falls into a group of shaded bands, which belong to the spectrum,
                    but almost midway between the second and third. Herr Vogel has observed that
                    this line corresponds to a band in the spectrum of rarefied air <hi
                        rend="italic">(Pogg. Ann.,</hi> cxlvi. 582). This is quite true, but in
                    Angstrom’s opinion is founded on a pure misconception. The spectrum of rarefied
                    air has in the yellow-green part seven bands of nearly equal strength, and that
                    the auroral line corresponds with the margin of one of these bands, which is not
                    even the strongest, cannot be anything else than merely accidental.”</p>
                <p>Angstrom’s own view is that this line is due to fluorescence or phosphorescence,
                    and he remarks that “since fluorescence is produced by the ultra-violet rays, an
                    electric discharge may easily be imagined, which though in itself of feeble
                    light, may be rich in ultra-violet rays, and therefore in a condition to cause a
                    sufficiently strong fluorescence. It is also known that oxygen is
                    phosphorescent, as also several of its compounds.” We arc, however, just as
                    ignorant of any body which would give such a light by phosphorescence or
                    fluorescence as by ignition, and it seems more probable that the light may be
                    due to chemical action. It is assumed by Angström that water vapour is
                    necessarily absent in the higher atmosphere on account of the cold, but when we
                    remember that its molecular weight is lighter than that of oxygen in the
                    proportion of 9 to 16, it is not unlikely that it may attain great elevations
                    under the very low tensions that prevail at such heights, and it is possible
                    also that both it and other bodies may, by electric repulsion in the auroral
                    beams, be earned up much above the level which they would attain by gravity. If,
                    then, electric discharges take place between the small sensible particles of
                    water or ice in the form of mist or βirrus, as Silbermann has shown to be
                    likely, surface decomposition would ensue, and it is highly probable that the
                    nascent gases would combine with emission of light. It has been almost proved in
                    the case of hydrogen phosphide that the very characteristic spectrum produced by
                    its combustion is due neither to the elements nor to the products of combustion,
                    but to some peculiar action at the instant of combination, and it is quite
                    possible that, under such circumstances as above described, water might also
                    give an entirely fresh spectrum.</p>
                <p>It is, perhaps, proper to mention that H. R. Procter found an apparent
                    coincidence by often repeated direct comparison with a band frequently seen both
                    in air and oxygen tubes, which he eventually succeeded in tracing with tolerable
                    certainty to some form of hydrocarbon. The comparison spectroscopes were only of
                    low dispersion, but on more accurate measurement of the carbon band it was found
                    that, though more refrangible than the first band of citron acetylene
                    (candle-flame), it was still less so than careful measurement assigns to the
                    aurora. In addition, the band was shaded towards the violet, which is not the
                    case with that of the aurora, though with feeble light it seemed like a
                    line.</p>
                <p>If, leaving the citron line, we pass on to the feeble spectrum towards the
                    violet, we shall obtain more hopeful coincidences, zingström thinks that three
                    of the bands correspond with the three brightest bands of the violet aurora of
                    the negative pole in rarefied air, and has tried to reproduce the conditions of
                    the aurora on a small scale. He says—</p>
                <p>“Into a flask, the bottom of which is covered with a layer of phosphoric
                    anhydride, the platinum wires are introduced, and the air is pumped out to a
                    tension of only a few millimetres. If the inductive current of a Ruhmkorff coil
                    be then sent through the flask, the whole flask will be filled, as it were, with
                    the violet light, which otherwise proceeds only from the negative pole, and from
                    both electrodes a spectrum is obtained consisting chiefly of shaded violet
                    bands. If this spectrum be compared with that of the aurora, Angström thinks the
                    agreement between the formerand some of the best established bands of the latter
                    is satisfactory.</p>

                <p>In the neighbourhood of the line 469'4 Herr Vogel has, moreover, observed two
                    weak light-bands, 466'3 and 462 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9 (?). The
                    spectrum of the violet has also two corresponding shaded bands, 465 ∙4 and
                    460Ί.</p>
                <p>“Should the aurora be flamy, and shoot out like rays, there is good reason for
                    assuming a disruptive discharge of electricity, and then there ought to appear
                    the strongest line in the spectrum of the air, the green, whose wave-length is
                    500'3. Precisely this has actually been observed by Vogel, and has, moreover,
                    been seen <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n106/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0106-0095"/> by Angström and. others. Finally, should the
                    aurora be observed as it appears at a less height in the atmosphere, then are
                    recognised both the hydrogen lines and also the strongest of the bands of the
                    dark-banded air-spectrum. There are found also again nearly all the lines and
                    light-bands of the weak aurora spectrum whose position has with any certainty
                    been observed.”</p>
                <p>With regard to the red line, which is sometimes perfectly sharp and well defined,
                    and occasionally, though very rarely, even as bright as the citron line,
                    scarcely even a plausible theory has been hazarded. That it is not the C line of
                    hydrogen is certain, as they have been directly compared, and are widely
                    separated; and none of the air lines near its position are at all comparable to
                    it in brightness. Vogel thinks it may “correspond with the first system of lines
                    in the spectrum of nitrogen (6620 to 6213), and that probably only the bright
                    part of this group of lines is visible on account of the extreme faintness of
                    the aurora.” This, however, cannot be the case, since the present writer has
                    seen it both bright and sharp. Vogel points out that the line near 5189 closely
                    corresponds to an oxygen line of that wave-length which is bright and constant
                    under very different conditions of pressure and temperature. He states that the
                    faint line near 5390 corresponds in like manner to a nitrogen line. He points
                    out that, though the correspondences with the iron lines are very striking, but
                    little weight can be laid on the fact, since many of the brightest lines of the
                    iron spectrum do not appear. The following table gives the principal iron lines
                    (Thalén) and the auroral ones; and it will be seen that the former are so
                    abundant that coincidences could scarcely fail :—</p>

                <p>Angstrom asserted some years since that he had detected the principal line of the
                    aurora in the spectrum of the zodiacal light, but he appears to have been misled
                    by a faint aurora, for more recent observers, and notably Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth,
                    Mr Backhouse, and A W. Wright <hi rend="italic">(Sill. Jour, of Sc.</hi>, viii.
                    39), have found that the spectrum of the zodiacal light is continuous and quite
                    analogous to that of twilight or faint starshine, and polariscope observations
                    prove that it is mostly reflected. The very faint line positioned by Alvan Clark
                    at 5320 has been said by Winlock to coincide with the principal coronal line
                    5322. The position of the auroral line is uncertain; and even if it were
                    accurate, a single doubtful coincidence with a faint line is not the least proof
                    of identity.</p>
                <p>We have already remarked the manifest relation between the forms and position of
                    aurorae and the earth’s lines of magnetic force, and in addition to this have
                    noted the disturbance of the magnetic needle during auroral displays. It is not,
                    however, at such times only that the magnetic elements are subject to variation;
                    the total force, declination, and inclination, all are constantly varying both
                    regularly with the hours of the day and the seasons of the year, and irregularly
                    at uncertain times. The irregular oscillations when violent are c2lled magnetic
                    storms, and it must be noted that auroral display never takes place except
                    during such disturbances, although a large proportion of the most remarkable
                    magnetic storms are unaccompanied by visible aurorae.</p>
                <p>Franklin, who was one of the first observers of this relation (at Fort
                    Enterprise, 64° 30' N., 113° 10' W.), says of the magnetic needle,—“The motion
                    communicated to it was neither sudden nor vibratory. Sometimes it was
                    simultaneous with the formation of arches, prolongation of beams, or certain
                    other changes of form or action of the aurora. But generally the effect of these
                    phenomena upon the needle was not visible immediately, but in about half an hour
                    or an hour the needle had attained its maximum of deviation. From this its
                    return to its former position was very gradual, seldom regaining it before the
                    following morning, and frequently not until the afternoon, unless it was
                    expedited by another arch of the aurora operating in a direction different from
                    the former one.”</p>
                <p>“The arches of the aurora,” he adds, “most commonly traverse the sky nearly at
                    right angles to the magnetic meridian, but deviations from this direction, as
                    has already been stated, were not rare; and I am inclined to consider that these
                    different positions of the aurora have considerable influence on the direction
                    of the needle. When an arch was nearly at right angles to the magnetic meridian,
                    the motion of the needle was towards the west. This westward motion was still
                    greater when one extremity of the arch bore 301°, or about 59° to the west of
                    the magnetic north, that is, when the extremity of the arch approached from the
                    west towards the magnetic north. A westerly motion also took place when the
                    extremity of an arch was in the true north, or about 36° to the west of the
                    magnetic north, but not in so great a degree as when its bearing was about 301°.
                    A contrary effect was produced when the same end of an arch originated to the
                    southward of the magnetic west, viz., when it bore from 245° to 234°, and of
                    course when its opposite extremity approached nearer to the magnetic north. In
                    these cases the motion of the needle was towards the east. In one case only a
                    complete arch was formed in the magnetic meridian, in another the beam shot up
                    from the magnetic north to the zenith; and in both these cases the needle moved
                    towards the west.</p>
                <p>“The needle was most disturbed on February 13th, <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.,</hi>
                    at a time when the aurora was most distinctly seen passing between a stratum of
                    clouds and the earth, or at least illuminating the face of the clouds opposed to
                    the observer. This and several other appearances induced me to infer that the
                    distance of the aurora from the earth varied on different nights, and produced a
                    proportionate effect on the needle. When the light shone through a dense hazy
                    atmosphere, when there was a halo round the moon, or when a small snow was
                    falling, the disturbance was generally considerable; and on certain hazy, cloudy
                    nights the needle frequently deviated in, a considerable degree, although the
                    aurora was not visible at the time. Our observations do not enable us to decide
                    whether this ought to be attributed to an aurora concealed by a cloud or haze,
                    or entirely to the state of the atmosphere. Similar deviations have been
                    observed in the day-time, both in a clear and cloudy state of the sky, but more
                    frequently in the latter case. An aurora sometimes approached the zenith without
                    producing any change in the position of the needle, as was more generally the
                    case; whilst at other times a considerable alteration took place although the
                    beams or arches did not come near the zenith. The aurora was frequently seen
                    without producing any perceptible effect on the needle. At such times its
                    appearance was that of an arch, or an horizontal stream of dense yellowish
                    light, with little or no internal motion. The disturbance in the needle was not
                    always proportionate to the agitation of the aurora, but it was always greater
                    when the quick motion and vivid light were observed to take place in a hazy
                    atmosphere. In a few instances the motion of the needle was observed to commence
                    at the instant a beam darted upwards from the horizon; and its former position
                    was more quickly or slowly regained according to circumstances. If an arch was
                    formed immediately afterwards, having its extremities placed on opposite sides
                    of the magnetic north and south to the former one, the return of the needle was
                    more speedy, and it generally went beyond the point from whence it first
                    started.”</p>
                <p>Speaking of the aurora of May 13, 1869, Μ. Lamont of Munich says <hi
                        rend="italic">(Comptes Rendus,</hi> lxviii. 1201)—</p>
                <p>“1. During 40 years I have only seen seven or eight aurorae at Munich, and this
                    small number is insufficient for a study of the characters of the
                    phenomenon.</p>
                <p>“2. Aurorae, whether visible at Munich or not, are always accompanied by magnetic
                    perturbations.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n107/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0107-0096"/>
                <p>“3. In the perturbations of declination which I have observed for 28 years, I
                    have been unable to recognise any general law.</p>
                <p>“4. The perturbations of horizontal intensity commence in general by an increase
                    of that force, and finish always by a diminution, which lasts for two or three
                    days.</p>
                <p>“5. In all perturbations there is a <hi rend="italic">constant relation</hi>
                    between changes of inclination and the simultaneous changes of horizontal
                    intensity, such that an augmentation of intensity of py⅜τπr corresponds to a
                    diminution of inclination of 8° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 28 (for
                    Munich).</p>
                <p>“6. In telegraphic wires we cannot observe the existence of a constant
                    terrestrial current, since the conductivity of the soil is infinitely greater
                    than that of the telegraphic wire, and it is only <hi rend="italic">sudden
                        changes</hi> that manifest themselves. In consequence, during magnetic
                    perturbations in the galvanometer of a telegraphic wire, we only see irregular
                    deflections to right or left, succeeding each other at intervals of a few
                    minutes.</p>
                <p>“In 1850 and 1851 we made electrical observations from hour to hour, from 7 A.Μ.
                    to 6 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.,</hi> without being able to see any connection
                    between the atmospheric electricity and the magnetic perturbations. Later I
                    abandoned these observations, because the indications of the electrometers
                    depended too much on local and accidental circumstances.”</p>
                <p>It should be noted here that the horizontal component of magnetic force varies
                    with the inclination as well as with the intensity of the total force, and the
                    ratio noted above is almost exactly that which would be produced by a change in
                    the inclination alone; and it would appear as if the actual horizontal force,
                    independent of the inclination, was subject to comparatively little variation.
                    This is not improbable, since variations in the horizontal force could
                    correspond only to electro-magnetic easterly or westerly currents, while changes
                    in declination, inclination, and vertical force <hi rend="italic">might</hi>
                    correspond to currents from the magnetic north and south, which there is reason
                    to believe are most frequent in auroral displays.</p>
                <p>To give some idea of the extent of magnetic perturbations. we may mention that
                    during the aurora of 13th May 1869, the declination at Greenwich varied l <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 0</hi> 25', while the vertical force experienced four
                    successive maxima, and the greatest oscillation amounted to 0 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 04 of its total mean value. The horizontal force
                    at the same time only varied 0 014 of its mean value. During the aurora of the
                    15th April of the same year the declination at Stonyhurst varied 2° 23' 14" in
                    nine minutes.</p>
                <p>The electric currents produced at such times in telegraph wires, though
                    transient, are often very powerful. Loomis <hi rend="italic">(Sill. Jour.,</hi>
                    vol. xxxii.) mentions cases where wires had been ignited, brilliant flashes
                    produced, and combustible materials kindled by their discharge. It often happens
                    that the ordinary signals are completely interrupted during their
                    continuance.</p>
                <p>In addition to the resemblance between the auroral phenomena and those of
                    electric discharges in rarefied gases which we have already mentioned, we have
                    seen that auroral displays are accompanied by marked disturbances both in the
                    direction and force of terrestrial magnetism. This fact is in itself almost
                    proof of their electrical character, and, taken in conjunction with the strong
                    “earth-currents” which are at such times produced in lines of telegraph, and
                    with the manifest polarisation of the arches and rays with regard to the
                    magnetic meridian, may be considered as conclusive that the aurora is some sort
                    of electric discharge. There are still some points with regard to the origin of
                    this electricity which are unexplained, and it is uncertain whether the magnetic
                    disturbance causes the electrical phenomena, or <hi rend="italic">vice
                        versa.</hi> It has been shown by Prof. Pliicker that when an electric
                    discharge takes place through rarefied gas in the field of a magnet, it is
                    concentrated in the magnetic curves, which are the only paths in which it can
                    move without being disturbed by the magnet. This is well shown in De la Hive’s
                    well-known experiment, in which an electro-magnet is enclosed in an electric
                    egg. As soon as the magnet is set in action, the discharge, which had before
                    filled the egg, is concentrated into a defined band of light, which rotates
                    steadily round the magnet,—the direction of its rotation being changed by
                    reversal either of the current or of the polarity of the magnet. If we suppose
                    that the aurora is an electric discharge passing from one magnetic pole to the
                    other, and following the terrestrial magnetic curves, we shall find that the
                    theory agrees with observed facts even in its lesser details. In these latitudes
                    the magnetic curves are sensibly straight and parallel, and are inclined S.E. at
                    an angle of about 70° from the perpendicular, and, by the well-known laws of
                    perspective, will appear to converge towards this point, as, in fact, the
                    auroral streamers do. The streamers should move from east to west, or from west
                    to east, according as the discharge is from north to south, or <hi rend="italic"
                        >vice versa,</hi> and, in fact, they are in constant motion. Professor
                    Loomis <hi rend="italic">(Sill. Jour. of Sc.,</hi> xxxiv. 45) gives a catalogue
                    of forty-six cases of such movement, of which thirty-one were from E. to W. and
                    only fifteen in the opposite direction; and as part of these apparent motions
                    are due to a real motion from N. to S., he concludes that the actual motion of
                    the streamers is from about N.N.E. to S.S.W. This would make the north pole the
                    negative electrode, which is most likely usually the case. Prof. Loomis has
                    shown that during auroral displays electrical currents traverse the earth’s
                    surface in the same general direction, though subject to great variation in
                    intensity and even to reversal. Waves of magnetic disturbance are also
                    propagated in the same direction <hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> xxxii. 318).</p>
                <p>With regard to the arches it is evident that they are generally circles
                    concentric to the magnetic pole, and it is very probable that they are analogous
                    to the striae often seen in discharges in rarefied gases. Gassiot, quoted by B.
                    V. Marsh <hi rend="italic">(Sill. Jour.,</hi> xxxi. 316, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Roy. Soc. Proc.,</hi> vol. x. Nos. 38 and 39), describes an experiment with
                    his great Grove’s battery of 400 cells, in which the exhausted receiver was
                    placed between the poles αf the large electromagnet of the Royal Institution
                    :—“On now exciting the magnet with a battery of ten cells, effulgent strata were
                    drawn out from the positive pole, and passed along the under or upper surface of
                    the receiver according to the direction of the current. On making the circuit of
                    the magnet and breaking it immediately, the luminous strata rushed from the
                    positive, and then retreated, cloud following cloud with a deliberate motion,
                    and appearing as if swallowed up by the positive electrode.” This, as Mr Marsh
                    remarks, bears a very considerable resemblance to the conduct of the auroral
                    arches, which almost invariably drift slowly southward; and we cannot do better
                    than sum up his theory in his own words :—“The foregoing considerations seem to
                    render it probable that the aurora is essentially an electric discharge between
                    the magnetic poles of the earth leaving the immediate vicinity of the north
                    magnetic pole in the form of clouds of electrified matter, which float southward
                    through the atmosphere at a height of 40 miles or more from the earth, sometimes
                    to a distance of more than 30° from the pole; that whilst they are thus moving
                    forward, with a comparatively slow and steady motion, or sometimes even
                    remaining almost stationary for a long time, bright streams of electricity are
                    from time to time suddenly shot out from them in a nearly vertical direction,
                    that is to say, in the magnetic curves corresponding to the points from which
                    they originate; that these curves, ascending to a great height beyond the
                    atmosphere, then bending more and more southward and downward until they finally
                    reach corresponding points in the southern magnetic hemisphere, are the pathways
                    by which the electric currents pass to their destination; and that for several
                    hundred miles from the earth these curves are thus ‘ traced through space and
                    illuminated with bright electric light;’ and further, that the magnetism of the
                    earth also causes these luminous currents and the electrified matter <pb

                    magnetic pole of the earth, giving them the motion from east to west, or from
                    west to east, which the components of the arch are observed to have.”</p>
                <p>The principal difficulties and deficiencies of this hypothesis, which was first
                    suggested by De la Rive, are that it makes no attempt to account for the origin
                    of such an electrical discharge, and that it is difficult to understand how an
                    electric current can traverse vast spaces of the almost perfect vacuum which
                    must exist at the distance from the earth (many hundreds of miles) which is
                    attained by the magnetic curves, since, in the best vacuums of our Sprengel
                    pumps, discharge will not take place even across the interval of a few
                    centimetres. It is not, however, certain that stellar space is an insulator, and
                    it is possible, moreover, that the auroral currents do not follow the magnetic
                    curves through their whole course, since electric discharge is always in the
                    path of least resistance, and this is modified not only by the magnetic forces,
                    but by atmospheric density, and it is possible that on attaining a certain
                    height the current may proceed horizontally on a stratum of least resistance. It
                    need create no surprise that the discharge is generally invisible in the
                    intermediate zone of low latitudes, since this is well accounted for not only by
                    the large surface over which it is spread at great heights, but because this
                    part of its course is at right angles to the line of sight, while in higher
                    latitudes we look at the streamers almost “end-on,” and thus have before our
                    eyes a very great depth of luminous gases. It is common enough, too, in
                    discharges in rarefied gases to see the two poles surrounded by luminous aurae,
                    while the intermediate space is almost or quite dark, or consists of luminous
                    disks or striae separated by dark spaces. It seems probable that this “glow”
                    discharge in rarefied gases is really a sort of electrical convection, which is
                    propagated comparatively slowly, and from particle to particle; and that the
                    striae are surfaces at which the difference of potential of the moving molecules
                    is so great as to cause discharge between them, while in the intermediate dark
                    spaces the electric force is carried mechanically and silently by the particles
                    movingin regular currents under the repulsive and attractive forces of
                    electrification. On this hypothesis the auroral discharge becomes
                    comprehensible, since we have only to suppose that the electricity is carried
                    mechanically, as it were, through the vacuous spaces, which, if they contain no
                    matter to conduct electricity, can contain none to impede the motion of the
                    molecules. It is, moreover, by no means certain that the bright rays indicate
                    actual currents. They may simply consist of matter rendered luminous in the
                    arches, and projected by magnetic or electrical repulsion in the curves of
                    magnetic force, since Varley <hi rend="italic">{Roy. Soc. Proc.,</hi> xix. 236)
                    shows that when a glow discharge in a vacuum tube is brought within the field of
                    a powerful magnet, the magnetic curves are illuminated beyond the electrodes
                    between which the discharge is taking place as •well as within the path of the
                    current; and also that this illumination is caused by moving particles of
                    matter, since it deflected a balanced pιate of talc on which it was caused to
                    impinge. It has also been shown that in electrical discharges in air at ordinary
                    pressures, while the spark itself was unaffected by the magnet, it was
                    surrounded by a luminous cloud or aura, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> which was
                    drawn into the magnetic curves, and which might also be separated from the spark
                    by blowing upon 'it. It is evident, therefore, that any mechanical force may
                    separate the luminous particles from the electric discharge which produces
                    them.</p>
                <p>With regard to the geographical distribution of aurora, Prof. Loomis <hi
                        rend="italic">{Sill. Jour.,</hi> xxxi.) has laid down a series of zones of
                    equal auroral frequency, and in Petermann’s <hi rend="italic">Mittheilungen</hi>
                    for October 1874, Prof. Fritz has given a chart embodying the results of his
                    extensive researches on the same subject. He finds, like Prof. Loomis, that the
                    frequency of auroral display does not continue to increase to the pole, but
                    reaches a maximum in a zone which, for the northern hemisphere, passes through
                    the Faroe Islands, reaches its most southern point, about 57°, nearly south of
                    Greenland, passes over Nain on the Labrador coast, then tends northwards, across
                    Hudson’s Bay (60° N. lat.), and through great Bear Lake, and leaves the American
                    continent slightly south of Point Barrow. It then skirts the northern coast of
                    Asia, reaching its most northerly point, about 76° N., near Cape Taimyr, passing
                    through the north of Nova Zembla, and skirting the N.W. coast of Norway. Not
                    only are auroral displays less frequent in Iceland and Greenland than further
                    south, but it is found that while south of this zone aurorae appear usually to
                    the north of the observer, north of it they are generally to the south, and
                    within it, north or south indifferently. South of this lie other zones
                    approximately parallel to it, and of constantly diminishing frequency. That in
                    which the average yearly number of aurorae is 100 passes through the Drontheim,
                    the Orkneys, and the Hebrides, and reaches the American coast just north of
                    Newfoundland. South of this the frequency diminishes rather rapidly. At
                    Edinburgh the annual average is 30, at York 10, in Normandy 5; while at
                    Gibraltar the average is about 1 in ten years.</p>
                <p>These curves, which Prof. Fritz calls <hi rend="italic">isochasmen,</hi> are
                    nearly normal to the magnetic meridians, and bear a close relation to the curves
                    of equal magnetic inclination, especially with those laid down by Hansteen in
                    1730, while they noticeably diverge in some places from those of Sabine of 1840.
                    They also approximate to the isobaric curves of Schouw, and Prof. Fritz remarks
                    that the curves of greater frequency tend towards the region of lowest
                    atmospheric pressure. It is not unlikely that there may be such a connection,
                    since Prof. Airy has showed a relation between barometric and magnetic
                    disturbances.</p>
                <p>It will be noticed that, eastward from England, the isochasmic curves tend
                    rapidly northward, Archangel being only on the same auroral parallel as
                    Newcastle. Prof. Fritz points out that they bear some relation to the limit of
                    perpetual ice, tending most southward where, aβ in North America, the ice limit
                    comes furthest south. He also endeavours to establish some connection between
                    the periods of maximum of aurorae and those of the formation of ice, and
                    considers ice as one of the most important local causes which influence their
                    distribution. He quotes a curious fact mentioned by several Arctic voyagers,
                    that aurora was most frequently seen when open w ater was in sight, and usually
                    rather in the direction of the water than of the. magnetic north. In this
                    connection it may be well to remind our readers that the water of the Arctic
                    regions is alw ays warmer than the ice fields, and must cause upward currents of
                    damp air. For the southern hemisphere there are not yet sufficient observations
                    to make any determination of geographical distribution. ≠</p>
                <p>With regard to distribution in time Loomis and Fritz· and Wolf have shown that
                    there are periodical maxima about every ten or eleven years, and that these
                    maxima coincide both with those of sun spots, and of magnetic disturbance. The
                    following are Fritz and Wolf’s dates of maxima :—</p>

                <p>The annexed chart from Prof. Loomis’s paper <hi rend="italic">{Sill. Jour.,</hi>
                    April 1873) shows, in a very striking manner, the correspondence of aurorae,
                    magnetic variation, and sunspot area since 14 76. It is not improbable that
                    there maj also be changes of longer period which our observation; are yet
                    insufficient to determine.</p>
                <p>It has frequently been stated that the aurora returned periodically on certain
                    days in the same manner as meteors. On the 3d of February brilliant aurorae
                    occurred in 1750 and 1869, and on the 4th in 1869, 1870, 1871, 1872, 1873, and
                    1874; on the 13th February in 1575, 1821, 1822, 1865, and 1867; on the 6th March
                    in 1716, 1777, 1843, 1867, and 1868; on the 9th September in 1776, 1827, 1835,
                    1866, 1868, 1872, and on the 29th in 1828, 1840, 1851, 1852, 1870, and 1872.
                    This conclusion, however, is not supported by systematic investigation. A
                    considerable catalogue of aurorae was divided into decennial periods, and it was
                    found that the maxima of one period rarely coincided with those of others, and
                    that the larger the number of years taken into account the less prominent the
                    maxima appeared,—evident proof that they were only accidental. It may be,
                    however, that if only prominent aurorae had been considered, more periodicity
                    might have been found, or that the periodicity is constant for very short
                    periods only.</p>
                <p>Although no daily periodicity can be affirmed, there are two well-marked annual
                    maxima in March and October, of which the latter is the greater, and two
                    minima—the greater in June and the less in January. In this respect the aurora
                    differs from the sporadic meteors, which have a maximum in autumn and a minimum
                    in spring. It also differs from meteors in the hours of its appearance, the
                    former being most frequent before and the latter after midnight.</p>
                <p>Although the electric hypothesis is the one generally accepted by scientific men,
                    it is only fair to allude to one that has been recently proposed independently
                    by Dr Zehfuss <hi rend="italic">{Physikalische Theorie,</hi> Adelman, Frankfort)
                    and by H. J. H. Groneman of Gröningen <hi rend="italic">{Astronomische
                        Nachrichten,</hi> No. 2010-2012). According to this view, the light of the
                    aurora is caused by clouds of ferruginous meteoric dust, which is ignited by
                    friction with the atmosphere. Groneman has shown that these might be arranged
                    along the magnetic curves by action of the earth’s magnetic force during their
                    descent, and that their influence might produce the observed magnetic
                    disturbances. The arches may be accounted for by the effects of perspective on
                    columns suddenly terminated at a uniform height by increase of atmospheric
                    density, while the correspondences with iron lines in its spectrum are
                    sufficiently close to favour the idea. Ferruginous particles have been found in
                    the dust of the Polar regions (E. A. Nordenskiold, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ast.</hi><hi rend="italic">Nach.,</hi> 1874, § 154), but whether they are
                    derived from stellar space or from volcanic eruption is uncertain. The yearly
                    and eleven-yearly periodicity of aurorae tends to support the theory, but it is
                    a formidable difficulty that, w hile shooting stars are more frequent in the
                    morning, or on the face of the earth which is directed forwards in its orbit,
                    the reverse is the case with aurorae. Groneman meets this difficulty by
                    supposing that in the first case the velocity may be too great to allow of
                    arrangement by the earth’s magnetic force, and that, consequently, only diffused
                    light can be produced. He accounts for its unfrequency in equatorial regions by
                    the weakness of the earth’s magnetic force, and the fact that, when it does
                    occur, the columns must be parallel to the earth’s surface. Without pronouncing
                    in favour of this hypothesis, it must be admitted that it furnishes a plausible
                    explanation of the phenomenon, although we have no evidence that meteoric dust,
                    even if it exists, would produce the observed spectrum, and, as has been already
                    remarked, the iron coincidences are of little weight.</p>
                <p>Although we must confess that the causes of the aurora are very imperfectly
                    explained, we may hope that the rapid progress which the last few years have
                    witnessed in bringing terrestrial magnetism under the domain of cosmical laws
                    may soon be extended to the aurora, and that we shall see in it fresh evidence
                    that the same forces which cause hurricanes in the solar atmosphere thrill
                    sympathetically to the furthest planets of our system in waves, not only of
                    light and heat, but of magnetism and electricity.</p>
