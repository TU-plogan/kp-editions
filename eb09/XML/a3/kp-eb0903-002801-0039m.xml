                <p><label type="entry">ATMOSPHERE</label> is the name applied to the invisible
                    elastic envelope which surrounds the earth, the gaseous matter of which it is
                    composed being usually distinguished by the name of air. Storms and weather
                    generally, solar and terrestrial radiation, the disintegration of rocks, animal
                    and vegetable life, twilight, and the propagation of sound, are some of the more
                    striking phenomena which are either to a large extent or altogether dependent on
                    the atmosphere. That air possesses weight may be shown by the simple experiment
                    of taking a hollow globe filled with air and weighing it; then removing the
                    contained air by means of an air-pump, and again weighing the globe, when it
                    will be found to weigh less than at first. The difference of the two results is
                    the weight of the air which has been removed. From Regnault’s experiments, 100
                    cubic inches of dry air, or air containing no aqueous vapour, under a pressure
                    of 30 English inches of mercury, and at a temperature of 60° Fahr., weigh
                    31‘03529 grains; and since 100 cubic inches of distilled water at the same
                    pressure and temperature weigh 25,252∣ grains, it follows that air is 813'67
                    times lighter than water.</p>
                <p>Air as an elastic fluid exerts pressure upon the earth or any substance on which
                    it rests, the action of a boy’s sucker and of a water-pump being familiar
                    instances showing the pressure of the atmosphere. When air is removed from a
                    water-pump, the water rises in the pump only to a certain height; for as soon as
                    the water has risen to such a height that the weight of the column of water in
                    the pump above the level of the surface of the water in the well just balances
                    the pressure exerted by the atmosphere on the surface of the well, it ceases to
                    rise. If the pressure of the atmosphere be increased, the water will rise higher
                    in the pump; but if diminished, the level of the water will sink. The height to
                    which the water rises within the pump thus varies with the pressure of the
                    atmosphere, the height being generally about 34 feet. Since a given volume of
                    mercury weighed <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> at a temperature of 62 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> Fahr, is 13 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 569 times
                    heavier than the same volume of water, it follows that a column of mercury will
                    rise in <hi rend="italic">vacuo</hi> to a height 13 ’ 569 times less than a
                    column of water, or about 30 inches. If we suppose, then, the height of the
                    mercurial column to be 30 inches, which is probably near the average height of
                    the barometer at sea-level, and its base equal to a square inch, it will contain
                    30 cubic inches of mercury; and since one cubic inch of mercury contains 3426‘7
                    grains, the weight of 30 cubic inches will be nearly 14‘7 304 lb avoirdupois.
                    Thus the pressure of the atmosphere is generally, at least in these latitudes,
                    at sea-level equal to 14'7304 lb on each square inch of the earth’s surface. Sir
                    John Herschel has calculated that the total weight of an atmosphere averaging 30
                    inches of pressure is about 11⅜ trillions of pounds; and that, making allowance
                    for the space occupied by the land above the sea, the mass of such an atmosphere
                    is about Τδϋύοοο P <hi rend="superscript"> art</hi> °f that of the earth itself.
                    This enormous pressure is exerted on the human frame in common with all objects
                    on the earth’s surface, and it is calculated that a man of the ordinary size
                    sustains a pressure of about 14 tons; but as the pressure is exerted equally in
                    all directions, and permeates the whole body, no inconvenience arises in
                    consequence of it.</p>
                <p>A pressure agreeing approximately with the average atmospheric pressure at
                    sea-level is often used as a unit of pressure. This unit is called <hi
                    rend="italic">an atmosι&gt;here,</hi> and is employed in measuring pressures in
                    steam-engines and boilers. The value of this unit which has been adopted, in the
                    metrical system, is the pressure of 760 millimètres (29‘922 Eng. inches) of the
                    mercurial column at 0° C. (32° Fahr.) at Paris, which amounts in that latitude
                    to 1Ό33 kilogrammes on the square centimètre. In the English system, <hi
                    rend="italic">an atmosj)here</hi> is the pressure due to 29'905 inches of the
                    mercurial column at 32° Fahr, at London, amounting there to nearly 14£ ft&gt;
                    weight on the square inch. The latter atmosphere is thus 0'99968 of that of the
                    metrical system.</p>
                <p>As regards the distribution of atmospheric pressure over the globe, there was
                    little beyond conjecture, drawn from theoretical considerations and for the most
                    part erroneous, till the publication in 1868 of Buchan’s memoir “On the Mean
                    Pressure of the Atmosphere and the Prevailing Winds over the Globe.” <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> By the monthly isobaric charts and copious tables
                    which accompanied the memoir, this important physical problem was first
                    approximately solved. Since then the British Admiralty has published charts
                    showing the mean pressure of the atmosphere over the ocean. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> The more important general conclusions regarding the
                    geographical distribution of atmospheric pressure are the following :—</p>
                <p>There are two regions of high pressure, the one north and the other south of the
                    equator, passing completely round the globe as broad belts of high pressure.
                    They enclose between them the low pressure of tropical regions, through the
                    centre of which runs a narrower belt of still lower pressure, towards which the
                    north and south trades blow. The southern belt of high pressure lies nearly
                    parallel to the equator, and is of nearly uniform breadth throughout; but the
                    belt north of the equator has a very irregular outline, and great differences in
                    its breadth and in its inclination to the equator,—these irregularities being
                    due to the unequal distribution of land and water in the northern hemisphere.
                    Taking abroad view of the subject, there are only three regions of low
                    pressure,—one round each pole, bounded by or contained within the belts of high
                    pressure just referred to, and the equatorial belt of low pressure. The most
                    remarkable of these, in so far as yet known, is the region of low pressure
                    surrounding the south pole, which appears to remain pretty constant <hi

                <p>during the whole year. The depression round the north pole is divided into two
                    distinct centres, at each of which there is a diminution of pressure greatly
                    lower than the average north polar depression. These two centres lie in the
                    north of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans respectively. The distribution of
                    pressure in the different months of the year differs widely from the annual
                    average, particularly in January and July, the two extreme months. In January
                    the highest pressures are over the continents of the northern hemisphere,—and
                    the larger the continental mass the greater the pressure,—and the lowest
                    pressures are over the northern portions of the Atlantic and Pacific, South
                    America and South Africa, and the Antarctic Ocean. In the centre of Asia the
                    mean pressure of the atmosphere in this month is fully 30∙400 inches, whereas in
                    the North Atlantic, round Iceland, it is only 29'340 inches, or upwards of an
                    inch lower than in Central Asia. The area of high barometer is continued
                    westwards through Central and Southern Europe, the North Atlantic between 5° and
                    45° N. lat., North Aiaerica, except the north and north-west, and the Pacific
                    for some distance on either side of 15° N. lat. It is thus an exaggerated form
                    of the high belt of annual mean pressure, spreading, however, over a much
                    greater breadth in North America, and a still greater breadth in Asia.</p>
                <p>In July, on the other hand, the mean pressure of Central Asia is only 29'468
                    inches, or nearly an inch lower than during January; or, putting this striking
                    result in other words, about a thirtieth of the pressure of the atmosphere is
                    removed from this region during the hottest months of the year as compared with
                    the winter season. The lowest pressures of the northern hemisphere are now
                    distributed over the continents, and the larger the continental mass the greater
                    is the depression. At the same time, the highest are over the ocean between 50°
                    N. and 50° S. lat., particularly over the North Atlantic and the North Pacific
                    between 25° and 40° N. lat., and in the southern hemisphere over the belt of
                    high mean annual pressure, 'which in this month reaches its maximum height.
                    Pressure is high in South Africa and in Australia, just as in the winter of the
                    northern hemisphere pressures are high over the continents.</p>
                <p>Over the ocean, if we except the higher latitudes, atmospheric pressure is more
                    regular throughout the year than over the land. In the ocean to westwards of
                    each of the continents there occurs at all seasons an area of high pressure,
                    from 0 ’ 10 inch to 0 ’ 30 inch higher than what prevails on the coast westward
                    of which it lies. The distance of these spaces of high pressure is generally
                    about 30° of longitude; and their longitudinal axes lie, roughly speaking, about
                    the zones of the tropics. The maximum is reached during the winter months, and
                    these areas of high pressure are most prominently marked west of those
                    continents which have the greatest breadth in 30° lat.; and the steepest
                    barometric gradients are on their eastern sides. It is scarcely possible to
                    over-estimate the importance of these regions of high and low mean pressures,
                    from their intimate bearing on atmospheric physics, but more particularly from
                    their vital connection with prevailing winds and the general circulation of the
                    atmosphere. This relation will be apprehended when it is considered that winds
                    are simply the flowing away of the air from regions where there is a surplus
                    (regions of high pressure) to where there is a deficiency of air (regions of low
                    pressure). Everywhere over the globe this transference takes place in strict
                    accordance with Buys-Ballot’s “Law of the Winds,” which may be thus expressed
                    :—The wind neither blows round the space of lowest pressure in circles returning
                    on themselves, nor does it blow directly toward that space; but it takes a
                    direction intermediate, approaching, however, more nearly to the direction and
                    course of circular curves than of radii to a centre. More exactly, the angle is
                    not a right angle, but from 45° to 80°. Keeping this relation between wind and
                    the distribution of pressure in mind, the isobaric lines give the proximate
                    causes of the prevailing winds over the globe, and through these the prominent
                    features of climates. As regards the ocean, the prevailing winds indicate the
                    direction of the drift-currents and other surface-currents, and thereby the
                    anomalous distribution of the temperature of the sea as seen in the Chili,
                    Guinea, and other ocean currents, and the peculiarly marked climates of the
                    coasts past which these currents flow, are explained; for observations have now
                    proved that the prevailing winds and surface-currents of all oceans are all but
                    absolutely coincident.</p>
                <p>As regards the annual march of pressure through the months of the year, curves
                    representing it for the different regions of the earth differ from each other in
                    every conceivable way. It is only when the results are set down in their proper
                    places on charts of the globe that the subject can be well understood. When thus
                    dealt with, many of the results are characterised by great beauty and
                    simplicity. Thus, of all influences which determine the barometric fluctuation
                    through the months, the most important are the temperature, and through the
                    temperature the humidity. Comparing, then, the average pressure in January with
                    that in July, which two months give the greatest possible contrasts of
                    temperature, the following is the broad result;—</p>
                <p>The January exceeds the July pressure over the whole of Asia except Kamtchatka
                    and the extreme north-east, the greatest excess being near the centre of the
                    continent; over Europe to south and east of a line drawn from the White Sea
                    south-westward to the Naze, thence southward to the mouth of the Weser, then to
                    Tours, Bordeaux, and after passing through the north of Spain, out to sea at
                    Coruna; over North America, except the north-east and north-west. On the other
                    hand, the July exceeds the January pressure generally over the whole of the
                    southern hemisphere, over the northern part of the North Atlantic and regions
                    immediately adjoining (the excess amounting in Iceland to 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 397 inch), and over the northern part of the North
                    Pacific and surrounding regions. Thus the pressure which is so largely removed
                    from the Old and New Continents of the northern hemisphere in July is
                    transferred, partly to the southern hemisphere, and partly to the northern
                    portions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.</p>
                <p>Atmospheric pressure is more uniformly distributed over the globe in April and
                    October than in any of the other months. In May and November, being the months
                    immediately following, occur the great annual rise and fall of temperature; and
                    since these rapid changes take place at very different rates, according to the
                    relative distribution of land and water in each region, a comparison of the
                    geographical distribution of May with that for the year brings out in strong
                    relief the more prominent causes which influence climate, and some of the more
                    striking results of these causes. This comparison shows a diminution of pressure
                    in May over tropical and sub-tropical regions, including nearly the whole of
                    Asia, the southern half of Europe, and the United States. An excess prevails
                    over North America to the north of the Lakes, over Arctic America, Greenland,
                    the British Isles, and to the north of a line passing through the English
                    Channel in a northeasterly direction to the Arctic Sea. The excess in the
                    southern hemisphere includes the southern half of south America and of Africa,
                    the whole of Australia, and adjacent parts of the ocean. The influence of the
                    land of the southern hemisphere, which in this month is colder than the
                    surrounding seas, brings about an excess of pressure; on the other hand, the
                    influence of land over those regions <pb break="no"

                    about a lower pressure, interesting examples of which occur in India, the
                    Malayan Archipelago, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas. In many
                    cases the lines of pressure follow more or less closely the contours of the
                    coasts. Thus the diminution is greater over Italy and Turkey than over the
                    Adriatic and Black Seas. The greatest diminution occurs in Central Asia, where
                    it exceeds 0'200 inch, and the greatest excess round Iceland, where it exceeds
                    0'200 inch. It is to the position of Great Britain, with reference to the
                    deficiency of pressure on the one hand and the excess on the other, that the
                    general prevalence of east winds at this season is due. These easterly winds
                    prevail over the whole of Northern Europe, as far south as a line drawn from
                    Madrid and passing in a north-easterly direction through Geneva, Munich, &amp;c.
                    To the south of this line the diminution of pressure is less, and over this
                    region the winds which are in excess are not easterly, but southerly. Crossing
                    the Mediterranean, and advancing on Africa, we approach another region of lower
                    pressure, towards which easterly and north-easterly winds again acquire the
                    ascendency, as at Malta, Algeria, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>This, in many cases great, variation of the pressure in the different months of
                    the year must be kept carefully in view in deducing heights of places from
                    observations made by travellers of the pressure of atmosphere, by the barometer
                    or the temperature of boiling water. In reducing the observations, it is
                    necessary to assume a sealevel pressure if the place is at a considerable
                    distance from any meteorological observatory. Previous to the publication of
                    Buchan’s <hi rend="italic">Mean Pressure of the Atmosphere,</hi> it appears that
                    a mean sea-level pressure of 29'92 or 30'00 inches was in such cases universally
                    assumed. The mean pressure at Barnaul, Siberia, being 29'536 inches in July,
                    30'293 inches in January, and 29'954 inches for the year, it follows that, by
                    the former method of calculating the heights, observations made in January to
                    ascertain the height of Lake Balkash would make the lake 350 feet too high, and
                    observations made in July would make it 330 feet too low,—the difference of the
                    two observations, each set being supposed to be made under the most favourable
                    circumstances, and with the greatest accuracy, being 680 feet. This illustration
                    will serve to account for many of the discrepancies met with in books regarding
                    the heights of mountains and plateaus.</p>
                <p>Of the periodical variations of atmospheric pressure, the most marked is the
                    daily variation, which in tropical and sub-tropical regions is one of the most
                    regular of recurring phenomena. In higher latitudes the diurnal oscillation is
                    masked by the frequent fluctuations to which the pressure is subjected. If,
                    however, hourly observations be regularly made for some time, the hourly
                    oscillation will become apparent. The results show two maxima occurring from 9
                    to 11 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> and 9 to 11 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.,</hi>
                    and two minima occurring from 3 to 6 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> and 3 to 6
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> The following are the extreme variations for
                    January, April, July, and October from the daily mean pressure at Calcutta,
                    deduced from the observations made during six years, viz., 1857-62:—</p>

                <p>These two illustrations may be regarded as typical, to a large extent, of the
                    diurnal barometric oscillations in tropical and temperate regions. At Calcutta
                    the amounts are large, and the dates of the occurrence of the maxima and minima
                    very regular from 3 to 4 and 9 to 10 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> and p.M.
                    respectively. On the other hand, the oscillations at Vienna are much smaller and
                    more variable in amount, and the dates of occurrence of the critical phases take
                    place through a wider interval, viz., from 3 to 6 and 9 to 11 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> and P.M. respectively.</p>
                <p>Though the diurnal barometric oscillations are among the best-marked of
                    meteorological phenomena, at least in tropical and sub-tropical regions, yet
                    none of these phenomena, except perhaps the electrical, could be named
                    respecting whose geographical distribution so little is really known, whether as
                    regards the amount of variation, the hour of occurrence of the critical phases,
                    or, particularly, the physical causes on which the observed differences depend.
                    This arises chiefly from the want of a sufficient number of ascertained facts;
                    and to remedy this deficiency, observations have, in the preparation of this
                    present article, been collected and calculated from upwards of 250 places in
                    different parts of the globe, and the data set down on charts. The chief results
                    of this inquiry are the following, attention being entirely confined to the
                    chief oscillation, viz., that occurring from the <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi>
                    maximum to the <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> minimum.</p>

                    regions as far as 50° N. lat.; in higher latitudes the time of occurrence varies
                    from 8 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> to noon. In July it occurs from 9 to 10
                    everywhere only as far as about 40° N. lat.; the time at Tiflis (41° 42' N.

                    N. lat. In higher latitudes the hour is very generally 5, but at some places it
                    is as early as 4 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.,</hi> and at others as late as 6 <hi

                <p>In the northern hemisphere, in summer, the afternoon minimum falls to a greater

                    southern hemisphere the same relation is observed in the summer and winter
                    months, thus showing that in the summer of both hemispheres the influence of the
                    sun tends to lower the minimum at 3 to 4 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> to a
                    greater extent than to raise the 9 to 10 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi>

                    Of the four daily oscillations, this is the most important. When the amounts at
                    different places are entered on charts of the globe, it is seen that the
                    amplitude of this fluctuation is, speaking generally, greatest in the tropics,
                    diminishing as we advance into higher latitudes; greater over the land than over
                    the sea, increasing greatly on proceeding inland; nearly always greater with a
                    dry than with a moist atmosphere; and generally, but by no means always, it is
                    greatest in the month of highest <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n42/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0042-0031"/> temperature and greatest dryness combined. The
                    regions of largest amplitude include the East India Islands, Eastern Peninsula,
                    India, Arabia, tropical Africa, and tropical South and Central America, where it
                    either closely approaches or exceeds 0T00 inch. At Silchar, in Assam, it is 0T33
                    inch. In the tropical parts of the ocean the oscillation is from 0Ό20 to 0Ό30
                    inch less than on land. The influence of the Mediterranean Sea in lessening the
                    amount over all regions bordering it is very strongly marked. The line showing
                    an oscillation of 0Ό50 inch crosses North America about lat. 44°, curves
                    southward at some distance from the east coast to lat. 23°, then north-eastward
                    along the coast of Africa, passes eastwards near the north coast of that
                    continent, thence strikes northwards, cutting the eastern part of the Black Sea,
                    and eastward across the Caspian to a point to northward of Peking, and then
                    bends southward to the Loo Choo Islands. The line of 0Ό20 inch cuts the N.W. of
                    Spain and N.W. of France, and runs northward through Great Britain as far as the
                    Tweed, thence to Christiania, then southwards to Copenhagen and to Cracow, the
                    latitude of which it follows eastward through Asia.</p>
                <p>The more marked seasonal changes are these:—In India the oscillations during the
                    dry and wet seasons, or in January and July, respectively, are—Bombay, 0Ί20 and
                    ΟΌ67 inch; Poonah, 0Ί33 and 0Ό59 inch; and Calcutta, 0Ί32 and 0'091 inch. At
                    Madras, where the rain-bringing characters of the monsoons are reversed, the
                    numbers are 0Ί14 and 0Ί15 inch, and at Roorkee, where rain falls all the year
                    round, 0Ό88 and 0Ό79. Again, at Aden, in Arabia, where the weather of July is
                    peculiarly hot and dry, the oscillation in December is 0Ί06, but in July it
                    rises to 0 ’ 137 inch. The point to be insisted on here is, that, whatever be
                    the cause or causes to which the daily barometric oscillation is due, the
                    absolute amount is largely dependent on comparatively local influences.</p>
                <p>While illustrations similar to the above may be adduced from many other parts of
                    the globe, showing the influence in the same direction of prevailing dry or wet,
                    hot or cold seasons on the amplitude of the oscillation, the North Atlantic and
                    regions adjoining present an apparent exception to the law which seems to be
                    indicated by these results. The whole of the North Atlantic, particularly north
                    of lat. 20°, and the sea-boards which bound it, to which the Mediterranean and
                    its immediate sea-board may be added, are strikingly characterised by a small
                    summer oscillation; and this diminution is most strongly marked along the
                    eastern part of the ocean. Thus, in July, at Ponta Delgada, in the Azores, the
                    oscillation is only 0'06 inch; at Angra do Heroisma, also in the Azores, 0Ό10
                    inch; at Funchal, Madeira, 0ΌΙ1 inch; at Oporto, 0Ό18; Lisbon, 0Ό30; and Lagos,
                    0Ό21; at Naples and Palermo, 0Ό08; and at Malta, 0Ό20 inch. Now, with reference
                    to this extensive region, it is to be noted that the rainfall of July is either
                    zero or very small; and yet with this dry state of the atmosphere and high
                    temperature (the annual maximum occurring at the time), this oscillation is
                    extraordinarily diminished, being exactly the reverse of what takes place during
                    the dry and wet seasons in India. The diminution on the western half of the
                    Atlantic, though not so great, is also striking, the January and July
                    oscillations being 0Ό56 and 0Ό36 inch in Barbadoes, 0Ό80 and 0Ό56 at Jamaica,
                    0Ό82 and 0Ό54 at Havanna, ΟΌ53 and 0Ό24 in the Bahamas, and ΟΌ54 and 0Ό22 in
                    Bermuda. Over the whole of the region here indicated the rainfall of July is
                    largely in excess of that of January. The apparently exceptional character of
                    this region is probably due to the circumstance, that at this time of the year
                    the sun’s rays fall perpendicularly over a more diversified surface of the
                    earth, that is, on a greater extent of land, than at any other season. At this
                    time the Mediterranean, which is completely shut in by land, and the Atlantic,
                    which is bounded by two great continents, show a much smaller oscillation than
                    prevails over the land adjoining them, and the lines of equal oscillation now
                    attain their annual maximum. On the other hand, in January, when the sun’s rays
                    fall perpendicularly over the most uniform surface, or over the maximum extent
                    of ocean, the lines are almost everywhere parallel with the parallels of
                    latitude.</p>
                <p>Again, on advancing inland from the Atlantic, the effects of comparatively local
                    influences are very striking, as the following mean July oscillations, from
                    places situated in lines running in different directions, show :— Dublin, 0Ό12;
                    Oxford, 0 022; Ostend, 0Ό09; Brussels, 0Ό19; Vienna, 0 049; Odessa, 0Ό24; and
                    Tiflis, ΟΌ77: Limerick, 0Ό10; Ξelston, 0 007; Paris, 0Ό20; Geneva, 0Ό45; Turin,
                    0 052; Rome, 0Ό36; Palermo, 0Ό08; and Malta, 0Ό20. But the most remarkable
                    illustration is the following, the places being all situated between 38° and 42°
                    N. lat.: San Francisco, 0Ό68; Fort Churchhill, 0'091; Washington, 0Ό63; Angra do
                    Heroisma, 0Ό06; Lisbon, 0Ό30; Campo Maior, 0 054; Palermo, 0'008; Tiflis, ΟΌ77;
                    and Peking, 0Ό60.</p>
                <p>It follows from what has been stated that much which has been written regarding
                    these fluctuations, and in explanation of them, does not rest on facts; and
                    nearly everything yet requires to be done in the way of collecting data towards
                    the representation and explanation Gf the daily oscillations of atmospheric
                    pressure which are, as regards two-thirds of the globe, perhaps, as already
                    stated, the most regular of recurring phenomena, and an explanation of which
                    cannot but throw much light on many of the more important and difficult problems
                    of the atmosphere. The data chiefly required are—barometric data from which the
                    amplitude of the four daily oscillations can be represented in their
                    distribution and times of occurrence for each of the months; temperature data,
                    comparable <hi rend="italic">inter se,</hi> from which the diurnal march of
                    temperature for each month can be ascertained; hygrometric data for hourly
                    values; rain data also for the hours; wind observations conducted on a
                    satisfactory and uniform plan; together with magnetic and electrical
                    observations. It is singularly unfortunate that the disposition of
                    meteorologists of recent years has been to recommend as hours of observations
                    for places which observe only twice or thrice daily, hours which do not
                    correspond with the times when tho great barometric and thermometric daily
                    phases occur; hence these phases cannot be noted except at the great
                    observatories, which are too few and far apart to give sufficient data for the
                    proper discussion of many of those questions.</p>
                <p>Since the two maxima of daily pressure occur when the temperature is about the
                    mean of the day, and the two minima when it is at its highest and lowest
                    respectively, there is thus suggested a connection between the daily barometric
                    oscillations and the daily march of temperature; and similarly a connection with
                    the daily march of the amount of vapour and humidity of the air. The view
                    entertained by many of the causes of the daily oscillations may be thus stated
                    :—The <hi rend="italic">forenoon maximum,</hi> is conceived to be due to the
                    rapidly increasing temperature, and the rapid evaporation owing to the great
                    dryness of the air at this time of the day, and to the increased elasticity of
                    the lowermost stratum of air which results therefrom, until a steady ascending
                    current has set in. As the day advances, the vapour becomes more equally
                    diffused upwards through the air, an ascending current, more or less strong and
                    steady, is set in motion, a diminution of elasticity follows, and the pressure
                    falls to the <hi rend="italic">afternoon minimum.</hi> From this point the
                    temperature declines, a system of descending currents set in, and the air of the
                    lowermost stratum <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n43/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0043-0032"/> approaches more nearly the point of saturation,
                    and from the increased elasticity, the pressure rises to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >evening maximum.</hi> As the deposition of dew proceeds, and the fall of
                    temperature and consequent downward movement of the air are arrested, the
                    elasticity is again diminished, and pressure falls to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >morning minimum.</hi> Since the view propounded some years ago, that if the
                    elastic force of vapour be subtracted from the whole pressure, what remains will
                    show only one daily maximum and minimum, has not been confirmed by observation,
                    it follows that the above explanation is quite insufficient to account for the
                    phenomena; indeed, the view can be regarded in no other light than simply as a
                    tentative hypothesis.</p>
                <p>Singularly enough, Lamont and Broun, a few years ago, were led, independently of
                    each other, to form an opinion that the daily barometric oscillations were due
                    to the magneto-electric influence of the sun. It admits of no doubt, looking at
                    the facts of the case so far as they have been disclosed, that the daily
                    barometric oscillations originate with the sun, and that more than the sums
                    influence as exerted on the diurnal march of the temperature and humidity of the
                    atmosphere is concerned in bringing them about. But from the facts adduced, it
                    is equally certain that, be the originating cause what it may, its effects are
                    enormously modified by the distribution of land and water over the globe, by the
                    wind, and by the absolute and relative humidity of the atmosphere. The smallness
                    of the amount of the summer oscillation from the forenoon maximum to the
                    afternoon minimum over the North Atlantic as far south as lat. 30°, and its
                    diminished amount, aβ far south at least as the equator, will no doubt play an
                    important part in the unravelling of this difficulty.</p>
                <p>One of the most important steps that could be taken would be an extensive series
                    of observations from such countries as India, which offers such splendid
                    contrasts of climate at all seasons, has a surface covered at one place with the
                    richest vegetation, and at others with vast stretches of sandy deserts, and
                    presents extensive plateaus and sharp ascending peaks—all which conditions are
                    indispensable in collecting the data required for the solution of this vital
                    problem of atmospheric physics.</p>
                <p>The ancients thought that air was one of the four elements from which all things
                    originated, and this doctrine continued to prevail till 1774, when Priestley
                    discovered oxygen gas, and showed it to be a constituent part of air. Nitrogen,
                    the other constituent of air, first called <hi rend="italic">azote,</hi> was
                    discovered soon after, and the marked differences between these two gases could
                    not fail to strike the most careless observer. It is remarkable that Scheele
                    independently discovered both oxygen and nitrogen, and was the first to
                    enunciate the opinion that air consists essentially of a mixture of these two
                    gases. From experiments made by him to ascertain their relative volumes he
                    concluded that the proportions are 27 volumes of oxygen and 73 volumes of
                    nitrogen. It was left to Cavendish to show from 500 analyses that the relative
                    proportions were practically constant, and that the proportion is 20'833 per
                    cent, of oxygen. The results obtained by Cavendish, though not attended to for
                    many years after they were published, have been shown by recent and more refined
                    analyses to be wonderfully exact. The most recent analyses of specimens of air
                    collected under circumstances which ensure that it is of average purity, give as
                    a mean result the following :—</p>
                <p>Volume.</p>
                <p>Oxygen 20'96 per cent.</p>
                <p>Nitrogen 79Ό0 „</p>
                <p>Carbonic acid 0Ό4 „</p>
                <p>100'00</p>
                <p>The circumstances under which these proportions vary, and the other gases and
                    substances which are found in the air, will be afterwards adverted to.</p>
                <p>Besides these three constituents of air, there is a fourth, viz., the vapour of
                    water, from which no air, even at the lowest temperatures yet observed, is
                    wholly free, so that absolutely dry air does not exist in the free atmosphere.
                    The dry air of the atmosphere—oxygen (inclusive of ozone), nitrogen, and
                    carbonic acid—is always a gas, and its quantity is constant from year to year;
                    but the vapour of water does not always remain in the gaseous state, and the
                    quantity present in the atmosphere is, by the processes of evaporation and
                    condensation, varying every instant. Water evaporates at all temperatures, even
                    the lowest, and rises into the air in the form of an invisible elastic gas
                    called aqueous vapour. The elasticity of vapour varies with the temperature. At
                    0° Fahr, it is capable of sustaining a pressure equal to 0Ό44 inch of the
                    mercurial barometer, as calculated from Regnault’s experiments; at 32°
                    (freezing), 0Ί81 inch; at 60°, 0'518 inch; at 80°, 1Ό23 inch; and at 100°, 1'918
                    inch, being nearly <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛ the average pressure of the
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>In investigating the hygrometry of the atmosphere, the chief points to be
                    ascertained are—(1), the temperature of the air; (2), the dew-point; (3), the
                    elastic force of vapour, or the amount of barometric pressure due to the vapour
                    present; (4), the quantity of vapour in, say, a cubic foot of air; (5), the
                    additional vapour required to saturate a cubic foot of air; (6), the relative
                    humidity; and (7), the weight of a cubic foot of air at the pressure at the time
                    of observation. The vapour of the atmosphere is observed by means of the
                    hygrometer (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hygrometer),</hi> of which it is only
                    necessary here to refer to <hi rend="italic">Regnault’s</hi> as the most exact,
                    and <hi rend="italic">August's</hi> as the most convenient, and, consequently,
                    the one in most general use. August’s hygrometer consists of a dry and a wet
                    bulb, with which are observed the temperature of the air and the temperature of
                    evaporation. Of these two observed data, the formula of reduction, as deduced
                    from Apjohn’s investigations, is as follows :—Let F be the elastic force of

                    found. In calculating relative humidity, saturation is usually assumed to be
                    100, perfectly dry air 0. The humidity is found by dividing the elastic force at
                    the dew-point by the elastic force at the temperature of the air, and
                    multiplying the quotient by 100.</p>
                <p>The elastic force may be regarded as representing approximately the absolute
                    quantity of vapour suspended in the air. It may be termed the absolute humidity
                    of the atmosphere. Since the chief disturbing influences at work in the
                    atmosphere are the forces called into play by its aqueous vapour, a knowledge of
                    the geographical distribution of this constituent through the months of the year
                    is of the utmost possible importance. Hence every effort ought to be made to
                    place the observation of the hygrometry of the air, and the reduction of the
                    observed data, on a sounder basis than has yet been done. As regards
                    geographical distribution, the elastic force is greatest within the tropics, and
                    diminishes towards the poles; it is greater over <pb break="no"

                    greater in summer than in winter; and greater at midday than in the morning. It
                    diminishes with the height generally; but in particular cases, different strata
                    are superimposed on each other, differing widely as regards dryness and
                    humidity, and the transitions from the one to the other are often sharp and
                    sudden.</p>
                <p>The relative humidity of the air may be regarded as the degree of approach to
                    saturation. It is greatest near the surface of the earth during night, w hen the
                    temperature, being at or near the daily minimum, approaches the dewpoint; it is
                    also great in the morning, when the sun’s rays have evaporated the dew, and the
                    vapour is as yet only diffused a little way upwards; and it is least during the
                    greatest heat of the day.</p>
                <p>Between the humidity, both absolute and relative, of the air and the temperature
                    there is a vital and all-important connection. Observation shows that when the
                    quantity of vapour in the air is great, and also when the relative humidity is
                    high, temperature falls little during the night, even though the sky be
                    perfectly clear; but when the quantity of vapour is small, or the relative
                    humidity is low, temperature rapidly falls. On the other hand, during the day
                    the temperature rises slowly, when the quantity of vapour is great, or relative
                    humidity high, even though the sky be clear, but when the quantity of vapour is
                    small, and humidity low, temperature rapidly rises. These facts are explained by
                    the circumstance that perfectly dry air is diathermanous, that is, it allows
                    radiant heat to pass through it without being sensibly warmed thereby. Add
                    vapour to this air, and its diathermancy is diminished. The diathermancy is also
                    reduced if the temperature approach nearer to the dew-point; in other words, if
                    the relative humidity be increased. Hence, with an increase of vapour or with
                    increased humidity, the effects of both solar and terrestrial radiation are much
                    less felt on the surface of the earth—the vapour screen performing, in truth,
                    one of the most important conservative functions of the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Since ascending currents fall in temperature as they ascend, through diminished
                    pressure and consequent dilatation, they increase their relative humidity; and
                    since descending currents increase in temperature, and consequently reduce their
                    relative humidity, it follows that, over a region from which ascending currents
                    rise, solar and terrestrial radiation is very considerably obstructed, but over
                    a region upon which currents descend, radiation is much less obstructed. Most of
                    our exceptionally hot summer and cold winter weather is to be explained in this
                    way, on which occasions there is generally observed a high barometric pressure
                    overspreading a comparatively limited region, on which a slow downward movement
                    of the air proceeds.</p>
                <p>Of the solar heat which reaches the surface of the globe, that part which falls
                    on the land may be regarded as wholly absorbed by the thin superficial layer
                    exposed to the heating rays; and since there is no mobility in the particles of
                    the land, the heat can be communicated downwards only by conduction. On the
                    other hand, the solar heat which falls on water is not, as in the case of land,
                    arrested at the surface, but penetrates to a considerable depth, the heating
                    effect being in the case of clear water appreciably felt at a depth of from 500
                    to 600 feet. Since the heat daily received by the ocean from the sun is diffused
                    downwards through a very considerable depth, the surface of the ocean on which
                    the atmosphere rests is much less heated during the day than is the surface of
                    the land. Similarly it is also less cooled during the night by terrestrial
                    radiation.</p>
                <p>This points to a chief acting force on which the great movements of the
                    atmosphere depend, viz., simultaneous local irregularities in the distribution
                    of temperature in the atmosphere. The local expansion of the atmosphere by heat
                    during the day is greatest over land, w here the air is clear, dry, and
                    comparatively calm, and least over the ocean, where the sky is clouded, and the
                    air loaded with moisture. On the other hand, the local contraction by cold
                    during night is greatest over land, where the air is clear, dry, and calm, or
                    nearly so, and least over the ocean, where the air is clouded, and loaded with
                    moisture. As familiar illustrations of atmospheric movements resulting from
                    local expansions by heat and contractions by cold, we may refer to the land and
                    sea breezes, and what depend upon exactly the same principle, the dry and rainy
                    monsoons in different parts of the globe. But the illustration of the principle
                    on the broadest scale is the system of atmospheric circulation known as the
                    equatorial and polar currents of the atmosphere, which originate in the unequal
                    heating by the sun of the equatorial, temperate, and polar regions.</p>
                <p>The other principal motive force in atmospheric circulation depends on the
                    aqueous vapour. The many w ayβ in which this element acts as a motive force will
                    be seen when it is considered that a large quantity of sensible heat disappears
                    in the process of evaporation, and reappears in the process of condensation of
                    the vapour into rain or cloud; that saturated air is specifically lighter than
                    dry air; and that the absolute and relative amount of the vapour powerfully
                    influences both solar and terrestrial radiation. The question to be carefully
                    considered here is, how in these ways the vapour produces local irregularities
                    in the distribution of atmospheric pressure, thus giving rise to aerial
                    movements which set in to restore the equilibrium that has thus been
                    disturbed.</p>
                <p>It is from these local irregularities—using the word local in a very wide
                    sense—in the distribution of atmospheric pressure, whether the irregularities
                    originate in the temperature or aqueous vapour, that all winds, from the
                    lightest breeze to the most destructive hurricane, take their rise; for, as
                    already stated, wind is merely the flowing away of the air from where there is a
                    surplus of it to where there is a deficiency.</p>
                <p>In examining weather charts embracing a considerable portion of the earth’s
                    surface, such, for instance, as those published in the <hi rend="italic">Journal
                    of the Scottish Meteorological Society,</hi> vol. ii. p. 198, which include a
                    large part of the northern hemisphere, there are seen two different systems of
                    pressure changing their forms and positions on the globe from day to day—one set
                    being systems of low pressure marked off by concentric isobarics enclosing
                    pressures successively lower as the central space is approached, and the other
                    set being systems of high pressure marked off by roughly concentric isobarics
                    bounding pressures successively higher towards their centres. These two systems
                    are essentially distinct from each other, and without some knowledge of them the
                    circulation of the atmosphere cannot be understood.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Areas of Low Pressure, or Cyclones.—</hi> The annexed
                    woodcut, fig. 1, is a good representation of a cyclone w hich passed over
                    north-western Europe on the morning of 2d November 1863. The pressure in the
                    central space is 28 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9 inches, from which it rises
                    successively, as shown by the isobarics, to 29T, 29 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 3, 29 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5, 297, and 29’9 inches. The arrows
                    show the direction and force of the wind, the force rising with the number of
                    feathers on the arrows. The two chief points to be noted are the following
                    :—(1.) The <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> of the arrows show’s a vorticose
                    motion of the air inwards upon the space of lowest pressure, the motion being
                    contrary to that of the hands of a w atch. It will be observed that the winds
                    blow in conformity with what is known as Buys-Ballot’s “Law of the Winds,”
                    already <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n45/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0045-0034"/> referred to, but which may be otherwise thus put
                    :—Stand with your back to the wind, and the lowest barometer, or centre of
                    depression, will be to your left in the northern hemisphere (in the southern
                    hemisphere to the right); this rule holds universally.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(2.) The force oi</hi> the wind is proportional to the
                    barometric gradient, or the quotient of the distance between two places stated
                    in miles by the difference of pressure stated in inches of mercury as observed
                    at the two places. Hence, in the Channel, where the isobarics are close
                    together, winds are high, but in the north of Scotland, where the isobarics are
                    far apart, winds are light. This rule also holds universally, though the exact
                    relation requires still to be worked out by observation. As regards the
                    important climatic elements of temperature and moisture, the air in the S.S.E.
                    half of the cyclone is mild and humid, and much rain falls; but in the other
                    half it is cold and dry, and little rain falls. A succession of low pressures
                    passing eastward, in a course lying to northwards of Great Britain, is the
                    characteristic of an open winter in Great Britain; on the other hand, if the
                    cyclones follow a course lying to the southward, the winters are severe. This is
                    a chief point of climatic importance connected with the propagation eastward of
                    these cyclonic areas.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Areas of High Pressures, or Anticyclones—</hi> The
                    accompanying weather chart, fig. 2, for 2-4th August 1868, represents an
                    anticylone or region of high pressure, which overspread the greater part of
                    Europe at that time. Here the highest pressure is in the centre of the system,
                    and, as usually happens, the isobarics are less symmetrical than those near the
                    centre of a cyclone. The winds, as usual in anticyclones, are light: this,
                    however, is the essential point of difference—the winds do not flow inwards upon
                    the centre, but outwards from the region of high pressure; and it will be
                    observed that in many cases they cut the isobarics· at nearly right angles.
                    Another important point of difference is in the air over the region covered by
                    the anticyclone being, particularly in its central portion, very dry, and either
                    clear or nearly free from clouds.</p>
                <p>Climatically, the significance of the anticyclone consists in the space covered
                    for the time by it being, on account of its dryness and clearness, more fully
                    under the influence of both solar and terrestrial radiation; and consequently in
                    winter it is accompanied with great cold, and in summer with great heat. As
                    shown by Buchan, in reviewing the weather of north-western Europe for 1868,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    intense heat which prevailed in Great Britain during 2-4th August of that year
                    was due to the high barometric pressure accompanying this anticyclone, the
                    comparative calmness of the atmosphere, the clearness of the sky, the dryness of
                    the air, and the strong insolation which took place under these
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>Thus, then, the tendency of the winds on the surface of the earth is to blow
                    round and in upon the space where pressures are low and out of the space where
                    pressures are high. Now, since vast volumes of air are in this way poured into
                    the space where pressure is low, without increasing that pressure, and, on the
                    other hand, vast volumes flow out of the space where pressure is high, without
                    diminishing that pressure, it necessarily follows that the air poured in is not
                    allowed to accumulate over this space, but must escape into othér regions; and
                    also that the air which flows out from the anticyclonic region must have its
                    place supplied by fresh accessions from above. In other words, the central space
                    of the cyclone is occupied by a vast ascending current, which after rising to a
                    considerable height flows away as upper currents into surrounding regions; and
                    the central space of the anticyclone is filled by a slowly descending current,
                    which is fed from upper currents, blowing towards it from neighbouring regions.
                    When the area of observation is made sufficiently wide, cyclones are seen to
                    have one, or sometimes more, anticyclones in proximity to them, the better
                    marked anticyclones having two, and sometimes more, cyclones in their vicinity.
                    In fig. 2, a part of a cyclone in Iceland is seen, and another cyclone in the
                    Crimea accompanied the anticyclone there figured. Hence the cyclone and the
                    anticyclone are properly to be regarded as counterparts, belonging to one and
                    the same great atmospheric disturbance.</p>
                <p>.From this it follows that observations of the winds cannot be conducted, and the
                    results discussed, on the supposition that the general movement of the winds
                    felt on the earth’s surface is horizontal, it being evident that the circulation
                    of the atmosphere is effected largely through systems of ascending and
                    descending currents. The only satisfactory way of discussing the winds, viewed
                    especially in their climatic relations, is that recently proposed by Koppen of
                    St Petersburg, and applied by him with very fruitful results in investigating
                    the weather of that place during 1872 and 1873. In attempting an explanation o
                    <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> these phenomena, we are met with several as yet
                    insuperable obstacles :—(1.) An imperfect knowledge of the mode <pb break="no"

                    systems; (2.) Imperfect knowledge of the relations of the formation of cloud and
                    aqueous precipitation to barometric fluctuations; (3.) A want of information
                    with reference to the merely mechanical effects of ascending, descending, and
                    horizontal currents of air on the barometric pressure; in other words, we do not
                    know how far the barometric pressure is an indication of the mass of air in the
                    column vertically over it, when that column is traversed by air-currents; (4.)
                    An almost total absence of really good wind observations; and (5.) Deficient
                    information in nearly everything that respects aqueous vapour—its relation to
                    radiant heat, both solar and terrestrial; its mode of diffusion vertically and
                    horizontally in the free atmosphere, especially from an evaporating surface; the
                    influence which its condensation into cloud and rain exerts on aerial
                    currents,—in regard to all which more satisfactory methods of observing this
                    vital element, and discussing the results of observation, are greatly to be
                    desired. There are here large important fields of inquiry awaiting experimental
                    and observational physicists.</p>
                <p>The law of the dilatation of gases, known as the “Law of Boyle” or “Law of
                    Mariotte,” is this: The volume occupied by a gas is in inverse ratio to the
                    pressure under which it exists, if the temperature remains the same; or the
                    density of a gas is proportioned to its pressure. Consequently, air under a
                    pressure equal to that of two atmospheres will occupy only half the volume it
                    occupied under the pressure of one atmosphere; under the pressure of three
                    atmospheres, one-third of that volume, &amp;c. By doubling the pressure we
                    double the elasticity. If, however, the temperature be increased, and the air
                    occupy the same space, the pressure will be increased; but if the pressure is to
                    remain the same, the air must occupy a larger space. From Regnault’s
                    experiments, it is concluded that the co-efficicnt which denotes increase of
                    elasticity for l <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> Fahr, of air whose volume is
                    constant equals Ό02036; and that the coefficient which denotes increase of
                    volume for l <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> Fahr, of air whose elasticity is
                    constant equals Ό02039.</p>
                <p>Those portions of the atmosphere in contact with the earth are pressed upon by
                    all the air above them. The air at the top of a mountain is pressed upon by all
                    the air above it, while all the portion below it, or lying between the top of
                    the mountain and the surface of the sea, exerts no pressure whatever upon it.
                    Thus the pressure of the atmosphere constantly diminishes with the height. If,
                    then, the pressure of the atmosphere at two heights be observed, and if at the
                    same time the mean temperature and humidity of the whole stratum of air lying
                    between the two levels were known, the difference in height between the two
                    places could be calculated. For the development of this principle, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Barometric Measurements of Heights.</hi></p>
                <p>The air thus diminishing in density as we ascend, if it consists of ultimate
                    atoms, as is no doubt the case, it follows that the limit of the atmosphere will
                    be reached at the height where the force of gravity downwards upon a single
                    particle is equal to the resisting force arising from the repulsive force of the
                    particles. It was long supposed, from the results of observations on the
                    refraction of light, that the height of the atmosphere did not exceed 45 miles;
                    but from the observations of luminous meteors, whose true character as cosmical
                    bodies was established a few years ago, it is inferred that the height of the
                    atmosphere is at least 120 miles, and that, in an extremely attenuated form, it
                    may even reach 200 miles.</p>
                <p>Though there are considerable differences in the specific gravities of the four
                    constituent gases of the atmosphere, viz., oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic acid gas,
                    and aqueous vapour, there is yet no tendency to separation among them, owing to
                    the law of diffusion obtaining among elastic fluids mixed together. While the
                    proportion of these gases is in a general sense constant, there are, however,
                    consistent differences in the amounts of oxygen and nitrogen in the air of
                    unwholesome places, as first shown by Régnault. The following figures, showing
                    the volume per cent, of oxygen, rest on the authority of Dr Angus Smith, who has
                    given much attention to this subject :—Sea-shore of Scotland and Atlantic (lat.
                    43° 5' N., long. 17° 12' W.), 20’99; tops of Scottish hills, 20'98; in
                    sitting-room feeling close but not excessively so, 20'89; backs of houses and
                    closets, 20'70; under shafts in metalliferous mines, 20'424; when candles go
                    out, 18'50; when it is very difficult to remain in the air many minutes, 17 '20.
                    The variations in the amounts of carbonic acid in different situations are
                    great; thus—in the London parks it is Ό301; on the Thames, Ό343; where fields
                    begin, Ό369; in London streets in summer, Ό380; during fogs in Manchester, Ό679;
                    in workshops it rises to '3000, and in the worst parts of theatres to '3200; and
                    the largest amount, found in Cornwall mines, is 2'5000.</p>
                <p>Great differences have been observed by Dr A. Smith between country rain and town
                    rain: country rain is neutral; town rain, on the other hand, is acid, and
                    corrodes metals and even stones and bricks, destroying mortar rapidly, and
                    readily spoiling many colours. Much information has been obtained regarding
                    impurities, in the air of towns and other places by examining the rain collected
                    in different places. The air freest from impurities is that collected at the
                    sea-coast and at considerable heights. Again, ammonia is found to diminish,
                    while nitric acid increases, in ascending to, at least, habitable heights. As
                    regards organic matter in the air, it corresponds to a considerable extent with
                    the density of the population. As might have been supposed from the higher
                    temperature, more nitric acid is contained in rain collected on tho Continent
                    than in the British Islands. This inquiry, which is only yet in its infancy,
                    will doubtless continue to be vigorously prosecuted, particularly since we may
                    hope thereby to arrive at the means of authoritatively defining the safe limits
                    of the density of population, and the extent to which manufactures may be
                    carried on within a given area. The influence of atmospheric impurities on the
                    public health has received a good deal of attention.</p>
                <p>The relation of weather to mortality is a very important inquiry, and though a
                    good deal has been known regarding the question for some time, yet it has only
                    recently been systematically inquired into by Dr Arthur Mitchell and Mr Buchan,
                    the results of the investigation which deals with the mortality of London being
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Scottish Meteorological
                    Society</hi> (New Series, Nos. 43 to 46). Considering the weather of the year as
                    made up of several distinct climates differing from each other according to
                    temperature and moisture and their relations to each other, it may be divided
                    into six distinct climates, characterised respectively by cold, cold with
                    dryness, dryness with heat, heat, heat with moisture, and cold with moisture.
                    Each of these six periods has a peculiar influence in increasing or diminishing
                    the mortality, and each has its own group of diseases which rise to the maximum,
                    or fall to the minimum mortality, or are subject to a rapid increase or a rapid
                    decrease. The mortality from all causes and at all ages shows a large excess
                    above the average from the middle of November to the middle of April, from which
                    it falls to the minimum in the end of May; it then slowly rises, and on the
                    third week of July suddenly shoots up almost as high as the winter maximum of
                    the year, at which it remains till the second week of August, falling thence as
                    rapidly as it rose to a secondary minimum in October. Regarding the summer
                    excess, which is so abrupt in its rise and fall, it is almost altogether <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n47/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0047-0036"/> due to the enormous increase of the mortality
                    among mere infants under one year of age; and this increase is due not only to
                    deaths at one age, but to deaths from one class of diseases, viz., bowel
                    complaints. If the deaths from bowel complaints be deducted from the deaths from
                    all causes, there remains an excess of deaths in the cold months, and a
                    deficiency in the warm months. In other words, the curve of mortality is
                    regulated by the large number of deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs.
                    The curve of mortality for London, if mere infants be excepted, has thus an
                    inverse relation to the temperature, rising as the temperature falls, and
                    falling as the temperature rises. On the other hand, in Victoria, Australia,
                    where the summers are hotter and the winters milder, the curves of mortality and
                    temperature are directly related to each other—mortality and temperature rising
                    and falling together; the reason being that in Victoria deaths from bowel
                    complaints are much greater, and those from diseases of the respiratory organs
                    much less than in London.</p>
                <p>The curves show that the maximum annual mortality from the different diseases
                    groups around certain specific conditions of temperature and moisture combined.
                    Thus, <hi rend="italic">cold and moist weather</hi> is accompanied with a high
                    death-rate from rheumatism, heart diseases, diphtheria, and measles; <hi
                    rend="italic">cold weather,</hi> with a high death-rate from bronchitis,
