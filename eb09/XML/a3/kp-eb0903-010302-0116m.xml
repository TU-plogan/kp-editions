                    the largest islandcontinent of Australasia, is situated within 10° 47' and 39°
                    1Γ S. lat., and 113° and 153° 30' E. long. It measures 2500 miles in length from
                    west to east, by 1950 miles in breadth from north to south, and contains an area
                    of about 3,000,000 square miles—nearly the same as that of the United States of
                    America, exclusive of Alaska. It is surrounded on the west by the Indian Ocean,
                    and on the east by the South Pacific. In the north it is separated from New
                    Guinea by Torres Strait, which is 80 miles broad, and from the Eastern
                    Archipelago by Arafura Sea; while on the south Bass Strait, 140 miles wide,
                    separates it from Tasmania. The neighbouring colony of New Zealand lies 1200
                    miles opposite its south-east coast.</p>
                <p>Owing to its position at the antipodes of the civilised world, Australia has been
                    longer a <hi rend="italic">terra incognita</hi> than any other region of the
                    same extent. Its first discovery is involved in considerable doubt, from
                    confusion of the names which were applied by the earlier navigators and
                    geographers to the Australasian coasts.</p>
                <p>The ancients were somehow impressed with the idea of a <hi rend="italic">Terra
                    Australis</hi> which was one day to be revealed. The Phoenician mariners had
                    pushed through the outlet of the Red Sea to eastern Africa, the Persian Gulf,
                    and the coasts of India and Sumatra. But the geographer Ptolemy, in the 2d
                    century, still conceived the Indian Ocean to be an inland sea, bounded on the
                    south by an unknown land, which connected the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chersonesus</hi><hi rend="italic">Aurea</hi> (Malay Peninsula) with the
                    promontory of <hi rend="italic">Prasum</hi> in eastern Africa. This erroneous
                    notion prevailed in mediaeval Europe, although some travellers like Marco Polo
                    heard rumours in China of large insular countries to the south-east.</p>
                <p>The investigations of Mr R. II. Major make it appear probable that the Australian
                    mainland was known as “Great Java” to the Portuguese early in the 16th century;
                    and the following passage in the <hi rend="italic">Descriptionis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ptolemaicoe</hi><hi rend="italic">Augmentum</hi> of Cornelius
                    Wytfliet, printed at Louvain in 1598. is perhaps the first distinct account that
                    occurs of the country :—“The <hi rend="italic">Australis Terra</hi> is the most
                    southern of all lands, and is separated from New Guinea by a narrow strait. Its
                    shores are hitherto but little known, since, after one voyage and another, that
                    route has been deserted, and seldom is the country visited, unless when sailors
                    are driven there by storms. The <hi rend="italic">Aτιstralis Terra</hi> begins
                    at one or two degrees from the equator, and is ascertained by some to be of so
                    great an extent, that if it were thoroughly explored it would be regarded as a
                    fifth part of the world.”</p>
                <p>It was in 1606 that Torres, with a ship commissioned by the Spanish Government of
                    Peru, parted from his companion Quiros (after their discovery of Espiritu Santo
                    and the New Hebrides), and sailed from east to w est through the strait which
                    bears his name; while in the same year the peninsula of Cape York w as touched
                    at by a vessel called the “Duyfhen” or “Dove” from the Dutch colony of Bantam in
                    Java, but this was understood at the time to form a part of the neighbouring
                    island of New Guinea. The Dutch continued their attempts to explore the unknown
                    land, sending out in 1616 the ship “Endraght,” commanded by Dirk Hartog, which
                    sailed along the west coast of Australia from lat. 26° 30' to 23° S. This
                    expedition left on an islet near Shark’s Bay a record of its visit engraved on a
                    tin plate, which was found there in 1801. The “Pera” and “Arnhem,” Dutch vessels
                    from Amboyna, in 1618 explored the Gulf of Carpentaria, giving to its westward
                    peninsula, on the side opposite to Cape York, the name of Arnhem Land. The name
                    of Carpentaria was also bestowed on this vast gulf in compliment to Peter
                    Carpenter, then governor of the Dutch East India Company. In 1627 the “Güldene
                    Zeepard,” carrying Peter Nuyts to the embassy in Japan, sailed along the south
                    coast from Cape Leeuwin, and sighted the whole shore of the Great Bight. But
                    alike on the northern and southern seaboard, the aspect of New Holland, as it
                    was then called, presented an uninviting appearance.</p>
                <p>An important era of discovery began with Tasman’s voyage of 1642. He, too, sailed
                    from Batavia; but, first crossing the Indian Ocean to the Mauritius, he
                    descended to the 44th parallel of S. lat., recrossing that ocean to the east. By
                    taking this latter course he reached the island which now bears his name, but
                    which he called Van Diemen’s Land, after the Dutch governor of Batavia. In 1644
                    Tasman made another attempt, w hen he explored the north-west coast of
                    Australia, from Arnhem Land to the 22d degree of latitude, approaching the
                    locality of Dirk Hartog’s discoveries of 1616. He seems to have landed at Cape
                    Ford, near Victoria River, also in Roebuck Bay, and again near Dampier’s
                    Archipelago. But the hostile attitude of the natives, whom he denounced as a
                    malicious and miserable race of savages, prevented his seeing much of the new
                    country; and for half a century after this no fresh discoveries were made.</p>
                <p>The English made their first appearance on the Australian coast in 1688, w hen
                    the north-western shores were visited by the famous buccaneer Captain William
                    Dampier, who spent five weeks ashore near Roebuck Bay. A few years later (1697)
                    the Dutch organised another expedition under Vlamingh, who, first touching at
                    Swan River on the west coast, sailed northward to Shark’s Bay, where Hartog had
                    been in 1616. Dampier, two years later, visited the same place, not now as a
                    roving adventurer, but with a commission from the English Admiralty to pursue
                    his Australian researches. This enterprising navigator, in the narrative of his
                    voyages, gives an account of the trees, birds, and reptiles he observed, and of
                    his encounters with the natives. But he found nothing to invite a long stay.
                    There was <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n117/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0117-0104"/> yet another Dutch exploring squadron on that
                    coast in 1705, but the results were of little importance.</p>
                <p>It was Captain Cook, in his voyages from 1769 to 1777, who communicated the most
                    important discoveries, and first opened to European enterprise and settlement
                    the Australasian coasts. In command of the bark “Endeavour,” 370 tons burden,
                    and carrying 85 persons, amongst whom were Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Solander,
                    returning from the Royal Society’s expedition to observe the transit of Venus,
                    Cook visited both New Zealand and New South Wales. He came upon the Australian
                    mainland in April 1770, at a point named after Lieutenant Hicks, who first
                    sighted it, on the shore of Gipps’ Land, Victoria, S. lat. 38°, E. long. 148°
                    53'. From this point, in a coasting voyage not without peril when entangled in
                    the barrier reefs of coral, the little vessel made its way up the whole length
                    of the eastern side of Australia, rounding Cape York, and crossing Torres Strait
                    to New Guinea. In his second expedition of Australasian discovery, which was
                    sent out in 1773, Cook’s ship, the “Resolute,” started in company with the
                    “Adventure,” commanded by Captain Fur- .neaux. The two vessels separated, and
                    Cook went to New Zealand, while Furneaux examined some parts of Tasmania and
                    Bass Strait. The third voyage of Cook brought him, in 1777, both to Tasmania and
                    to New Zealand.</p>
                <p>Next to Cook, twenty or thirty years after his time, the names of Bass and
                    Flinders are justly honoured for continuing the work of maritime discovery he
                    had so well begun. To their courageous and persevering efforts, begun at their
                    private risk, is due the correct determination of the shape both of Tasmania and
                    the neighbouring continent. The French admiral Entrecasteaux, in 1792, had made
                    a careful examination of the inlets at the south of Tasmania, and in his opinion
                    the opening between Tasmania and Australia was only a deep bay. It was Bass who
                    discovered it to be a broad strait, with numerous small islands. Captain
                    Flinders survived his friend Bass, having been associated with him in 1798 in
                    this and other useful adventures. Flinders afterwards made a complete 8urvey in
                    detail of all the Australian coasts, except the west and north-west. He was
                    captured, however, by the French during the war, and detained a prisoner in
                    Mauritius for seven years.</p>
                <p>The shores of what is now the province of Victoria were explored in 1800 by
                    Captain Grant, and in 1802 by Lieutenant Murray, when the spacious land-locked
                    bay of Port Phillip was discovered. New South Wales had already been colonised,
                    and the town of Sydney founded at Port Jackson in 1788. West Australia had long
                    remained neglected, but in 1837, after the settlement at Swan River, a series of
                    coast surveys was commenced in H.M.S. “Beagle.” These were continued from 1839
                    to 1843 by Mr Stokes, and furnished an ’exact knowledge of the western,
                    north-western, and northern shores, including four large rivers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inland Exploration.—</hi> The geographical position of the
                    Australian continent had now been sufficiently determined, and what Remained for
                    discovery was sought, not as hitherto by coasting along its shores and bays, but
                    by striking into the vast tract of <hi rend="italic">terra incognita</hi> that
                    occupied the interior. The colony of New South Wales had been founded in 1788,
                    but for twenty-five years its settlers were acquainted only with a strip of
                    country 50 miles wide, between the Blue Mountains and the sea-coast, for they
                    scarcely ever ventured far inland from the inlets of Port Jackson and Botany
                    Bay. Mr Bass, indeed, once while waiting for his vessel, made an attempt to
                    cross the Blue Mountains, and succeeded in discovering the River Grove, a
                    tributary of the Hawkesbury, but did not proceed further. An expedition was also
                    conducted by Governor Hunter along the Nepean River west of the settlement,
                    while Lieutenant Bareiller, in 1802, and Mr Caley, a year or two later, failed
                    in their endeavour to surmount the Blue Mountain range. This formidable ridge
                    attains a height of 3400 feet, and being intersected with precipitous ravines
                    1500 feet deep, presented a bar to these explorers’ passage inland. At last, in
                    1813, when a summer of severe drought had made it of vital importance to find
                    new pastures, three of the colonists, Messrs Wentworth and Blaxland and
                    Lieutenant Lawson, crossing the Nepean at Emu Plains, gained sight of an
                    entrance, and ascending the summit of a dividing ridge, obtained a view of the
                    grassy valley of the Fish River. This stream runs westward into the Macquarie,
                    which was discovered a few months afterwards by Mr Evans, who followed its
                    course across the fertile plains of Bathurst.</p>
                <p>In 1816 Lieutenant Oxley, R.N., accompanied by Mr Evans and Mr Cunningham the
                    botanist, conducted an expedition of great interest down the Lachlan River, 300
                    miles to the north-west, reaching a point 34° S. lat., and 144° 30' E. long. On
                    his return journey Oxley again struck the Macquarie River at a place he called
                    Wellington, and from this place in the following year he organised a second
                    expedition in hopes of discovering an inland sea. He was, however, disappointed
                    in this, as after descending the course of the Macquarie below Mount Harris, he
                    found that the river ended in an immense swamp overgrown with reeds. Oxley now
                    turned aside—led by Mr Evans’s report of the country eastward—crossed the
                    Arbuthnot range, and traversing the Liverpool Plains, and ascending the Peel and
                    Cockburn Rivers to the Blue Mountains, gained sight of the open sea, which he
                    reached at Port Macquarie. A valuable extension of geographical knowledge had
                    been gained by this circuitous journey of more than 800 miles. Yet its result
                    was a disappointment to those who had looked for means of inland navigation by
                    the Macquarie River, and by its supposed issue in a Mediterranean sea.</p>
                <p>During the next two or three years public attention was occupied with Captain
                    King’s maritime explorations of the north-west coast in three successive
                    voyages, and by explorations of West Australia in 1821. These steps were
                    followed by the foundation of a settlement on Melville Island, in the extreme
                    north, which, however, was soon abandoned. In 1823 Lieutenant Oxley proceeded to
                    Moreton Bay and Port Curtis, the first place 7° north of Sydney, the other 10°,
                    to choose the site of a new penal establishment. From a shipwrecked English
                    sailor he met with, who had lived with the savages, he heard of the river
                    Brisbane. About the same time, in the opposite direction, south-west of Sydney,
                    a large extent of the interior was revealed. The River Murrumbidgee—which unites
                    with the Lachlan to join the great River Murray—was traced by Mr Hamilton Hume
                    and Mr Hovell into the country lying north of the province of Victoria, through
                    which they made their way to Port Phillip. In 1827 and the two following years,
                    Mr Cunningham prosecuted his instructive explorations on both sides of the
                    Liverpool range, between the upper waters of the Hunter and those of the Peel
                    and other tributaries of the Brisbane north of New South Wales. Some of his
                    discoveries, including those of Pandora’s Pass and the Darling Downs, were of
                    great practical utility.</p>
                <p>By this time much had thus been done to obtain an acquaintance with the eastern
                    parts of the Australian continent, although the problem of what could become of
                    the large rivers flowing north-west and south-west into the interior was still
                    unsolved. With a view to determine this question, Governor Sir Ralph Darling, in
                    the year 1828, sent out the expedition under Captain Charles Sturt, who
                    proceeding first to the marshes at the end of the Macquarie River, found his
                    progress checked by the dense mass of reeds in that quarter. He therefore turned
                    westward, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n118/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0118-0105"/> and struck a large river, with many affluents, to
                    which he gave the name of the Darling. This river, flowing from north-east to
                    south-west, drains the marshes in which the Macquarie and other streams from the
                    south appeared to be lost. The course of the Murrumbidgee, a deep and rapid
                    river, was followed by the same eminent explorer in his second expedition in
                    1831 with a more satisfactory result. He travelled on this occasion nearly 2000
                    miles, and discovered that both the Murrumbidgee, carrying with it the waters of
                    the Lachlan morass, and likewise the Darling, from a more northerly region,
                    finally joined another and larger river. This stream, the Murray, in the upper
                    part of its course, runs in a north-westerly direction, but afterwards turning
                    southwards, almost at a right angle, expands into Lake Alexandrina on the south
                    coast, about 60 miles S.E. of the town of Adelaide, and finally enters the sea
                    at Encounter Bay in E. long. 139°.</p>
                <p>After gaining a practical solution of the problem of the destination of the
                    westward-flowing rivers, Sir Thomas Mitchell, in 1835, led an expedition
                    northward to the upper branches of the Darling; but the party meeting with a sad
                    disaster in the death of Mr Cunningham, the eminent botanist, who was murdered
                    by the natives on the Bogan River, further exploration of that region was left
                    to be undertaken by Dr Leichardt, nine years later, and by the son of Sir Thomas
                    MitchelL Meantime, from the new colony of Adelaide, South Australia, on the
                    shores of Gulf St Vincent, a series of adventurous journeys to the north and to
                    the west was commenced by Mr Eyre, who explored a country much more difficult of
                    access, and more forbidding in aspect, than the “Riverina” of the eastern
                    provinces. He performed in 1840 a feat of extraordinary personal daring,
                    travelling all the way along the barren seacoast of the Great Australian Bight,
                    from Spencer Gulf to King George’s Sound. Mr Eyre also explored the interior
                    north of the head of Spencer Gulf, where he was misled, however, by appearances
                    to form an erroneous theory about the water-surfaces named Lake Torrens. It was
                    left to the veteran explorer, Sturt, to achieve the arduous enterprise of
                    penetrating from the Darling northward to the very centre of the continent. This
                    was in 1845, the route lying for the most part over a stony desert, where the
                    heat (reaching 131° Fahr.), with scorching winds, caused much suffering to the
                    party. The most northerly point reached by Sturt on this occasion was about S.
                    lat. 24° 25'. His unfortunate successors, Burke and Wills, travelled through the
                    same district sixteen years later; and other expeditions were organised, both
                    from the north and from the south, which aimed at learning the fate of these
                    travellers, as well as that of Dr Leichardt. These efforts completed our
                    knowledge of different routes across the entire breadth of Australia, in the
                    longitude of the Gulf of Carpentaria; while the enterprising journeys of
                    Mac-Douall Stuart, a companion of Sturt, obtained in 1862 a direct passage from
                    South Australia northward. to the shores of the Malayan Sea. This route has been
                    utilised by the construction of an overland telegraph from Adelaide to the
                    northern coast.</p>
                <p>A military station having been fixed by the British Government at Port Victoria,
                    on the coast of Arnhem Land, for the protection of shipwrecked mariners on the
                    north coast, it was thought desirable to find an overland route between this
                    settlement and Moreton Bay, in what then was the northern portion of New South
                    Wales, now called Queensland. This was the object of Dr Leichardt’s expedition
                    in 1844, which proceeded first along the banks of the Dawson and the Mackenzie,
                    tributaries of the Fitzroy River, in Queensland. It thence passed farther north
                    to the Burdekin, ascending to the source of that river, and turned westward
                    across a table-land, from which there was an easy descent to the Gulf of
                    Carpentaria. Skirting the low shores of this gulf, all the way round its upper
                    half to the Roper, Leichardt crossed Arnhem Land to the Alligator River, which
                    he descended to the western shore of the peninsula, and arrived at Port
                    Victoria, otherwise Port Essington, after a journey of 3000 miles, performed
                    within a year and three months. In 1847 Leichardt undertook a much more
                    formidable task, that of crossing the entire continent from east to west. His
                    starting point was on the Fitzroy Downs, north of the River Condamine, in
                    Queensland, between the 26th and 27th degrees of S. latitude. But this eminent
                    explorer had not proceeded far into the interior before he met his death, his
                    last despatch dating from the Cogoon, April 3, 1848. In the same region, from
                    1845 to 1847, Sir Thomas Mitchell and Mr E. B. Kennedy explored the northern
                    tributaries of the Darling, and a river in S. lat. 24°, named the Barcoo or
                    Victoria, which flows to the south-west. This river was more thoroughly examined
                    by Mr A. C. Gregory in 1858. Mr Kennedy lost his life in 1848, being killed by
                    the natives while attempting to explore the peninsula of Cape York, from
                    Rockingham Bay to Weymouth Bay.</p>
                <p>Among the performances of less renown, but of much practical utility in surveying
                    and opening new paths through the country, we may mention that of Captain
                    Banister, showing the way across the southern part of West Australia, from Swan
                    River to King George’s Sound, and that of Messrs Robinson and G. H. Haydon in
                    1844, making good the route from Port Phillip to Gipps’ Land with loaded drays,
                    through a dense tangled scrub, which had been described by Strzelecki as his
                    worst obstacle. Again, in West Australia there were the explorations of the
                    Arrowsmith, the Murchison, the Gascoyne, and the Ashburton Rivers, by Captain
                    Grey, Mr Roe, Governor Fitzgerald, Mr R. Austin, and the brothers Gregory, whose
                    discoveries have great importance from a geographical point of view.</p>
                <p>These local researches, and the more comprehensive attempts of Leichardt and
                    Mitchell to solve the chief problems of Australian geography, must yield in
                    importance to the grand achievement of Mr Stuart in 1862. The first of his tours
                    independently performed, in 1858 and 1859, were around the South Australian
                    lakes, namely, Lake Torrens, Lake Eyre, and Lake Gairdner. These waters had been
                    erroneously taken for parts of one vast horseshoe or sickle-shaped lake, only
                    some twenty miles broad, believed to encircle a large portion of the inland
                    country, with drainage at one end by a marsh into Spencer Gulf. The mistake,
                    shown in all the old maps of Australia, had originated in a curious optical
                    illusion. When Mr Eyre viewed the country from Mount Deception in 1840, looking
                    between Lake Torrens and the lake which now bears his own name, the refraction
                    of light from the glittering crust of salt that covers a large space of stony or
                    sandy ground produced an appearance of water. The error was discovered, after
                    eighteen years, by the explorations of Mr Babbage and Major Warburton in 1858,
                    while Mr Stuart, about the same time, gained a more complete knowledge of the
                    same district.</p>
                <p>A reward of £10,000 having been offered by the Legislature of South Australia to
                    the first man who should traverse the whole continent from south to north,
                    starting from the city of Adelaide, Mr Stuart resolved to make the attempt. He
                    started in March 1860, passing Lake Torrens and Lake Eyre, beyond which he found
                    a pleasant, fertile country till he crossed the M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    Donnell range of mountains, just under the line of the tropic of Capricorn. On
                    the 23d of April he reached a mountain in S. lat. nearly ..22°, and E. long,
                    nearly 134°, which is the most central marked point of the Australian continent,
                    and has been named Central Mount Stuart. Mr Stuart did not finish his task on
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n119/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0119-0106"/> this occasion, on account of indisposition and
                    other causes. But the 18th degree of latitude had been reached, where the
                    watershed divided the rivers of the Gulf of Carpentaria from the Victoria River,
                    flowing towards the north-west coast. He had also proved that the interior of
                    Australia was not a stony desert, like the region visited by Sturt in 1845. On
                    the first day of the next year, 1861, Mr Stuart again started for a second
                    attempt to cross the continent, which occupied him eight months. He failed,
                    however, to advance further than one geographical degree north of the point
                    reached in 1860, his progress being arrested by dense scrubs and the want of
                    water.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in the province of Victoria, by means of a fund subscribed among the
                    colonists and a grant by the Legislature, the ill-fated expedition of Messrs
                    Burke and Wills was started. It made for the Barcoo, with a view to reach the
                    Gulf of Carpentaria by a northerly course midway between Sturt’s track to the
                    west and Leichardt’s to the east. The leading men of the party were Mr Robert
                    O’Hara Burke, an officer of police, and Mr William John Wills, of the Melbourne
                    observatory. Messrs Burke and Wills, with two men named Gray and King, left the
                    others behind at the Barcoo on 16th December 1860, and proceeded, with a horse
                    and six camels, over the desert traversed by Sturt fifteen years before. They
                    got on in spite of great difficulties, past the M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    Kinlay range of mountains, S. lat. 21° and 22°, and then reached the Flinders
                    River, which flows into the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Here, without
                    actually standing on the seabeach of the northern shore, they met the tidal
                    waters of the sea. On February 23, 1861, they commenced the return journey,
                    having in effect accomplished the feat of crossing the Australian continent.
                    Unhappily, three of the party perished on the road home. Gray, who had fallen
                    ill, died on the 16th of April. Five days later, Burke, Wills, and King had
                    repassed the desert to the place on Cooper Creek (the Barcoo, S. lat. 27° 40',
                    E. long. 140° 30'), where they had left the depot, with the rest of the
                    expedition. Here they experienced a cruel disappointment. The depot was
                    abandoned; the men in charge had quitted the place the same day, believing that
                    Burke and those with him were lost. The main body of the expedition, which
                    should have been led up by a Mr Wright, from Menindie, on the Darling, was
                    misconducted and fatally delayed. Burke, Wills, and King, when they found
                    themselves so fearfully left alone and unprovided in the wilderness, wandered
                    about in that district till near the end of June. They subsisted miserably on
                    the bounty of some natives, and partly by feeding on the seeds of a plant called
                    nardoo. At last both Wills and Burke died of starvation. King, the sole
                    survivor, was saved by meeting the friendly blacks, and was found alive in
                    September by Mr A. W. Howitt’s party, sent on purpose to find and relieve that
                    of Burke.</p>
                <p>Four other parties, besides Howitt’s, were sent out that year from different
                    Australian provinces. Three of them, respectively commanded by Mr Walker, Mr
                    Lands-borough, and Mr Norman, sailed to the north, where the latter two landed
                    on the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria, while Mr Walker marched inland from
                    Rockhampton. The fourth party, under Mr J. M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    Kinlay, from Adelaide, made for the Barcoo by way of Lake Torrens. By these
                    means, the unknown region of Mid Australia was simultaneously entered from the
                    north, south, east, and west, and important additions were made to geographical
                    knowledge. Lands-borough crossed the entire continent from north to south,
                    between February and June 1862; and M ’ Kinlay, from south to north, before the
                    end of August in that year. The interior of New South Wales and Queensland, all
                    that lies east of the 140th degree of longitude, was examined. The Barcoo and
                    its tributary streams were traced from the Queensland mountains, holding a
                    south-westerly course to Lake Eyre in South Australia; the Flinders, the
                    Gilbert, the Gregory, and other northern rivers watering the country towards the
                    Gulf of Carpentaria were also explored. These valuable additions to Australian
                    geography were gained through humane efforts to relieve the lost explorers. The
                    bodies of Burke and Wills were recovered and brought to Melbourne for a solemn
                    public funeral, and a noble monument has been erected to their honour.</p>
                <p>Mr Stuart, in 1862, made his third and final attempt to traverse the continent
                    from Adelaide along a central line, which, inclining a little westward, reaches
                    the north coast of Arnhem Land, opposite Melville Island. He started in January,
                    and on April 7 reached the farthest northern point, near S. lat. 17°, where he
                    had turned back in May of the preceding year. He then pushed on, through a very
                    thick forest, with scarcely any water, till he came to the streams which supply
                    the Roper, a river flowing into the western part of the Gulf of Carpentaria.
                    Having crossed a table-land of sandstone which divides these streams from those
                    running to the western shores of Arnhem Land, Mr Stuart, in the month of July,
                    passed down what is called the Adelaide River of North Australia. Thus he came
                    at length to stand on the verge of the Indian Ocean; “gazing upon it,” a writer
                    has said, “with as much delight as Balboa, when he had crossed the Isthmus of
                    Darien from the Atlantic to the Pacific.” The line crossing Australia which was
                    thus explored has since been occupied by the electric telegraph connecting
                    Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and other Australian cities with London.</p>
                <p>A third part, at least, of the interior of the whole continent, between the
                    central line of Stuart and the known parts of West Australia, from about 120° to
                    134° E. long., an extent of half a million square miles, still remained a blank
                    in the map. But the two expeditions of 1873, conducted by Mr Gosse and Colonel
                    Egerton Warburton, have made a beginning in the exploration of this <hi
                    rend="italic">terra incognita</hi> west of the central telegraph route. That
                    line of more than 1800 miles, having its southern extremity at the head of
                    Spencer Gulf, its northern at Port Darwin, in Arnhem Land, passes Central Mount
                    Stuart, in the middle of the continent, S. lat. 22°, E. long. 134°. Mr Gosse,
                    with men and horses provided by the South Australian Government, started on
                    April 21 from the telegraph station fifty miles south of Central Mount Stuart,
                    to strike into West Australia. He passed the Reynolds range and Lake Amadeus in
                    that direction, but was compelled to turn south, where he found a tract of
                    well-watered grassy land. A singular rock of conglomerate, 2 miles long, 1 mile
                    wide, and 1100 feet high, with a spring of water in its centre, struck his
                    attention. The country was mostly poor and barren, sandy hillocks, with scanty
                    growth of spinifex. Mr Gosse, having travelled above 600 miles, and getting to
                    26° 32' S. lat. and 127° E. long., two degrees within the West Australian
                    boundary, was forced to return. Meantime a more successful attempt to reach the
                    western coast from the centre of Australia has been made by Colonel Warburton,
                    with thirty camels, provided by Mr T. Elder, M.L.C., of South Australia. Leaving
                    the telegraph line at Alice Springs (23° 40' S. lat., 133° 14' E. long.), 1120
                    miles north of Adelaide city, Warburton succeeded in making his way to the De
                    Grey River, West Australia. Overland routes have now been found possible, though
                    scarcely convenient for traffic, between all the widely separated Australian
                    provinces. In Northern Queensland, also, there have been several recent
                    explorations, with results of some interest. That performed by Mr W. Hann, with
                    Messrs Warner, Tate, and Taylor, in 1873, <pb break="no"

                    range, watered by the Lynd, the Mitchell, the Walsh, and the Palmer Rivers, on
                    the east side of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The coasting expedition of Mr G.
                    Elphinstone Dalrymple, with Messrs Hill and Johnstone, finishing in December
                    1873, effected a valuable survey of the inlets and navigable rivers in the Cape
                    York peninsula. The Endeavour River, in S. lat. 16°, which was visited by
                    Captain Cook a hundred years ago, seems capable of being used for communication
                    with the country inland. A newly discovered river, the Johnstone or Gladys, is
                    said to flow through a very rich land, producing the finest cedars, with groves
                    of bananas, nutmeg, ginger, and other tropical plants. The colonial geologists
                    predict that the north-east corner of Australia will be found to possess great
                    mineral treasures. At the opposite extremity of the continent, its south-west
                    corner, a tour lately made by Mr A. Forrest, Government surveyor, from the Swan
                    River eastward, and thence down to the south coast, has shown the poorness of
                    that region. The vast superiority of eastern Australia to all the rest is the
                    most important practical lesson taught by the land-exploring labours of the last
                    half century.</p>

                    inlets from the sea, except upon its northern shores, where the coast line is
                    largely indented. The Gulf of Carpentaria, situated in the north, is enclosed on
                    the east by the projection of Cape York, and on the west by Arnhem Land, and
                    forms the principal bay on the whole coast, measuring about 6° of long, by 6° of
                    lat. Further to the west, Van Diemen’s Gulf, though much smaller, forms a better
                    protected bay, having Melville Island between it and the ocean; while beyond
                    this Queen’s Channel and Cambridge Gulf form inlets about S. lat. 14° 5O'. On
                    the north-west of the continent the coast line is much broken, the chief
                    indentations being Admiralty Gulf, Collier Bay, and King Sound, on the shores of
                    Tasman Land. Western Australia, again, is not favoured with many inlets—Exmouth
                    Gulf and Shark Bay being the only bays of any size. The same remark may be made
                    of the rest of the sea-board; for, "with the exception of Spencer Gulf, the Gulf
                    of St Vincent, and Port Phillip, on the south, and Moreton Bay, Hervey Bay, and
                    Broad Sound, in the east, the coast line is singularly uniform.</p>
                <p>The conformation of the interior of Australia is very peculiar, and may perhaps
                    be explained by the theory of the land having been, at a comparatively recent
                    period, the bed of an ocean. The mountain ranges parallel to the east and west
                    coasts would then have existed as the cliffs and uplands of many groups of
                    islands, in widely scattered archipelagoes resembling those of the Pacific. The
                    singular positions and courses of some of the rivers lend force to this
                    supposition. The Murray and its tributaries, the Murrumbidgee, the Lachlan, and
                    the Darling, rising from the mountains on the east coast, flow inwards so far
                    that they were at one time supposed to issue in a central sea. They do, in fact,
                    spend their waters in a large shallow lake; but this is not far from the south
                    coast, and is provided with an outlet to the ocean. The Macquarie and the
                    Lachlan merge in extensive swamps, and their beds in the dry season become a
                    mere chain of ponds. This agrees with the idea that the whole country was a
                    sea-bottom, which has scarcely yet assumed the character of permanent dry land,
                    while another proof consists in the thinness and sterility of the soil in the
                    lowlands.</p>
                <p>Along the entire line of the east coast there extends a succession of mountain
                    ranges from Portland, in Victoria, to Cape York in the extreme north, called in
                    different parts the Australian Grampians, the Australian Alps, the Blue
                    Mountains, the Liverpool Ranee, and other names. These constitute, like the
                    Andes of South America, a regular Cordillera, stretching from north to south
                    1700 miles in length, with an average height of 1500 feet above the sea. The
                    rivers flowing down the eastern slope, having but short courses before they
                    reach the sea, are of a more determined character than those which take a
                    westerly and inland direction. They cut their way through the sandstone rocks in
                    deep ravines; but from their tortuous and violent course, and from the
                    insufficient volume of water, they are unfit for navigation. Very few of them
                    traverse more than 200 miles, inclusive of windings, or pass through any
                    district extending more than 50 mües inland. It is different with the Murray,
                    flowing westward, which has a course of 1100 miles, traversing a space from east
                    to west measuring 8° of longitude. The Murray is navigable during eight months
                    of the year along a great part of its course. This great river, with its
                    tributaries, drains a basin the area of which is reckoned at half a million of
                    square miles. Yet it has no proper outlet to the sea, debouching into a lagoon
                    called Lake Alexandrina, on the sea-coast of Encounter Bay. On the opposite or
                    northwestern part of the continent there are several important water-courses.
                    One river, the Victoria, which rises somewhere about 18° or 19° S. lat. and 131°
                    E. long., flows northward to 15° 30' S. lat., where it turns westward. Its bed
                    forms a deep channel through the sandstone tableland, with cliffs 300 feet high,
                    while in width it sometimes extends to half a mile, its depth varying from 50
                    feet to as many fathoms. The Victoria debouches into Cambridge Gulf, 14° 14' S.
                    lat. and 129° 30' E. long., an estuary 20 miles broad, with a depth of 8 or 10
                    fathoms. To the westward of this district run two other large rivers, the Prince
                    Regent and the Glenelg, the latter being navigable, with a fertile country on
                    its banks. The Roper, a navigable stream in Arnhem Land, has a width of 500 to
                    800 yards 40 or 50 miles from its mouth, which is at the Limmen Bight in the
                    Gulf of Carpentaria. In the more settled and inhabited provinces of Australia
                    there are the Brisbane, the Fitzroy, and the Burdekin, rivers of Queensland; the
                    Glenelg River, of Victoria; and the Swan River, of West Australia. But this
                    continent cannot boast of a Nile, an Indus, or a Mississippi, and the interior
                    suffers from the want of water communication.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The interior plain of Australia, enclosed by the
                    coast mountain ranges, is a vast concave table of sandstone, with a surface area
                    of 1,500,000 square miles. The sedimentary rock, in some parts, has been washed
                    away or scooped out; but in the opinion of Mr W. H. L. Ranken <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dominion of Australia,</hi> 1874), the edges of the plateau, where highest and
                    least reduced by denudation, are actually formed of this sediment. While the
                    southern margin of the plain consists of walls of sandstone cliffs, extending
                    along the sea-coast, the plateau on the east, south-east, tho west, and partly
                    on the north, is bordered by terraced ramparts of mountains. These elevations
                    consist of granite and syenite on the west side, rising from 1000 to 3000 feet
                    in height. On the east side, in New South Wales and Gipps’ Land, they rise to a
                    much greater height, attaining 7000 feet at the south-east corner in the
                    Australian Alps. Here, too, the sandstone masses are often violently rent
                    asunder, and mingled with the overflows of igneous matter, forming basalt and
                    trap. On the north side of the continent, except around the Gulf of Carpentaria,
                    the edge of the sandstone table-land has a great elevation; it is cut by the
                    Alligator River into gorges 3800 feet deep.</p>
                <p>In examining more particularly the geological structure of eastern Australia, we
                    must take into account the neighbouring island of Tasmania. The late Count
                    Strzelecki, author of the first scientific essay upon the subject, in 1845;
                    after minutely describing all the mountain ranges of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n121/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0121-0108"/> New South Wales, passes on to Wilson Promontory,
                    the most southerly point of Australia, whence he looks seaward at the islands in
                    Bass’s Strait. As he there observes the Tasmanian mountains, with which he is
                    equally familiar, it occurs to him that the whole is the result of identical
                    forces, operating in a direction from north-east to south-west. Such phenomena
                    he ascribes to a series of “volcanoes of elevation,” along a vast fissure of the
                    earth, upon the line regarded by him as “the Australian eastern axis of
                    perturbation.” These forces he believes to have been exerted, with different
                    degrees of intensity, at four several epochs, which are indicated by the
                    character of the sedimentary rocks, broken through or contorted by the eruptive
                    greenstone and basalt. That eruptive action is seen in the ravines and
                    precipices of the Blue Mountains near Sydney; in the Grose valley, below Mount
                    Hay and its neighbours, Mount King George and Mount Tomah; but still more
                    remarkably in the mountains of Tasmania, viewed from Ben Lomond, within 30 miles
                    of Launceston. The sedimentary deposits of the first epoch are characterised by
                    the presence of mica slate, and of argillaceous and siliceous slate, as well as
                    by the absence of gneiss. Those of the second epoch are found to be arenaceous,
                    calcareous, or argillaceous stratified deposits. The third epoch includes the
                    coal deposits, with their intervening shales and sandstones, including many
                    fossils; while the fourth and last epoch is marked by the occurrence of elevated
                    peaks, and by the remains of land animals found in the limestone caves or in
                    alluvial deposits.</p>
                <p>The Rev. W. B. Clarke, of Sydney, again, in a revised treatise published in 1871,
                    expresses a doubt whether the southern range of mountains, extending to Wilson’s
                    Promontory, be really a continuation of the main Cordillera of New South Wales.
                    He rather considers this to be prolonged in a westerly direction, taking a bend
                    that way at the Warragong or Snowy Alps, and to be continued within 60 miles of
                    the border of South Australia, which is on the 141st meridian of E. long. The
                    subject is further discussed by Mr R. Brough Smith, of Melbourne, in his essay
                    of 1872 on the mineralogy and rock formations of Victoria. This geologist has
                    also remarked that the Murray, which must have repeatedly shifted its bed and
                    changed its outlet, may have once been a far more powerful stream, flooding a
                    vast tract of the interior, and thus becoming an effective agent in the
                    geological formations of all south-east Australia. It has produced, in Victoria
                    more especially, the Tertiary stratifications which are equivalent to the
                    Pliocene rocks of Europe.</p>
                <p>Throughout the whole of eastern Australia, including New South Wales and
                    Queensland, while no tertiary <hi rend="italic">marine</hi> deposits have been
                    found, there occur many remarkable beds of siliceous sandstone, bearing
                    impressions of ferns and leaves of trees, which are referred to the Tertiary
                    epoch.</p>
                <p>An interesting theory is advanced by Mr Clarke to account for the absence of
                    Tertiary deposits on the eastern coast, when they are found on the western and
                    southern coasts of Australia. In the islands of New Caledonia and other
                    Australasian groups, from the Louisiade, near New Guinea, to New Zealand, there
                    is a repetition of Australian geological formations, and there are abundant
                    Tertiary deposits; and this may confirm the supposition that the Australian
                    continent at some period extended farther to the east, and that a vast portion
                    has disappeared under the ocean. To the same hypothetical cause Mr Darwin
                    ascribes the formation of the Great Barrier Reef, stretching along the east
                    coast from S. lat. 22° 23' to Torres Strait, with an interval between it and the
                    land varying from 12 to 140 miles.</p>
                <p>With regard to the more remote geological epochs, Australia presents fewer
                    materials for study than the other continents of our globe. Mr Clarke doubts the
                    origin of some of the more ancient slates mentioned in the “first epoch” of
                    Count Strzelecki, and does not find, either in eastern or in southern Australia,
                    sufficient proof that these regions contain azoic and metamorphic rocks. Large
                    masses of granite occur along the coast, and more extensively in Western
                    Australia. Of the lower Palaeozoic there is a great deal of Upper Silurian rock
                    in New South Wales and Queensland, and some in Tasmania. It is in the Lower
                    Silurian formation, as Sir Roderick Murchison predicted, that gold deposits are
                    chiefly found. Rocks of the Devonian period are not yet proved to exist anywhere
                    in Australia, and it is doubtful if any true Permian or Trias, so common
                    elsewhere, have been met with in this continent. The great Carboniferous series
                    is very prominent in New South Wales and in parts of Queensland; it prevails
                    less in Victoria. Coal-beds, of thickness varying from 3 feet to 30 feet, are
                    found associated, both above and below, with fossils resembling those of the
                    Carboniferous strata in Ireland. Their antiquity is proved beyond question, in
                    some districts, as in the valley of the Hawkesbury, where they are overlaid with
                    beds of sandstone, shale, and conglomerate, 1000 feet thick. It has been shown
                    by Mr Daintree that there is a very extensive distribution of the Secondary or
                    Mesozoic rocks in Queensland—the Cretaceous strata, both there and in Western
                    Australia, covering a large area. The Oolitic are more abundant in Western
                    Australia.</p>
                <p>The great plains of the interior, and the slopes of the inner mountain ranges,
                    consist largely of deposits of the Tertiary epoch. They occupy an immense area
                    in Victoria and New South Wales, including the Riverina district, which was
                    probably, as Mr Brough Smith considers, levelled and planed down by the ancient
                    vast expansion of the Murray. “The waves of the sea,” he remarks, “and the
                    waters of this river, have eaten away mountains of granite and great hills of
                    schist in past times, and placed instead of them a smooth covering of sands and
                    clays.” The great basin east of Port Phillip, connected with another basin about
                    Westernport, is underlaid with Mesozoic carbonaceous rocks, upper Miocene, a
                    nodular basalt, and decomposed amygdaloid of older volcanic origin, the
                    quartzose drift of the first Pliocene formations, and some volcanic products of
                    more recent date. Here the Miocene beds abound with fossil leaves of plants
                    belonging to that age. The sands, clays, and gravels of later periods, in the
                    ancient beds of the streams within the Silurian areas, are more or less
                    auriferous. Some of the deeper “leads” of the gold-miner contain fossil fruits
                    and the trunks and branches of trees, which are described by Baron von Müller in
                    the Melbourne official reports of the mining surveyors. In the Ballarat
                    gold-fields the auriferous quartzose gravels are overlaid by flows of lava and
                    vesicular volcanic rocks, while in a neighbouring district south of Ballarat,
                    pebbles and sand are cemented by ferruginous matter into an extremely hard
                    conglomerate.</p>
                <p>In eastern Australia, where no Tertiary marine deposits are met with, there are
                    deep accumulations of drift, such as transmuted beds of the Carboniferous
                    formation, porphyry, and basalt, and other igneous rocks, and fragments of the
                    older Palaeozoic strata. Many of the drift streams are not only highly
                    auriferous, but contain gems of all kinds. Diamonds, though of small size, have
                    been taken from the Cudgegong River, near Mudgee, in New South Wales, and
                    likewise from the Macquarie River.</p>
                <p>In the eastern plains of the interior, embedded in black muddy trappean soil, are
                    found the bones of enormous animals of the marsupial or kangaroo order, as well
                    as birds, fishes, and reptiles. The accumulations of bones in caverns at
                    Wellington, New South Wales, and on the rivers Colo, Macleay, and Coodradigbee,
                    are of great interest.</p>

                <p>A femur bone of the dinornis, the gigantic extinct bird of New Zealand, has been
                    discovered in the drift on Peak Downs in eastern Australia, at the depth of 188
                    feet; and this would lead to the belief that land once existed where now the
                    Pacific Ocean separates by a thousand miles two countries of Australasia, whose
                    present animal and vegetable races have so little in common.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> The useful and precious metals exist in
                    considerable quantities in each of the five provinces of Australia. New South
                    Wales has abundance of gold, copper, iron, and coal, as well as silver, lead,
                    and tin. The mineral riches of Victoria, though almost confined to gold, have
                    been the main cause of her rapid progress. South Australia possesses the most
                    valuable copper mines. Queensland ranks next to the last-named province for
                    copper, and excels her neighbours in the production of tin, while gold, iron,
                    and coal are also found in considerable quantities. In Western Australia mines
                    of lead, silver, and copper have been opened; and there is much ironstone.</p>
                <p>The discovery of gold in New South Wales and Victoria took place in 1851, and
                    during the next twenty years Victoria exported 40,750,000 oz. of the precious
                    metal, while New South Wales, from 1851 to 1871, exported nearly 10,000,000
                    ounces. The Queensland gold mines, since 1860, have displayed increasing
                    promise; up to the end of 1872 they had yielded rather less than 1,000,000
                    ounces; but much was expected, at a more recent date, from the Palmer River and
                    other districts of the north. The yearly value of the aggregate gold exports of
                    Australia, on the average of fifteen years, has been £10,000,000. Victoria alone
                    has produced gold to the value of £170,000,000. The alluvial gold-fields, in
                    which the early diggers, with the simplest tools, obtained for a short time
                    large quantities of the coveted ore, seem now to be mostly exhausted. It is in
                    the quartz formations of the mountain ranges, or in those at a great depth
                    underground, reached by the sinking of shafts and regular mining operations,
                    that Australian gold is henceforth to be chiefly procured. There are mines in
                    Victoria 1000 feet deep, as at Clunes, and many others from 300 to 600 feet.</p>
                <p>The copper mines of Burra Burra, in South Australia, proved very profitable some
                    twenty-five years ago, yielding in a twelvemonth ore to the value of £350,000,
                    and the Moonta mines, in 1872, were scarcely less productive. The province of
                    South Australia, in that year, exported copper to the amount of £800,000.
                    Queensland, in 1873, produced one-fourth that quantity. Tin, an article of great
                    mercantile interest, is divided between Queensland and New South Wales in a
                    frontier district, two-thirds of the extent of which belongs to the Darling
                    Downs, within the last-mentioned province. There is a little tin, also, in some
                    parts of Victoria. Lead, silver, and cinnabar have been obtained not only in New
                    South Wales, but likewise in Western Australia.</p>
                <p>The abundance of good iron ore, in convenient vicinity to thick beds of excellent
                    coal, ensures a future career of manufacturing prosperity to New South Wales,
                    and not less to Queensland. The country north and south of Sydney, and west of
                    that city 100 miles inland to the diriding range of mountains, is all of
                    Carboniferous formation. At the mouth of the Hunter River, from the port and
                    town of Newcastle, coal was exported in 1873 to the value of £1,000,000
                    sterling. The collieries there taken up have an extent of 35,000 acres, but the
                    area of the coal-field is officially estimated at 10,000,000 acres, and the
                    seams are 9 feet to 11 feet thick. The quality of this coal is said to be equal
                    to that of Great Britain for most furnace purposes, and it is generally used by
                    steamships in the Pacific and Chinese navigation. Next in importance are the
                    Wollongong collieries, south of Sydney, and those of Hartley, Maitland, and
                    Berrima, now connected by railway with the capital.</p>
                <p>In each of the places above named there is iron of a superior quality, the
                    working of which to advantage cannot be long delayed. On the lllawarra coast it
                    is found close to the finest bituminous coal, and to limestone. The iron of New
                    South’Wales is mostly haematite, and the ironstone contains from 60 to 70 per
                    cent, of ore.</p>
                <p>Among other mineral products of the same region are cannel coal and shale
                    yielding kerosene oil. This is a recognised article of export from New South
                    Wales to the other colonies. It is hardly worth while to speak of diamonds,
                    opals, and precious stones, but they are often picked up, though of small size,
                    along the Mudgee and Abercrombie Rivers, and at Beechworth and Daylesford, in
                    Victoria.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate. —</hi> The Australian continent, extending over 28° of
                    latitude, might be expected to show a considerable diversity of climate. In
                    reality, however, it experiences fewer climatic variations than the other great
                    continents, owing to its distance (28°) from the Antarctic circle and (11°) from
                    the equator. There is, besides, a powerful determining cause in the uniform
                    character and undivided extent of its dry interior plain. On this subject Mr
                    Ranken, in his <hi rend="italic">Dominion of Australia,</hi> remarks—“A basin
                    haring its northern portion in the tropics, it acts like an oven under the daily
                    sun. It becomes daily heated; then its atmosphere expands; but such is its
                    immensity that no sufficient supply of moist sea air from the neighbouring
                    oceans can reach it, to supply the vacancy caused by this expansion. Of an
                    almost perfectly flat surface, there is no play for currents of air upon it;
                    only the heat is daily absorbed and nightly radiated. Such is the heat, that in
                    the summer the soil is more like a fire than an oven; the air, if it moves, is
                    like a furnace-blast; and such its extent and sameness, that as great heat may
                    prevail hundreds of miles south as north of the tropics.” This continual
                    radiation of heat is sometimes relieved—though not with the regularity of an
                    annual season, indeed rather at uncertain intervals of several years—by the
                    admission of masses of vapour, drawn in from the Pacific or the Indian Ocean.
                    Great masses of clouds, after labouring many months to reach the interior from
                    the sea, succeed in passing over the sea-bound mountains, and spread themselves
                    in floods of rain upon the inland country. The north-west shore, and that of
                    Carpentaria, are favoured with an annual visitation of the monsoons, from
                    December to March, penetrating as far as 500 miles into the continent, where the
                    sands of the desert are driven in wavy heaps by the force of this wind. But
                    South Australia, though it feels a cool sea breeze from the south-west, gets
                    little rain, for lack of any mountain range parallel with the coast to arrest
                    and condense the passing vapours. The yearly rainfall at Adelaide and Gawler is
                    therefore not more than 15 or 20 inches, while at the head of Spencer Gulf it is
                    but 6 or 8. In Victoria and in New South Wales, on the contrary, where a wall of
                    mountain fronts the ocean, most places on the sea-board enjoy a fair allowance
                    of rain. It is 32 inches at Portland, nearly 26 inches at Melbourne; at Sydney
                    and Newcastle, on the east coast, as much as 48 and 44 inches in the year. But
                    at Brisbane, in Queensland, farther north, it amounts to 50 inches; at
                    Rockingham Bay, in latitude 18’ S., where the hills are covered with dense
                    forests, the rainfall in 1871 was no less than 90 inches. In every part,
                    however, of this magnificent highland region, the supply of moisture is rapidly
                    diminished by passing inland; so that very little remains to fall on the
                    interior or western slopes of the coast ranges, and to irrigate the interior
                    plains.</p>
                <p>With regard to the temperature, the northern regions of the continent being
                    situated within the tropic of Capricorn, <pb break="no"

                    Africa, that are situated in corresponding latitudes. The seaward districts of
                    New South Wales seem in this respect to be like Southern Europe. The mean annual
                    temperature of Sydney is 62° 4' Fahr., almost equal to that of Lisbon in
                    Portugal. The inland plains of this colony, however, west of the Blue Mountains,
                    which suffer much from evaporation, experience in summer a heat which rises to
                    100° Fahr, in the shade, and sometimes as high as 140°. There are highland
                    districts, on the contrary, such as Kiandra, 4640 feet above the sea-level,
                    where frost, snow, and hail are endured through the winter. On the Australian
                    Alps, cold being more intense in the dry air, the limit of perpetual snow comes
                    down to 7145 feet. The days on which rain falls in the coast regions of New
                    South Wales average from 100 to 150 in the year, and the amount from 20 inches
                    to 50 inches, decreasing generally farther inland.</p>
                <p>In winter, in New South Wales, the prevalent winds blow from the west, with
                    occasional storms of wind and rain from the eastward; while the autumn months
                    have much cloudy weather, not accompanied by rain. January and February are the
                    hottest months of summer, and July the coldest month of winter.</p>
                <p>With regard to the climate of Victoria, Mr Robert Ellery, Government astronomer
                    at Melbourne, in his report of 1872, furnishes exact information. The mean
                    annual temperature at Melbourne during fourteen years was 57 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0-</hi> 6, and that of the whole province 56 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0-</hi> 8, including stations 2000 feet or 1400 feet above
                    the sea-level at Daylesford and Ballarat. This is equivalent to the mean annual
                    temperature of Marseilles and Florence, in the northern hemisphere, but the
                    climate of Melbourne is much more equable than that of the Méditerranean shores.
                    The lowest temperature yet recorded has been 27°, or 5° below the freezing
                    point; the highest, lll <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> in the shade, occurring
                    during one of the hot winds, called “brickfielders,” which, loaded with dust,
                    occasionally blow for a few hours in summer. At Sandhurst, 778 feet above the
                    sea, the greatest extremes of temperature yet observed were 117° and 27°'5; at
                    Ballarat the extreme of winter cold was 10° below freezing.</p>
                <p>The amount of humidity in the air is liable to great and rapid variations in the
                    summer months. It is sometimes reduced as much as 60 per cent, within a few
                    hours, by the effect of hot dry winds. But this is compensated by an access of
                    moisture upon a change of wind. The annual average rainfall at Melbourne, which
                    for thirty years is stated at 25 ’ 66 inches, does not seem less than that of
                    places in similar latitudes in other parts of the world. Yet it proves
                    inadequate, because of the great amount of evaporation, estimated by Professor
                    Neumayer at 42 inches.</p>
                <p>The spring season in Victoria, consisting of the months of September, October,
                    and November, is genial and pleasant, with some rain. The summer—December,
                    January, and February—is generally hot and dry, though its first month is
                    sometimes broken by storms of cold wind and heavy rain. In February the north
                    winds assume the character of siroccos, and bush-fires often devastate the
                    grassy plains and forests of the inland country. The autumn months—March, April,
                    and May—are, in general, the most agreeable; and at this season vegetable life
                    is refreshed, and puts forth a growth equal to that of the spring. The winter is
                    June, July, and August, with strong, dry, cold winds from the north, alternating
                    with frequent rain from the opposite quarter; there is little ice or snow,
                    except in the mountain districts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Botany.—</hi> A probable computation of the whole number of
                    distinct vegetable species indigenous to Australia and Tasmania has been made by
                    Baron Ferdinand von Müller, the Government botanist at Melbourne. He believes
                    that, omitting the minute fungi, there will not be found above 10,000 species of
                    Australian plants. The standard authority upon this subject, so far as it could
                    be known sixty years ago, but now requiring to be completed and extended, was
                    the <hi rend="italic">Prodromus</hi><hi rend="italic">Florae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Novoellollandioe,</hi> published in 1810 by Mr Robert Brown of the
                    British Museum. Besides making personal observations from 1802 to 1805, he had
                    classified the collections procured by Sir Joseph Banks when Captain Cook’s ship
                    visited the eastern shore. Upon that occasion, in 1769, the name of Botany Bay
                    was given to an inlet near Port Jackson, from the variety of new specimens found
                    there. Baron von Müller’s Report of 1857 on the researches made by him alone in
                    the North Australian exploring expedition under Mr Gregory, exhibits 2000 new
                    species, representing more than 800 genera, which belong to 160 different
                    orders. He could discover no new natural order, or fundamental form of the
                    vegetable kingdom, in a minute examination of the flora of Arnhem Land, the
                    country around the Gulf of Carpentaria, and the Victoria River, but 60 genera
                    were found that had not been noticed by any earlier Australian botanist.</p>
                <p>The eastern parts of this continent, New South Wales and Queensland, are very
                    much richer, both in their botany and in their zoology, than any other parts of
                    Australia. Much was done here for the former science, half a century ago, by Mr
                    Allan Cunningham, whose monumental obelisk fitly stands in the Botanic Garden at
                    Sydney. In general, the growth of trees on the north and north-west coasts is
                    wanting in size and regularity, compared with their growth in eastern Australia.
                    To the last-mentioned region, for instance, the pines are entirely confined;
                    here the Moreton Bay pine, and Bunya Bunya pine, of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Araucaria,</hi> growing to 150 feet in height, yield excellent timber. The red
                    cedar, the iron bark, the blue gum-tree, and others useful to the carpenter,
                    belong likewise to the eastern highlands. The <hi rend="italic">Casuarina,</hi>
                    or she-oak, is found on the shores of Carpentaria and in the interior, but not
                    on the banks of the Victoria River to the north-west. Of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eucalyptus,</hi> or gum-tree, Australia has 400 species; but the one most
                    uniformly distributed is the <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >rostrata</hi> or <hi rend="italic">acuminata,</hi> called the flooded gum-tree;
                    its timber is durable, and takes a fine polish. Rosewood, tulip-wood,
                    sandal-wood, and satin-wood, with other materials for the cabinetmaker’s
                    ornamental work, abound in the forests of Queensland. The forest scenery of the
                    more northerly districts, within the tropics, and onwards to Rockingham Bay, is
                    described as of great luxuriance. It consists of many kinds of large umbrageous
                    trees, some of an Indian type, intermixed with noble araucarias, all matted
                    together in an impervious thicket by lianes of the convolvulus, the calamus, and
                    other plants, climbing or pendent, harbouring in their shade many parasitical
                    orchids and ferns. Such forests overhang the seaward sides of the mountain
                    ranges, where they inhale abundant moisture from the winds of the Pacific Ocean,
                    and feed upon a congenial soil from the decomposition of schistose rocks.</p>
                <p>A striking contrast is offered to the view beyond the coast ranges. The interior
                    of Queensland presents either highland downs of basaltic origin, almost bare of
                    trees, but with abundant herbaceous vegetation, good pasture grass, and an
                    immense quantity of vervain, or the Brigalow scrub, merely shrubs and small
                    trees, on a soil of argillaceous sandstone. The sandstone table-lands, again,
                    naked and dry, produce but a few diminutive eucalypti, and sparse tufts of
                    uneatable grasses, while the inland deserts have only the acacia to break the
                    monotony of the scene. The character of the inland flora adds confirmation to
                    the belief that the interior was formerly a marine soil, -which <pb break="no"

                    properties. In the districts farthest removed from the action of fresh water,
                    hundreds of miles are covered with such plants as will grow on the sea-shore,
                    e.y., the mesembryanthemum called pig’s face or Hottentot fig. Other species
                    belonging to the coastward uplands seem to have been conveyed into the interior
                    by the action of water, as the belts of timber, and of pine or cypress scrub,
                    are always found to extend along the line of direction taken by floods. They
                    grow on sandy ridges, alongside of hollows, or depressed channels. On the north
                    coast, so much of which is flat, and often swampy or sandy, the mangrove
                    flourishes as in other tropical regions.</p>
                <p>From the extreme aridity of the climate in most parts of northern Australia,
                    there is a singular absence of mosses and lichens. North-west Australia
                    possesses, in <hi rend="italic">the Adan-sonia Gτegorii,</hi> or gouty-stem
                    tree, a counterpart of the West African baobab, or monkey-bread tree. It is
                    worthy of remark that, with a few exceptions, the Australian trees are
                    evergreens. They also show a peculiar reverted position of their leaves, which
                    hang vertically, turning their edges instead of their sides towards the sun; and
                    the eucalypti have the peculiarity of shedding their bark annually instead of
                    their leaves. In Australia the native species of lily, tulip, and
                    honeysuckle-appear as standard trees of considerable size. The native grasses do
                    not form a continuous and even greensward, as in Europe, but grow in detached
                    clumps or tufts. None of the cereal plants are indigenous, and very few of the
                    fruits or roots that supply human food; but many Australian plants are likely to
                    be valuable for medicinal or chemical manufactures.</p>
                <p>This continent, as might be expected, has some of the same botanical families
                    that occupy South Africa, Polynesia, and South America. Its relations in that
                    respect to Europe are shown by Alphonse de Candolle’s tabular statements in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Géographie Botanique Raisonnée.</hi> He gives the exact number
                    of species common to Australia and to France in each of the principal families
                    or natural orders. It appears that of 3614 species of phanerogamic plants in
                    France, only 45 belong to Australia. But it will be sufficient, without citing
                    the numerical details, to quote Baron von Müller’s list of the natural orders
                    having the moβt numerous species of indigenous growth in South Australia. They
                    are here arranged in succession, according to their comparative amounts of
                    specific diversity, those which have the greatest number of species being
                    mentioned first. Of the phanerogamic series, the leguminous and the composite
                    families united form nearly one-fourth. Indeed, the half of the dicotyledonous
                    plants, or exogens, that exist in the sub-tropical districts belong to these two
                    orders. Next come the myrtaceous plants, the ferns, and the grasses; the
                    Proteaceae, which form a conspicuous feature of Australian botany; the
                    Orchidaceae, the epacrid family, and the parsley family, or Umbelliferae; the
                    Diosmeae, a sub-order of the Rutaceae or rue family; the Liliaceae, the Labiataa
                    or mint family, the Goodeniae, the Scrophulariaceae or figworts, and the
                    Salsolaceøe. The Ranunculaceae, the geranium family, the rosaceous plants, and
                    the epacrid group, are not found in Australia north of the tropical line.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Animals.—</hi> The zoology of Australia and Tasmania presents a
                    very conspicuous point of difference from that of other regions of the globe, in
                    the prevalence of non-placental mammalia. The vast majority of the mammalia are
                    provided with an organ in the uterus, by which, before the birth of their young,
                    a vascular connection is maintained between the embryo and the parent animal.
                    There are two orders, the Marsupialia and the Monotremata, which do not possess
                    this organ. Both these are found in Australia, to which region indeed they are
                    not absolutely confined; but the marsupials alone constitute two-thirds of all
                    the Australian species of mammals. It is the well-known peculiarity of this
                    order that the female has a pouch or fold of skin upon her abdomen, in which she
                    can place the young for suckling within reach of her teats. The opossum of
                    America is the only species out of Australasia which is thus provided. Australia
                    is inhabited by at least 110 different species of marsupials, which have been
                    arranged in five tribes, according to the food they eat, viz., the rooteaters
                    (wombats), the fruit-eaters (phalangers), the grasseaters (kangaroos), the
                    insect-eaters (bandicoots), and the flesh-eaters (native cats and rats). Of
                    these tribes the wombats are closely allied to the phalangers, represented by
                    the opossums and flying squirrels, with the native bear, while fossil remains of
                    twenty extinct species have also been found. Of wombats now existing there are
                    four species, all of nearly the same size, seldom exceeding 100 lb in weight.
                    They all burrow in the ground, and their habitat is in New South Wales,
                    Tasmania, and South Australia. There is but one species of the singular animal
                    miscalled the native bear, which is more like a sloth in its habits. Three
                    varieties of brush-tailed opossum are found, but one of them exists only in
                    Tasmania; and there are three ringtailed varieties in almost every part of
                    Australia. The great flying phalanger (Petaurista) is nearly allied to the
                    last-mentioned genus; it exists only in East Australia; as does the small flying
                    phalanger (Belideus), which is restricted to mountain districts. The interior of
                    Australia and the west coast are wanting in these species, but two or three of
                    them occur on the north coast. The smallest phalanger <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Acrobata pygmced)</hi> is less than a mouse, and has a feathery tail. The
                    little <hi rend="italic">Tarsipes</hi><hi rend="italic">rostratus</hi> is almost
                    toothless, but has a long hairy tongue, which it thrusts into flowers to suck
                    their sweetness.</p>
                <p>The kangaroo (Macropus) and most of its congeners show an extraordinary
                    disproportion of the hind limbs to the fore part of the body. The rock wallabies
                    again have short tarsi of the hind legs, with a long pliable tail for climbing,
                    like that of the tree kangaroo of New Guinea, or that of the jerboa. Of the
                    larger kangaroos, which attain a weight of 200 lb and more, eight species are
                    named, only one of which is found in West Australia. There are some twenty
                    smaller species in Australia and Tasmania, besides the rock wallabies and the
                    hare kangaroos; these last are wonderfully swift, making clear jumps eight or
                    ten feet high. To this agility they owe their preservation from the prairie
                    fires, which are so destructive in the interior during seasons of drought. In
                    the rat kangaroo there is not the same disproportion of the limbs; it approaches
                    more nearly to the bandicoot, of which seven species exist, from the size of a
                    rat to that of a rabbit. The carnivorous tribe of marsupials, the larger species
                    at any rate, belong more to Tasmania, which has its “tiger” and its “devil.” But
                    the native cat, or dasyurus, is common to every part of Australia. Several
                    different species of pouched rats and mice, one or two living in trees, are
                    reckoned among the flesh-eaters. Fossil bones of extinct kangaroo species are
                    met with, which must have been of enormous size, twice or thrice that of any
                    species now living.</p>
                <p>We pass on to the other curious order of non-placental mammals, that of the
                    Monotremata, so called from the structure of their organs of evacuation with a
                    single orifice, as in birds. Their abdominal bones are like those of the
                    marsupials; and they are furnished with pouches for their young, but have no
                    teats, the milk being distilled into their pouches from the mammary glands.
                    Australia and Tasmania possess two animals of this order,—the echidna, or spiny
                    ant-eater (hairy in Tasmania), and the <hi rend="italic">Platypus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">anatinus,</hi> the duck-billed water-mole, otherwise named the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ornithorhynchus paradoxus.</hi> This odd animal is provided <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n125/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0125-0112"/> with a bill or beak, which is not, like that of a
                    bird, affixed to the skeleton, but is merely attached to the skin and
                    muscles.</p>
                <p>Australia has no apes, monkeys, or baboons, and no ruminant beasts. The
                    comparatively few indigenous placental mammals, besides the dingo, or wild
                    dog—which, however, may have come from the islands north of this continent— are
                    of the bat tribe and of the rodent or rat tribe. There are four species of large
                    fruit-eating bats, called flying foxes, twenty of insect-eating bats, above
                    twenty of land-rats, and five of water-rats. The sea produces three' different
                    seals, which often ascend rivers from the coast, and can live in lagoons of
                    fresh water; many cetaceans, besides the “right whale” and sperm whale; and the
                    dugong, found on the northern shores, which yields a valuable medicinal oil.</p>
                <p>The birds of Australia in their number and variety of species (reckoned at 690)
                    may be deemed some compensation for its poverty of mammals <hi rend="italic">;
                    yet</hi> it will not stand comparison in this respect with regions of Africa and
                    South America in the same latitudes. The black swan of West Australia was
                    thought remarkable when discovered as belying an old Latin proverb. There is
                    also a white eagle. The vulture is wanting. Sixty species of parrots, some of
                    them very handsome, are found in Australia. The emu, a large bird of the order
                    Cursores, or runners, corresponds with the African and Arabian ostrich, the rhea
                    of South America, and the cassowary of the' Moluccas and New Guinea. In New
                    Zealand this order is represented by the apteryx, as it formerly was by the
                    gigantic moa, the remains of which have been found likewise in Queensland. Of
                    the βame species as the birds of paradise is the graceful <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moenura</hi><hi rend="italic">superba,</hi> or lyre bird, with its tail
                    feathers spread in the shape of a lyre. The mound-raising megapodes, the
                    bowerbuilding satin-birds, and several others, display peculiar habits. The
                    honey-eaters present a great diversity of plumage. There are also many kinds of
                    game birds, pigeons, ducks, geese, plovers, and quails.</p>
                <p>The ornithology of New South Wales and Queensland is more varied and interesting
                    than that of the other provinces.</p>
                <p>As for reptiles, Australia has a few tortoises, all of one family, and not of
                    great size. The “leathery turtle,” which is herbivorous, and.yields abundance of
                    oil, has been caught at sea off the Illawarra coast so large as 9 feet in
                    length. The saurians or lizards are numerous, chiefly on dry sandy or rocky
                    ground in the tropical region. The great crocodile of Queensland is 30 feet
                    long; there is a smaller one, 6 feet long, to be met with in the shallow lagoons
                    of the interior. The monitor, or fork-tongued lizard, which burrows in the
                    earth, climbs, and swims, is said to grow to a length of 8 or 9 feet. This
                    species, and many others, do not extend to Tasmania. There are about twenty
                    kinds of night-lizards, and many which hibernate. One species can utter a cry
                    when pained or alarmed, and the tall-standing frilled lizard can lift its
                    forelegs, and squat or hop like a kangaroo. There is also the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moloch</hi><hi rend="italic">horridus</hi> of South and West Australia, covered
                    with tubercles bearing large spines, which give it a very strange aspect. This
                    and some other lizards have power to change their colour, not only from light to
                    dark, but in some parts from yellow to grey or red. Dr Gray, of the British
                    Museum, has described fifty species of Australian lizard.</p>
                <p>The snakes are reckoned at sixty-three species, of which forty-two are venomous,
                    but only five dangerous. North Queensland has many harmless pythons. There are
                    forty or fifty different sorts of frogs; the commonest is distinguished by its
                    blue legs and bronze or gold back; the largest is bright green; while the
                    tree-frog has a loud shrill voice, always heard during rain.</p>
                <p>The Australian seas and rivers are inhabited by many fishes of the same genera as
                    exist in the southern parts of Asia and Africa. Of those peculiar to Australian
                    waters may be mentioned the arripis, represented by what is called among the
                    colonists a salmon trout. A very fine freshwater fish is the Murray cod, which
                    sometimes weighs 100 lb; and the golden perch, found in the same river, has rare
                    beauty of colour. Among the sea fish, the snapper is of great value as an
                    article of food, and its weight comes up to 50 lb. This is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pagrus</hi><hi rend="italic">unicolor,</hi> of the family of Sparidae, which
                    includes also the bream. Its colours are beautiful, pink and red with a silvery
                    gloss; but the male as it grows old takes on a singular deformity of the head,
                    with a swelling in the shape of a monstrous human-like nose. These fish are
                    caught in numbers outside Port Jackson for the Sydney market. Two species of
                    mackerel, differing somewhat from the European species, are also caught on the
                    coasts. The so-called red garnet, a pretty fish, with hues of carmine and blue
                    stripes on its head, is much esteemed for the table. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trigla polyommata,</hi> or flying garnet, is a greater beauty, with its body of
                    crimson and silver, and its large pectoral fins, spread like wings, of a rich
                    green, bordered with purple, and relieved by a black and white spot. Whiting,
                    mullet, gar-fish, rock cod, and many others known by local names, are in the
                    lists of edible fishes belonging to New South Wales and Victoria. Much
                    interesting and valuable information upon Australian zoology will be found in a
                    recent essay by Mr Gerard Krefft, curator and secretary of the museum at Sydney,
                    and in the Count de Castelnau’s report on the fishes of Victoria at the
                    International Exhibition of 1873.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Aborigines.—</hi> The Papuan, Melanesian, or Australasian
                    aborigines exhibit certain peculiarities which are not found in the African
                    negro, to which race they otherwise present some similarity. In the Australasian
                    the forehead is higher, the under jaw less projecting, the nose, though flat and
                    extended compared with that of the European, is less depressed than in the
                    African. His lips are thick, but not protuberant; and the eyes are sunken,
                    large, and black. The colour of his skin is lighter—of a dusky hue—than that of
                    the Negro. In stature he equals the average European, but tall men are rare,
                    except in North Queensland; his body and limbs are well shaped, strongly
                    jointed, and highly muscular. The hind parts are not, as in the African,
                    excessively raised; and while the calf of the leg is deficient, the heel is
                    straight. The natives of Papua have woolly spirally-twisted hair. Those of
                    Tasmania, now exterminated, had the same peculiarity. But the natives of the
                    Australian continent have straight or curly black hair. The men wear short
                    beards and whiskers.</p>
                <p>Their mental faculties, though probably inferior to those of the Polynesian
                    copper-coloured race, are not contemptible. They have much acuteness of
                    perception for the relations of individual objects, but little power of
                    generalisation. No word exists in their language for the general terms tree,
                    bird, or fish; yet they have invented a name for every species of vegetable and
                    animal they know. The grammatical structure of some North Australian languages
                    has a considerable degree of refinement. The verb presents a variety of
                    conjugations, expressing nearly all the moods and tenses of the Greek. There is
                    a dual, as well as a plural form in the declension of verbs, nouns, pronouns,
                    and adjectives. The distinction of genders is not marked, except in proper names
                    of men and women. All parts of speech, except adverbs, are declined by termi
                    national inflections. There are words for the elementary numbers, one, two,
                    three; but “four” is usually expressed by “two-two;” then “five” by “two-three,”
                    and so on. They have no idea of decimals. The number and diversity of separate
                    languages, not mere dialects, is truly bewildering. Tribes of a few hundred
                    people, living within a few <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n126/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0126-0113"/> miles of each other, have often scarcely a phrase
                    in common. This is more especially observed in New South Wales, a country much
                    intersected by dividing mountain ranges. But one language is spoken all along
                    the Rivers Murray and Darling, while the next neighbours of the Murray tribes,
                    on both sides, are unable to converse with them.</p>
                <p>It is, nevertheless, tolerably certain that all the natives of Australia belong
                    to one stock. There appears reason to believe that their progenitors originally
                    landed on the north-west coast, that of Cambridge Gulf or Arnhem Land, in canoes
                    drifting from the island of Timor. They seem then to have advanced over the
                    continent in three separate directions. By one route they moved, in the course
                    of ages, directly across to the south coast, near the head of the Great Bight,
                    Spencer Gulf, and the Gulf of St Vincent. Another division followed the west
                    coast to Swan River, and round by King George’s Sound. The third and most
                    important body, turning eastward, crossed the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria,
                    then split and subdivided itself amidst the rivers and highland ranges of
                    Queensland, while some of its tribes crossing the Upper Darling occupied New
                    South Wales, overspread the Riverina, and peopled the south-eastern quarter of
                    Australia. The proofs and arguments upon which this hypothetical distribution is
                    based are set forth by Mr Eyre in his interesting essay on the Australian
                    aborigines <hi rend="italic">(Discoveries in Central Australia,</hi> Ac., by E.
                    J. Eyre, resident magistrate, Murray River, vol. ii) It is chiefly the
                    prevalence of some peculiar customs, such as circumcision, or the removal of two
                    upper-jaw teeth at a stated age of adolescence, that seems to mark the common
                    descent of tribes, now widely distant in location, which appear to have belonged
                    to one of the supposed main streams of population. The discontinuance of such
                    customs among the tribes of the other main divisions is plausibly ascribed to
                    local influences. From a comparison of their languages, the diversities of which
                    have been already referred to, it appears that little aid is to be expected from
                    them in ethnological grouping.</p>
                <p>The natives of the north-eastern quarter—a tropical region of diversified
                    surface, with many rivers and thick forests, as well as open highlands—are far
                    superior in body, mind, and social habits to those of the rest of Australia.
                    They bear, in fact, most resemblance to their rfeighbours and kindred in the
                    island of New Guinea, but are still below these in many important respects.</p>
                <p>If a general view be taken of the tribes of Australia, and the state in which
                    they existed independently of recent European intercourse, two or three
                    extraordinary defects exhibit themselves. They never, in any situation,
                    cultivated the soil for any kind of food-crop. They never reared any kind of
                    cattle, or kept any domesticated animal except the dog, which probably came over
                    with them in their canoes. They have nowhere built permanent dwellings, but
                    contented themselves with mere hovels for temporary shelter. They have neither
                    manufactured nor possessed any chattels beyond such articles of clothing,
                    weapons, ornaments, and utensils as they might carry on their persons, or in the
                    family store-bag for daily use. Their want of ingenuity and contrivance has,
                    however, undoubtedly been promoted by the natural poverty of the land in which
                    the race settled.</p>
                <p>The sole dress of both sexes in their aboriginal state is a cloak of skin or
                    matting, fastened with a skewer, but open on the right-hand side. No headgear is
                    worn, except sometimes a net to confine the hair, a bunch of feathers, or the
                    tails of small animals. The bosom or back is usually tattoed, or rather scored
                    with rows of hideous raised scars, produced by deep gashes at the age when youth
                    comes to manhood or womanhood. Their dwellings, for the most part, are either
                    bowers, formed of the branches of trees, or hovels of piled logs, loosely
                    covered with grass or bark, which they can erect in an hour, wherever they
                    encamp. But some huts of a more commodious and substantial form were seen by
                    Flinders on the south-east coast in 1799, and by Captain King and Sir J.
                    IMitchell on the north-east, where they no longer appear. The ingenuity of the
                    race is mostly to be recognised in the manufacture of their weapons of warfare
                    and the chase. While the use of the bow and arrow does not seem to have occurred
                    to them, the spear and axe are in general use, commonly made of hard-wood; the
                    hatchets of stone, and the javelins pointed with stone or bone. The peculiar
                    weapon of the Australian is the boomerang, a curved blade of wood, of such
                    remarkable construction, that it swerves from its direct course, sometimes
                    returning so as to hit an object behind the thrower. Their nets, made by women,
                    either of the tendons of animals or the fibres of plants, will catch and hold
                    the strong kangaroo or the emu, or the very large fish of Australian rivers.
                    Canoes of bent bark, for the inland waters, are hastily prepared at need; but
                    the inlets and straits of the north-eastern sea-coast are navigated by larger
                    canoes and rafts of a better construction.</p>
                <p>Without claiming permanent ownership of the land, each native tribe was
                    accustomed, till the English squatter came, to enjoy the recognised manorial
                    dominion of its own hunting-ground, perhaps ten or twelve miles square. This was
                    subdivided between the chief heads of families. The affairs of a tribe are ruled
                    by a council of the men past middle age who are still in full vigour of mind and
                    body. One may be their president, but they have no hereditary prince. Their most
                    solemn assemblies take place when the youth undergo one or other of the painful
                    ceremonies of initiation into manhood. In every case of death from disease or
                    unknown causes the sorcerers hold a public inquest, and pretend to ask the
                    corpse how it was killed. Such deaths are invariably ascribed to witchcraft
                    practised by a hostile or envious neighbouring tribe. The bodies of the slain in
                    battle are sometimes eaten, or the fat of the kidneys, at least, is extracted
                    for a feast of victory. But cannibalism in Australia is not confined to the
                    flesh of enemies, nor is it generally associated with an insulting triumph. It
                    is rather, like that reported of the ancient Scytl1ian3, a rite of funeral
                    observance, in honour of deceased kindred and friends. The reality of this
                    custom is proved by the testimony of trustworthy English witnesses, who have
                    watched the revolting act. The only idea of a god known to be entertained by
                    these people, is that of Buddai, a gigantic old man lying asleep for ages, with
                    his head resting upon his arm, which is deep in the sand. He is expected one day
                    to awake and eat up the world. They have no religion beyond those gloomy dreams.
                    Their notions of duty relate mostly to neighbourly service and social interest;
                    and they are not all thieves or liars, but are capable of many good deeds. The
                    marriage bond is observed by the wife or wives, the penalty of its violation
                    being death. But chastity upon any other account is a virtue beyond the native
                    conception, though a certain delicacy of feeling in matters of sex is not
                    unknown. The deplorable lack of moral restraint has involved this unhappy race
                    in sufferings which may be easily understood, from their contact with the more
                    reckless and vicious representatives of foreign nations.</p>
                <p>The numbers of the native Australians are steadily diminishing. A remnant of the
                    race exists in each of the provinces, while a few tribes still wander over the
                    interior. Altogether it is computed that not more than about 80,000 aborigines
                    remain on the continent.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most complete and trustworthy information on the Australian race is
                    to be found in works published some twenty or thirty years ago, before the
                    country <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n127/mode/1up"

                    settler. Mr Eyre’s work above referred to, and Captain (afterwards Sir George)
                    Grey’s <hi rend="italic">Discoveries in North-JΓest and 11 estern

                <p><hi rend="italic">Colonial History.—</hi> Of the five Australian provinces, that
                    of New South Wales may be reckoned the oldest. It was in 1788, eighteen years
                    after Captain Cook explored the east coast, that Port Jackson was founded as a
                    penal station for criminals from England; and the settlement retained that
                    character, more or less, during the subsequent fifty years, transportation being
                    virtually suspended in 1839. The colony, however, from 1821 had made a fair
                    start in free industrial progress.</p>
                <p>By this time, too, several of the other provinces had come into existence. Van
                    Diemen’s Land, now called Tasmania, had been occupied as early as 1803. It was
                    an auxiliary penal station under New South Wales, till in 1825 it became a
                    separate province. From this island, ten years later, parties crossed Bass’s
                    Straits to Port Phillip, where a new settlement was shortly established, forming
                    till 1851 a part of New South Wales, but now the richer and more populous colony
                    of Victoria. In 1827 and 1829, an English company endeavoured to plant a
                    settlement at the Swan River, and this, added to a small convict station
                    established in 1825 at King George’s Sound, constituted Western Australia. On
                    the shores of the Gulf St Vincent, again, from 1835 to 1837, South Australia was
                    created by another joint-stock company, as an experiment in the Wakefield scheme
                    of colonisation.</p>
                <p>Such were the political component parts of British Australia up to 1839. The
                    earlier history, therefore, of New South Wales is peculiar to itself. Unlike the
                    other mainland provinces, it was at first held and used chiefly for the
                    reception of British convicts. When that system was abolished, the social
                    conditions of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia became more equal.
                    Previous to the gold discoveries of 1851 they may be included, from 1839, in a
                    general summary view.</p>
                <p>The first British governors at Sydney, from 1788, ruled with despotic power. They
                    were naval or military officers in command of the garrison, the convicts, and
                    the few free settlers The duty was performed by such men as Captain Arthur
                    Phillip, Captain Hunter, and others. In the twelve years’ rule of General
                    Macquarie, closing with 1821, the colony made a substantial advance. By means of
                    convict labour roads and bridges were constructed, and a route opened into the
                    interior beyond the Blue Mountains. A population of 30,000, three-fourths of
                    them convicts, formed the infant commonwealth, whose attention was soon directed
                    to the profitable trade of rearing fine wool sheep, first commenced by Mr John
                    M‘Arthur in 1803.</p>
                <p>During the next ten years, 1821-31, Sir Thomas Brisbane and Sir Ralph Darling,
                    two generals of the army, being successively governors, the colony increased,
                    and eventually succeeded in obtaining the advantages of a representative
                    institution, by means of a legislative council. Then came General Sir Richard
                    Bourke, whose wise and liberal administration proved most beneficial. New South
                    Wales became prosperous and attractive to emigrants with capital. Its
                    enterprising ambition was encouraged by taking fresh country north and south. In
                    the latter direction, explored by ΔIitchell in 1834 and 1836, lay Australia
                    Felix, now Victoria, including the well-watered, thickly-wooded country of
                    Gipps’ Land.</p>
                <p>This district, then called Port Phillip, in the time of Governor Sir George
                    Gipps, 1838 to 1846, was growing fast into a position claiming independence.
                    Melbourne, which began with a few huts on the banks of the Yarra-Yarra in 1835,
                    was in 1840 a busy town of 6000 inhabitants, the population of the whole
                    district, with the towns of Geelong and Portland, reaching 12,850; while its
                    import trade amounted to £204,000, and its exports to £138,000. Such was the
                    growth of infant Victoria in five years; that of Adelaide or South Australia, in
                    the same period, was nearly equal to it. At Melbourne there was a deputy
                    governor, Mr Latrobe, under Sir George Gipps at Sydney. Adelaide had its own
                    governors, first Captain Hindmarsh, next Colonel Gawler, and then Captain George
                    Grey. Western Australia progressed but slowly, with less than 4000 inhabitants
                    altogether, under Governors Stirling and Hutt.</p>
                <p>The general advancement of Australia, to the era of the gold-mining, had been
                    satisfactory, in spite of a severe commercial crisis, from 1841 to 1843, caused
                    by extravagant land speculations and inflated prices. Victoria produced already
                    more wool than New South Wales, the aggregate produce of Australia in 1852 being
                    45,000,000 lb; and South Australia, between 1842 and this date, had opened most
                    valuable mines of copper. The population of New South Wales in 1851 was 190,000;
                    that of Victoria, 77,000; and that of South Australia about the same.</p>
                <p>At Summerhill Creek, 20 miles north of Bathurst, in the Macquarie plains, gold
                    was discovered, in February 1851, by Mr E. Hargraves, a gold-miner from
                    California. The intelligence was made known in April or May; and then began a
                    rush of thousands,—men leaving their former employments in the bush or in the
                    towns to search for the ore so greatly coveted in all ages. In August it was
                    found at Anderson’s Creek, near Melbourne; a few weeks later the great Ballarat
                    gold-field, 80 miles west of that city, was opened; and after that, Bendigo, now
                    called Sandhurst, to the north. Not only in these lucky provinces, New South
                    Wales and Victoria, where the auriferous deposits were revealed, but in every
                    British colony of Australasia, all ordinary industry was left for the one
                    exciting pursuit. The copper mines of South Australia were for the time
                    deserted, while Tasmania and New Zealand lost many inhabitants, who emigrated to
                    the more promising country. The disturbance of social, industrial, and
                    commercial affairs, during the first two or three years of the gold era, was
                    very great. Immigrants from Europe, and to some extent from North America and
                    China, poured into Melbourne, where the arrivals in 1852 averaged 2000 persons
                    in a week. The population of Victoria was doubled in the first twelvemonth of
                    the gold fever, and the value of imports and exports was multiplied tenfold
                    between 1851 and 1853.</p>
                <p>The colony of Victoria was constituted a separate province in July 1851, Mr
                    Latrobe being appointed governor, followed by Sir Charles Hotham and Sir Henry
                    Barkly in succession. The more rapid increase of Victoria since that time, in
                    wealth and number of inhabitants, has gained it a pre-eminence in the esteem of
                    emigrants; but the varied resources of New South Wales, and its greater extent
                    of territory, may in some degree tend to redress the balance, if not to restore
                    the character of superior importance to the older colony.</p>
                <p>The separation of the northern part of eastern Australia, under the name of
                    Queensland, from the original province of New South Wales, took place in 1859.
                    At that time the district contained about 25,000 inhabitants; and in the first
                    six years (as Sir George Bowen, the first governor, observed in 1865) its
                    population was quadrupled and its trade trebled.</p>
                <p>It appears, from a general view of Australian progress in the last twenty years,
                    that the provinces less rich in gold than Victoria have been enabled to advance
                    in prosperity by other means. Wool continues the great staple of Australia. But
                    New South Wales, possessing both coal and iron, is becoming a seat of
                    manufactures; while Queensland<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n130/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0130-0115"/> is also favoured with much mineral wealth,
                    including tin. The semi-tropical climate of the latter colony is suitable for
                    the culture of particular crops, needing only a supply of other than European
                    labour. Meantime South Australia, besides its production of copper and a fair
                    share of wool, has become the great wheat-growing province of the continent.</p>
                <p>The separate colonies of Australia are still in a somewhat transitional state,
                    emigration being so continuous, and the country to be yet occupied so extensive.
                    For this and for other reasons, therefore, it may be more fitting to describe
                    the several colonies, with respect to their industrial and social conditions,
                    under their respective names. To enable the reader, however, to judge of the
                    general posi tion of the provinces at a recent date, the following statistics
                    are appended :—</p>
