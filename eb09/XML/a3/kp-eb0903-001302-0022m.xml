                    meant “the abode of Hor” or Horus, and she was the mother of that deity in some
                    of his types, and as such a form of Isis, of whom she was a higher or celestial
                    manifestation. Her name occurs as early as the 4th dynasty, when she is styled
                    the mistress of the tree, or sycamore, <hi rend="italic">neha,</hi> or the tree
                    of the south. Besides the local titles of the different cities over which she
                    presided, she was entitled regent of the gods, living mistress of the upper and
                    lower world, mistress of the heaven and regent of the West, and pupil or eye of
                    Ra, or the Sun, with whom she was connected. In her celestial character she is
                    represented as an Egyptian female holding a sceptre, her head surmounted by the
                    sun’s disk, horns, and uraeus, and her flesh coloured blue, the colour of the
                    heaven, or yellow, that of gold and beauty (according to Egyptian notions), a
                    term also applied to Aphrodite in Greek mythology. In her terrestrial character
                    she was the goddess who presided over sports and dancing, music and pleasure,
                    like the Greek Aphrodite, the goddess of love; but her particularly special type
                    was the white or spotted cow, the supposed mother of the sun. The solar deities
                    Shu and Tefnut were her children. In certain legends she is mentioned as the
                    seven cows of Athor, which appear in the Ritual or Book of the Dead. These cows,
                    like the <hi rend="italic">Moirae,</hi> or fates of Greek mythology, appeared at
                    the births of legendary persons, and predicted the course and events of their
                    lives. It is in this capacity that Athor is connected with Ptah, or the Egyptian
                    Hephaestus, and is allied to Sekhet or Bast, called the wife <pb break="no"

                    mystical companions of the Apis, the second life or incarnation of the god of
                    Memphis. She was also represented under the attributes and with the titles of
                    the goddess Nut, or the Egyptian Rhea. The cow of Athor wore on its head the
                    solar disk, and hawk feather plumes, like Amen Ra; and in this character as the
                    great cow she has on some monuments her human head replaced by that of a cow
                    wearing a disk, or the disk and plumes. This emblem also appears in her type at
                    a later period, when her head is represented with long tresses curled into a
                    spiral at the end, and she has the ears of a cow instead of human ears. Her head
                    is then surmounted by a doorway or its cornice, emblem of the abode of the sun,
                    which she represented. This is sometimes surmounted by the disk and horns. The
                    handle of the sistrum, a musical instrument with bars, was generally made in
                    shape of this head and cornice, as were also the capitals of the columns of
                    Abusimbel, Den-derah, and other temples, and the aegis and prows of certain
                    arks. As the goddess of beauty and youth, many of the queens of Egypt assumed
                    her type and attributes, and young females after death, at the Ptolemaic and
                    subsequent periods, had their names preceded by that of the goddess, as both
                    sexes had “Osiris” from the period of the 19th dynasty, that of Athor being a
                    later substitute, and for females only. The third month of the Egyptian year was
                    named Athor after her, and the fish <hi rend="italic">aten</hi> or latus, a kind
                    of carp, was sacred to her. The names and titles of Athor were very numerous,
                    and she is named in the inscriptions the lady or mistress of Silsilis,
                    Abusimbul, Pselcis, Ombos, Hermonthis, Apollonopolis Magna, and Heliopolis; but
                    the chief site of her worship was Denderah, or Tentyris, where she is mentioned
                    under many names, and all the different festivals held in her honour are
                    recorded in the calendar of the temple. Athor is one of the oldest of the
                    Egyptian deities, and her worship continued till the fall of Pantheism and
                    substitution of Christianity. Her w orshiρ passed from Egypt to the neighbouring
                    isles, cow-headed figures of the goddess having been discovered in Cyprus. Her
                    figures and representation are common. Jablonski, <hi rend="italic">Panth.;</hi>
