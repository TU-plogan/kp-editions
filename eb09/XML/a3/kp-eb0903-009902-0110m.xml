                <p><label type="entry">AURUNGZEBE</label>, one of the greatest of the Moghul
                    emperors of Hindustan, was the third son of Shah Jehan, and was born in October
                    1618. His original name, Mahomet, was changed by his father, with whom he was a
                    favourite, into Aurungzebe, meaning ornament of the throne, and at a later time
                    he assumed the additional titles of Mohi-eddin, reviver of religion, and
                    Alam-gir, conqueror of the world. At a very early age, and throughout his whole
                    life, he manifested profound religious feeling, perhaps instilled into him in
                    the course of his education under some of the strictest Mahometan doctors. He
                    was employed, while very young, in some of his father’s expeditions into the
                    country beyond the Indus, gave promise of considerable military talents, and was
                    appointed to the command of an army directed against the Usbeks. In this
                    campaign he was not completely successful, and soon after was transferred to the
                    army engaged in the Deccan. Here he gained several victories, and in conjunction
                    with the famous general, Meer Jumla, who had deserted from the king of Golconda,
                    he seized and plundered the town of Haidarâbâd, which belonged to that monarch.
                    His father’s express orders prevented Aurungzebe from following up this success,
                    and, not long after, the sudden and alarming illness of Shah Jehan turned his
                    thoughts in another direction. Of Shah Jehan’s four sons, the eldest, Dara, a
                    brave and honourable prince, but disliked by the Mussulmans on account of his
                    liberality of thought, had a natural right to the throne. Accordingly, on the
                    illness of his father, he at once seized the reins of government and established
                    himself at Dehli. The second son, Soojah, governor of Bengal, a dissolute and
                    sensual prince, was dissatisfied, and raised an army to dispute the throne with
                    Dara. The keen eye of Aurungzebe saw in this conjuncture of events a favourable
                    opportunity for realising his own ambitious schemes. His religious exercises and
                    temperate habits gave him, in popular estimation, a great superiority over his
                    brothers, but he was too politic to put forward his claims openly. He made
                    overtures to his younger brother Murad, governor of Guzerat, representing that
                    neither of their elder brothers was worthy of the kingdom, that he himself had
                    no temporal ambition, and desired only to place a fit monarch on the throne, and
                    then to devote himself to religious exercises and make the pilgrimage to Mecca.
                    He therefore proposed to unite his forces to those of Murad, who would thus have
                    no difficulty in making himself master of the empire while the two elder
                    brothers were divided by their own strife. Murad was completely deceived by
                    these crafty representations, and at once accepted the offer. Their united
                    armies then moved northward. Meanwhile Shah Jehan had recovered, and though Dara
                    resigned the crown he had seized, the other brothers professed not to believe in
                    their father’s recovery, and still pressed on. Soojah was defeated by Dara’s
                    son, but the imperial forces under Jesswunt Singh were completely routed by the
                    united armies of Aurungzebe and Murad. Dara in person took the field against his
                    brothers, but was defeated and compelled to fly. Aurungzebe then, by a clever
                    stroke of policy, seized the person of his father, and threw him into
                    confinement, in which he was kept for the remaining eight years of his life.
                    Murad was soon removed by assassination, and the way being thus cleared,
                    Aurungzebe, with affected reluctance, ascended the throne in August 1658. He
                    quickly freed himself from all other competitors for the imperial power. Dara,
                    who again invaded Guzerat, was defeated and closely pursued, and was given up by
                    the native chief with whom he had taken refuge. He was brought to Dehli,
                    exhibited to the people, and assassinated. Soojah, who had been a second time
                    defeated near Allahabad, was attacked by the imperial forces under Meer Jumla
                    and Mahomet, Aurungzebe’s eldest son, who, however, deserted and joined his
                    uncle. Soojah was defeated and fled to Aracan, where he perished; Mahomet was
                    captured, thrown into the fortress of Gwalior, and died after seven years’
                    confinement. No similar contest disturbed Aurungzebe’s long reign of forty-six
                    years, which has been celebrated, though with doubtful justice, as the most
                    brilliant period in the history of Hindustan. The empire certainly was wealthy
                    and of enormous extent, for there were successively added to it the rich
                    kingdoms of <pb break="no"

                    Assam, but it was internally decaying, and ready to crumble away before the
                    first vigorous assault. Two causes principally had tended to weaken the Moghul
                    power. The one was the intense bigotry and intolerant policy of Aurungzebe,
                    which had alienated the Hindus and roused the fierce animosity of the haughty
                    Rajputs. The other was the rise and rapid growth of the Mahratta power. Under
                    their able leader, Sevaji, these daring freebooters plundered in every
                    direction, nor could all Aurungzebe’s efforts avail to subdue them. At the close
                    of the long contests between them, the Moghul power was weaker, the Mahratta
                    stronger than at first. Still the personal ability and influence of the emperor
                    were sufficient to keep his realms intact during his own life. His last years
                    were embittered by remorse, by gloomy forebodings, and by constant suspicion,
                    for he had always been in the habit of employing a system of espionage, and only
                    then experienced its evil effects. He died, on the 21st February 1707, at
                    Ahmadnagar, while engaged on an extensive but unfortunate expedition against the
                    Mahrattas.</p>
