                <p><label type="entry">AUDUBON, <hi rend="smallcaps">John James</hi></label>, a
                    well-known naturalist, was born in 1781 in Louisiana, where his parents, who
                    were French Protestants, had taken up their residence while it was still a
                    Spanish colony. They afterwards settled in Pennsylvania. From his early years he
                    had a passion for observing the habits and appearances of birds, and attempting
                    delineations of them from nature. At the age of fifteen he was sent to Paris,
                    and remained there about two years, when among other studies he took some
                    lessons in the drawing-school of David. On returning to America his father
                    established him in a plantation in Pennsylvania, and he soon after married. But
                    nothing could damp his ardour for natural history. For fifteen years he annually
                    explored the depths of the primeval forests of America in long and hazardous
                    expeditions, far from his family and his home. In these excursions he acquired
                    the facility of making those spirited drawings of birds that gives such value to
                    his magnificent work, <hi rend="italic">The Birds of America.</hi> At that
                    period he had not dreamed of any publication of his labours; as he informs us,
                    “it was not the desire of fame that prompted to those long exiles; it was simply
                    the enjoyment of nature.” He afterwards removed with his family to the village
                    of Henderson on the banks of the Ohio, where he continued his researches in
                    natural history for several years, and at length set out for Philadelphia with a
                    portfolio containing 200 sheets filled with coloured delineations of about 1000
                    birds. Business obliged him to quit Philadelphia unexpectedly for some weeks,
                    and he deposited his portfolio in the warehouse of a friend; but to his intense
                    dismay and mortification he found, on his return, that these precious fruits of
                    his wanderings and his labours had been totally destroyed by rats. The shock
                    threw him into a fever of several weeks’ duration, that well-nigh proved fatal.
                    But his native energy returned with returning health; and he resumed his gun and
                    his game-bag, his pencils and his drawing-book, and plunged again into the
                    recesses of the backwoods. In about three years he had again filled his
                    portfolio, and then rejoined his family, who had in the meantime gone to
                    Louisiana. After a short sojourn there he set out for the Old World, to exhibit
                    to the ornithologists of Europe the riches of America in that department of
                    natural history.</p>
                <p>In 1826 Audubon arrived at Li verpool, where the meritsof his spirited
                    delineations of American birds w ere immediately recognised. An exhibition of
                    them to the public in the galleries of the Royal Institution of that town was so
                    successful that it was repeated at Manchester and at Edinburgh, where they were
                    no lese admired. When he proposed to publish a work on the birds of America,
                    several naturalists advised him to issue the work in large quarto, as the most
                    useful size for the lovers of natural history, and the most likely to afford him
                    a sufficient number of subscribers to remunerate his labours. At first he
                    yielded to this advice, and acknowledged its soundness; but finally he decided
                    that his work should eclipse every other ornithological publication. Every bird
                    was to be delineated of the size of life, and to each species a whole page was
                    to be devoted; consequently, the largest <hi rend="italic">elephant folio</hi>
                    paper was to receive the impressions. This necessarily increased the expense of
                    the work so much as to put it beyond the reach of most scientific
                    naturalists—which accounts for the small number of persons who, for a
                    considerable time, could be reckoned among his supporters in the gigantic
                    undertaking. The exceptionally high character of the work, however, gradually
                    became known; and a sufficient number of subscribers was at length obtained in
                    Great Britain and America, during the ten or twelve years that the work was
                    going through the press, to indemnify him <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n82/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0082-0071"/> for the great cost of the publication—leaving
                    him, however, a very inadequate compensation for his extraordinary industry and
                    skill. The first volume was published at New York in the end of the year 1830,
                    the second in 1834, the third in 1837, and the fourth and last in 1839. The
                    whole consists of 435 coloured plates, containing 1055 figures of birds the size
                    of life. It is certainly the most magnificent work of the kind ever given to the
                    world, and is well characterised by Cuvier, “C’est le plus magnifique monument
                    que ΓArt ait encore élevé à la Nature.”</p>
                <p>During the preparation and publication of his great work Audubon made several
                    excursions from Great Britain, In the summer of 1828 he visited Paris, where he
                    made the acquaintance of Cuvier, Humboldt, and other celebrated naturalists, and
                    received from them every mark of honour and esteem. The following winter he
                    passed in London. In April of 1830 he revisited the United States of America,
                    and again explored the forests of the central and southern federal territories.
                    In the following year he returned to London and Edinburgh, but the August of
                    1831 found him again in New York. The succeeding winter and spring he spent in
                    Florida and South Carolina; and in the summer of 1832 he set out for the
                    Northern States, with an intention of studying the annual migrations of birds,
                    particularly of the passenger pigeon, of which he has given a striking
                    description; but his career was arrested at Boston by a 6evere attack of
                    cholera, which detained him there till the middle of August. After that he
                    explored the coasts, lakes, rivers, and mountains of North America, from
                    Labrador and Canada to Florida, during a series of laborious journeys, that
                    occupied him for three years. From Charleston, accompanied by his wife and
                    family, he took his third departure for Britain. During his earlier residence in
                    Edinburgh he had begun to publish his <hi rend="italic">American Ornithological
                    Biography,</hi> which at length filled five large octavo volumes. The first was
                    issued there by Adam Black in 1831; the last appeared in 1839. This book is
                    admirable for the vivid pictures it presents of the habits of the birds, and the
                    adventures of the naturalist. The descriptions are characteristically accurate
                    and interesting.</p>
                <p>In 1839 Audubon bade a final adieu to Europe; and returning to his native
                    country, he published, in a more popular form, his <hi rend="italic">Birds of
                    America,</hi> in seven octavo volumes, the last of which appeared in 1844. His
                    ardent love of nature still prompted him to new enterprises, and he set out on
                    fresh excursions; but in these he was always accompanied by his two sons, and
                    one or two other naturalists. The result of these excursions was the projection
                    of a new work, <hi rend="italic">The Quadrupeds of America,</hi> in atlas folio,
                    and also a <hi rend="italic">Biography of American Quadrupeds,</hi> both of
                    which were commenced at Philadelphia in 1840. The latter was completed in 1850,
                    and is, perhaps, even superior to his <hi rend="italic">Ornithological
                    Biography.</hi></p>
                <p>To great intelligence in observing, and accuracy in delineating nature, to a
                    vigorous, handsome frame, and pleasing expressive features, Audubon united very
                    estimable mental qualities, and a deep sense of religion without a trace of
                    bigotry. His conversation was animated and instructive, his manner unassuming,
                    and he always spoke with gratitude to Heaven for the very happy life lie had
                    been permitted to enjoy. He died, after a short illness, in his own residence on
                    the banks of the Hudson, at New York, on the 27th of January 1851. See <hi
