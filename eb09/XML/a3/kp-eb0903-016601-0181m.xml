                    brilliant French writer on philosophy, was born at Sorrèze in 1766, and died at
                    Paris in 1845. He was educated at the college in his native town; and at the age
                    of 17 joined a religious body with the view of afterwards entering the church.
                    He remained only a year in this society, and then accepted an appointment as
                    teacher in the college at Tarbes. The duties of this office proved most
                    uncongenial to him, and he gladly entered the service of the bishop of Olèron,
                    to whom he acted as secretary. With this, too, he quickly became dissatisfied,
                    either on account of the bishop’s reiterated desire that he should take orders,
                    or from the many petty annoyances incident to his post. He withdrew to the
                    little village of Villemagne, near Beziers, where he supported himself by
                    performing the duties of organist in the church. He afterwards acted as tutor to
                    the Count de Bose’s sons, with whom he remained till the outbreak of the
                    Revolution. Azais, at first an ardent admirer of that great movement, was struck
                    with dismay at the atrocities that were perpetrated, and published a vehement
                    pamphlet on the subject. He was denounced, and had to seek safety in flight. For
                    eighteen months he found refuge in the hospital of the Sisters of Charity at
                    Tarbes; and it was not till 1806 that he was able to settle in Paris. There,
                    three years later, he published his treatise <hi rend="italic">Des
                    Compensations</hi><hi rend="italic">dans les Destinées Humaines,</hi> in which
                    he sought to show that happiness and misery were fairly balanced in this world,
                    and that consequently it was the duty of citizens to submit quietly to a fixed
                    government. This doctrine was not displeasing to Napoleon, who mr.de its author
                    professor at St Cyr. After the removal of that college, he obtained, in 1811,
                    the post of inspector of the public library at Avignon, and from 1812 to 1815 he
                    held a similar office at Nancy. His preference for the Bonaparte dynasty
                    naturally operated in his disfavour at the Restoration; but after suffering
                    considerable privation for some years, he obtained a government pension, which
                    placed him beyond the reach of want. He employed the remaining years of his life
                    in oral and published expositions of his system of philosophy.</p>
                <p>A ccording to Azais, the whole of existence, the universe, whose cause is God,
                    may be regarded as the product of two factors, Matter and Force. Matter in its
                    primitive state consists of homogeneous elements or atoms. All force is in its
                    nature expansive, and is, therefore, subject to one supreme law, that of
                    equilibrium, or equivalence of action and reaction; for evidently expansive
                    force emanating from each body is repressive force acting on all other bodies.
                    The whole of the phenomena of the universe are successive stages in the
                    development caused by the action of this one force under its one law on the
                    primitive atoms; and in tracing this development we must group facts into three
                    distinct orders,—first, the physical; second, the physiological; third, the
                    intellectual, moral, and political. In the sphere of physical phenomena,
                    distinct development can be traced from the simplest mechanical motion up
                    through the more complex forces of light, heat, and electricity to the power of
                    magnetic attraction, by means of which the second great order of facts is
                    produced out of the first. For magnetic force acting on elastic bodies, which as
                    reactive have potential life, creates the primitive living globule, which is
                    shaped like a tube open at both ends. From this first vital element a gradual
                    ascent can be traced, culminating in man, who is differentiated from the other
                    animals by the possession of intellect, or consciousness of the ideas with which
                    external things impress him. These ideas, however, are in themselves corporeal;
                    what is immaterial in man, or his soul, is the expansive force inherent in him.
                    Moral and political phenomena are the results of two primitive instincts,
                    progress and self-conservation, corresponding to the two forces, expansion and
                    repression. From the reciprocal relations of these instincts may be deduced the
                    necessary conditions of social and political life. The ultimate goal of humanity
                    is the perfect fulfilment of the law of equilibrium, the establishment of
                    universal harmony. When that is accomplished, the destiny of man has been
                    achieved, and he will vanish from this earth. Such a consummation may be looked
                    for in about 7000 years. During an additional period of 5000 years the great
                    cosmical forces will be gradually tending towards the establishment of complete
                    equilibrium; and, when this is attained, the present system of things is at an
                    end.</p>
