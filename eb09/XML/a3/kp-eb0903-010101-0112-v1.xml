                        rend="smallcaps">Magnus,</hi> a Roman poet of the 4th century, was the son
                    of an eminent physician, and born at Burdigala <hi rend="italic">(Bordeaux)</hi>
                    about 310 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> His education was conducted with
                    unusual care, either because his genius was very promising, or because the
                    scheme of his nativity, which had been cast by his maternal grandfather, was
                    found to promise great fame and advancement. He made extraordinary progress in
                    classical learning; and, after completing his studies at Toulouse, he practised
                    for a time at the bar in his-native place. At the age of thirty he became a
                    teacher of grammar, and soon afterwards was promoted to the professorship of
                    rhetoric. In this office he acquired so great a reputation that he was appointed
                    preceptor to Gratian, the Emperor Valentinian’s son. The rewards and honours
                    conferred on him for the faithful discharge of his duties, prove the truth of
                    Juvenal’s maxim—that when Fortune pleases she can raise a man from the humble
                    rank of rhetorician to the dignity of consul. He was appointed consul by the
                    Emperor Gratian in the year 379, after having filled other important offices;
                    for besides the dignity of quaestor, to which he had been nominated by
                    Valentinian, he was made praefectof Latium, of Libya, and of Gaul, after that
                    prince’s death. His speech, returning thanks to Gratian on his promotion to the
                    consulship, is a good specimen of high-flown rhetorical flattery. The time of
                    his death is uncertain, but he was alive in 388, and probably survived till
                    about 394. From references in hie works he appears to have been a convert to
                    Christianity.</p>
                <p>Of lιis prose writings, there are extant the <hi rend="italic">Actio ad</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Gratianum,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Periochoe</hi> (or
                    summaries) <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">Iliadem et Odysseam,</hi>
                    and one or two of the <hi rend="italic">Epistoloe.</hi> The principal pieces in
                    verse are the <hi rend="italic">Epigrammata,</hi> some of which are extremely
                    felicitous; the <hi rend="italic">Parentalia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Commemoratio Professorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Burdigalensium,</hi> which
                    give interesting details concerning his relations and literary friends; the <hi
                        rend="italic">Epistoloe</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, finally, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Idyllia,</hi> a collection of twenty small poems, the most
                    famous of which are the <hi rend="italic">Cento</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Nuptialis,</hi> an obscene selection of lines from Virgil, and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Mosella,</hi> a descriptive poem on the river Moselle,
                    containing some good passages. Ausonius was rather a man of letters than a poet;
                    his wide reading supplied him with materials for verse, but his works exhibit no
                    traces of a true poetic spirit; even his versification, though ingenious, is
                    frequently defective. The best editions of his works are those of Tollius
                    (Amsterdam, 1669), and Souchay (Paris, 1730), and the Bipontine (1785). The <hi
                        rend="italic">Mosella</hi> has been edited separately by Booking (1828,
                    1842).</p>
