                    signifies, in its widest sense, any substitute or agent appointed to act in “the
                    turn, stead, or place of another.” The term is now commonly confined to a class
                    of qualified agents who undertake the conduct of legal proceedings for their
                    clients. By the common law the actual presence of the parties to a suit was
                    considered indispensable, but the privflege of appearing by attorney was
                    conceded in certain cases by special dispensation, until the statute of Merton
                    and subsequent enactments made it competent for both parties in all judicial
                    proceedings to appear by attorney. Solicitors appear to have been at first
                    distinguished from attorneys, as not having the attorney’s power to bind their
                    principals, but latterly the distinction has been between attorneys as the
                    agents formally appointed in actions at law, and solicitors who take care of
                    proceedings in Parliament, Chancery, Privy Council, &amp;c. In practice,
                    however, and in ordinary language, the terms are synonymous. Regulations
                    regarding the qualification of attorneys are found as far back as the 20 Edward
                    I., which required the judges to select in each county the most learned and able
                    attorneys and apprentices to do service in the courts. By the 6 and 7 Vict. c.
                    73, and other statutes, the qualifications necessary for admission on the rolls
                    of attorneys and solicitors are :—1st, The due execution of a proper contract in
                    writing with some practising attorney or solicitor for the term of five years,
                    or of three years if the clerk be a graduate of the universities of Oxford,
                    Cambridge, Dublin, London, or Durham, or of the Queen’s University, Ireland, or
                    if he have been a member of the bar, a writer to the signet, a solicitor before
                    the supreme courts in Scotland, or for ten years <hi rend="italic">bona

                    a right to be admitted and to practise in any of the courts in the kingdom, and
                    this right may be enforced by mandamus. They may act as advocates in certain of
                    the inferior courts. Conveyancing, formerly considered the exclusive business of
                    the bar, is now often performed by attorneys. Barristers are understood to
                    require the intervention of an attorney in all cases that come before them
                    professionally, although in criminal cases the prisoner not unfrequently engages
                    a counsel directly by giving him a fee in open court. The relation of attorney
                    and client disqualifies the former from dealing with his client on his own
                    behalf, while it giveshim a lien, on professional services, over the deeds,
                    &lt;⅛c., of the client in his possession. An attorney may be struck off the
                    rolls for professional or other misconduct, on application by counsel at the
                    instance of an injured party, or, as the case generally is, of the Incorporated
                    Law Society as representing the profession.</p>
