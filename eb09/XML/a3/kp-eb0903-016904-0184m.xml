                    rend="smallcaps">Western Islands</hi></label>, are situated in the Atlantic
                    Ocean, and extend in an oblique line from N.W. to S.E., between 36° 55' and 39°
                    55' N. lat., and between 25° and 31° 16' W. long. They are generally considered
                    as pertaining to Europe, though separated by a distance of 800 milee from the
                    coast of Portugal. They are divided into three distinct groups: the
                    south-eastern consisting of Saö-Miguel, or St Michael’s, and Sta Maria; the
                    central and largest, of Fayal, Pico, Saυ Jorge, Terceira, and Graciosa; and the
                    north-western, of Flores and Corvo.</p>
                <p>It does not appear that the ancient Greeks and Romans had any knowledge of the
                    Azores, but from the number of Carthaginian coins discovered at Corvo it has
                    been supposed that the islands must have been visited by that adventurous
                    people. The Arabian geographers, Edrisi in the 12th century, and Ibn-al-Wardi in
                    the 14th, describe, after the Canaries, nine other islands in the Western Ocean,
                    which are in all probability the Azores. This identification is supported by
                    various considerations. The number of islands is the same; the climate under
                    which they are placed by the Arabians makes them north of the Canaries; and
                    special mention is made of the hawks or buzzards, which were sufficiently
                    numerous at a later period to give rise to the present name (Port. <hi
                    rend="italic">Açor,</hi> a hawk.) The Arabian writers represent them as having
                    been populous, and as having contained cities of some magnitude; but they state
                    that the inhabitants had been greatly reduced by intestine warfare. The Azores
                    are first found distinctly marked in a map of 1351, the southern group being
                    named the Goat Islands <hi rend="italic">(Cabreras);</hi> the middle group, the
                    Wind or Dove Islands <hi rend="italic">(De Ventura</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sive</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Columbis)</hi>; and the
                    western, the Brazil Island <hi rend="italic">(De Brazi)—</hi> the word Brazil at
                    that time being employed for any red dye-stuff. In a Catalan map of the year
                    1375 the island of Corvo is found as <hi rend="italic">Corvi Marini,</hi> and
                    Flores as <hi rend="italic">Li Conigi;</hi> while Saö Jorge is already
                    designated San Zorze. It has been conjectured that the discoverers were Genoese,
                    but of this there is not sufficient evidence. It is plain, however, that the
                    so-called Flemish discovery by Van der Berg is only worthy of the name in a very
                    secondary sense. According to the usual account, he was driven on the islands in
                    1432, and the news excited considerable interest at the court of Lisbon. The
                    navigator, Gonzalo Velho Cabral—not to be confounded with his greater namesake,
                    Pedro Alvarez Cabral—was sent to prosecute the discovery. Another version
                    relates that Don Henry of Portugal had in his possession a map in which the
                    islands were laid down, and that he sent out Cabral through confidence in its
                    accuracy. The map had been presented to him by his brother, Don Pedro, who had
                    travelled as far as Babylon. Be this aβ it may, Cabral reached the island, which
                    he named Santa Maria, in 1432, and in 1444 took possession of St Michael’s. The
                    other islands were all discovered by 1457. Colonisation had meanwhile been going
                    on prosperously; and in 1466 the Azores were presented by Alρhonso V. to his
                    aunt, Isabella, the duchess of Burgundy. An influx of Flemish settlers followed,
                    and the islands became known for a time as the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n185/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0185-0170"/> Flemish Islands. From 1580 to 1640 they were
                    subject to Spain like the rest of the Portuguese kingdom, of which they now form
                    a province. At that time the Azores were the grand rendezvous for the fleets on
                    their voyage home from the Indies; and hence they became a theatre of that
                    maritime warfare which was carried on by the English under Queen Elizabeth
                    against the Peninsular powers. The connection with England has long since been
                    of a more peaceful description; no other country affording such a ready market
                    for Azorean productions.</p>
                <p>The islands are now divided into three administrative districts, which take their
                    names from the chief towns of</p>
                <p>Angra in Terceira, Horta in Fayal, and Ponta-Delgada in St Michael’s—the first of
                    the three being also the capital of the islands. The most of the inhabitants are
                    of Portuguese origin, but there is a mixture not only of Flemish but Moorish
                    blood. Negroes, Mulattoes, English, Scotch, and Irish immigrants are present in
                    considerable numbers, especially in San Miguel and Fayal. Education is in a very
                    backward state, the great proportion of the lower classes being unable to read
                    or write. Progress, however, is being made in this as well as other
                    respects.</p>
                <p>Under the active administration of Pombal, considerable efforts were made for the
                    improvement of the Azores, but the stupid and bigoted Government which followed
                    rather tended to destroy these benefits, and to create a retrograde course.
                    Towards the beginning of the present century, the possession of the islands was
                    contested by the claimants for the crown of Portugal. The adherents of the
                    constitution, who supported against Miguel the rights of Maria da Gloria,
                    obtained possession of Terceira in 1829, where they succeeded in maintaining
                    themselves, and after various struggles, Queen Maria’s authority was established
                    over all the islands. She resided at Angra from 1830 to 1833.</p>
                <p>The aspect of all the islands is very similar in general characteristics,
                    presenting an elevated and undulating outline, with little or no table-land, and
                    rising into peaks, of which the lowest (that of Sta Maria) is 1889 feet, and the
                    highest (that of Pico) 7613 feet above the level of the sea. Their lines of
                    sea-coast are, with few exceptions, high and precipitous, with bases of
                    accumulated masses of fallen rock, in which open bays, or scarcely more enclosed
                    inlets, form the harbours of the trading towns. The volcanic character of the
                    whole archipelago is very obvious, and has been abundantly confirmed by the
                    numerous earthquakes and eruptions which have taken place since its discovery.
                    Hitherto the western group of Flores and Corvo has been quite exempt, Graciosa
                    has been equally undisturbed, and Fayal has only suffered from one eruption, in
                    1672. The centre of activity has for the most part been St Michael’s, while the
                    neighbouring island of Santa Maria has altogether escaped. In 1444-45 there was
                    a great eruption at St Michael’s, of which, however, the accounts that have been
                    preserved exaggerate the importance. In 1522 the town of Villa Franca, at that
                    time the capital of the island, was buried, with all its 6000 inhabitants,
                    during a violent convulsion. In 1572 an eruption took place in the island of
                    Pico; in 1580 St George was the scene of numerous outbursts; and in 1614 a
                    little town in Terceira was destroyed. In 1630, 1652, 1656, 1755, 1852, &amp;c.,
                    St Michael has been visited with successive eruptions and earthquakes, several
                    of them of great violence. On various occasions, as in 1638, 1720, 1811, and
                    1867, subterranean eruptions have taken place, which have sometimes been
                    accompanied by the appearance of temporary islands. Of these the most remarkable
                    was thrown up in June 1811, about half a league from the western extremity of St
                    Michael’s. It was called Sabrina by the commander of the British man-of-war of
                    that name, who witnessed the phenomenon. Details will be found in a valuable
                    chapter of Hartung’s <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Azoren,</hi> p.
                    99, and in the 23d vol. of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions.</hi></p>
                <p>The climate is particularly temperate and equable, the extremes of sensible heat
                    and cold being, however, increased by the humidity of the atmosphere. This is so
                    great that paper-hangings will not adhere to the walls, and the veneering of
                    furniture strips off. The range of the thermometer is from 45° Fahr., the lowest
                    known extreme, or 48°, the <pb break="no"

                    ordinary, or 86°, the highest known extreme of July, near the level of the sea.
                    Between these two points (both taken in the shade) there is from month to month
                    a pretty regular gradation of increase or decrease, amounting to somewhat less
                    than four degrees <hi rend="italic">(Geographical Journal,</hi> vol. xv.) Iu
                    winter the prevailing winds are from the north-west, west, and south; while in
                    summer the most frequent are the north, north-east, and east. The weather is
                    often extremely stormy, and the winds from the west and south-west render the
                    navigation of the coasts very dangerous.</p>
                <p>The general character of the flora is decidedly European, no fewer than 400 out
                    of the 478 species generally considered as indigenous belonging likewise to that
                    continent, while only four are found in America, and forty are peculiar to the
                    archipelago. Vegetation in most of the islands is remarkably rich, especially in
                    grasses, mosses, and ferns, heath, juniper, and a variety of shrubs. Of
                    tall-growing trees there was, till the present century, an almost total lack;
                    but through the exertions of José de Canto and others the Bordeaux pine, the
                    European poplar, the African palm-tree, the Australian eucalyptus, the chestnut,
                    the tulip-tree, the elm, the oak, and many others, have been successfully
                    introduced into one or more of the islands. The orange, the apricot, the banana,
                    the lem &lt;.ι, the citron, the Japanese medlar, and the pomegranate, are the
                    common fruits, and various other varieties are more or less cultivated. At one
                    time much attention was given to the growing of the sugarcane, but it has now
                    for the most part been abandoned. The culture of woad introduced in the 16th
                    century also belongs to the past. A kind of fern <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dicksonia</hi><hi rend="italic">culcita'),</hi> called by the natives <hi
                    rend="italic">cabellinho,</hi> and common throughout the archipelago, furnishes
                    a silky material for the stuffing of mattresses, which forms an article of
                    export to Brazil and Portugal.</p>
                <p>The mammalia of the Azores are limited to the rabbit, weasel, ferret, rat (brown
                    and black), mouse, and bat, in addition to domestic animals. Among the fish
                    caught off the coast may be mentioned the mullet, the tunny, the bonito. The
                    numbers of birds are so remarkable that in St Michael’s, where a reward is given
                    for the destruction of the blackbird, the bullfinch, the redbreast, the
                    chaffinch, and the canary, the sum paid annually represents a deathlist of
                    420,000. The game includes the woodcock, red partridge (introduced in the 16th
                    century), quail, and snipe.</p>
                <p>St Michael’s, the largest and most populous of the islands, has an area of 224
                    square miles, and 105,404 inhabitants. The east end rises from a bluff cliff,
                    from 1200 to 1400 feet high, to a lofty inland peak, whence a central range,
                    varying in height from 2000 to 2500 feet, runs to the westward, terminating in
                    the Serra da Agoa de Paö, 3060 feet above the sea. The sea-coast gradually
                    declines in approaching the last point, where it is not more than about 100 feet
                    high. The middle part of the island is lower, and more undulating; its western
                    extremity being marked by the conspicuous Serra Gorda, 1574 feet above the sea;
                    its shores on both sides are low, broken, and rocky. The aspect of the western
                    portion of the island is that of a vast truncated cone, irregularly cut off at
                    an elevation of about 800 feet, and falling on the N., S., and W. sides to a
                    perpendicular coast of betweeen 300 and 800 feet high. In the higher parts an
                    undergrowth of shrubs gives the mountains a rich and wooded appearance. Like all
                    volcanic countries, the face of the island is uneven and irregular, being deeply
                    excavated by numerous ravines, and roughened by streams of semi-vitrified and
                    scoriaceous lava, that resist all atmospheric influences and repel vegetation.
                    Heavy rains falling on the mountains afford a constant supply of water to four
                    lakes at the bottom of extinct craters, and a number of minor reservoirs, and
                    through them to small streams running rapidly down on all sides into the sea <hi
                    rend="italic">(Geographical Journal,</hi> vol. xv.)</p>
                <p>Hot springs abound in many parts of the island, and from almost every crevice
                    vapour is seen issuing. But the most remarkable phenomena are the Caldeiras or
                    boiling fountains, which rise chiefly from a valley called the Furnas, near the
                    western extremity of the island. The water ascends in columns to the height of
                    about 12 feet, after which it dissolves in clouds of vapour. The ground in the
                    immediate vicinity is entirely covered with native sulphur, like hoar frost. At
                    a small distance is the Muddy Crater, the vertex of which, 45 feet in diameter,
                    is on a level with the plain. Its contents are in a state of continual and
                    violent ebullition, accompanied with a sound resembling that of a tempestuous
                    ocean. Yet they never rise above its level, unless occasionally to throw to a
                    small distance a spray of the consistence of melted lead. The Furnas abounds
                    also in hot springs, some of them of a very high temperature. There is almost
                    always, however, a cold spring near to the hot one. These springs have for a
                    considerable period been greatly resorted to in cases of palsy, rheumatism,
                    scrofula, and similar maladies, and bath-rooms and various conveniences for
                    visitors have been erected.</p>
                <p>The plains are fertile, producing wheat, barley, and Indian corn; whilst vines
                    and oranges grow luxuriantly on the sides of the mountains. The plants are made
                    to spring even from the interstices of the volcanic rocks, which are sometimes
                    blasted to receive them. Raised in this manner, these fruits are said to be of
                    superior quality; but the expense of such a mode of cultivation necessarily
                    restricts it. The western part of the island yields hemp, which might be raised
                    to a considerable extent. The exports consist of wine, fruit, and provisions,
                    the most important trade being in oranges. Foreign intercourse was at one time
                    confined rigorously to Lisbon; but the inhabitants now trade directly with
                    England, America, and other countries. The exports during 1872 at the port of St
                    Michael’s were of the value of &lt;£85,279, and the imports amounted to
                    £91,943.</p>
                <p>The principal town in the island is Ponta-Delgada, which contains 15,520
                    inhabitants. It is built with tolerable regularity, the streets being straight
                    and broad. The religious edifices are numerous and elegant. The harbour receives
                    only small vessels; those of larger size must anchor in an open roadstead, which
                    cannot be occupied during the prevalence of southerly gales. A breakwater and
                    harbour of refuge have been in process of construction for a number of years;
                    and a lighthouse is being built at the north-east end of the island. The other
                    towns are Villa Franca, Ribeira Grande, Alagoa, Agoa de Paö, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>St Mary is a small island immediately adjacent to St Michael’s, through the
                    medium of which its trade is conducted, as it has no good harbours of its own.
                    It has an area of 36 square miles, and produces wheat in abundance, of which a
                    considerable quantity is exported. Various volcanic rocks are the predominant
                    formations, but beds of limestone also occur, giving rise to numerous stalactite
                    grottoes all over the island. Population from 7000 to 8000.</p>
                <p>Terceira (so called as being the third in order of discovery) is smaller than St
                    Michael’s, but being placed in a more central position with respect to the other
                    islands, has been chosen as the seat of government. The port of Angra, protected
                    by Mt. Brazil, is also superior to any of those in St Michael’s. This island
                    does not exhibit nearly the same extensive traces of volcanic action; and the
                    summits of its mountains are generally level. It abounds in grain and cattle;
                    but the wines are inferior, and fruits are raised merely, for internal
                    consumption. The number of inhabitants is estimated at 50,000.</p>

                <p>Fayal (so called from the extreme abundance of the jføya, an indigenous shrub) is
                    the most frequented of all the Azores, after St Michael’s, as it has one of the
                    best harbours in the islands, and lies directly in the track of vessels that are
                    crossing the /Atlantic in any direction. Its principal town is Villa de Horta,
                    with a population of 7636. The town is defended by two castles and a wall, both
                    in decay, and serving rather for show than strength. The city contains two
                    convents for monks and three for nuns, with eight churches. The bay is two miles
                    in length and three-quarters of a mile in breadth, and the depth of water from 6
                    to 20 fathoms. Though a good roadstead, it is not altogether free from danger in
                    S.S.∖V. and S.E. winds. The women of this island manufacture fine lace from the
                    agave thread, and till recently produced large quantities of open-work
                    stockings. They also execute carvings in snow-white figtree pith, and carry on
                    the finer kinds of basket-making. A small valley, called FIemengos, still
                    perpetuates the name of the Flemish settlers, who have left their mark on the
                    physical appearance of the inhabitants. Population, 26,264.</p>
                <p>A considerable quantity of wine used to be exported from Fayal under the name of
                    Fayal wine, which was really the produce of Pico, one of the most remarkable of
                    the Azores. This island is composed of an immense conical mountain, rising to
                    the height of 7613 feet, and bearing every trace of volcanic formation. The soil
                    consists entirely of pulverised lava. All the lower parts of the mountain used
                    to be in the highest state of cultivation, and covered with vine and orange
                    plantations. But in 1852 the vines were attacked by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >0idium</hi> fungus and completely destroyed, while-the orange-trees suffered
                    almost as much from the <hi rend="italic">Coccus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hesperidum.</hi> The people were consequently reduced to want, and forced to
                    emigrate in great numbers. The planting of fig-trees and apricots alleviated the
                    evil, and after a time many of the emigrants returned. Pico also produces a
                    valuable species of wood resembling, and equal in quality to, mahogany.
                    Population, 24,000.</p>
                <p>Graciosa and St George are two small islands, situated between Fayal and
                    Terceira. Graciosa, as its name imports, is chiefly noted for the extreme beauty
                    of its aspect and scenery. The chief town is Sta Cruz, and the total population
                    8000. The only manufacture is the burning of bricks. The chief town of St George
                    is Velas, and the population 18,000.</p>
                <p>The two small islands of Corvo and Flores seem but imperfectly to belong to the
                    group. They lie also out of the usual track of navigators; but to those who,
                    missing their course, are led thither, Flores affords good shelter in its
                    numerous bays. Its poultry is excellent; and the cattle are numerous, but small.
                    It derives its name from the abundance of the flowers that find shelter in its
                    deep ravines. Population of Corvo, 1000, and of Flores, 10,508.</p>
