                <p><label type="entry">ATTICA</label>, the most famous district of ancient Greece,
                    is a triangular piece of ground projecting in a south-easterly direction into
                    the Aegean Sea, the base line being formed by the continuous chain of Mounts
                    Cithaeron and Parnes, the apex by the promontory of Sunium. It is washed on two
                    sides by the sea, and this feature seems to have given rise to the name; for,
                    notwithstanding the unusual letterchange, Αττικτ) probably stands for <hi
                        rend="italic">Άκηκή,</hi> since Strabo and other ancient writers inform us
                    that the country originally bore both this name and that of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ακτή.</hi> The latter designation was frequently used by the Greeks to
                    describe an extensive tract reaching into the sea, especially when, as in the
                    case of Attica and the Argolic Acte, it was joined to the continent by a broad
                    base. The coast is broken up into numerous small bights and harbours, which,
                    however, are with few exceptions exposed to the south wind; the irregularity of
                    the outline accounts for its great length in comparison of the superficial area
                    of the country. The surface of Attica, as of the rest of Greece, is very
                    mountainous, and between the mountain chains lie several plains of no great
                    size, open on one side to the sea. On the west its natural boundary is the
                    Corinthian Gulf, so that it would include the district of Megaris; and, as a
                    matter of fact, before the Dorian invasion, which resulted in the foundation of
                    Megara, the -whole of this country was politically one, being in the hands of
                    the Ionian race. This is proved by the column which, as we learn from Strabo,
                    once stood on the Isthmus of Corinth, bearing on one side the inscription, “This
                    land is Peloponnesus, not Ionia ”—</p>

                <p>The central position of Attica in Greece was one main cause of its historical
                    importance. When K. O. Müller compares Greece to a body, whose members are
                    different in form, while a mutual connection and dependence naturally exist,
                    between them, he speaks of Attica as one of the extremities which served as the
                    active instruments of the body of Greece, and by which it was kept in constant
                    connection with other countries. Hence in part arose the maritime character of
                    its inhabitants; and when they had once taken to the sea, the string of
                    neighbouring islands, Ceos, Cythnos, and others, some of which lay within sight
                    of their coasts, and from one to another of which it was possible to sail
                    without losing sight of land, served to .empt them on to further enterprises.
                    Similarly on land, the post it occupied between Northern Greece and the
                    Peloponnese materially influenced its relation to other states, both in respect
                    of its alliances, such as that with Thessaly, towards which country it was drawn
                    by mutual hostility to Boeotia, which lay between them,—a friendship of great
                    •service to Athens, because it brought to her aid the Thessalian cavalry, an arm
                    with which she herself was feebly provided; and also in respect of offensive
                    combinations of other powers, as that between Thebes and Sparta, which
                    throughout an important part of Greek history were closely associated in their
                    politics, through mutual dread of their powerful neighbour.</p>
                <p>The mountains of .Attica, which form its most characteristic feature, are to be
                    regarded as a continuation of that chain which, starting from Mount Tymphrestus
                    at the southern extremity of Vindus, passes through Phocis and Boeotia under the
                    well-known names of Parnassus and Helicon; from this proceeds the range which,
                    as Cithaeron in its western and Parnes in its eastern portion, separates Attica
                    from Boeo Ja, throwing off spurs southward towards the Saronic Gulf in Aegaleos
                    and Hymettus, which bound the plain of Athens. Again, the eastern extremity of
                    Parnes is joined by another line of hills, which, separating from Mount Oeta,
                    skirts the Euboic Gulf, and, after entering Attica, throws up the lofty pyramid
                    of Pentelicus, overlooking the plain of Marathon, and then sinks towards the sea
                    at Sunium to rise once more in the outlying islands. Finally, at the extreme
                    west of the whole district, Cithaeron is bent round at right angles in the
                    direction of the isthmus, at the northern approach to which it abuts against the
                    mighty mass of Mount Geraneia, which is interposed between the Corinthian and
                    the Saronic Gulf. The elevation reached by some of these is considerable, both
                    Cithaeron and Parnes being about 4G00 feet, Hymettus 33G0, and Pentelicus 25GO,
                    while Aegaleos does not rise higher than 1536 feet. At the present day they are
                    extremely bare, and, to one who is accustomed to Italian scenery, their severity
                    is apt at first to be almost repellent; but after a time the eye is delighted
                    with the delicacy of the outlines, the minute articulation of the minor ridges
                    and valleys, and the symmetrical way in which nature has grouped the several
                    mountains so as to form a balance between them. The appearance thus produced can
                    be best described as classical.</p>
                <p>The soil of Attica is light and thin, and requires very careful agriculture to
                    develop its produce. This feature belongs not only to the rocky mountain sides,
                    but to some extent also to the maritime plains, and had considerable influence
                    on the development of the inhabitants, both by enforcing industrious habits, and
                    in leading them at an early period to take to the sea. Still, the level ground
                    was sufficiently fertile to form a marked contrast to the rest of the district,
                    and this fact is represented in the mythical genealogy of the early kings, which
                    embodies several geographical features. Thus, while first we find the name of
                    Actaeus or Act≈0D, who represents the <hi rend="italic">ακτή</hi> or sea-coast,
                    later on occurs Cranaus, a personification of the rocky ground, whence both
                    Pindar and Aristophanes apply the epithet <hi rend="italic">κpavaai</hi> to
                    Athens; and further we meet with Erichthonius, w hose name is intended to
                    express the fruitful plains. Thucydides attributes to the nature of the thin
                    soil (i. 2, <hi rend="smallcaps">to</hi> λ∈τrτo ’ γ∈ωv), which presented no
                    attraction to invaders, the permanence of the same inhabitants in the country,
                    whence arose the claim to indigenousness on which the Athenians so greatly
                    prided themselves; while at the same time the richer ground fostered that
                    fondness for country life, which is proved by the enthusiastic terms in which it
                    is always spoken of by Aristophanes, and by the discontent of the people of
                    Attica at being forced to betake themselves to the city at the commencement of
                    the Peloponnesian War. That we are not justified in judging of the ancient
                    condition of the soil by the aridity which prevails at the present day, is shown
                    by the fact that out of the 174 demes into which Attica was divided, at least
                    one-tenth were named from trees or plants.</p>
                <p>But whatever drawbacks the people of Attica experienced in respect of the soil
                    were more than compensated by the fineness of the climate. In this point they
                    enjoyed a great advantage over their neighbours the Boeotians; and while at the
                    present day travellers speak of the excessive heat in summer and cold in winter
                    which they have experienced in Boeotia, Attica has always been famous for its
                    mildness. In approaching this district from the north, a change of temperature
                    is felt as soon as a person descends from Cithaeron or Parnes, and the sea
                    breeze, which in modern times is called ό <hi rend="italic">lμ,βdτη&lt;s,</hi>
                    or that which sets towards shore, moderates the heat in summer. Both the Attic
                    comedians and Plato speak with enthusiasm of their native climate, and the
                    fineness of the Athenian intellect was attributed to the clearness of the Attic
                    atmosphere. It was in the neighbourhood of Athens itself that the air was
                    thought to be purest. This is what Euripides refers to in the well-known passage
                    where he describes the inhabitants as “ever walking gracefully through the most
                    luminous aether” <hi rend="italic">(Med.,</hi> 829); and Milton, who is always
                    an admirable exponent of Greek literature, in like manner says—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l> “Where, on the Aegean shore, a city stands, </l>
                    <l> Built nobly, pure the air, and light the soil,— </l>
                    <l> Athens, the eye of Greece.” </l>
                </lg>
                <p>Thus it is hardly hyperbole in Xenophon to say “one would not err in thinking
                    that this city is placed near the centre of Greece—nay, of the civilised
                    world,—because, the farther removed persons are from it, the severer is the cold
                    or heat they meet with” <hi rend="italic">(Vectigal.,</hi> i. 6). To the
                    clearness of the atmosphere must be referred the distinctness with which distant
                    objects can be discerned, for from the Acropolis the lines of white marble that
                    streak the sides of Pentelicus are visible, and also the brilliant colouring
                    which is so conspicuous in an Athenian sunset. Thus Dean Stanley speaks of “the
                    flood of fire with which the marble columns, the mountains, and the sea are all
                    bathed and penetrated ;” “the violet hue which PIymettus assumes in the evening
                    sky, in contrast to the glowing furnace of the rock of Lycabettus, and the rosy
                    pyramid of Pentelicus.” And Μ. Bursian says—“Amongst the most beautiful natural
                    scenes that I have beheld I reckon the sight of Hymettus from Athens at sunset,
                    whilst the entire range, as soon as the sun begins to sink, quivers with the
                    loveliest rosy red, which gradually passes through the most varied gradations
                    into the deepest violet. No one who has not enjoyed this spectacle can
                    understand the <hi rend="italic">purpureos</hi><hi rend="italic">colies</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">florentis Hymetti</hi> of Ovid.” This otherwise perfect
                    climate is slightly marred by the prevalence of the north wind. This is
                    expressed on the Horologium of Antonius Cyr-rhestes, called the Temple or Tower
                    of the Winds, at <pb break="no"

                    bearded man of stern aspect, thickly clad, and wearing strong buskins; he blows
                    into a conch shell, which he holds in his hand as a sign of his tempestuous
                    character. This also explains the close connection between him and this country
                    in mythology, especially in the legend of Orithyia, who is the daughter of the
                    Cephisus, thus representing the mists that rise from the streams, and whom he
                    carries off with him and makes his wife. One of their offspring is called
                    Chione, or the Snow Maiden.</p>
                <p>When we turn to the vegetation of Attica, the olive first calls for our
                    attention. This tree, we learn from Herodotus (v. 82), was thought at one time
                    to have been found in that country only; and the enthusiastic praises of
                    Sophocles <hi rend="italic">(Oed.</hi><hi rend="italic">Col.,</hi> 700) teach us
                    that it was the land in which it flourished best. So great was the esteem in
                    which it was held, that in the early legend of the struggle between the gods of
                    sea and laud, Poseidon and Athena, for the patronage of the country, the sea-god
                    is represented as having to retire vanquished before the giver of the olive: and
                    at a later period the evidences of this contention were found in an ancient
                    olive tree in the Acropolis, together with three holes in the rock, said to have
                    been made by the trident of Poseidon, and to be connected with a salt well hard
                    by. The fig also found its favourite home in this country, for Demeter was said
                    to have bestowed it as a gift on the Eleusinian Phytalus, <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> “the gardener.” Both Cithaeron and Parnes must have been wooded
                    in former times; for on the former are laid the picturesque silvan scenes in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Bacchoe</hi> of Euripides, and it was from the latter that
                    the wood came which caused the neighbouring deme of Acharnae to be famous for
                    its charcoal—the dvtfpακ∈ς <hi rend="italic">TLaρvησιoι,</hi> of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Acharnions</hi><hi rend="italic">(A</hi> Aristophanes (348).
                    It was the thymy slopes of Hymettus, too, from which came the famous Hymettian
                    honey. Among the other products we must notice the marble—both that of
                    Pentelicus, which afforded a material of unrivalled purity and whiteness for
                    building the Athenian temples, and the blue marble of Hymettus—the <hi
                        rend="italic">trabes</hi><hi rend="italic">llymettioe</hi> of Horace— which
                    used to be transported to Rome for the construction of palaces. But the richest
                    of all the sources of wealth in Attica was the silver mines of Laureium, the
                    yield of which was so considerable as to render silver the principal medium of
                    exchange in Greece, so that “a silver piece” <hi rend="italic">(apγvpιov)</hi>
                    was the Greek equivalent term for money. Hence Aeschylus speaks of the Athenians
                    as possessing a “fountain of silver” <hi rend="italic">(Pers.,</hi> 235), and
                    Aristophanes makes his chorus of birds promise the audience that, if they show
                    him favour, owls from Laureium, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> silver pieces with
                    the emblem of Athens, shall never fail them (Aw., 1106). In Strabo’s time,
                    though the mines had almost ceased to yield, silver was obtained in considerable
                    quantities from the scoriae; and at the present day a large amount of lead is
                    obtained in the same way, the value of what was exported in 1869 having been
                    £177,000 sterling.</p>
                <p>Having thus noticed the general features of the country, let us proceed to
                    examine it somewhat more in detail. It has been already mentioned that the base
                    line is formed by the chain of Cithaeron and Parnes, running from west to east;
                    and that from this transverse chains run southward, dividing Attica into a
                    succession of plains. The westernmost of these, which is separated from the
                    innermost bay of the Corinthian Gulf, called the Mare Alcyonium, by an offshoot
                    of Cithaeron, and is bounded on the east by a ridge which ends towards the
                    Saronic Gulf in a striking two-horned peak called Kerata, is the plain of
                    Megara. It is only for geographical purposes that we include this district under
                    Attica, for both the Dorian race of the inhabitants, and its dangerous proximity
                    to Athens, caused it to be at perpetual feud with that city; but its position as
                    an outpost for the Peloponnesians, together with the fact of its having once
                    been Ionian soil, sufficiently explains the bitter hostility of the Athenians
                    towards the Megarians. The great importance of Megara arose from its commanding
                    all the passes into the Peloponnese. These were three in number: one along the
                    shores of the Corinthian Gulf, which, owing to the nature of the ground, makes a
                    long detour; the other two starting from Megara, and passing, the one by a lofty
                    though gradual route over the ridge of Geraneia, the other along the Saronic
                    Gulf, under the dangerous precipices of the Scironian rocks. The town of Megara,
                    which was built on and between two low hills rising out of the plain rather more
                    than a mile from the sea, had the command of both gulfs by means of its two
                    ports—that of Pegae on the Corinthian, and that of Nicaea on the Saronic. The
                    necessities of the case occasionally brought the Megarians and their powerful
                    neighbours together; for the former greatly depended on Athens for their
                    supplies, as we see from their famished state, as described by Aristophanes in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ackamians</hi> (729 <hi rend="italic">seq.),</hi> when
                    excluded from the ports and markets of that country.</p>
                <p>To the east of the plain of Megara lies that of Eleusis, bounded on the one side
                    by the chain of Kerata, and on the other by that of Aegaleos, through a
                    depression in which was the line of the sacred way, where the torchlight
                    processions from Athens used to descend to the coast, the “brightly-gleaming
                    shores” (λαμ,7rαδες <hi rend="italic">aκτaC)</hi> of Sophocles <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Oed.</hi><hi rend="italic">Col.,</hi> 1049). Here a deep bay runs into the
                    land, opposite to which, and separated from it by a strait, which forms a
                    succession of graceful curves, was the rocky island of Salamis, at all times an
                    important possession to the Athenians on account of its proximity to their city.
                    The scene of the battle of Salamis was the narrowest part of this channel, where
                    the island approaches the extremity of Aegaleos; and it was on the last
                    declivities of that mountain that—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l> “A king sate on the rocky brow </l>
                    <l> Which looks o’er sea-born Salamis.” </l>

                <p>The eastern portion of this plain was called the Thriasian plain, and the city of
                    Eleusis was situated in the recesses of the bay. The coast-line of this part,
                    between the sanctuary of Poseidon at the isthmus, which was originally Ionian,
                    and Athens, is the principal scene of the achievements of Theseus, a hero who
                    holds the same relation to the Ionians of Greece proper as Hercules does to the
                    Greeks at large, viz., that of being the great author of improvements in the
                    country. In this instance his feats seem to describe the establishment of a safe
                    means of communication. On the isthmus itself he destroys the monster Sinis, the
                    “ravager,” otherwise called Pityocamptes, or the “pine-bender,” which names
                    imply that he is the embodiment of a violent wind, though the legend grew up
                    that he fastened his victims to the bent branches of two pines, by the rebound
                    of which they were torn in sunder. His next exploit is near Crommyon, where he
                    destroys a wild sow, called Phaea, or “the dusky,” which probably means that he
                    checked a torrent, since violent watercourses are often represented by that
                    animal in Greek mythology. Then follows the struggle with the brigand Sciron,
                    who signifies the dangerous wind, which blows with such violence in this
                    district that at Athens the north-west wind received the name of Sciron from the
                    neighbouring Scironian rocks; the pass, which skirts the sea at the base of the
                    cliffs, is now known by the ill-omened title of Kake Scala, and is-still
                    regarded as a perilous transit. Finally, between Eleusis and Athens, Theseus
                    overcomes Procrustes, or “the racker,” who apparently represents the dangers of
                    the pass between Eleusis and Athens, now called Daphne; for the ridge of Mount
                    Aegaleos hard by was in ancient <pb break="no"

                    told by Diodorus (iv. 59), was the scene of the contest.</p>
                <p>Next in order to the plain of Eleusis came that of Athens, which is the most
                    extensive of all, reaching from the foot of Parnes to the sea, and bounded on
                    the west by Aegaleos, and on the east by Hymettus. Its most conspicuous feature
                    is the broad line of dark green along its western side, formed by the
                    olive-groves of Colonus and the gardens of the Academus, which owe their
                    fertility to the waters of the Cephisus, by which they are irrigated. This river
                    is fed by copious sources on the side of Mount Parnes, and thus, unlike the
                    other rivers of Attica, has a constant supply of water; but it does not reach
                    the sea, nor did it apparently in classical times, having been diverted, then as
                    now, into the neighbouring plantations; <hi rend="italic">for</hi> this is what
                    Sophocles means when he speaks of “the sleepless fountains of Cephisus, which
                    stray forth from their channels” <hi rend="italic">(Oed.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    two bare knolls of lightcoloured earth, which caused the poet in the same chorus
                    to apply the epithet “white” (άργ^τα) to that place. On the opposite side of the
                    plain runs the other river, the Ilissus, which rises from a beautiful fountain
                    in Mount Hymettus, and skirts the eastern extremity of the city of Athens; but
                    this, notwithstanding its celebrity, is a mere brook, which stands in pools a
                    great part of the year, and in summer is completely dry. The situation of Athens
                    relatively to the surrounding objects is singularly harmonious; for, while it
                    forms a central point, so as to be the eye of the plain, and while the
                    altar-rock of the Acropolis and the hills by which it is surrounded are
                    conspicuous from every point of view, there is no such exactness in its position
                    as to give formality, since it is nearer to the sea than to Parnes, and nearer
                    to Hymettus than to Aegaleos. The most striking summit in the neighbourhood of
                    the city is that of Lyca-bettus, now Mount St George, on the north-eastern side;
                    and the variety is still further increased by the continuation of the ridge
                    which it forms for some distance northwards through the plain. Three roads lead
                    to Athens from the Boeotian frontier over the intervening mountain barrier—the
                    easternmost over Parnes, from Delium and Oropus by Deceleia, which was the usual
                    route of the invading Lacedaemonians during the Peloponnesian War; the
                    westernmost over Cithaeron, by the pass of Dryoscephalae, or the “Oakheads,”
                    leading from Thebes by Plataea to Eleusis, and so to Athens, which we hear of in
                    connection with the battle of Plataea, and with the escape of the Plataeans at
                    the time of the siege of that city in the Peloponnesian War; the third, midway
                    between the two, by the pass of Phyle, near the summit of which, on a rugged
                    height overlooking the Athenian plain, is the fort occupied by Thrasybulus in
                    the days of the Thirty Tyrants. On the sea-coast to the south-west of Athens
                    rises the hill of Munychia, a mass of rocky ground, forming the acropolis of the
                    town of Piraeeus, which was once separated from the mainland; for Strabo (i. 3,
                    § 18) speaks of it as having been formerly an island. On one side of this,
                    towards Hymettus, lay the open roadstead of Phalerum, on the other the harbour
                    of Piraeeus, a completely land-locked inlet, safe, deep, and spacious, the
                    approach to which was still further narrowed by moles. The eastern side of the
                    hill was further indented by two small but commodious havens, which were
                    respectively called Zea and Munychia.</p>
                <p>The north-eastern boundary of the plain of Athens is formed by the graceful
                    pyramid of Pentelicus, which received its name from the deme of Pentele at its
                    foot, but was far more commonly known as Brilessus in ancient times,. This
                    mountain did not form a continuous chain with Hymettus, for between them
                    intervenes a level space of ground two miles in width, which formed the entrance
                    to the Mesogaea, an elevated undulating plain in the midst of the mountains,
                    reaching nearly to Sunium. At the extremity of Hymettus, where it projects into
                    the Saronic Gulf, was the promontory of Zoster, or “the Girdle,” which was so
                    called because it girdles and protects the neighbouring harbour; but in
                    consequence of the name, a legend was attached to it, to the effect that Latona
                    had loosed her girdle there. From this promontory to Sunium there runs a lower
                    line of mountains, and between these and the sea a fertile strip of land
                    intervenes, which was called the Paralia. Beyond Sunium, on the eastern coast,
                    were two safe ports, that of Thoricus, which is defended by the island of
                    Helene, forming a natural breakwater in front of it, and that of Prasiae, now
                    called Porto Raphti, or “the Tailor,” from a statue at the entrance to which the
                    natives have given that name. But it still remains to mention the most famous
                    spot of ground in Attica, the little plain of Marathon, which lay in the
                    north-east corner, encircled on three sides by Parnes and Pentelicus, while the
                    fourth faces the sea and the opposite coast of Euboea. It was on the mountain
                    slopes that the Greeks were stationed, while the Persians with their ships
                    occupied the coast; and on the two sides the marshes may still be traced by
                    which the movements of the invader’s host were impeded. The mound, which at once
                    attracts the eye in the centre of the level plain, is probably the burial-place
                    of the Athenians who fell in the battle. The bay in front is sheltered by
                    Euboea, and is still more protected from the north by a projecting tongue of
                    land, called Cynosura. The mountains in the neighbourhood were the seat of one
                    of the political parties in Attica, the Diacrii or Hyperacrii, who, being poor
                    mountaineers, and having nothing to lose, were the principal advocates of
                    change; while, on the other hand, the Pedieis, or inhabitants of the plains,
                    being wealthy landholders, formed the strong conservative element, and the
                    Parali, or occupants of the sea-coast, representing the mercantile interest,
                    held an intermediate position between the two. Finally, there was one district
                    of Attica, that lay without its natural boundaries, the territory of Oropus,
                    which properly belonged to Boeotia, as it was situated to the north of Parnes;
                    but on this the Athenians always endeavoured to retain a firm hold, because it
                    facilitated their communications with Euboea. The command of that island was of
                    the utmost importance to them; for, if Aegina could rightly be called “the
                    eyesore of the Piraeeus,” Euboea was quite as truly a thorn in the side of
                    Attica; for w e leam from Demosthenes <hi rend="italic">(De Cor.,</hi> p. 307)
                    that at one period the pirates that made it their headquarters so infested the
                    neighbouring sea as to prevent all navigation.</p>
                <p>Of the condition of Attica in mediaeval and modern times little need be said, for
                    it has followed for the most part the fortunes of Athens. The population,
                    however, has undergone a great change, independently of the large admixture of
                    Slavonic blood that has affected the Greeks of the mainland generally, by the
                    immigration of Albanian colonists, who now occupy a great part of the country.
                    The most important of the classical ruins that remain outside Athens are those
                    of the temple of Athena at Sunium, which form a conspicuous object as they
                    surmount the headland, and gave rise to the name which it bore, until lately, of
                    Cape Colonnae; it is in the Doric style, of white marble, and 13 columns of the
                    temple and a pilaster are now standing. At Eleusis the foundations of the <hi
                        rend="italic">propylaea</hi> of the great temple of Demeter and other
                    buildings have been laid bare by excavation; at Thoricus there are remains of an
                    ancient theatre; and at Rhamnus, northward from Marathon, at a little distance
                    from the sea, are the basements and some of the columns of two temples in the
                    same enclosure, which were dedicated to Nemesis and Themis. <hi rend="smallcaps"
