                    to account for the outward current into the Black Sea, it was long supposed to
                    possess direct communication with the Northern Ocean, and, when it was
                    discovered that there was no visible channel, recourse was had to a “secret
                    sluice;” there being, it was thought, but a comparatively narrow isthmus to be
                    crossed. In some prehistoric time, according to Pallas and Murchison, a
                    connection with the Caspian Sea seems to have existed; but no great change has
                    taken place in regard to the character or relations of the Sea of Azof! since
                    our earliest records. It lies between 45° 20' and 47° 18' N.lat., and between
                    35° and 39°E.long., its length from S.W. to N.E. being about 235 miles, and its
                    greatest breadth 110. It is for the most part comparatively shallow; the deepest
                    portion forming as it were a prolongation of the bed of the Don, its largest
                    and, indeed, its only very important tributary. Near the mouth of that river the
                    depth varies from 3 to 10 feet, and the greatest depth does not exceed 44 feet.
                    Fierce and continuous winds from the E. prevail during July and August, and in
                    the later part of the year those from the N.E. and S.E. are not unusual. A great
                    variety of currents are thus produced, and the relative depths of the differents
                    parts of the sea are greatly modified. From December to March the whole surface
                    is generally frozen. The water is for the most part comparatively fresh, but
                    differs considerably in this respect according to locality and current. Fish are
                    so abundant that the Turks use the name <hi rend="italic">Baluk-Denis,</hi> or
                    Fish-Sea. To the W., separated from the main basin by the long, narrow spit of
                    Arabat, lies the remarkable series of lagunes and marshes known as the Sivash,
                    or Putrid Sea. Here the water is intensely salt, and at the same time swarms
                    with life. The Sea of Azoff is of great importance to Russian commerce, and a
                    number of flourishing cities have grown up along its shores. Of these the most
                    important are Taganrog, Berdiansk, Mariupol, and Yenikale. Unfortunately, there
                    is a lack of safe and commodious harbours and roads.</p>
