                    famous leader of the Huns, sur-named the “Fear of the World,” or the “Scourge of
                    God,” was born probably about 406 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> His father
                    Mundzuk, king of the Huns, was succeeded by his brothers Octar and Rhuas; and on
                    the death of Rhuas, in 434, Attila and his brother Bleda together ascended the
                    throne. They ruled not only over the Huns, but over nearly all the tribes north
                    of the Danube and the Black Sea; under their banners fought Ostrogoths, Gepidae,
                    Alani, Heruli, and many other Teutonic peoples. Their dominions are said to have
                    extended from the Rhine to the frontiers of China. Attila was superstitiously
                    reverenced by his countrymen; he was said to possess the iron sword of the
                    war-god, Mars, and he proclaimed himself to be the man-child born at Engaddi,
                    who was destined to rule over the whole world. In 441 and 442 the brothers
                    ravaged Thrace and Illyria, defeated the troops of the Eastern Empire in three
                    great battles, and penetrated as far as Thermopylae. Peace was made on the
                    Romans agreeing to pay a heavy tribute. About this time Attila contrived to make
                    away with his brother Bleda, and thus secured undivided supremacy. In 445 and
                    the following years, he again directed his attacks against the Eastern Empire,
                    and laid waste the whole country round Constantinople. Nowhere did he meet with
                    resistance save from the brave little town of Azimus. The empire seemed about to
                    succumb, when Theodosius entered into negotiations and made terms with his
                    conqueror. While matters were being arranged, a plot was laid to assassinate
                    Attila, in which the emperor was implicated. The conspiracy was discovered, and
                    the barbarian upbraided the Christian monarch with his want of honour and manly
                    courage. Theodosius died soon after, and his successor, Marcian, returned a firm
                    refusal to Attila’s demands for tribute. War seemed inevitable; but at this time
                    the attention of the Hun was drawn to the Western Empire. It is said that the
                    Princess Honoria, sister of Valentinian, tired of her life of enforced celibacy,
                    sent her ring and an offer of her hand to Attila, who upon this grounded his
                    claim to a part of the empire. It is probable, however, that he merely used this
                    as a pretext, and that his real designs were more comprehensive. He evidently
                    thought it a favourable opportunity for taking advantage of the enmity between
                    the Romans and the Visigoths; and to this plan he was also induced by the
                    proposals of Genseric, king of the Vandals, who offered to unite with him
                    against his rival, Theodoric, king of the Visigoths. In 451 Attila assembled his
                    forces, it is said 700,000 strong, led them through the centre of Germany,
                    probably by Franconia, and crossed the Rhine, at what place cannot be
                    determined. He defeated the Burgundians, and pushed on through the heart of
                    Gaul, until his centre was checked by the valiant resistance offered <pb

                    Roman general, had collected and united their forces, and marching with all
                    speed, arrived in time to raise the siege of Orleans. Attila retreated to a
                    position in the plain of Chalons, and there concentrated his forces for a great
                    engagement. A tremendous battle ensued—one of the most gigantic as well as most
                    important contests recorded in history. The Romans, who formed one wing, were
                    driven back, and although they kept together, and at nightfall retired to the
                    camp of the Visigoths, Aëtius had given up the day as lost. The Visigoths, who
                    were on the other wing, had also been repulsed, and were discouraged by the fall
                    of their leader Theodoric. But the fortune of the day was changed by the
                    impetuous bravery of Thorismund, Theo-doric’s son, who, burning to avenge his
                    father’s fall, led on the infuriated Visigoths, and drove Attila back to his
                    camp. He even penetrated into the fortifications, but was wounded and thrown
                    from his horse, and his followers with difficulty carried him off. Next day,
                    Attila remained in his camp in expectation of an attack, and having thrown all
                    his baggage into a gigantic pile in the centre of the camp to be burned in case
                    of defeat, resolved to sell his life dearly. But no attack was made; for
                    Thorismund was persuaded by Aëtius to march to Toulouse in order to obtain his
                    father’s kingdom. Attila was thus enabled to retire in perfect security. Next
                    year he poured his forces through the defiles of the Alps, and laid waste the
                    whole north of Italy. Rome itself seemed likely to fall before the invader, w
                    hen his course was arrested by an embassy headed by Pope Leo. Attila at once
                    withdrew from Italy, but the motive which led him to act thus is not known. At
                    the time his retreat was ascribed to a miraculous interposition of Providence,
                    Peter and Paul having appeared in the camp of the Huns along with the embassy.
                    The whole matter is rather obscure; and scarcely more credible is the story told
                    by Jornandes that Attila invaded Gaul a second time and was completely defeated
                    by Thorismund. No other historian mentions this circumstance. In the year 453,
                    Attila died from the bursting of a blood-vessel on the night of his marriage
                    with a beautiful Gothic maiden, called Ildiko, or Hilda. He was buried by his
                    followers with great pomp and lamentation. The vast empire over which he had
                    ruled broke up immediately after his death, no one chief being powerful enough
                    to seize the supremacy. In person Attila is described as having been of true
                    Hunnish type, short, but strongly made, with a large head, flat, widespread
                    nostrils, and small glittering eyes. His presence was majestic and imposing, and
                    he excelled all his followers in military exercises.</p>
