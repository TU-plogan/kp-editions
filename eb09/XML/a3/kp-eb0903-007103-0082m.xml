                    rapidly into importance as a manufacturing and commercial town, and its merchant
                    princes, the Fuggers and Weisers, rivalled the Medici of Florence; but the
                    alterations produced in the currents of trade by the discoveries of the 15th and
                    16th centuries occasioned a great decline. In 1276 it was raised to the rank of
                    a free imperial city, which it retained, with many changes in its internal
                    constitution, till 1806, when it was annexed to the kingdom of Bavaria.

                    importance. It was besieged and taken by Gustavus Adolphus in 1632, and in 1635
                    it surrendered to the imperial forces; in 1703 it was bombarded by the electoral
                    prince of Bavaria, and forced to pay a contribution of 400,000 dollars; and in

                    those which gave birth to the Augsburg confession (1530) and to the Augsburg
                    alliance (1686).</p>
                <p>The city is pleasantly situated in an extensive and fertile plain, between the
                    rivers Wertach and Lech, 36 miles W.N.W. of Munich, lat. 48° 2Γ 44* N., long.
                    10° 54' 42" E. Its fortifications were dismantled in 1703, and have since been
                    converted into public promenades. Maximilian Street is remarkable for its
                    breadth and architectural magnificence. One of its most interesting edifices is
                    the Fugger House, of which the entire front is painted in fresco. Among the
                    public buildings of Augsburg most worthy of notice is the town-hall, said to be
                    one of the finest in Germany, built by Elias Holl in 1616-20. One of its rooms,
                    called the “Golden Hall,” from the profusion of its gilding, is 113 feet long,
                    59 broad, and 53 high. The palace of the bishops, where the memorable Confession
                    of Faith was presented to Charles V., is now used for Government offices. The
                    cathedral dates in its oldest portions from the 10th century. There are also
                    various churches and chapels, a school of arts, a polytechnic institution, a
                    picture gallery in the former monastery of St Catherine, a museum, observatory,
                    botanical gardens, an exchange, gymnasium, deaf-mute institution, orphan asylum,
                    public library, several remarkable fountains dating from the 16th century,
                    &amp;c. The “Fuggerei,” built in 1519 by the brothers Fugger, consists of 106
                    small houses, let to indigent Roman Catholic citizens at a merely nominal rent.
                    The manufactures of Augsburg are various and important, consisting of woollen,
                    linen, cotton, and silk goods, watches, jewellery, and goldsmith-work,
                    mathematical instruments, machinery, leather, paper, chemical stuffs, types,
                    &lt;fcc. Copper-engraving, for which it was formerly noted, is no longer carried
                    on; but printing, lithography, and publishing have acquired a considerable
                    development, one of the beshknown Continental newspapers being the <hi

                    Gazette.</hi> Augsburg is an important railway junction. On the opposite side of
                    the river, which is here crossed by a bridge, lies the little village of
                    Lechhausen. Population in 1871, 51,270.</p>
