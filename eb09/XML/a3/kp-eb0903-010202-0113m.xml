                    ablest English writers on jurisprudence, was born on the 3d March 1790. At an
                    early age he entered the army, and passed five years in military service. He
                    then retired, applied himself to the study of law, and was called to the bar in
                    1814. His powers, though admirably adapted for grasping the fundamental
                    principles of law, were not of a nature to render him successful in legal
                    practice. His health, too, was delicate, and in 1825 he resigned active
                    employment at the bar. In the following year, however, he was appointed to the
                    chair of jurisprudence in the newly-founded London university. He immediately
                    crossed over to Germany to prepare himself for his new duties, and at Bonn
                    became acquainted with some of the most eminent German jurists. His lectures
                    were at first attended by a number and a class of students quite beyond his
                    anticipations. Among his hearers were such men as Lord Romilly, Sir G. C. Lewis,
                    and J. S. Mill. From Mill’s notes some of the lectures were afterwards
                    published, and he has given an admirable account of Austin in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertations</hi> (vol. iii.) But it soon became apparent that
                    there would be no steady demand for training in the science of law, which,
                    though useful, was not of immediate utility in practice. Under these
                    circumstances Austin, who was almost too conscientious in regard to his own
                    work, thought it right to resign the chair in 1832. An attempt to institute
                    lectures at the Inner Temple also failed, and, as his health was delicate, ho
                    retired to Boulogne, where he remained for nearly two years. In 1837 he acted as
                    royal commissioner in Malta, and discharged the duties of that office most
                    efficiently. The next ten years were spent in travelling on the Continent, as
                    the state of his health hardly permitted him to reside in England. The
                    Revolution of 1848 drove him from Paris, and on his return to England he settled
                    at Weybridge, in Surrey, where he remained till his death in December 1859.
                    Austin wrote one or two pamphlets, but the chief work he published was his <hi
                    rend="italic">Province of Jurisprudence Determined</hi> (1832), a treatise on
                    the relation between ethics and law, which gives a clear analysis of the notion
                    of obligation, and an admirable statement of utilitarianism, the ethical theory
                    adopted by the author. After his death, his widow, Mrs Sarah Austin, published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Jurisprudence; or, The Philosophy of Positive
                    Law.</hi> These, combined with the <hi rend="italic">Province,</hi> have been
                    edited, under the same title, by Mr R. Campbell, and reached in 1875 a fifth
                    edition.</p>
