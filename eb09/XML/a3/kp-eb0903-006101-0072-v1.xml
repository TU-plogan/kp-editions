                    the friend of Cicero, was one of the most distinguished men during the period of
                    the decline and fall of the Roman republic. His life gives an admirable picture
                    of the classical man of culture, who, withdrawing from the stir of political
                    affairs, devoted himself to literary and artistic pursuits. He was born at Rome
                    109 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and was thus three years older than Cicero,
                    along with whom he and the younger Marius were educated. His family is said to
                    have been of noble and ancient descent; his father belonged to the equestrian
                    order, and was very wealthy. When Pomponius (who afterwards received the surname
                    Atticus, on account of his long residence at Athens, and his intimate
                    acquaintance with Greek literature) was still a young man, his father died, and
                    he at once took the prudent resolution of transferring himself and his fortune
                    to Athens, in order to escape the dangers of the civil war, in which he might
                    have been involved through his connection with the murdered tribune Sulpicius
                    Rufus. Here, in retirement, he contrived to keep himself free from the
                    entanglements of faction, while preserving friendly relations with all parties.
                    Sulla, who urged him to come to Rome and join his party, took no offence at his
                    refusal, but treated him with marked kindness. He assisted the younger Marius
                    and Brutus with money when they were fleeing from their enemies, and remained on
                    the most cordial terms with Caesar and Pompey, Antony and Octavianus. His most
                    intimate friend, however, was Cicero, whose correspondence with him extended
                    over many years, and who seems to have found his prudent counsel and sympathy a
                    remedy for all his many troubles. His private life was tranquil and happy. He
                    did not marry till he was 53 years of age, and his only child became the wife of
                    Vipsanius Agrippa, the distinguished minister of Augustus. His large fortune was
                    increased on the death of his uncle, L. Caecilius, who bequeathed to him the
                    greater part of his property. He formed a large library at Athens, and kept a
                    staff of slaves engaged in making copies of valuable works. He probably derived
                    considerable profits from the sale of these books. In 32 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.</hi> he was seized with an illness believed to be incurable. He
                    resolved not to protract a painful and hopeless struggle, and died after five
                    days of voluntary starvation. As might have been expected from his easy temper
                    and equable disposition, Atticus professed a mild Epicureanism,
                    but.philosophical problems, as such, do not seem to have had much interest for
                    him; he was emphatically a man of literature. Of his writings none are extant,
                    but we have notices of two, one a Greek history of Cicero’s consulship, the
                    other, in Latin, on Roman annals, a subject to which he had given much
                    attention. This work was highly commended for its minute exactness,
                    chronological accuracy, and simple style.</p>
