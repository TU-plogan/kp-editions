                    most eastern of the three peninsular promontories which stretch south from the
                    coast of Turkey <hi rend="italic">(Macedonia),</hi> like the prongs of a
                    trident, into the Archipelago. The name is, however, frequently extended to the
                    whole peninsula which was formerly known as Acte. The peak rises like a pyramid,
                    with a steep summit of white marble, to a height of 6780 feet, and can be seen
                    at sunset from the plain of Troy on the one hand, and on the other from the
                    slopes of Olympus. The whole peninsula is remarkable for the beauty of its
                    scenery, with rocky heights and richly-wooded flanks, ravines “embowered from
                    the light,” and glimpses or free outlook over the surrounding sea. The climate
                    is for the most part healthy and pleasant, though the western side is perhaps
                    too much exposed to the heats of summer; and Lucian assures us that in ancient
                    times the inhabitants were famous for longevity. Several towns, such as Sane,
                    Dium, Olophyxus, Cleonae, are mentioned by Greek and Latin writers as existing
                    in the Peninsula; but none of them seem to have attained any great importance,
                    and the most remarkable event in the ancient history of Athos is the
                    construction by Xerxes of a ship-canal across the isthmus between the outer sea
                    and the Singitic gulf. Traces of this canal, which was regarded by Juvenal as a
                    Greek myth, have been found almost right across the neck of land, and leave no
                    doubt of the truth of the story. In more modern times the district of Athos has
                    been famous for the number of hermits and monks that have found shelter in its
                    retreats. No fewer than 935 churches, chapels, and oratories are said to exist,
                    and many of the communities possess considerable wealth. It is believed that,
                    with the exception of the dwellings of Pompeii, some buildings in</p>
                <p>Athos are the oldest specimens of domestic architecture in Europe; the shrines
                    are in many cases richly decorated with goldsmith’s work of great antiquity; the
                    wealth of the monastic libraries in illuminated manuscripts has long been
                    celebrated; and nowhere, according to Mr Tozer, can the Byzantine school of
                    painting be studied with equal advantage. The date of the oldest religious
                    foundation in the peninsula is not clearly ascertained, and the traditional
                    chronology of the monks themselves can hardly be trusted. A bull of Romanus
                    Lecapenus speaks of the restoration of the monastery of Xeropotamu in 924, and
                    as early as 885 a rescript of Basil the Macedonian forbids the molestation of
                    the “holy hermits.” Lavra, on Mount Athos proper, was founded by St Athanasius
                    in 960; the village of Caryes or “The Hazels,” was appointed as the seat of
                    government about the same time; and shortly afterwards there followed the
                    establishments Iveron (τών Ι∕3rjpωv), Vatopedi (∕3ατo7τeδi,ov), and Sphigmenu
                    (τoυ Εσφtγju∈voυ). The family of the Comneni (1056-1204) bestowed great
                    privileges on the existing monastaries, and added to their number. In the reign
                    of Alexius the first purely Slavonic monastery (that of Chilandari) was founded
                    by the Servian prince Stephen Nemenja. The taking of Constantinople by the
                    Latins in 1204 brought persecution and pillage on the monks; this reminded them
                    of earlier Saracenic invasions, and led them to appeal for protection to Pope
                    Innocent III., who gave them a favourable reply. Under the Palaeologi they
                    recovered their prosperity, and were enriched by gifts from various sources. In
                    the 14th century the peninsula became the chosen retreat of several of the
                    emperors, and the monasteries were thrown into commotion by the famous dispute
                    about the mystical Hesychasts. Their numbers were gradually increased by the
                    foundation of St Dionysius, Simopetra, Constamonitu, Russico, St Paul. In the
                    15th century the monks made terms with the Turkish conqueror Amurath, and have
                    since been molested by none of the sultans, except Soliman the Magnificent, who
                    laid waste some parts of the peninsula. In 1545 Stavroniceta, the last
                    monastery, was added to the list. The hospodars of Wallachia, who were
                    recognised as the protectors of Athos, enriched the communities with lands; but
                    a process of secularisation was commenced by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n26/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0026-0015"/> Capodistrias, who confiscated their holdings in
                    Greece; and more recently they have been stripped of theiι possessions in the
                    Danubian principalities. They still retain some property in parts of the
                    Archipelago. A Turkish official resides at Caryes, and collects the taxes, which
                    amount to about ten shillings a head; but for the most part the peninsula is
                    autonomous, being governed by an administrative body of four presidents
                    (ότιστάται), one of whom bears the title of “First Man of Athos,” and a
                    representative body called the Holy Synod, which consists of twenty members, one
                    from each of the monasteries proper. These twenty communities are partly
                    Ccenobitic, with a common stock and a warden, and partly Idiorrhyth-mic, with a
                    kind of republican government and great individual liberty. Besides these
                    regular monasteries, there are a number of <hi rend="italic">ασκητήρια,</hi> or
                    sketes, which consist of several small associations gathered round a central
                    church, and numerous little communities known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >καθίσματα,</hi> or retreats, as well as genuine hermitages. Harmony is not
                    always maintained between the different establishments, as was shown by a bitter
                    dispute about a water-course between Cutlumusi and Pantocratoros, which led to
                    the interference of the British consuls of Salonica and Cavalia, in answer to an
                    appeal from some Ionian monks who were British subjects (1853). For the most
                    part, however, the inhabitants of Athos are quiet and moderately industrious.
                    They are said to number about 3000, all men; for no female, even of the lower
                    animals, is permitted to desecrate the precincts of the Holy Mountain.</p>
