                <p><label type="entry">AVERAGE</label>, a term used in maritime commerce to signify
                    damages or expenses resulting from the accidents of navigation. Average is
                    either <hi rend="italic">general</hi> or <hi rend="italic">particular.</hi>
                    General average arises when sacrifices have been made, or expenditures incurred,
                    for the preservation of the ship, cargo, and freight, from some peril of the
                    sea, or from its effects. It implies a subsequent contribution, from all the
                    parties concerned, rateably to the values of their respective interests, to make
                    good the loss thus occasioned. Particular average signifies the damage or
                    partial loss happening to the ship, goods, or freight by some fortuitous or
                    unavoidable accident. It is borne by the parties to whose property the
                    misfortune happens, or by their insurers. The term average originally meant what
                    is now distinguished as general average j and the expression “particular
                    average, although not strictly accurate, came to be afterwards used for the
                    convenience of distinguishing those damages or paιtial <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0161-0146"/> losses for which no general contribution
                    could be claimed.</p>
                <p>Although nothing can be more simple than the fundamental principle of general
                    average, that a loss incurred for the advantage of all the coadventurers should
                    be made good by them all in equitable proportion to their stakes in the
                    adventure, the application of this principle to the varied and complicated cases
                    which occur in the course of maritime commerce has given rise to many
                    diversities of usage at different periods and in different countries. It is «oon
                    discovered that the principle cannot be applied in any settled or consistent
                    manner unless by the aid of rules of a technical and sometimes of a seemingly
                    arbitrary character. The distinctions on which these rules turn are often very
                    τefined indeed. This is the chief reason why no real progress has yet been made
                    towards an international system of general average, notwithstanding repeated
                    conferences and other efforts by most competent representatives from different
                    countries, seeking to arrive at a common understanding as a preliminary basis
                    for such a system. A brief summary only can be given here of the rules which
                    have been established in Great Britain by usage, or by legal decisions, in
                    connection with the subject.</p>
                <p>All general average losses may be divided into two principal classes—(1), <hi
                        rend="italic">sacrifices</hi> of part of the cargo and freight, or of part
                    of the ship, for the general safety; (2), <hi rend="italic">extraordinary
                        expenditures</hi> incurred with the same object. We shall notice these in
                    their order.</p>
                <p>When a part of a <hi rend="italic">cargo</hi> is thrown overboard <hi
                        rend="italic">(or jettisoned,</hi> as it is termed) to save the ship from
                    foundering in a storm, or to float her when stranded, or to facilitate her
                    escape from an enemy, the loss of the goods and of the freight attached to them
                    must be made good by average contribution. But if goods jettisoned have been
                    originally stowed on deck, no contribution can be demanded for them, unless they
                    are so carried according to the common usage and course of trade on the voyage
                    for which they are shipped, or with the consent of all the parties concerned in
                    the ship and cargo.</p>
                <p>If, instead of being thrown overboard, the goods are put into boats or lighters,
                    and lost or damaged before reaching the shore, such loss is regarded as a
                    virtual jettison, and gives a claim to average contribution. The same rule
                    applies to damage occasioned by the goods being put ashore on muddy ground, or
                    where they cannot be kept in ordinary safety. But when the goods have been
                    conveyed to a place of ordinary safety, they cease to be at the risk of the
                    general interest; and should they be damaged there by fire or other accidents
                    the loss must be borne by the individual proprietors, or by their insurers.</p>
                <p>Damage done to the cargo by discharging it at a port of refuge in the manner and
                    under the circumstances •customary at that port, is not allowed as general
                    average. This rule covers the case of wastage, breakage, leakage, &lt;tc., from
                    handling the goods in the ordinary course of -discharging, warehousing, and
                    reshipping.</p>
                <p>If goods are thrown overboard from having become, Through heating or other cause
                    peculiar to their own condition, a source of special danger to the whole
                    interest, the loss is not recoverable in general average. So, too, if a cargo is
                    discharged at a port of refuge from damage resulting from its own <hi
                        rend="italic">vice</hi><hi rend="italic">propre,</hi> the costs are
                    chargeable to its owners.</p>
                <p>The loss of corn, salt, guano, or similar goods, arising from their being pumped
                    up or baled out with the water in the vessel, is not recoverable by average
                    contribution. The damage done to the cargo by means of water thrown down the
                    hatches, or admitted into the ship by scuttling her, for the purpose of
                    extinguishing an accidental fire, was excluded from general average by the usage
                    of Lloyds up till 1873. In that year the courts of Queen’s Bench and Exchequer
                    Chamber expressed a strong opinion in connection with the case of Stewart <hi
                        rend="italic">v.</hi> the West India and Pacific Steamship Company, that
                    such damage ought to be made good by average contribution. The usage has now
                    been altered accordingly.</p>
                <p>The amount of compensation to be made for goods sacrificed by general average
                    acts is determined by the net market price they would have produced on arrival
                    at the port of destination had they not been sacrificed; but under deduction of
                    the freight attaching to them (which is made good to the shipowners), and of the
                    charges for duties and landing expenses which are saved.</p>
                <p>The general average acts next to be considered are those which involve sacrifices
                    of part of the <hi rend="italic">ship or her materials.</hi></p>
                <p>The same principles which regulate the case of goods thrown overboard apply also
                    to the jettison of the ship’s chains, anchors, hawsers, spars, boats, or other
                    stores. But if water-casks are stowed on deck, or if chains and hawsers are
                    carried on deck when the vessel is not near the land so as to render it
                    necessary that they should be so carried, the loss arising from the jettison of
                    these articles falls on the shipowner; and if boats are jettisoned in
                    consequence of their having been broken adrift from their fastenings on deck by
                    the force of the sea, they are excluded from general average, and are charged to
                    particular average on the ship. The damage done to the ship by cutting holes to
                    effect a jettison of the cargo, or to pour down water to a fire, or by scuttling
                    her for that purpose, is allowed as a general average charge. The damage arising
                    from cutting or knocking away a portion of the ship’s bulwarks in order to
                    prevent the deck from being flooded in a storm, is compensated in the same
                    manner.</p>
                <p>When sails or masts are cut away in order to right a ship which has been thrown
                    on her beam-ends, or to prevent her from driving on a lee-shore, the loss is
                    made good by average contribution; but if the object in cutting away a sail or
                    spar be merely to <hi rend="italic">save a mast,</hi> the loss is not made good
                    in general average.</p>
                <p>It frequently happens that masts or yards are sprung and carried away by the
                    force of the wind, and are left entangled in the rigging, or hanging over the
                    ship’s side in what is termed “a state of wreck ;” in these circumstances it
                    becomes necessary to cut them away, with the sails and rigging attached, and to
                    throw the whole overboard, otherwise they would impede the navigation, and
                    endanger the ship and cargo. On this ground it is held by some authorities that
                    the loss caused by the act of cutting them away should be made good by average
                    contribution. But this act is the direct consequence of the previous accident,
                    which places these articles in a situation where it is impossible to save them
                    without imperilling the ship, cargo, and lives. It would not be reasonable to
                    imperil these for such a purpose; whence it follows that the displaced articles
                    are already <hi rend="italic">virtually</hi> lost by means of the original
                    accident, before the loss is <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> consummated by
                    cutting them away. This loss is accordingly excluded, by the usage of this
                    country, from average contribution. On the same principle, no contribution can
                    be demanded for any articles which are sacrificed as having themselves become,
                    through previous accident, the immediate cause of danger to the whole
                    interest.</p>
                <p>The loss of sails or spars, in consequence of carrying a press of canvas to avoid
                    a lee-shore, or to escape from an enemy, is not the subject of general average
                    in this country; neither is the damage suffered by the ship from <hi
                        rend="italic">straining,</hi> under any such extraordinary press of
                    sail.</p>
                <p>When anchors and cables are slipped from in order to work a vessel off a
                    lee-shore, or to avoid collision with another ship, the loss is made good by
                    average contribution; but if the cable is slipped in order* that the vessel may
                    join convoy, or because the anchor has become <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n162/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0162-0147"/> hooked to some object at the bottom and
                    cannot be raised, the loss is borne by the shipowner.</p>
                <p>When sails, ropes, or other materials are cut up and used at sea for the purpose
                    of stopping leaks or to rig jury-masts, or when the common benefit requires that
                    they should be applied to some purpose for which they were not originally
                    intended, the loss is made good in general average. The same rule applies to the
                    case of hawsers, cables, anchors, sails, or boats, lost or damaged in attempting
                    to force off a stranded vessel from the shore.</p>
                <p>The damage sustained in defending a ship against a pirate or an enemy is not the
                    subject of general average in this country; it is treated as particular average
                    on the ship.</p>
                <p>It has been much debated by writers on maritime law, whether the voluntary
                    stranding of a ship, in order to prevent her from foundering, should be treated
                    as a general •or as a particular average loss. In the United States it has been
                    settled, by judicial decision, that the loss in question constitutes a general
                    average claim; but the opposite doctrine is acted upon in the usage of Great
                    Britain, and the point has never been decided by the courts of law. It appears
                    to us that the argument greatly preponderates against the rule adopted in the
                    United States, and in favour of the usage established in this country. The only
                    reason for regarding this loss as the subject of general average is, that it
                    originates in the intentional act of running the ship aground, for the
                    preservation, as far as possible, of the whole interest concerned. But it tan
                    seldom be known beforehand how the different interests at stake will be
                    specially affected by the act in question ;— whether, for instance, the damage
                    to the cargo may not be more serious than the damage to the ship, or <hi
                        rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Thus no particular part of the interest can
                    be said to be intentionally sacrificed for the benefit of the whole; the
                    intention, indeed, is not to sacrifice any one part, but to place the whole
                    interest in a situation of less peril than it would otherwise have been in. What
                    particular damages may thereafter ensue to either ship or cargo will depend, in
                    each case, on a variety of circumstances entirely accidental in their character,
                    and therefore in no proper sense the subject of previous intention. The same
                    rule, therefore, which excludes from general average accidental damages in all
                    other cases, ought to exclude them in this case also. Moreover, when the
                    alternatives are either that the vessel be left to founder, or that she be run
                    ashore with a chance of preservation, there can really be no room for choice,
                    or, at all events, the elements of will and intention are entirely subordinate
                    in the part they must play under the pressure of the existing circumstances; and
                    in this view the stranding is as truly inevitable as if it had been caused by
                    the force of the w inds and waves alone.</p>
                <p>But, even were these reasons less weighty than it appears they are, a serious
                    practical objection might be urged against the doctrine that voluntary stranding
                    should be a general average loss, on the ground that it would in most cases be
                    impossible to distinguish between the damages received by the ship and cargo
                    prior to the stranding, and those sustained after or in consequence of it. It is
                    needless to remark, that before a ship can be in such imminent danger of
                    foundering as to render it necessary to run her ashore, she must be presumed to
                    have sustained a very considerable amount of damage; and the probability is,
                    that the cargo also will have suffered to a corresponding extent. Up to this
                    point these damages are confessedly <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> average;
                    and were it held that the damages <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the stranding
                    were the subject of <hi rend="italic">general</hi> average, it would, of course,
                    be necessaιy to distinguish the separate damages that belonged to each. But in
                    every case these different damages would exist in varying proportions, yet
                    always so incorporated together that justice could never have a more perplexing
                    task than that of discriminating between them. No general rule could be applied
                    that would meet the widely different circumstances of each particular case; and
                    the arbitrary method of adjustment that would alone be possible would doubtless
                    give rise to endless dissatisfaction and dispute. On the ground of expediency,
                    therefore, as -well as on that of principle, the usage now established in this
                    country ought to be maintained, notwithstanding the high authorities by whom the
                    opposite practice has been countenanced.</p>
                <p>The amount of general average losses on the ship is compensated by allowing to
                    the owners the cost of repairs, or of new materials in place of those
                    sacrificed, subject to the deduction of one-third for the difference of value
                    between old and new; but no deduction is made from the cost of new anchors, and
                    only one-sixth is deducted from the cost of new chain cables. If the ship be on
                    her first voyage (which is held to include the homeward as well as the outward
                    passage), the repairs and new materials are allowed in full.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to notice the second principal class of general average losses,
                    consisting of extraordinary expenditures incurred with a view to the common
                    benefit.</p>
                <p>When a ship is obliged to put into a port of refuge, in consequence of damage
                    received in the course of the voyage, the usage in this country is to allow as
                    general average all the charges connected with the entrance of the vessel into
                    the port, and with the landing and warehousing of the cargo, when this is
                    necessary to admit of the ship being repaired. Thus the expenses of pilotage or
                    other assistance into the port, the harbour dues, and similar charges, the costs
                    of the protest taken by the master and crew, and of the survey held to ascertain
                    whether the cargo requires to be discharged, together with the charges for
                    landing the cargo and conveying it to a warehouse or other place of safety, are
                    all made good as general average. The costs of repairing the ship are charged to
                    general average only in so far as the repairs may refer to damages which are
                    themselves the proper subject of general contribution. If the damages are of the
                    nature of particular average, as is more usually the case, they are charged
                    accordingly; or if they proceed from “wear and tear,” they are stated against
                    the shipowner.</p>
                <p>The warehouse rent for the cargo at a port of refuge, and any expenses connected
                    with its preservation, form special charges against that particular interest,
                    and .are borne by the proprietors of the goods, or by their insurers. When goods
                    are insured “free from particular average, unless the ship be stranded,” it is
                    necessary, if the ship has not been stranded, to distinguish the charges for
                    warehouse rent and fire insurance from those incurred in connection with the
                    preservation of the goods from the effects of damage,—the underwriters being
                    liable for the former, but not for the latter.</p>
                <p>The expenses of reshipping the cargo, and the pilotage, or other charges <hi
                        rend="italic">outwards,</hi> are borne by the freight. If the entire cargo
                    cannot be taken on board again, from the want, at the port of refuge, of the
                    usual facilities for stowing it, the loss or expenses resulting from the
                    exclusion of part of it are not treated, in this country, as the subject of
                    general contribution.</p>
                <p>The wages and provisions of the master and crew during the period of detention at
                    a port of refuge are not admitted as a charge against general average, it being
                    held that the shipowner is bound to keep a competent crew on board the ship from
                    the commencement to the end of the voyage at his own expense.</p>
                <p>The charges for agency at a port of refuge are brought against the general
                    average, even though they may have been originally made in the form of separate
                    charges <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n163/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0163-0148"/> against the ship and cargo respectively.
                    Commissions on money advanced, maritime interest on bottomry and <hi
                        rend="italic">respondentia,</hi> and the loss on exchanges, &lt;fcc., are
                    apportioned relatively to the gross sums expended on behalf of the several
                    interests concerned.</p>
                <p>The expenses incurred in getting a stranded ship off the ground, the hire of
                    extra hands to pump a ship which has sprung a leak, and the sums awarded for
                    salvage or for other services rendered to the ship and cargo under any
                    extraordinary emergencies, are compensated by average contribution. But this
                    rule applies only to the <hi rend="italic">extraneous</hi> assistance that may
                    have been obtained, the crew being bound to do their utmost in the service of
                    the ship on all occasions, with extra remuneration for what they might consider
                    extraordinary exertions on their part.</p>
                <p>The costβ of reclaiming the ship and cargo after having been captured are allowed
                    as general average charges; and although <hi rend="italic">ransom,</hi> to an
                    enemy is prohibited in this country by legal enactment, it seems that this does
                    not apply to the case of money or goods given up by way of composition to
                    pirates for the liberation of the ship and cargo, and that this would also form
                    a subject of average contribution.</p>
                <p>When the ship and cargo arrive at the port of destination it is unnecessary, in
                    ordinary cases, to distinguish, in the adjustment of the general average,
                    between the losses which have arisen from <hi rend="italic">sacrifices</hi> and
                    those which have resulted from <hi rend="italic">expenditures</hi> for the
                    common benefit. But if the ship and cargo should be lost before reaching their
                    destination, no contribution is due for the goods or ship’s materials which may
                    have been <hi rend="italic">sacrificed</hi> at a former stage of the voyage, the
                    owners of these being in no worse position than any of their coadventurers. On
                    the other hand, it is evident that when money has been <hi rend="italic"
                        >expended</hi> for the common benefit, the subsequent loss of the ship and
                    cargo should not affect the right of the party who has made the advance to
                    recover it in full from all the parties for whose advantage it was originally
                    made. Hence, while <hi rend="italic">sacrifices</hi> are made good only in the
                    event of the ship and cargo being ultimately saved, <hi rend="italic"
                        >expenditures</hi> must be reimbursed whether the ship and cargo be
                    eventually saved or lost; and the contribution for these expenditures must be
                    regulated by the values of the ship, cargo, and freight as they stood at the
                    time when the advances were made.</p>
                <p>If, however, the money required for average expenditures has been raised by means
                    of bottomry, and the ship be lost before completing the voyage, there can be no
                    claim for reimbursement,—the risk being assumed by the bottomry lender in
                    consideration of the premium he receives on the sum advanced. When there is no
                    bottomry, it is a usual practice, but not an invariable rule, to insure the
                    average disbursements by a special policy. When this has been done, and when the
                    amount has been recovered on the subsequent loss of the ship, it cannot be again
                    claimed from the individuals who would otherwise have been liable. But if the
                    expenditures are not insured, either by a bottomry contract, or by a special
                    policy, and if the ship and cargo be totally lost in the subsequent course of
                    the voyage, the parties for whose benefit the expenditures were incurred must
                    reimburse them on the principles already explained. These parties, however, have
                    recourse on their original insurers, not only for the total loss of the
                    interests insured, but also for the previous expenditures, although the insurers
                    may thus be called on to pay a <hi rend="italic">larger sum</hi> than the amount
                    of the insurance.</p>
                <p>The contribution for general average losses is regulated by the values of the
                    respective interests for the benefit of which they were incurred. The practical
                    rule adopted, in all ordinary cases, is to estimate the ship, cargo, and freight
                    at their <hi rend="italic">net</hi> values to their owners, in the state in
                    which they arrive at the port of destination, <hi rend="italic">but including in
                        these values the sums made good for sacrifices,</hi> and tc assess the
                    contribution accordingly. The necessity for including the amount of compensation
                    made for sacrifices in the valuations on which the contribution is charged,
                    arises from the principle that all the parties interested in the adventure
                    should bear the ultimate loss in exact proportion to their respective interests,
                    which would not be the case if the owners of the articles sacrificed were to
                    recover their full value without being themselves assessed for the loss thereon
                    in the same manner as their coadventurers.</p>
                <p>The contributory value of the <hi rend="italic">ship</hi> is accordingly her
                    actual value to her owner in the state in which she arrives, whether damaged or
                    otherwise, including the sum made good in the general average for any sacrifices
                    which may have been made of part of the ship or her materials.</p>
                <p>The value of the <hi rend="italic">cargo</hi> for contribution is its net market
                    value on arrival, after deducting the charges incurred for freight, duty, and
                    landing expenses, but without deducting the costs of insurance or commission. If
                    goods be damaged, they contribute only according to their deteriorated value;
                    and if special charges have been incurred on the cargo at a port of refuge (as
                    for warehouse rent, &amp;c.), the amount of these charges is deducted. The sum
                    charged to general average for goods sacrificed is of course added to the
                    valuation. All goods carried in the ship for the purposes of traδic must be
                    included in the valuation of the cargo; but the wearing apparel, or personal
                    effects, of the passengers and crew are exempted from contribution.</p>
                <p>The value of the <hi rend="italic">freight</hi> for contribution is the sum
                    received by the shipowner on the completion of the voyage for the carriage of
                    the cargo, after deducting from that sum the wages reckoned as from the date of
                    the casualty, the port charges at the place of destination, and the special
                    charges against the freight which may have been incurred at a port of refuge,
                    consisting of the costs of reshipping the cargo, and of outward pilotage,
                    &amp;c. The provisions for the voyage are not deducted, as these are held to
                    have formed part of the original value of the s⅛ip. If the freight has been paid
                    in advance, it forms part of the value of the <hi rend="italic">goods,</hi> and,
                    consequently, does not contribute as a separate interest. When a sum has been
                    advanced on account of freight, subject to insurance, it must be distinguished
                    from the portion of the freight which remains at the shipowner’s risk, and be
                    charged separately for its rateable contribution; and the freight so advanced is
                    not subject to deduction for wages, &amp;c., this deduction being made only from
                    the freight at risk. It has been decided that, when a vessel has been originally
                    chartered for a double voyage, the whole freight to be earned under the
                    charter-party must contribute at its net value, after deducting the wages and
                    other charges which must be incurred in earning it. The effect of this rule is
                    to render the freight attaching to the <hi rend="italic">return</hi> voyage, as
                    well as that attaching to the voyage <hi rend="italic">outwards,</hi> liable to
                    contribute for average losses arising in the course of the outward passage,—a
                    result the equity of which is not always very apparent. ... .</p>
                <p>An adjustment of general average made at any foreign port where the voyage may
                    terminate, if proved to be in conformity with the law and usage of the country
                    to which such foreign port belongs, is binding on all the parties interested as
                    coadventurers, although they may be subjects of this country, and although the
                    adjustment may be made on principles different from those sanctioned by the laws
                    or usages of Britain. The reason for this rule is, that the parties engaging in
                    the adventure are held to assent to the known maritime usage according to which
                    general average is adjusted on the arrival of the ship and goods at the port of
                    destination.</p>

                <p>The subject of general average is only incidentally connected with that of marine
                    insurance, being itself a distinct branch of maritime law. But the subject of
                    particular average arises directly out of the contract of insurance, and will
                    therefore be best considered in connection with it. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
