                <p><label type="entry">ATMOSPHERIC RAILWAY</label>, a railway in which the pressure
                    of air is used directly or indirectly to propel carriages, as a substitute for
                    steam. It was devised at a time when the principles of propulsion were not so
                    well understood as they are now, and when the dangers and inconveniences
                    attendant on the use of locomotives were very much exaggerated. It had been long
                    known that small objects could be propelled for great distances through tubes by
                    air pressure, but a Mr Vallance, of Brighton, seems to have been the first to
                    propose the application of this system to passenger traffic. He projected (about
                    1825) an atmospheric railway, consisting of a wooden tube about 6 feet 6 inches
                    in diameter, with a carriage running inside it. A diaphragm fitting the tube,
                    approximately air-tight, was attached to the carriage, and the air exhausted
                    from the front of it by a stationary engine, so that the atmospheric pressure
                    behind drove the carriage forward. Later inventors, commencing with Henry Pinkus
                    (1835), for the most part kept the carriages altogether outside the tube, and
                    connected them by a bar with a piston working inside it, this piston being moved
                    by atmospheric pressure in the way just mentioned. The tube was generally
                    provided with a slot upon its upper side, closed by a continuous valve or its
                    equivalent, and arrangements were made by which this valve should be opened to
                    allow the passage of the driving bar without permitting great leakage of air.
                    About 1840, Messrs Clegg &amp; Samuda made various experiments with an
                    atmospheric tube constructed on this principle upon a portion of the West London
                    Railway, near Wormwood Scrubs. The apparent success of these induced the Dublin
                    and Kingstown Railway to adopt Clegg à Samuda’s scheme upon an extension of
                    their line from Kingstown to Dalkey, where it was in operation in 1844. Later
                    on, the same system was adopted on a part of the South Devon line and in several
                    other places, and during the years 1844-1846 the English and French patent
                    records show a very large number of more or less practicable and ingenious
                    schemes for the tubes, valves, and driving gear of atmospheric railways. The
                    atmospheric system was nowhere permanently successful, but in all cases was
                    eventually superseded by locomotives, the last atmospheric Une being probably
                    that at St Germains, which was worked until 1862. Apart from difficulties in
                    connection with the working of the valve, the maintenance of the vacuum,
                    &lt;fcc,, other great practical difficulties, which had not been indicated by
                    the experiments, soon made themselves known in the working of the lines. Above
                    all, it was found that stationary engines, whether hauling a rope or exhausting
                    a tube, could never work a railway <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> with anything
                    like the economy or the convenience of locomotives, a point which is now
                    regarded as settled by engineers, but which was not •so thoroughly understood
                    thirty years ago. Lately, the principle of the atmospheric railway has been
                    applied on a very large scale in Loudon and elsewhere, under the name of “<hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pneumatic Despatch</hi>” (ç.v.), to the transmission of small
                    parcels in connection with postal and telegraph work, for which purpose it has
                    proved admirably adapted. (See paper by Prof. Sternberg of Carlsruhe in
