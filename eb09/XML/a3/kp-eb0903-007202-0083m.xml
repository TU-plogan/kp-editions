                    fifteen, at which it continued, with the exception that Caesar appointed a
                    sixteenth, and the emperors frequently added as <hi rend="italic">supra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">numerum</hi> persons of distinction, or of their own family. An
                    augur retained his office and sacred character for life. The college had the
                    right of election of new members. The insignia of their office were the <hi
                    rend="italic">lituus,</hi> or crook, and the dress called <hi rend="italic"
                    >trabea.</hi> The natural region to look to for signs of the will of Jupiter was
                    the sky, where lightning aud the flight of birds seemed directed by him as
                    counsel to men. The latter, however, was the more difficult of interpretation,
                    and upon it, therefore, mainly hinged the system of divination with which the
                    augurs were occupied, and which is expressed in the terms <hi rend="italic"
                    >augurium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">auspicium (aves gerere, aves spicere).</hi>
                    The presence of augurs was required only in observing signs in the sky, where
                    their first duty was to mark out with the <hi rend="italic">lituus</hi> a space
                    or <hi rend="italic">templum</hi> in the sky within which the omen must occur.
                    Such observations being properly made only in the city of Rome, augure are not
                    found elsewhere. Signs of the will of the gods were of two kinds, either in
                    answer to a request <hi rend="italic">(auspicia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >impetrativa),</hi> or incidental <hi rend="italic">(auspicia oblativa).</hi> Of
                    such signs there were five classes:—(1.) <hi rend="italic">Signs in the
                    sky</hi><hi rend="italic">(coelestia auspicia),</hi> consisting chiefly of
                    thunder and lightning, but not excluding falling stars and other phenomena.
                    Lightning from left to right was favourable, from right to left unfavourable;
                    and this being a very direct and impressive token of the will of Jupiter, the
                    observation of it was held to apply to all public transactions fixed for the day
                    on which it occurred. Whether favourable or the reverse in its direction, the
                    appearance of lightning was held as a voice of the god against business being
                    done in the public assemblies. But since the person charged to take the auspices
                    <hi rend="italic">(de</hi><hi rend="italic">coelo servasse)</hi> for a certain
                    day was constitutionally subject to no other authority who could test the truth
                    or falsehood of his statement that he had observed lightning, it happened that
                    this became a favourite means of putting off meetings of the public assembly.
                    Restrictions were, however, imposed on it in the later tiroes of the republic.
                    When a new consul, praetor, or quaestor entered on his first day of office and
                    prayed the gods for good omens, it was a matter of custom to report to him that
                    lightning from the left had been seen. (2.) <hi rend="italic">Signs from birds
                    (signa ex</hi><hi rend="italic">avibus),</hi> with reference to the direction of
                    their flight, and also to their singing, or uttering other <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n84/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0084-0073"/> sounds. In matters of ordinary life on which
                    divine counsel was prayed for, it was usual to have recourse to this form of
                    divination. *For public affairs it was, by the time of Cicero, superseded by the
                    fictitious observation of lightning. (3.) <hi rend="italic">Feeding of
                    birds</hi><hi rend="italic">(auspicia</hi><hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tripudiis),</hi> which consisted in observing whether a
                    bird,—usually a fowl,—on grain being thrown before it, let fall a particle from
                    its mouth <hi rend="italic">(tripudium solistimum).</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >If</hi> it did so, the will of the gods was in favour of the enterprise in
                    question. The simplicity of this ceremony recommended it for very general use,
                    particularly in the army when on service. The fowls were kept in cages by a
                    servant, styled <hi rend="italic">pullarius.</hi> In imperial times are
                    mentioned the <hi rend="italic">decuriales pullarii.</hi> (4.) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Signs from animals</hi><hi rend="italic">(pedestria auspicia,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">quadrupedibus),</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> observation of the course of, or sounds uttered by, quadrupeds and
                    serpents within a fixed space, corresponding to the observations of the flight
                    of birds, but much less frequently employed. It had gone out of use by the time
                    of Cicero. (5.) <hi rend="italic">Warnings (signa ex dims),</hi> consisting of
                    all unusual phenomena, but chiefly such as boded ill. Being accidental in their
                    occurrence, they belonged to the <hi rend="italic">auguria oblativa,</hi> and
                    their interpretation was not. a matter for the augurs, unless occurring in the
                    course of some public transaction, in which case they formed a divine veto
                    against it. Otherwise, reference was made for an interpretation to the
                    Pontifices in olden times, afterwards frequently to the Sibylline books, or the
                    Etruscan haruspices, when the incident was not already provided for by a rule,
                    as, for example, that it was unlucky for a person leaving his house to meet a
                    raven, that the sudden death of a person from epilepsy at a public meeting was a
                    sign to break up the assembly, not to mention other instances of adverse omens.
                    A Roman, however, did not necessarily regard a warning as binding unless it was
                    clearly apprehended. Not only could an accidental oversight render it useless,
                    but to some extent measures could be taken to prevent any warning being noticed.
                    At sacrifices, for instance, the flute was played <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quid</hi><hi rend="italic">aliud exaudiatur</hi> (Pliny, <hi
                    rend="italic">Nat. Hist.,</hi> xxviii. 2, 11).</p>
                <p>Among the other means of discovering the will of the gods were casting lots,
                    oracles of Apollo (in the hands of the college <hi rend="italic">sacris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">faciundis),</hi> but chiefly the examination of the entrails of
                    animals slain for sacrifice. Anything abnormal found there was brought under the
                    notice of the augurs as warnings, but usually the Etruscan haruspices were
                    employed for this. The persons entitled to ask for an expression of the divine
                    will on a public affair were the magistrates. To the highest offices, including
                    all persons of consular and praetorian rank, belonged the right of taking <hi
                    rend="italic">auspicia</hi><hi rend="italic">maxima;</hi> to the inferior
                    offices of aedile and quaestor, the <hi rend="italic">auspicia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">minora;</hi> the differences between these, however, must have
                    been small. The subjects for which <hi rend="italic">auspicia publica</hi> were
                    always taken were the election of magistrates, their entering on office, the
                    holding of a public assembly to pass decrees, the setting out of an army for
                    war. They could only be taken in Rome itself; and in case of a commander having
                    to renew his <hi rend="italic">auspicia,</hi> he must either return to Rome or
                    select a spot in the foreign country to represent the hearth of that city. The
                    time for observing auspices was, as a rule, between midnight and dawn of the day
                    for which the transaction was fixed about which they were desired. But whether
                    it was so ordered in the ritual, or whether this was to leave the whole day
                    free, is not known. In military affairs this course was not always possible, as
                    in the case of taking auspices before crossing a river. The founding of
                    colonies, the beginning of a battle, before calling together an army, before
                    sittings of the senate, at decisions of peace or war, were occasions, not always
                    but frequently, for taking auspices. The place where the ceremony was performed
                    was not fixed but varied, so as to have a close relation to the object to which
                    it referred. A spot being selected, the official charged to make the observation
                    <hi rend="italic">(spectio)</hi> pitched his tent there some days before. A
                    matter postponed through adverse signs from the gods could on the following or
                    some future day be again brought forward for the auspices <hi rend="italic"
                    >(repetere auspicia).</hi> If an error <hi rend="italic">(vitium)</hi> occurred
                    in the auspices, the augurs could, of their own accord or at the request of the
                    senate, inform themselves of the circumstances, and decree upon it. A consul
                    could refuse to accept their decree while he remained in office, but on retiring
                    he could be prosecuted. <hi rend="italic">Auspicia oblativa</hi> referred mostly
                    to the comitia. A magistrate was not bound to take notice of signs reported
                    merely by a private person, but he could not overlook such a report from a
                    brother magistrate. For example, if a quaestor on his entry to office observed
                    lightning and announced it to the consul, the latter must delay the public
                    assembly for the day. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. s. μ.)</hi></p>
