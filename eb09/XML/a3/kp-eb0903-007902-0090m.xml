                <p><label type="entry">AUGUSTUS <hi rend="smallcaps">and the Augustan
                    Age</hi></label>. The name of Augustus was the title of honour given by the
                    Romans to the emperor Caius Julius Caesar Octavianus, or, as he was originally
                    designated, Caius Octavius. This title was intended to be hereditary in his
                    family, but all the succeeding Caesars or emperors of Rome continued to adopt
                    it, long after they had ceased to be connected with the first Augustus by blood.
                    The era of Augustus formed an illustrious epoch in Roman history, and was
                    distinguished for its splendid attainments in arts and arms, and more especially
                    in literature. The Romans in later times looked back to the age of Augustus with
                    great complacency, as the most prosperous and the most distinguished in their
                    annals. The name of the “Augustan Age” has been specially applied to it in
                    modern times, and the same title has been given, with more or less justice, to
                    certain epochs in modern history as the highest compliment to their glory. The
                    reign of Louis XIV. is called the Augustan age of France; the reign of Anne, the
                    Augustan age of England.</p>
                <p>Caius Octavius was the son of a noble Roman of the same name, of the plebeian
                    order. The father had married Atia, the daughter of Julia, sister to the great
                    C. Julius Caesar, who was accordingly great-uncle to the young Octavius. Caesar,
                    the dictator, having no son of his own, took an interest in this youth, caused
                    him to be enrolled among the Patricians, and bred him with a view to the highest
                    honours of the republic. Already, in his eighteenth year, he had chosen him for
                    his “master of the horse,” but this was a merely nominal distinction. The young
                    man was sent to carry on his education at the camp at Apollonia in Illyricum,
                    and there, at the age of nineteen, he heard of his great kinsman’s assassination
                    (44 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) He had already become a favourite with the
                    soldiers, who offered to escort him to Rome, and follow his fortunes. But this
                    he declined, and crossed over alone to Italy. On landing he learnt that Caesar
                    had made him his heir and adopted him into the Julian gens, whereby he acquired
                    the designation of C. Julius Caesar Octavianus. The inheritance was a perilous
                    one; his mother and others would have dissuaded him from accepting it, but he,
                    confident in his abilities, declared at once that he would undertake its
                    obligations, and discharge the sums bequeathed by the dictator to the Roman
                    people. Μ. Antonius had possessed himself of Caesar’s papers and effects, and
                    made light of his young nephew’s pretensions. The liberators paid him little
                    regard, and dispersed to their respective provinces. Cicero, much charmed at the
                    attitude of Antonius, hoped to make use of him, and flattered him to the utmost,
                    with the expectation, however, of getting rid of him as soon as he had served
                    his purpose. Octavianus conducted himself with consummate adroitness, making use
                    of all competitors for power, but assisting none. Considerable forces attached
                    themselves to him. The senate, when it armed the consuls against Antonius,
                    called upon him for assistance; and he took part in the campaign in which
                    Antonius was defeated at Mutina, but both the consuls, Hirtius and Pansa, slain.
                    The soldiers of Octavianus demanded the consulship for him, and the senate,
                    though now much alarmed, could not prevent his election. He now effected a
                    junction with Antonius, who quickly overthrew the power of the republican party
                    in their stronghold, the Cisalpine provinces, with the death of Decimus Brutus,
                    the ablest of the liberators. Thereupon Octavianus and Antonius, taking Lepidus
                    into union with them, met on the river Rhenus near Bononia, and proclaimed
                    themselves a triumvirate for the reconstitution of the commonwealth. They
                    divided the western provinces among them, the east being held for the republic
                    by Μ. Brutus and Cassius. They drew up a list of proscribed citizens, entered
                    Rome together, and caused the assassination of three hundred senators and two
                    thousand knights. They further confiscated the territories of many cities
                    throughout Italy, and divided them among their soldiers. Cicero was murdered at
                    the demand of Antonius. The remnant of the republican party took refuge either
                    with Brutus and Cassius in the East, or with Sextus Pompeius, who had made
                    himself master of the seas.</p>
                <p>Octavianus and Antonius crossed the Adriatic in 42 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    to reduce the last defenders of the republic. Brutus and Cassius were defeated,
                    and fell at the battle of Philippi. War soon broke out between the victors, the
                    chief incident of which was the siege and capture by famine of Perusia, and the
                    alleged sacrifice of three hundred of its defenders by the young Caesar at the
                    altar of his uncle. But peace was again made between them. Antonius married
                    Octavia, his rival’s sister, and took for himself the eastern half of the
                    empire, leaving the west to Caesar. Lepidus was reduced to the single province
                    of Africa. Meanwhile Sextus Pompeius made himself formidable by cutting off thε
                    supplies of grain from Rome. The triumvirs were obliged to concede to him the
                    islands in the western Mediterranean. But Octavianus could not allow the capital
                    to be kept in alarm for its daily sustenance. He picked a quarrel with Sextus,
                    and when his colleagues failed to support him, undertook to attack him alone.
                    Antonius, indeed, came at last to his aid, in return for military assistance in
                    the campaign he meditated in the East. But Octavianus was well served by the
                    commander of his fleet, Μ. Vipsanius Agrippa. Sextus was completely routed, and
                    driven into Asia, where he perished soon afterwards. Lepidus was an object of
                    contempt to all parties, and Octavianus and Antonius remained to fight for
                    supreme power.</p>
                <p>The alliance of Antonius with Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, alienated the Romans
                    from him. They now gladly accepted the heir of Caesar as the true successor of
                    the most illustrious of their heroes. It was felt almost universally that the
                    empire required a single head, and that repose could only be assured by the
                    sovereignty of the chief of its armies. The battle of Actium, followed by the
                    death of Antonius, 31 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> raised the victor to
                    universal empire. Nevertheless, Octavianus did not hasten to assume his
                    position. He first regulated the affairs of Egypt, which he annexed to the Roman
                    dominions, then lingered for a time in Greece, and entered upon a fifth
                    consulship at Samos, 29 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> On his return to Rome he
                    distributed the vast sums he had accumulated among the people and the soldiers,
                    while he soothed the pride of the nobles by maintaining unchanged the outward
                    show of republican government. Of his personal history from this period there
                    remains little to be said. He continued to reside almost constantly at Rome and
                    in the neighbourhood, making one expedition into Spain, 27 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> and a journey through Greece in 21, on which occasion he advanced
                    into Syria, and received back the standards taken by the Parthians from Crassus.
                    In 16 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he went to Gaul to regulate the affairs of
                    that province, an expedition which he repeated, 9 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    But from thenceforth he intrusted the defence of the position to his
                    lieutenants, and more especially to the young princes of his own family. The
                    empire continued to enjoy profound internal tranquillity. More than one plot was
                    formed against the head of the state by some of the discontented nobility, but
                    these were discovered and disconcerted; and when it was evident that they met
                    with no favour from the people generally, he <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n91/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0091-0080"/> could afford to treat them with a signal
                    clemency, which seems to have secured him from any further attempts. The
                    serenity and placability which he displayed in his latter years forms a marked
                    contrast to his jealousy and ferocity at an earlier period; and the character of
                    the Emperor Augustus Caesar has been a problem to historians in consequence. The
                    life of the emperor was prolonged to the year 14 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    He died at Nola in his seventy-fifth year, after holding supreme power in the
                    state for nearly half a century.</p>
                <p>During the years which had intervened between his accepting the inheritance of
                    Caesar, and his attaining to Caesar’s undivided sovereignty, the young aspirant
                    had been meditating how to secure the retention of his power. At first, excited
                    by fears for his own personal safety, and urged by the examples of party leaders
                    around him, and of others who had gone before him, he plunged into a career of ’
                    wholesale bloodshed, and cut off without scruple every public man from whose
                    principles or whose passions he might have cause of apprehension. A large
                    proportion, perhaps, of the senators and nobles had perished in the
                    proscriptions and bloody wars of the triumvirate. Still it could not be expected
                    that the germs of republican sentiment would ever be wholly eradicated. The
                    sense of patriotism and the sense of interest would not fail to raise up enemies
                    to the sovereign ruler of the Roman commonwealth. The conqueror’s first object
                    was to protect himself by force of arms, his next to soothe the passions of the
                    class from whose resentment he had most cause of fear, and after that to raise
                    up another class in direct sympathy with himself to balance the power which the
                    first must necessarily retain in a well-ordered government. It was to the
                    attainment of these three objects that Octavianus directed his organisation of
                    the commonwealth.</p>
                <p>The powers of the imperator or commander of the Roman army ceased on his return
                    to the city. He then became once more a plain citizen. If war again arose he
                    must seek his reappointment to command with tho usual forms. Caesar had not
                    trusted his countrymen so far. He had claimed from them the title of imperator
                    in perpetuity. With this title prefixed to his name, he continued to be still
                    the commander of the legions, whether in the city or in the provinces. With this
                    power his successor dared not dispense. On his arrival at Rome from the East he
                    at once required the senate to accord it to him, as to his uncle before him; but
                    he pretended only to ask it for a limited period of five years. At the
                    expiration of that term, however, he assumed it again and again, though each
                    time for ten years only, but never actually relinquished it to the end of his
                    career. He thus received authority to command the whole force of the state in
                    chief, and the officers who acted under him became simply his lieutenants. If
                    they gained victories, the honours of the triumph were reserved for the
                    imperator “under whose auspices” they were reputed to have served. It followed
                    that all the provinces on the frontiers, or in which armies were maintained,
                    were placed under the emperor’s direct authority, while it was only the central
                    and peaceful portions of the empire that were handed over to the government of
                    the senate. The imperial provinces were administered by the legati Caesaris, the
                    senatorial by proconsuls.</p>
                <p>The person of the emperor was thus secured as far as the power of the sword could
                    secure it. But he was anxious that the source of this power should not be too
                    apparent. The second Caesar wished to maintain the appearance at least of
                    government by the constitutional powers of the republic. The senate had once
                    been practically the ruling power, as far as it was not actually controlled by
                    the masters of the legions. He would not degrade it in its own estimation, or in
                    the estimation of the people, any further, at least, than might be necessary for
                    his main object. He caused himself to be appointed censor, not for one but for
                    five years, in order to give him full time to revise the list of senators, to
                    supply the fearful gaps in the ranks of the old nobility, and to expel such
                    members, and many they were, who seemed unworthy, from their foreign extraction,
                    their low birth, their scanty means, or their bad character, to have a place in
                    that august assembly. The irregularities of the epoch which he hoped now to
                    close had filled its benches with personages who degraded the order in the eyes
                    of genuine citizens. The nobles and good citizens generally hailed this revision
                    with deep satisfaction. It accorded with the national taste as well as with
                    historical traditions. From the individual resentments it provoked, it was an
                    act of some personal danger to the censor; but the danger was more than repaid
                    by the popularity attending upon it, which was enhanced to the utmost by the
                    liberality with which provision was made for raising some of the poor but
                    honourable members of the order to the standard of property now to be required
                    of them.</p>
                <p>The emperor placed himself at the head of this reconstituted body, by assuming
                    the office and title of <hi rend="italic">Princeps Senatus.</hi> The office was
                    indeed little more than nominal; it gave the right of proposing measures and of
                    speaking first in the highest legislative assembly of the state, and having been
                    borne in earlier times by some of the most distinguished of Roman patriots, it
                    carried with it the respect and affection of the people. The titular precedence
                    it gave was all the more valuable, inasmuch as it might be conceded without a
                    blush by the sturdiest republican in the senate. But it was the consul who
                    possessed practically the chief authority in the assembly. Octavianus had been
                    already five times consul, and he shrank from seizing in perpetuity an office
                    which, according to Roman ideas, differed in nothing from royalty, except that
                    it was elective, and that it was limited to the tenure of a single year. Yet he
                    could hardly afford to yield it to the citizen whom the people might at any time
                    elect to thwart or to rival him. What should he do? He took what was certainly a
                    bold step. It was a manifest innovation upon the forms of the free state when he
                    required from the citizens the perpetual “potestas,” or power of the consulship,
                    at the same moment that he resigned the office itself, and suffered consuls to
                    be annually elected to sit, one on each side of him, in the senate. The potestas
                    which was thus conceded to him rendered him the head of the state, both in its
                    legislative and executive departments. When he quitted the city he carried with
                    him into the provinces a proconsular authority, and became to all intents and
                    purposes king for life of the Romans and of their subjects. Even in the
                    senatorial provinces he was now recognised as supreme; and thus it was that in
                    him were centred all the great political functions which had been hitherto
                    divided by the great assembly of the Roman magnates.</p>
                <p>But the emperor did not limit his views to becoming the chief of the nobles. It
                    was the part of a wary statesman to associate himself not less intimately with
                    the opposite faction, which, under the name of the plebeians, had aimed at
                    securing co-ordinate power with the patricians. The original meaning of these
                    designations had indeed long been lost. The plebeians could boast many families
                    as eminent both for honours and possessions as their haughty rivals. Step by
                    step they had won an equal share with them in political privileges. But the
                    class which still bore the title of plebeian was much more widely extended, and
                    embraced the great mass of the knights and men of business in the city, and also
                    of the citizens settled throughout the provinces. This large class had for more
                    than a century contended with the nobles for the perquisites of office, and
                    their mutual rivalry had <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0092-0081"/> armed Sulla against Marius and Caesar against
                    Pompeius. The heir of Caesar inherited the favour of the plebeians, and was
                    bound to requite it by distinguished patronage. The plebeians were still the
                    electors to the tribunate, and still regarded the tribunes as their protectors
                    against the encroachments of the patricians represented by the senate. The
                    tribunes had proved themselves most useful allies to Caesar, and might yet again
                    array themselves in support of the faithful inheritor of his principles. The
                    emperor proposed to balance the consular potestas by assuming at the same time a
                    tribunician potestas also. He thus endowed himself with the authority of the
                    tribune for life, and assured the commons of the city and empire that he could
                    at any time exercise the formidable veto upon the proceedings of the consuls
                    which had served them so well, even down to recent times. Thus did he become
                    emperor indeed,—the sovereign both of the nobles and the people in the city, as
                    well as the commander of the army in the field and in the provinces.</p>
                <p>There remained yet another sovereign authority in the state, namely, that which
                    the chief pontiff exercised over the affairs of religion. However much the
                    religious sentiment had been weakened throughout the Roman world, there was yet
                    enough superstition left among the citizens to confer great and sometimes
                    overwhelming influence upon the legitimate interpreter of divine things to the
                    nation. The senate had exercised this power with great effect, as long as the
                    appointment to the chief pontificate rested with the patrician curiae. Of late
                    years, however, this important dignity had been thrown open to the commons also.
                    Octavianus was well pleased to accept it on the nomination of the whole people
                    combined. He allowed, indeed, his former colleague Lepidus to retain it
                    unmolested during his lifetime, but upon his death he assumed himself the
                    exalted position which he might hesitate to intrust to any other. With this last
                    addition to his prerogatives the emperor might well be content. The name of king
                    he had from the first utterly repudiated. The office of dictator approached too
                    near to that of a king to be acceptable to a ruler, who studied to confine
                    himself within the limits of the republican constitution. Yet there still lacked
                    some general appellative which might reflect in a single word the full dignity
                    and power resulting from the combination of so many honours and prerogatives.
                    The emperor proposed at first, it is said, to assume the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Romuliis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but Romulus had been a king;
                    and further, Romulus had been destroyed, according to the tradition, by the
                    senate, just as Caesar had been in later times. Such associations were ominous.
                    At last he fixed upon the epithet <hi rend="italic">Augustus,</hi> a name which
                    no man had borne before, and which, on the contrary, had been applied to things
                    the most noble, most venerable, and most sacred. The rites of the gods were
                    called <hi rend="italic">august;</hi> their temples were <hi rend="italic"
                    >august.</hi> The word itself was derived from the holy <hi rend="italic"
                    >auguries;</hi> it was connected in meaning with the abstract term <hi
                    rend="italic">authority,</hi> and with all that increases and flourishes
                    upon.earth. The use of this glorious title could not fail to smooth the way to
                    the general acceptance of the divine character of the mortal who was deemed
                    worthy to bear it. The senate had just decreed the divinity of the defunct
                    Caesar; the courtiers were beginning now to insinuate that his successor, while
                    yet alive, enjoyed an effluence from deity; the poets were even suggesting that
                    altars should be raised to him; and in the provinces, among the subjects of the
                    state at least, temples to his divinity were actually rising, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">cult</hi> of Augustus was beginning to assume a name, a ritual,
                    and a priesthood.</p>
                <p>Augustus, as we may now call him, viewed all this with secret satisfaction. It
                    was one of his first objects, indeed, to restore the outward show at least of
                    reverence for divine things, and re-establish the old Roman religion on its firm
                    political basis. It was easy to rebuild, or cause to be rebuilt, the fallen or
                    dilapidated temples of the national gods. The nobles paid their court to their
                    master by seconding his efforts in this direction. The Pantheon, the temple of
                    all the gods, if such was its original destination, remains still as a monument
                    of his minister Agrippa’s munificence; but Virgil would assure us that not less
                    than three hundred “grand” temples were erected throughout the city. Perhaps,
                    indeed, these were mostly the sacella or chapels of <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi>
                    the Lares, which are placed at the corners of the streets. Augustus took the
                    sentiment of the people at a favourable moment. They were thoroughly sickened by
                    the miseries of the civil wars; they were ashamed of the crimes for which the
                    whole nation were more or less responsible; they were eager to rush into any
                    scheme of expiation and reparation that should be offered to them, and lend
                    their hands to the material work of restoring at least the outward semblance of
                    penitence for sin, and thankfulness for the mercy vouchsafed them. There can be
                    no doubt that the conscience of the nation was awakened to a sense of the divine
                    retribution under which they had suffered, but which had been at last averted
                    under the blessed influence of the ruler whom they had at last chosen. The
                    Romans had not lost their belief in a divine Providence, which oppressed them
                    with anxiety and terror, however little they connected it with a sense of moral
                    duty.</p>
                <p>The spirit of materialistic philosophy had, however, been rife among them, and
                    during the past century the anti-religious dogmas of Epicurus had sapped the
                    belief of the educated and literary classes. The patrician youth of Rome had
                    been trained in the schools of Greece, and especially at Athens, or had been
                    placed under the teaching of Greek instructors at home; and of the three
                    contending schools, the Stoics, the Epicureans, and the Academics, the second
                    was that which had carried off far the greater number of disciples. The men of
                    books or of speculative character might be generally Academics, and claim Cicero
                    as their noblest leader; the men of imagination and deep religious fervour might
                    follow, with Cato and Brutus, the teaching of the Stoics; but the practical men,
                    the men of arts and arms and business, if they adhered to any school of thought
                    at all, were almost all, like Caesar himself and his associates generally,
                    addicted to the easy precepts and still laxer morality of Epicurus. This
                    philosophy was noted for its utter denial of Providence and, for all practical
                    objects, of divinity altogether. None of these rival systems, whatever degrees
                    of right sense and reason they might embrace respectively, could sanction any
                    real belief in the still current mythology of the national worship, which was
                    assailed and derided on all sides. Nevertheless, such was the pertinacious
                    adherence of the Roman people to their ancient forms, especially where they had
                    any connection with their national polity, that the outward ritual of their
                    religion was still maintained, though a mere shadow of its former substance.
                    Statesmen, indeed, had invented a formula for reconciling their actual unbelief
                    with their outward profession. Varro had said, and the dictum was favourably
                    accepted, that the ancient beliefs were to be upheld as a matter of public
                    policy. Such, no doubt, was the principle on which Augustus, who was himself
                    neither a believer nor a philosopher, but a politician only, proceeded, when he
                    assumed the part of a restorer of the national religion. He touched, with great
                    sagacity, a chord which vibrated to the heart of the people, who firmly believed
                    that the destinies of the city were bound up with the due observance of the
                    ancient rites, and statesmen looked on with decorous acquiescence at shows and
                    ceremonies to which they attached no significance whatever.</p>
                <p>The world “composes its countenance to the expression <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n93/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0093-0082"/> assumed by the king.” Such was the aphorism of
                    the man of the world, and in this particular Augustus was a king indeed. The
                    Romans rushed forward in the course he marked out for them. His word dictated
                    the fashions of the day, not in sentiment only, but in many particulars of
                    external conduct. He was anxious to restore the dignity of the Roman citizen, as
                    one of the conquering race which ruled its subjects as much by the prestige of
                    its character as by its arms, and he resented all relaxation from the
                    strait-laced discipline of the ancients, even to the petty matters of their
                    dress and deportment, He marked his sovereign displeasure at the degenerate
                    Romans who indulged in the loose habiliments of Greece. “Are these,” he
                    exclaimed, in the language of Virgil, <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> the rulers
                    of the world, the nation of the gown!” And in order to keep up the high
                    distinction of Roman citizenship at a period when provincials from all sides
                    were crowding into it, he reversed, in this single instance, the policy of
                    Caesar, and was very sparing in granting admission to the Roman franchise. He w
                    as, indeed, extremely careful in striking a balance between the tendency of the
                    age to a general fusion of castes and privileges and the ancient spirit of
                    exclusion, in which he thought the strength of the republic still really
                    reposed. The policy of Augustus was one, on the whole, of cautious and moderate
                    reaction. He made an effort to stay the process of disintegration, which he
                    found so rife throughout the vital forces of the empire. The lawlessness of his
                    own usurpation did indeed combine with the gross selfishness of his personal
                    character to sap the moral principles of society, and render its ultimate
                    dissolution inevitable; but he made a vigorous effort to stem the tide, and
                    succeeded in giving the Roman world a period of rest in the downward path which
                    it was generally pursuing.</p>
                <p>The character of the period, however, as an epoch of rest for reflection and
                    self-control, was chiefly marked in the literature, which, more than anything
                    else, has contributed to give it the name of the Augustan Age. The religious
                    sentiment which has been described, resting as it did upon a deep sympathy w ith
                    historical antiquity, coloured by a bold and vigorous imagination, is reflected
                    in the poetry of Virgil, and more particularly in the spirit of his great epic,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid.</hi> No doubt, both depth and tenderness of
                    feeling may be traced even in the eclogues of the same master, however slight
                    for the most part their subjects, and however imitative their treatment. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Georgies</hi> present us with more serious and dignified
                    characteristics, and though these pieces are directed mainly to the practical
                    treatment of practical operations, they admit of high moral as well as religious
                    colouring. They recall the Roman reader to the moral foundations of the national
                    character, its honest simplicity, its love of nature, its devotion to labour,
                    its conviction that industry is the appointed path to virtue and to honour. But
                    this moral feeling is elevated by a sense of the divine within man and around
                    him. The Roman husbandman, the breed of heroes, is never suffered to forget that
                    there is a God and a Providence, or that the favour of the divine power has
                    always fallen upon the industrious and the virtuous. “Thus it is that Etruria of
                    old, and Rome in later times, waxed illustrious and mighty; thus that the city
                    on the seven hills became the fairest object of creation.” The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Georgios</hi> are undoubtedly animated throughout with a religious sentiment,
                    and bespeak the high religious purpose of their author. But in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> this religious sentiment and purpose are both still
                    more distinctly proclaimed to us. The great epic of Virgil, the national epic of
                    the Roman people, glorifies the divine Providence which founded Rome in the
                    beginning, and carried her through all her triumphs to the consummation of her
                    greatness in the era of Augustus. It begins with the divine Aeneas, and it leads
                    us on to the divine Caesar. The greatness and the weakness of the hero of the
                    poem equally tend to this one end, the illustration of the Providence which has
                    educed strength out of weakness, and overruled everything to the glory of the
                    Roman people. The moral to be deduced from the story of. Aeneas is too plain for
                    any Roman to mistake. The divinity which protects Rome is the Lord of heaven and
                    earth and all that is therein. There is no God or Lord like unto Him. Blessed
                    are the Romans who have this Lord for their God. The majesty of the Roman
                    empire, now at the crowning summit of its progress, is the immediate efflux of
                    this sovereign power, and the one is for ever bound up with the other. If such
                    was the doctrine sung by Virgil, surely none could be more grateful to Augustus,
                    the sovereign ruler of an empire so guided and protected.</p>
                <p>The names of Virgil and Horace are familiarly united in every review of the age
                    of Augustus; yet no two men can stand more in contrast one with the other in
                    their personal character, in the scope of their writings, and in the influences
                    they respectively exercised upon their contemporaries. Horace, as is well known,
                    had been a republican in his youth; he had espoused the cause of Brutus and
                    Cassius, and, while yet a student in the schools at Athens, had obtained a
                    commission in their army. He fought in person in the battle of Philippi, and, as
                    he tells us himself, threw away his shield in his rapid flight from the swords
                    of the Caesarians. From that time he abjured the losing cause, and obtained,
                    perhaps without seeking it, the advice of the minister Maecenas, by whom he was
                    taken into favour and introduced to Augustus himself. However agreeable might be
                    his temper and manners, it is not likely that the politic usurper would
                    distinguish a mere upstart with admission to his society without at least
                    tacitly exacting some return. The character of this poet’s compositions, both in
                    his lyrics and his satires and epistles, seems pretty clearly to betray the
                    inspiration of the emperor and his astute associates. The most animated and
                    imaginative of his pieces are almost invariably employed in sounding the praises
                    of the Caesar and his family. When he descends from his highest flights of
                    poetry, he finds congenial matter for his muse in delicate flattery of Maecenas
                    and other magnates of the court. But it will be observed that he seldom, if
                    ever, addresses the haughty nobles of Rome except;in a strain of prudential
                    advice, soothing their pride, but lowering their ambition, and directing them to
                    seek contentment and happiness not in objects of public interest, but in the
                    tranquil enjoyment of ease, which he dignifies with the name of philosophy. The
                    poetry of Horace is full of pleasing sentiments, but it contains perhaps no
                    single strain of generous and ennobling enthusiasm. Such feelings it was the
                    policy of Augustus to discourage, and the policy of Augustus is faithfully
                    represented in the utterances of his courtly flatterer. But there was another
                    task imposed upon him, andut is to this that his satires and epistles are more
                    commonly directed, namely, to put out of countenance the offensive
                    self-assertion of the “new men” of the empire, the men whom the fortunes of the
                    civil war had suddenly raised from their native obscurity, and enriched or
                    ennobled, notwithstanding the barrenness of their origin and the vulgarity of
                    their breeding. Augustus wanted, no doubt, to tame the aspiring spirits of his
                    genuine nobles, but he shrank from driving them to desperation by swamping them
                    with an inundation of base-born inferiors, perhaps their own former clients and
                    freedmen. It was part of Horace’s office, as a gentleman usher at court, to
                    discountenance all such undue pretensions, and shut the door with consummate
                    urbanity upon the most disagreeable or the most importunate of the courtiers. He
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n94/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0094-0083"/> possessed in perfection both the delicate irony
                    and the graceful amenity which are essential to the performance of a task so
                    critical. Doubtless Horace, in his own peculiar line, exercised as great an
                    influence in Roman society as Virgil. The laughing philosopher was no less a
                    power among his contemporaries than the religious devotee. Each of them, in his
                    several way, performed an immense service to the government under which he
                    enjoyed favour and reward; nor can we deny that, considering how necessary the
                    government of Augustus was to the bleeding commonwealth, each in his several
                    -way did an invaluable service to his country.</p>
                <p>Nor, though we may admit that irony and persiflage were Horace’s <hi
                    rend="italic">forte,</hi> should we do him justice if we supposed that he had no
                    feelings of genuine tenderness and earnestness. Even Horace had his instinctive
                    sense of religious duty, which peeps out occasionally from under the robe of his
                    pretended philosophy, and shows that he recognised a principle of duty, and felt
                    ill at ease in the consciousness of his own deficiencies. We may recognise in
                    many of his later compositions his growing dissatisfaction with the worldly
                    views of life which he had been wont to recommend, and some efforts at the
                    attainment of higher sources of satisfaction. Both Virgil and Horace were cut
                    off in middle life, but both, we imagine, had already entered into the cloud,
                    and were painfully conscious that the commonwealth they loved had fallen into
                    its decline, and that their own attempts to invigorate or to soothe it were
                    little likely to prove availing. If Virgil deserves our admiration, Horace too
                    is not unworthy of our sympathy; and it is well that we can part in such good
                    temper from the two most perfect artists of the Roman, or perhaps of the
                    ancient, world altogether.</p>
                <p>Of Ovid, the third great poet of the Augustan Age, we can hardly think or speak
                    so favourably. Ovid, too, was a genuine representative of his epoch, which
                    occupied, however, the latter part of the career of Augustus, when the character
                    of the age had begun to show manifest signs of deterioration. In the character
                    of this poet, which may be abundantly gathered from his numerous works, there
                    appears no religious feeling and no moral purpose. Nevertheless, his writings
                    reflect, in some important particulars, the social tendencies of the epoch, and
                    afford valuable illustrations of the genius of the Augustan Age. To the
                    historian and archaeologist the <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> presents a store of
                    interesting information; but in this poetical account of the Roman calendar the
                    writer undoubtedly proposed to meet a social want of the time. The work is in
                    fact a <hi rend="italic">rationale</hi> of the divine offices, and expounds to
                    the nation the “seasons and the reasons <hi rend="italic">(tempora</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cum</hi><hi rend="italic">causis)”</hi> of the religious services
                    which the emperor recommended to their pious attention. Minute and manifold as
                    were the memorials of their past history, or of their accredited mythology,
                    which the <hi rend="italic">cult</hi> of the Roman temples enshrined, we can
                    imagine how much they must have faded away from the recollection of the people
                    generally during the century of confusion from which they had just emerged, and
                    how even the priests and flamens of the national divinities must have stood in
                    need of a learned interpreter of the rites which they mechanically performed.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> is remarkable as a speaking witness to the fact
                    of the ceremonial revival of the Augustan Age.</p>
                <p>The generally immoral tendency of a great part of Ovid’s poetry is well known;
                    and it speaks all the worse for the character of the age that the writer could
                    declare, and probably not without justice, that his personal conduct was purer
                    than the sentiments with which he sought to please the public. The deterioration
                    of sentiment between Virgil and Ovid is marked in the tone with which they speak
                    in the higher flights of their respective poetry. The writer of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> fully maintains the pure standard of thought and
                    expression which he received as a tradition from Homer, and which had been
                    respected by the epic poets generally; but Ovid, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metamorphoses,</hi> an heroic, if not an epic, composition, allows himself to
                    descend far below this exalted level, and is not only licentious in his
                    language, but seems to choose, and of set purpose, the most licentious of the
                    stories which his varied subject offers. Again, though Horace adopts the lighter
                    tone and looser phraseology of the lyric poets of Greece, there is at least
                    nothing meretricious in his style; he was not a corrupter of youth himself, nor
                    were the models such which he proposed for adaptation. But Ovid descends to the
                    imitation of a more wanton kind of poetry. He, too, seeks his models for the
                    most part from among the Greeks, but they are the Greeks of a more degenerate
                    age—the Greeks of the court of Alexandria, who pandered to the vicious tastes of
                    a corrupt and degraded society. But, imitator as he doubtless was, Ovid had a
                    strong personal individuality, and all his poetry is marked with the genuine
                    sentiment of his age and country. Perhaps we trace more of the real man in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Tristia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ponto,</hi> in which he is thrown entirely on his own resources, though in the
                    depth of his affliction and the decline of his powers, than in the abler and
                    more interesting works in which he owed we know not how much to the Greeks
                    before him.</p>
                <p>We have, besides these, the remains of other poets, such as Tibullus and
                    Propertius, who also hold up the mirror to their times, and assist us in
                    scanning its character on all sides. But it will be well to pass them over in
                    this brief sketch, and bring our review of the literature of the Augustan Age to
                    a close with a notice of the great historian Livy. The consummate excellence in
                    form and style of the work to which we refer bears witness to the intellectual
                    accomplishments of the epoch. No doubt the Romans did much at a later period to
                    improve their method of teaching, and to extend their acquaintance with the
                    highest models of literary excellence. An age succeeded in which Rome was formed
                    into an academy, like that of Athens or Alexandria, when all the arts and
                    sciences of the time were taught or practised under the direct instruction of
                    approved professors. Great were the merits of the historical literature of Rome
                    at a later age, and illustrious are some of the men who distinguished themselves
                    in its exercise. But, on the whole, a reasonable criticism will award to Livy
                    the palm of merit at least in the two particulars just specified,—a palm which
                    he may well contest even with the masters of the art in Greece. The form of
                    Livy’s history partakes in exquisite proportion of the descriptive, the
                    narrative, and the dramatic; it is replete with personal characteristics, which
                    bring us into direct acquaintance with the individuals of whom it treats; it
                    abounds, moreover, in matter of antiquarian interest, which we who read it at a
                    distance of nineteen centuries feel to be specially valuable, and which did not
                    fail to attract the sympathy even of the writer’s own contemporaries. The Romans
                    in the time of Augustus were just beginning to be keenly self-conscious. They
                    felt that they had attained to such a position in the world’s history as no
                    people before them had acquired. They were led by all the traditions of their
                    youth to attribute their splendid success to the examples of national virtue
                    paraded before them. They were sensible of the deep debt they owed to their
                    ancestors, and they wanted to know who their ancestors were; they wanted to
                    trace the features of their own character in the lineaments of the great men who
                    had gone before them. Of these ancient heroes of the commonwealth they had
                    hitherto imbibed a faint and vague conception from songs and poems and family or
                    national traditions. The legends connected with their ritual and their laws and
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n95/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0095-0084"/> institutions assumed the existence of those
                    heroes, and the reality of the deeds imputed to them; but the men and their
                    deeds were for the most part wrapped in obscurity, or presented under dubious
                    colours. The voice of Livy⅛ contemporaries muttered around him that of all their
                    compatriots he should be held most in honour among them, who should bring these
                    traditions of the past into the light of day, and make them pass among a
                    generation, willing so to accept them, as genuine and accredited history. The
                    history of Livy was the true product of the age, inasmuch as it answered to the
                    call of the age. It presented Roman history to the Romans much as Shakespeare’s
                    dramas presented English history to the English; the history in both cases was
                    just what the people wished to believe, and from thenceforth they so accepted
                    and believed it.</p>
                <p>As regards the style of Livy’s composition, it is enough to say that it is
                    generally regarded as the most perfect specimen of the Latin prose writing that
                    w e possess, and we may be pretty confident that if anything better had been
                    written, posterity would not have suffered it to perish. It holds the middle
                    place between the oratorical exuberance of Cicero and the philosophic
                    sententiousness of Tacitus. While sentence follow s sentence throughout in
                    logical sequence, so that the thread of meaning and argument is never lost under
                    a mass of verbiage, yet we are beguiled in our lengthened study by the repeated
                    recurrence of passages of highly-imaginative colouring; we feel that if the
                    historian sometimes deviates into poetry, he never misleads us with a show of
                    empty rhetoric. The Roman people, as represented by Livy, retained the genuine
                    strength and bluntness of their character. The teaching of their Greek
                    instructors had had as yet little effect in seducing them into the conceits and
                    affectations of the more frivolous people they had conquered. The history of
                    Livy remains the noblest monument of the <hi rend="italic">Romanus honos,</hi>
                    the national dignity, which his countrymen so proudly contrasted with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Grata,</hi><hi rend="italic">licentia,</hi> which w as gradually
                    enervating and degrading them. The spirit of the Augustan Age is set forth,
                    perhaps at its best and brightest, in the illustrious history of Livy.</p>
                <p>It is probable that Livy, who had been a republican in his heart, lived for the
                    most part the retired life of a student, though he is said to have been employed
                    in the education of some of the princes of the imperial family. He reflects the
                    character of the earlier generation, among whom he was born, rather than of the
                    later, in which he died, at an advanced age, in the fourth year of Tiberius. All
                    the great poets above mentioned met an early death about the middle of the
                    principate of Augustus, except Ovid, who survived to the eighth year of his
                    successor. Accordingly, it is in Ovid, as might be expected, that we trace the
                    first marks of degeneracy from the high standard of the Augustan literature—the
                    Golden Age of Latin composition. The decline of Rome, both in intellect and
                    morals, was becoming rapidly apparent. The splendid promise of the Augustan Age
                    was quickly exhausted. The spirit of freedom evaporated under the influences of
                    the time, and the spurious appearances which the emperor kept up had no power to
                    impart real vigour to the national constitution. Just in the same manner it is
                    abundantly clear that the fame of the age of Louis XIV. in France is founded on
                    the excellence of the men who were actually born and bred in an earlier epoch
                    and under a healthier <hi rend="italic">regime.</hi> Neither the age of Augustus
                    nor that of Louis produced the men who have rendered it illustrious. But the
                    decline of Rome was becoming marked before the death of Augustus in other
                    respects also. Although internal dissensions had been appeased, and private
                    ambition quelled, the external relations of the empire were insecure, and caused
                    vivid apprehensions. The frontiers of the Rhine and Danube were constantly
                    harassed by the indomitable spirit of the barbarians beyond them. On the Danube
                    the Roman arms seem to have been crowned with a sufficient measure of success,
                    but on the Rhine the great disaster of Varus, and the loss of three legions,
                    left a deep impression of gloom upon the feelings of the age. Augustus himself
                    suffered a succession of disappointments in the premature death of his nearest
                    kindred, and in the loss of his trustiest advisers. Though he maintained to the
                    last an outward serenity almost touching, he appears to have been painfully
                    conscious of the substantial failure of the great pacification he had
                    accomplished, and to have augured nothing but evil from the character of the
                    stepson, to whom, at the last moment, he was content to leave his inheritance. A
                    general foreboding of evil was creeping over the minds of his people. The age of
                    Augustus, which lasted nearly fifty years, was indeed a long day even in the
                    life of a nation, but its sun was manifestly hastening to its setting, and the
                    night was coming, slowly, gradually, but surely. (c. <hi rend="smallcaps"
