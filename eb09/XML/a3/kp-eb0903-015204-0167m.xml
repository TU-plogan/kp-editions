                    belonged to the family of the Colonnas, and is now in the possession of the

                    life of Gebirol. He was born at Malaga, and received his education at Saragossa,
                    where, in 1045, he wrote a small treatise on morals, which has been several
                    times reprinted. His death is said to have taken place in 1070 at Valencia.
                    Among the Jews he is known only through his poems, and, with a few unimportant
                    exceptions, no Jewish writer refers to his philosophical speculations. The
                    Christian Schoolmen, about the middle of the 12th century, became acquainted
                    with Gundisalvi’s Latin translation of a work called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fons</hi><hi rend="italic">Vitae</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sapientiae,</hi>
                    which exercised a powerful influence on their metaphysical discussions. The
                    author was called by them Avicebron, or Avicembron, or Avence-brol, and nothing
                    was known regarding him till Μ. Munk discovered a Hebrew abridgment, by Ibn
                    Falaquéra, of Rabbi S. ben GebiroΓs treatise on the source of life. He readily
                    identified this with the work of the unknown Avicebron, and the discovery of two
                    Latin MSS. of the <hi rend="italic">Fons</hi> has placed the identification
                    beyond doubt. The extracts of Falaquéra give a fair idea of the work, and enable
                    us to understand the peculiar influence it exercised. The objects of metaphysics
                    according to it are three in number, the knowledge of matter and form, of the
                    divine will or creative word, and of the supreme unity of God. God, as infinite,
                    cannot be known by intelligence which is finite, for all knowledge involves
                    comprehension, or requires that the known be contained in the knowing. God works
                    through the divine will, which is intermediate between the supreme unity and the
                    world. All things in the world possess both matter and form; all the various
                    species of matter are but variations of one universal matter; and similarly all
                    forms are contained in one universal form. This unity of matter applies to the
                    soul and mind as well as to material things, and it is against this proposition
                    that the orthodox Schoolmen, as Albertus and Thomas, principally argue. The
                    matter and form in the universe is disposed in successive stages, and rising
                    above the lowest grade or corporal matter there are certain intermediate
                    substances uniting it with the divine will, without which there is no motion.
                    These intermediate substances, taken in order, are —the universal intellect, the
                    rational soul, the vital soul, the vegetative soul, and nature, or the principle
                    of motion in material things. Activity is transmitted from the divine will
                    through these stages, each of which causes the one next below itself to pass
                    from potentiality into actuality. The materials of Avicebron’s philosophy are
                    due mainly to the Alexandrian speculations concealed in the pseudo-Aristotelian
                    <hi rend="italic">Theology.</hi> The position of the divine will, somewhat
                    enigmatical in a philosophical point of view, is probably a concession to Jewish
                    orthodoxy. For a full account of ail that is known regarding Avicebron’s life
