                    mention. But it was the capital of Attica which invested the name of Athens with
                    an undying charm for the poet, the artist, the philosopher, the historian, for
                    all time. It is situated in long. 23° 44' E., lat. 37° 58' N., towards the south
                    of the central plain (πεδών) of Attica, about 4½ miles from the harbour of
                    Piraeeus, and nearly 4 from the Bay of Phalerum. The survey of Pausanias (i.
                    2-30), when compared with existing remains, and supplemented by the numerous
                    incidental notices of ancient authors, enables us to form a more perfect
                    conception of the topography of ancient Athens than of any other Greek city.
                    Recent excavations have added greatly to our knowledge of it, and the literature
                    of the subject is very extensive (see p. 11, <hi rend="italic">infra).</hi> Our
                    object in this article will be to treat of the topography of Athens from an
                    historical point of view, and to show how the rise, the greatness, the decline
                    of the city may be read in the history of its buildings.</p>
                <p>There seems little reason to doubt that the earliest settlement on Athenian soil
                    was upon the cliff afterwards famous as the Acropolis. Such is the express
                    statement of Thucydides (ii. 15), who observes that the Acropolis was commonly
                    termed at Athens <hi rend="italic">η</hi> πόλις, much as the oldest part of
                    London is styled “The City.” The earliest inhabitants appear to have been
                    Pelasgians; and though it was the boast of the Athenians that they alone of all
                    Greek states were indigenous <hi rend="italic">(avτ0χθoves),</hi> yet their town
                    would from the first have received accessions from various parts of the
                    continent, the peaceful poverty of Attica affording a welcome refuge in those
                    early and unsettled times (Thucyd., i. 2). The most accessible portion of the
                    Acropolis is the western side, where it is joined by a neck of hill to the
                    Areopagus. On this side there existed down to later times the remains of
                    fortifications built by the earliest inhabitants, λvith nine doorways, one
                    within the other, called <hi rend="smallcaps">to</hi> Πελασγικόν, or <hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> to</hi> Έννεάπυλον. This fort protected the only
                    entrance to the citadel, which was surrounded by a wall, and artificially
                    levelled for the reception of buildings. Within this fortified enclosure stood
                    the shrine of Athena Polias (Homer, <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> ii. 449: <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> vii. 81), afterwards known as the Erechtheium,—and
                    an altar of Zeus Polieus, where the strange sacrifices of the Dipolia were
                    celebrated. A Prytaneium, containing the hearth-fire of the state, and serving
                    as the residence of the king, would be another indispensable feature in the
                    primitive town. But while the king and some of the most sacred families probably
                    had dwellings within the fortress itself, Thucydides (ii. 15) points out that a
                    great part of the early population dwelt outside its walls, under the south side
                    of the cliff, probably without fortification, but retiring to the citadel in
                    times of peril. In this quarter, towards the Ilissus, stood the oldest Athenian
                    sanctuary of Dionysus, in a region called Λi∕ιvαι, from having been literally a
                    marsh in early times. Not far off, and nearer the stream, stood the temple of
                    Zeus Olympius, said to be founded by Deucalion (Pausan., i. 18), of which more
                    will be said presently, the precinct of Gaea Olympia, and other ’ sacred places.
                    Here also was the fountain of Callirrhoe, afterwards ornamented by the
                    Pisistratids, and called Enneacrunus, the water of which was sought for sacred
                    purposes long after the city had outgrown these early limits (Thucyd., ii. 15).
                    The region we have been describing formed the nucleus of the later city, and
                    therefore, at the subdivision of all Attica into demes, this quarter was
                    distinguished by the name Kυδα0^vαιov.</p>
                <p>To the west of the Acropolis there extends from N. to S. a range of hills, the
                    three most prominent heights of which are commonly known respectively as the
                    Hill of the Nymphs, the Pnyx, and the Museium,—the Nymphs’ Hill being separated
                    from the Acropolis by the Areopagus, which intervenes between. Everywhere upon
                    the slopes of the hills just mentioned traces have lately been discovered of
                    ancient dwellings hewn out of the solid rock. But while all these rock-dwellings
                    are extremely ancient, yet some appear less primitive than others; it is
                    remarked that those which exist on the Areopagus and on the hillsides nearest to
                    the Acropolis are of a smaller and ruder type, those more distant from the
                    citadel being somewhat more convenient in plan and extent. Legend declares the
                    Athenians to have originally dwelt in rock-hewn caves (Dyer’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Athens,</hi> ch. i,), and it would seem that primitive Athens gradually
                    extended itself from the Acropolis in this W. and S.W. direction. This quarter
                    was afterwards <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">{Attische Studien,</hi> pt. i.) has, indeed, gone so far as to
                    regard these rock-dwellings as earlier than the occupation of the Acropolis
                    itself. But the contrary opinion of Thucydides is worth something, and the
                    natural strength of the Acropolis would make it the most obvious spot for
                    primitive occupation. Accordingly, we shall not be giving too free a licence to
                    our imagination if we conceive of primitive Athens as a twofold settlement,
                    partly on the Acropolis and the low ground at its southern foot, and partly upon
                    the eastern slopes of the hills on the west. It may even have been the
                    consolidation of these two villages into one township that gave rise to the
                    legend ascribing to Theseus the συνοικισ/χό? or consolidation of Attica. It
                    would be natural for legend to assign to one definite time, and connect with one
                    great mythical name, that process of unification which probably was as gradual
                    as it was spontaneous. As the population of the early town continued to
                    increase, two more districts seem to have been incorporated—Collytus, extending
                    from the east of Melite, between the Acropolis and Areopagus, and Cerameicus, or
                    the “Potters’ quarter” (“Tuileries”), which extended from the same two hills
                    towards the north and north-west. The regions we have now described appear to
                    have made up the Athens of Solonian times. The earliest historical event which
                    illustrates Athenian topography is the rising of Cylon (Herod., v. 71; Thucyd.,
                    i. 126; Pausan., i. 28). The narratives of that event imply that the Acropolis
                    was already fortified by the Enneapylum, that the Areopagus was already the seat
                    of the court which bore its name (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Areopagus),</hi> and
                    that near the entrance of the citadel stood an altar of the Semnae, or Furies,
                    at which Cylon and his partisans were slain. This altar has been immortalised by
                    Aeschylus in the splendid conclusion of the <hi rend="italic">Eumenides.</hi>
                    Another sacred spot in early Athens must have been the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leocoriτιm,</hi> w here Hipparchus was assassinated (Thucyd., i. 20; vi. 57).
                    This was a shrine erected in honour of the daughters of Leo, who were sacrificed
                    by their father to Athena, in order to avert a pestilence. The nature of the
                    legend testifies to the antiquity of the site. The words of Thucydides
                    respecting Cylon imply that the early city was already surrounded by a
                    ring-wall, and this probably remained intact until the invasion of the Persians,
                    although the buildings within the walls underwent great alteration and
                    improvements under the government of Pisistratus and his sons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> ’ The reign of the Pisistratids was recognised by
                    the ancients as marking an important era in Athenian topography. We have already
                    mentioned the fountain of Enneacrunus as being built by them. It was Pisistratus
                    . who laid the foundations of the great temple of Zeus Olympius upon the ancient
                    site above mentioned. His magnificent design had an eventful history: left
                    unfinished by its author, the Athenians, perhaps from dislike to the “tyrant,”
                    made no effort to complete it. At length, after receiving additions from various
                    foreign princes, it was completed by Hadrian (c. 130 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.),</hi> and formed the grandest edifice in the region of the city which, in
                    acknow-ledgment of the imperial munificence, was called Hadrianopolis. The
                    Olympium was one of the· largest temples in the world; but of its 124 Corinthian
                    columns only 15 are now standing. The <hi rend="italic">Pythium,</hi> or
                    sanctuary of the Pythian</p>
                <p>Apollo near the Olympium, was also ascribed to Pisistratus, whose grandson and
                    namesake dedicated an altar within it (Thucyd., vi. 54). To Pisistratus was
                    ascribed the founding of the <hi rend="italic">Lyceium,</hi> or temple of Apollo
                    Lyceius, which stood on the right bank of the Ilissus, a short distance from the
                    city. The names both of Pericles and Lycurgus the orator are also associated
                    with this building; yet it is not known who added the gymnasium close by, which
                    afterwards became famous as the favourite haunt of Aristotle, and the birthplace
                    of the Peripatetic philosophy. The yet more famous seat of the rival philosophy
                    seems also to have owed something to the Pisistratids, for Hipparchus was said
                    to have enclosed the <hi rend="italic">Academy</hi> with a wall. This was a
                    gymnasium surrounded by pleasant gardens lying to the N. of the city, about a
                    mile from the Dipylum gate. It owes all its fame, of course, to its connection
                    with Plato, who lived, taught, and was buried there. This site, so full of
                    glorious memories, cannot now be identified with certainty. Its trees, like
                    those of the Lyceium, were despoiled by Sulla to make implements of war. The
                    name of Pisistratus is connected with another important site. Professor E.
                    Curtius <hi rend="italic">{Attische Studien,</hi> pt. 2), supposes that the most
                    ancient Athenian market lay on the S. of the Acropolis, and that the
                    Pisistratids superseded it by a new market at the northern foot of the
                    Areopagus. Be this as it may, we are sure that, as early as their times, this
                    site formed the centre of Athenian commercial and civic life. The narrow valley
                    between the Pnyx Hill and the Areopagus, where older topographers placed the
                    Agora, is not a spacious enough site for the purpose. The obvious locality for
                    an Agora would be the rectangular space enclosed by the Areopagus on the S., by
                    the Acropolis on the E., and on the W. by the eminence occupied by the Theseium.
                    To the N. and N.E. no barrier existed; accordingly, the entrance was from the
                    Dipylum gate on the N.W., and on the N.E. the market received extension in Roman
                    times. The Agora thus stood in the region known as Cerameicus. But as the
                    Cerameicus extended for some miles in a N.W. direction, it became divided by the
                    city wall into the outer and the inner Cerameicus. The outer Cerameicus was an
                    agreeable suburb, lying on the road to the Academy and Colonus, the home of
                    Sophocles; and it was here that citizens who died in their country’s wars
                    received a public burial. Through gate Dipylum one passed into the inner
                    Cerameicus, the most important quarter of which was naturally the Agora itself;
                    and so it was common to speak of the Agora as “The Cerameicus.” How much this
                    market-place may have owed to the designs of the Pisistratids we cannot now
                    determine. The statues of Harmodius and Aristogiton formed a conspicuous
                    ornament of the south portion, and Thucydides (vi. 54) informs us that the
                    grandson and namesake of Pisistratus adorned the Agora by building the altar of
                    the twelve gods. If the Agora belongs to the age of Pisistratus, some of the
                    civic buildings within it would also be coeval with him. Such were the Stoa
                    Basileius, or Portico, where the archon basileius presided; the Bouleuterium,
                    where the senate of 500 held its sittings; the Tholus close by it, where the
                    Prytanes of the senate sacrificed—a circular building with a dome of stone, from
                    whence it gained its name; and the Prytan· eium, said to be founded by Theseus
                    (Thucyd., ii. 15), which contained the hearth-fire of the state, and where the
                    Prytanes and public benefactors had the privilege of dining at the public
                    expense. The statues of the ten heroes (eponymi), who gave their names to the
                    Athenian tribes, decorated the Agora probably from the first; against these
                    statues were affixed public notices and proclamations. Other buildings in the
                    Agora of later and ascertained dates will be enumerated in their proper
                    place.</p>

                <p>The revolution which expelled the Pisistratids (510 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>), and gave Athens a free government, left its mark upon the
                    topography of the city. The old Pelasgic fortress <hi rend="smallcaps">(to</hi>
                    ’ En∕∈ατrυλov), in which “the tyrants” had for a time held out, was now broken
                    down, and the site occupied by its ruins was devoted by the Delphic oracle to
                    eternal desolation. Only in the Peloponnesian war, when the country population
                    was crowded within the city walls, do we read of this spot being occupied by
                    dwellings (Thucyd., ii. 17). Another work which may probably be assigned to the
                    age of Clisthenes is the first arrangement of the Pnyx, or place of public
                    assembly. The hill that is commonly known as the Pnyx Hill contains one of the
                    most remarkable ruins in Athens; the silence, however, of Pausanius respecting
                    what was probably in his day already a mere ruin has occasioned some doubt
                    concerning its proper identification. The spot in question consists of two
                    terraces sloping down the hill towards the Areopagus, from S.W. to N.E. The
                    upper terrace, indeed, does not slope, but is levelled out of the solid rock
                    near the summit of the hill, being about 65 yards in length (E. to W.), and
                    about 43 in breadth at its broadest part (Ν’, to S.) It is bounded at the back
                    (S.) by a rock-wall, and at the W. end there stands a cubical block, allowed to
                    rise out of the solid rock when this upper terrace was levelled. There is good
                    reason for considering this as the altar for the sacrifices (τα 7τ∈piστια) with
                    which every assembly of the ecclesia was opened (Bursian, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philologus,</hi> 1854, p. 369, <hi rend="italic">foil.;</hi> Dyer, <hi
                    rend="italic">Athens,</hi> p. 462). The lower and considerably larger terrace is
                    separated from the upper terrace by another wall cut out of the solid rock. This
                    wall, which is nearly 126 yards long, is not quite straight, but encroaches
                    slightly upon the upper terrace, and forms at the centre a very obtuse angle. At
                    this point there rises, projecting from the wall, a large cubical mass, cut out
                    of the solid rock, resembling somewhat, though on a larger scale, the altar
                    described above. It is itself 11 feet square and 5 feet high, and stands on a
                    platform consisting of three very massive steps. This remarkable monument has
                    been recognised by tradition as the σκάλα του <hi rend="italic"
                    >∆ημoσθeveo&lt;s,</hi> and almost every traveller since Chandler’s time has
                    regarded it as no other than the famous bema of the ancient Athenian assembly.
                    The rock-wall from which it projects forms the chord of a vast semicircular
                    space, the enclosure of its arc being a wall of “Cyclopean” masonry. The radius
                    of the semicircle measures between 76 and 77 yards from this outer wall to the
                    bema. Here, then, was the auditorium of the Pnyx. But several difficulties beset
                    the identification. Towards the bottom of the lower bema Prof. E. Curtius <hi
                    rend="italic">(Attische Studien,</hi> pt. i.) has discovered another similar
                    though smaller bema. Again, Plutarch asserts that the bema which had originally
                    faced towards the sea was by the Thirty Tyrants turned round the other way, in
                    their hatred of the maritime democracy. Moreover, if the block of marble above
                    mentioned be rightly identified as the bema, then it would have the auditorium
                    sloping downwards from it, an arrangement ill suited for addressing a tumultuous
                    popular assembly. Dr Curtius accordingly pronounces the entire identification to
                    be a mistake, and would regard this spot as a primitive precinct and rock-altar
                    of the Most High Zeus. It would not be difficult, if space allowed, to disprove
                    Dr Curtius’s theory. Far more reasonable is the view of Dr Dyer <hi
                    rend="italic">(Athens,</hi> App. iil) He thinks that the lower and smaller bema
                    discovered by Dr Curtius was the bema of Clisthenes, which did (however much
                    Plutarch’s statement is discredited by his own absurd explanation) face in the
                    direction of the sea. The orator would thus speak from the arc of the
                    semicircle, having the audience above him. The Thirty may well have defaced the
                    Pnyx, and it would have been natural for Thrasybulus after the anarchy to
                    restore it on a large scale, hewing out what is still known as the bema. giving
                    the semicircular wall a wider sweep, and raising the tiers of seats at least to
                    a level with the new bema, if not above it. For there is no reason to suppose
                    that the surface of the lower terrace has undergone no change in the lapse of
                    centuries, or that the “Cyclopean” wall surrounding it never exceeded its
                    present height.</p>
                <p>A building of greater architectural importance and of equal interest belongs to
                    this same period. Dramatic performances at Athens originally took place in
                    wooden theatres extemporised for the occasion; but the fall of one of these led,
                    in the year 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> to the erection of the marble
                    theatre on a site already consecrated to Dionysus as the Lenaeum, upon the S.E.
                    slope of the Acropolis. (Suidas, s. <hi rend="italic">υ.</hi> ΠpατAας.) We may
                    be sure that the first stone theatre was comparatively simple in construction,
                    consisting of a κoιλov or auditorium, with tiers of rock-hewn seats, and an
                    ορχήστρα, or space for the chorus, while the stage itself and its furniture were
                    of wood. The excavation of the Dionysiae theatre in 1862 has made every one
                    familiar with the row of marble thrones for the various priests and officers of
                    state, the elaborate masonry of the stage, the orchestra floor, and other
                    features. But these and other interesting decorations of the theatre belong to a
                    later age. It was under the administration of Lycurgus the orator (337 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) that the building was first really completed; and
                    many of the sculptures which have been lately brought to light belong to a
                    restoration of the theatre in the 2d, or perhaps even in the 3d, century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The best account yet given of the Dionysiae theatre is to be found in Dr
                    Dyer’s recent work on Athens.</p></note></p>
                <p>Enough has now been said of the condition of Athens before the Persian War. It
                    was surrounded by a ring-wall of narrow circuit, some doubtful traces of which
                    are supposed to remain. At its centre stood the Acropolis, already crowded with
                    temples and sanctuaries, some upon the summit, some built at its foot, and
                    others—like the famous grotto of Pan, on the N.W. slope—mere caves in its rocky
                    sides.</p>
                <p>The Persian invasion, which forced the Athenians to take refuge in their “wooden
                    walls,” and to leave their city at the mercy of the barbarian, marked an
                    important epoch in the annals of Athenian building. Upon the retreat of
                    Mardonius, the Athenians returned to Attica to find their city virtually in
                    ruins.’ Its fortifications and public buildings had been destroyed or burnt, and
                    the private dwellings had been wantonly defaced or ruined by neglect. Amid the
                    enthusiasm of hope which follow ed upon the great deliverance of Greece, a
                    natural impulse led the Athenians to rear their city more glorious from its
                    ruins. Themis tocles fanned their patriotism with the foresight of a statesman,
                    and Athens rose again with marvellous rapidity. This haste, however, though
                    creditable to their patriotism, and, indeed, necessary in order to forestall the
                    jealous opposition of Sparta, was not without its evils. The houses were rebuilt
                    on their old sites, and the lines of the old streets, narrow and irregular as
                    they had been, were too readily followed. A similar haste marked the rebuilding
                    of the city walls, a work in which men and women, old and young, took zealous
                    part, not scrupling to dismantle any building or monument, private or public,
                    which could supply materials for the building. But in rebuilding the walls
                    Themistocles gave them a wider circuit, especially towards the N. and N.E.
                    (Thucyd., i. 90, 93). At the same time he determined to construct new harbours,
                    and to fortify the Piraeeus, regarding the navy of Athens as her principal
                    source of strength. It is doubtful whether the “Long Walls” formed a distinct
                    portion of his designs; but he may certainly be regarded as the founder of the
                    greatness <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n13/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0013-0004"/> of Athens, the works and embellishments carried
                    cut by Pericles being only a fulfilment of the far-sighted aims of Themistocles.
                    Thucydides (ii. 13) makes the circuit of the city wall to be 43 stades (about
                    <hi rend="italic">5⅛</hi> miles), exclusive of the unguarded space between walls
                    ', this is found to correspond accurately enough with the existing remains. In
                    tracing the circuit of the ancient walls, we may take our start from the N.W.
                    side of the city, at the one gate whose site is absolutely certain, the
                    Thriasian gate (called also the Sacred gate, as opening upon the sacred way to
                    Eleusis, and also <hi rend="italic">TO ∆iπυλov,</hi> as consisting of two gates,
                    perhaps one within the other), which is marked by the modern church of the Holy
                    Trinity, a little N. of the bottom of Hermes Street— a spot attractive to the
                    modern tourist through the beautiful “street of tombs” here laid bare by recent
                    excavations. From the Thriasian gate the wall of Themistocles ran due E. for
                    some distance; thence, skirting the modern theatre, it ran N.E., parallel to the
                    modern Piraeeus Street as far as the Bank, when it returned in a S.E. direction
                    across the site of the present Mint, as far as the Chamber of Deputies. Thence
                    towards the S.E. it included nearly all the modern Royal Gardens, and then ran
                    S.W., following the zig-zag of the hills above the north bank of the Ilissus,
                    until westwards by a straight course parallel with the Acropolis it reached the
                    Museium Hill. Thence it may be traced in a direction N.W. and N., following more
                    or less the contour of the hills, until we return to our starting-point at the
                    Dipylum gate. Eight other gates (exclusive of wickets, 7rυλιδ∈ς, which must have
                    existed) are mentioned by ancient authors—the Piraean, Hippades, Melitides,
                    Itonian, Diomeian, Diocharis, Panopis, and Acharnian. Their exact sites cannot
                    be certainly fixed, but some of them may be determined within narrow limits,
                    such as the Piraean gate, which led out of the Agora, and opened upon the long
                    walls. Having completed the defences of the city proper, among which must be
                    included the building of the north wall of the Acropolis (Dyer, p. 121),
                    Themistocles proceeded to fortify the Piraeeus.</p>
                <p>Athens, like most of the old Greek towns, was built, for greater security, at a
                    distance from the coast, and only when more settled times brought her greater
                    prosperity was a harbour formed at the nearest bay of Phalerum, near the modern
                    church of St George. It is said that Themistocles would gladly have transported
                    the Athenian population bodily from the upper city to the coast, there to form a
                    great maritime state. Though this was impossible, yet he could strengthen Athens
                    on the seaward side. The isthmus of Piraeeus, though somewhat more distant than
                    Phalerum, presented obvious advantages as a seaport. It formed on its north side
                    the spacious and secure basin of Piraeeus (now Port Drako), the north and south
                    shores of which towards the entrance fall back into two smaller bays—harbours
                    within the harbour—known respectively as the <hi rend="italic">κωφός
                    λι.μ.ήν</hi> and <hi rend="italic">κάνθαρος.</hi> The neck of the isthmus on the
                    south is formed by Port Zea (now Phanari), the entrance of which was secured by
                    Phreattys, the headland of Munychia. Round to the east of the district of
                    Munychia, again, and facing Phalerum, was the harbour known anciently as
                    Munychia, and now as Port Stratiotiki. Themistocles thus, in giving up Port
                    Phalerum, gave Athens three harbours instead of one. The fortifications of
                    Piraeeus were conceived on a grand scale, and carried out with no sign of hurry.
                    The whole circuit of Piraeeus and of the town of Munychia was enclosed alike on
                    the sea and land sides by walls of immense thickness and strength, which were
                    carried up to a height of more than 60 feet—this being only half the height
                    intended by Themistocles! (see Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Greece,</hi> c.
                    xliv.) The laying out of the new seaport belonged rather to the regime of
                    Pericles (Grote, c. xlvii.) It was then that Hippodamus, the eccentric
                    architect, planned the Agora which bore his name; and the various public
                    buildings which adorned Piraeeus doubtless arose with growth of Athenian
                    commerce. The harbour-basin was lined with porticoes, which served as warehouses
                    and bazaars. <hi rend="smallcaps">Two</hi> theatres existed in the town, and
                    numerous temples. The local deity was Artemis Munychia; but the large number of
                    foreigners (pετoικoι) who became naturalised at this port led to the
                    introduction of many foreign forms of worship. Artemis herself came to be
                    identified with the Thracian Bendis, and her festival (τα B∈vδι‰α) is referred
                    to in the immortal opening of Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Republic.</hi></p>
                <p>If not a part of the original designs of Themistocles, it was at least a natural
                    development of them, to carry “Long Walls” from the newly-fortified Piraeeus to
                    the upper city, and thus combine them both into one grand system of
                    fortification. The experiment of connecting a town by long walls with its port
                    had been already tried between Megara and Nisaea (Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist.
                    Greece,</hi> c. xlv.), and it was now repeated on a grander scale under Cimon.
                    From the portion of the city wall between the Museium and the Nymphs’ Hill a
                    sort of bastion was thrown out to S.W. so as to form an irregular triangle, from
                    the apex of which a “long wall,” about 4 miles long, was carried down to the N.
                    portion of the Piraeean fortifications; this was termed το <hi rend="italic"
                    >βopeιov</hi> τ∈Γχos. Another “long wall” of somewhat shorter length ran down to
                    the wall of Phalerum, which had hitherto served as the port of Athens; this was
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">to</hi><hi rend="italic">Φaληρι,κov</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >τάχος.</hi> A third wall, between the two, parallel to the first, and but a few
                    yards from it (το νότιον <hi rend="italic">τάχος,</hi><hi rend="italic">τb</hi>
                    διά <hi rend="italic">ράσου τάχος),</hi> w as afterwards added by Pericles, and
                    the maritime fortifications of Athens became complete. But the city owed still
                    more to the munificence of Cimon. Out of the spoils of his Persian campaign he
                    fortified the S. side of the Acropolis with a remarkably solid wall, which
                    terminated in a sort of bastion at the W. end. Here he reared a little temple of
                    Athena Nike (otherwise called the Wingless Victory), although the existing
                    sculptures of the frieze are pronounced on account of their style to belong to a
                    somewhat later date (Pausan., i. 28, 3; Corn. Nep., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cimon,</hi> ii; Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Cimon,</hi> xiii.) It was Cimon who
                    first set the example of providing the citizens with agreeable places for
                    promenade (Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">ibid.),</hi> by planting the Agora with
                    plane trees, and laying out the Academy with trees and walks. It is probable
                    that some of the porticoes in the Agora were built by Cimon; at all events, the
                    most beautiful one amongst them was reared by Pisianax, his brother-in-law, and
                    the paintings with which Polygnotus, his sister’s lover, adorned it
                    (representing scenes from the military history of Athens, legendary and
                    historical) made it ever famous as the 2τoα 7roικiλ∙7. One more building, the
                    most perfect existing relic of ancient Athens, was also built by Cimon. The
                    Theseium (as we still may venture to call it, in spite of the doubts lately cast
                    upon its identification)<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the Piraeeus. Having served in Byzantine times for a Christian church, it is now
                    a museum of antiquities, and contains some of the choicest treasures discovered
                    by recent excavations.</p>
                <p>We have now brought this sketch of Athenian topography down to the most
                    distinguished period of Athenian history and Athenian architecture—the era of
                    Pericles. As the champion of Hellenic freedom against the Persians, as the head
                    of the Ionic confederation, Athens had suddenly grown to be the foremost city in
                    Greece. But when one by one the confederate states sank into the position of
                    subject-allies<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0014-0005"/>; when the γy∈μoviα of Athens passed insensibly
                    into a <hi rend="italic">τvpawL&lt;s</hi> (Thucyd., ii. 63); when the
                    contribution of ships and men was commuted in most cases for a money payment,
                    and the funds of the confederation were transferred from the Apollonium at Delos
                    to the Athenian Acropolis,—an enormous revenue became at the disposal of the
                    Athenian Government. It is to their credit that so little of it found its way
                    into private pockets. It was natural for the thoughts of a Greek, especially of
                    an Athenian, to turn to the decoration of his city; it was politic that the
                    central city of the Ionian confederacy should be adorned with a beauty equal to
                    her prestige. The buildings connected with the name of Cimon had been chiefly
                    for utility or defence; those of Pericles were mainly ornamental. The first
                    edifice completed by him seems to have been the Odeium, on the E. of the
                    Dionysiae theatre, to serve as a place for recitations by rhapsodists, and for
                    musical performances. It was burnt by Aristion during Sulla’s siege of Athens,
                    but afterwards rebuilt. Mention has already been made of the building of the
                    Long Walls and the laying out of the Piraeeus by Pericles; but it was the
                    Acropolis itself which witnessed the greatest splendours of his administration.
                    Within its limited area arose buildings and statues, on which the genius of
                    Phidias the sculptor, of Ictinus and Mnesicles the architects, were employed for
                    years; while multitudes of artists and craftsmen of all kinds were busied in
                    carrying out their grand designs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Persian War had already been consecrated under Cimon to the honour of the
                    national goddess, in the erection of a colossal statue of Athena by Phidias
                    between the entrance of the Acropolis and the Erechtheium; her warlike attitude
                    gained her the title of Πρόμαχος, and the gleam of her helmet’s plume and
                    uplifted spear was hailed by the homeward seaman as he doubled Cape Sunium
                    (Pausan., i. 28). But the national deity was to receive yet greater honours at
                    the hand of Pericles. That an old temple stood on the site afterwards occupied
                    by the Parthenon is proved, less by the doubtful expressions of Herodotus (viii.
                    51, 55), and the testimony of later compilers like Hesychius, than by recent
                    excavations, which reveal that a large temple must have been at least begun upon
                    this spot when the Persian invaders destroyed the old buildings of the Acropolis
                    by fire. Here, then, Pericles proceeded to rear what has ever since been known
                    as the Parthenon. The designer of this masterpiece of architecture was Ictinus;
                    the foundations of the old temple were at his suggestion extended in length and
                    breadth, and thus arose upon the S. side of the Acropolis a magnificent temple
                    of the virgin goddess. It was completed in the year 438 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> It stood upon the highest platform of the Acropolis, so that the
                    pavement of the peristyle of the Parthenon was on a level with the capitals of
                    the columns of the east portico of the Propylaea. The temple was built entirely
                    of white marble from the quarries of Mount Pentelicus. Ascending a flight of
                    three steps, you passed through the great east entrance into the Pronaos,
                    wherein was stored a large collection of sacred objects, chiefly of silver. From
                    the Pronaos a massive door led into the <hi rend="italic">cella,</hi> called
                    Hecatompedos (vεως ό Έκατόμπ-εδος), because it measured in length 100 Attic
                    feet. The ^treasure here bestowed consisted chiefly of chaplets and other
                    objects of gold. The west portion of the cella was railed off (by κryχλ('δες),
                    and formed the <hi rend="italic">Parthenon</hi> proper, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the adytum occupied by the chryselephantine statue by Phidias of
                    Athena Parthenos,—a work which yielded the pre-eminence only to one other statue
                    by the same artist, viz., the Zeus at Olympia. In this adytum were stored a
                    number of silver bowls and other articles employed at the Panathenaic festi
                    vals. The westernmost compartment at the rear of the cella was the Opisthodomus,
                    w hich served as the national treasury; hither poured in the tribute of the
                    Athenian allies. It is important to remember that the Parthenon was never
                    intended as a temple of worship; for this purpose there already existed another
                    temple, presently to be described as the Erechtheium,—standing upon the primeval
                    site of that contest between Athena and Poseidon which established the claim of
                    the goddess to the Attic citadel and soil. The Parthenon was simply designed to
                    be the central point of the Panathenaic festival, and the storehouse for the
                    sacred treasure. The entire temple should be regarded as one vast <hi
                    rend="italic">ανάθημα</hi> to the national deity, not as a place for her
                    worship. Thus directly in front of her statue in the cella there stood an
                    erection, which has been mistaken for an altar, but which is more probably to be
                    regarded as the platform which the victorious competitors in the Panathenaic
                    contests ascended to receive, as it were from the hand of the goddess, the
                    golden chaplets and vases of olive oil that formed the prizes (see Michaelis’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Parthenon,</hi> p. 31). This consideration lends significance
                    to the decorations of the building, which were the work of Phidias. Within the
                    outer portico, along the outside of the top of the wall of the building, ran a
                    frieze 3 feet 4 inches in height, and 520 feet in total length, on which were
                    sculptured figures in low relief<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Nearly all of these sculptures are in the British Museum,, and the entire series
                    has been recently made complete bycasts from the other fragments, and arranged
                    in the order of the original design. The marvellous beauty of these reliefs,
                    which was heightened originally by colour, has been long familiar to all the
                    world from numerous illustrated descriptions. The procession of youths and
                    maidens, of priests and magistrates, of oxen for sacrifice, of flute-players and
                    singers, followed by the youthful chivalry of Athens on prancing steeds—is
                    represented as wending its way from the west towards the eastern entrance.<note

                    sides, the metopes between the Doric triglyphs were filled with sculptures
                    representing scenes from the mythical history of Athens. But the glory of the
                    Parthenon were the sculptures of the E. and W. pediments. Unhappily but a few
                    figures remain, and none are wholly perfect, of the statues which formed these
                    groups; and Pausanias appears to have thought it superfluous to give a minute
                    description of objects so familiar to every connoisseur and traveller. The
                    sculptures on the eastern pediment related to the birth of Athena; the central
                    group w as early destroyed by the Byzantine Christians in converting the
                    Parthenon into a church, with the Pronaos for its apse. But nearly all the
                    subordinate figures are preserved in a more or less injured condition in the
                    British Museum. The noble head of the horse of the car of Night, the seated
                    female figures of “The Fates,” and the grand torso commonly known as the
                    “Theseus,” are familiar to us all. It would be out of place here even to
                    enumerate the many attempts that have been made to reconstruct the groups of
                    either pediment. The sculptures on the W. represented the contest between Athena
                    and Poseidon for the possession of Attica; and although scarcely any portions of
                    these figures are now existing, yet they are better known to us than the E.
                    pediment by means of the faithful (if clumsy) sketches made by the Frenchman
                    Carrey in 1674, when they were in a comparatively perfect state. Those who
                    desire to know all that is to be known concerning the sculptures of the
                    Parthenon should consult the beautiful work of Michaelis, <hi rend="italic"

                    edifice have never been so splendidly given as by our countryman Penrose, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Principles of Athenian Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>We will turn now to the other buildings of the Acropolis, none of which, however,
                    are so full of significance as the Parthenon itself. For, indeed, standing as it
                    does on the higHst point of Athenian soil, its erection marked the culminating
                    point of Athenian history, literature, politics, and art. The “Birth of Athena,”
                    over the eastern entrance, may symbolise to us the sudden growth of Athenian
                    greatness, while in the contest between the armed goddess of peaceful wisdom and
                    the violent god of sea, which adorned the western front, we may see an allegory
                    of the long struggle between the agricultural and the maritime interests which
                    forms the central thread of Athenian history.</p>
                <p>Opposite to the Parthenon, on the northern edge of the Acropolis, stands another
                    remarkable temple, far smaller in size, and built in the most graceful forms of
                    the Ionic order. The Erechtheium appears to be designed expressly to contrast
                    with the severe sublimity of the Parthenon; and on the side which confronts
                    those mighty Doric shafts, the columns of the smaller building are allowed to
                    transform themselves into Canephori. The temple of Athena Polias, which
                    contained the ancient wooden image of the goddess, and formed the centre of her
                    worship, suffered from fire in the Persian War (479 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> A building so sacred would hardly have been allowed to remain for
                    long in ruins; but it was reserved for Pericles to set about a complete
                    restoration of it. However, the Peloponnesian War seems to have interrupted his
                    designs, and in the year 409 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the edifice was
                    still unfinished,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An

                    afterwards it must have been rebuilt, without doubt retaining all its original
                    features. The temple in its present state consists of an oblong cella extending
                    fom E. to W. From each side of the W. end of the cella projects a portico,
                    forming a sort of transept. The eastern portico formed the temple of Athena
                    Polias, upon the site of her ancient contest with Poseidon. The west portion was
                    the Pandroseium, dedicated to Athena Pandrosus. The building thus formed two
                    temples in one, and is styled by Pausanias a δι7rλ0⅛ <hi rend="italic"
                    >οίκημα.</hi> It seems at a later time to have been commonly called the
                    Erechtheium, because of a tradition that Erechtheus was buried on this site.</p>
                <p>Among the many glories of the Acropolis, the Propylaea are described by Pausanias
                    as being exceptionally magnificent (i. 22). They rivalled even the Parthenon,
                    and were the most splendid of all the buildings of Pericles. The western end of
                    the Acropolis, which furnished, and still furnishes, the only access to the
                    summit of the hill, was about 160 feet in breadth,—a frontage so narrow, that to
                    the artists of Pericles it appeared practicable to fill up the space with a
                    single building, which, in serving the main purpose of a gateway, should
                    contribute to adorn as well as to guard the citadel. This work, which rivalled
                    the Parthenon in felicity of execution, and surpassed it in boldness and
                    originality of design, was begun in the archonship of Euthymenes, in the year
                    437 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and completed in five years, under the
                    directions of the architect Mnesicles. Of the space which formed the natural
                    entrance to the Acropolis, 58 feet near the centre were left for the grand
                    entrance, and the remainder on either side was occupied by wings projecting 32
                    feet in front of the central colonnade. The entire building received the name of
                    Propylaea from its forming the vestibule to the five door ways, still in
                    existence, by which the citadel was entered. The wall in which these doors were
                    pierced was thrown back about 50 feet from the front of the artificial opening
                    of the hill, and the whole may therefore be said to have resembled a modern
                    fortification, although, in fact, the Propylaea was designed, not for defence,
                    but for decoration. The whole building was of Pentelic marble. The Megaron or
                    great vestibule in the centre consisted of a front of six fluted Doric columns,
                    mounted upon four steps, which supported a pediment, and measured 5 feet in
                    diameter and nearly 29 in height, with an intercolumniation of 7 feet, except
                    between the two central columns, which were 13 feet apart, in order to furnish
                    space for a carriage-way. Behind this Doric colonnade was a vestibule 43 feet in
                    depth, the roof of which was sustained by six inner columns in a double row, so
                    as to divide the vestibule into three aisles or compartments; and these columns,
                    although only three feet and a half in diameter at the base, were, including the
                    capitals, nearly 34 feet in height, their architraves being on the same level
                    with the frieze of the Doric colonnade. The ceiling was laid upon marble beams,
                    resting upon the lateral walls and the architraves of the two rows of Ionic
                    columns,—those covering the side aisles being 22 feet in length, and those
                    covering the central aisles 17 feet, with a proportional breadth and thickness.
                    Enormous masses like these, raised to the roof of a building, standing upon a
                    steep hill, and covered with a ceiling which all the resources of art had been
                    employed to beautify, might well overcome the reserve of a matter-of-fact
                    topographer like Pausanias, and at once account for and justify the unusual
                    warmth of his language when he is speaking of the roof of the Propylaea (i. 22).
                    Of the five doors at the extremity of the vestibule, the width of the central
                    and largest was equal to the space between the two central columns of the Doric
                    portico in front, and the same also as that between the two rows of Ionic
                    columns in the vestibule; but the doors on either side of the principal one were
                    of diminished height and breadth, and the two beyond these again were still
                    smaller in both dimensions. These five gates or doors led from the vestibule
                    into a back portico 18 feet in depth, which was fronted with a Doric colonnade
                    and pediment of the same dimensions as those of the western or cuter portico,
                    but placed on a higher level, there being five steps of ascent from the western
                    to the level of the eastern portico. From the latter or inner portico there was
                    a descent of one step into the adjacent part of the platform of the
                    Acropolis.</p>
                <p>The wings of the Propylaea were nearly symmetrical in front, each presenting on
                    this side a wall adorned only with a frieze of triglyphs, and with antae at the
                    extremities. The inner or southernmost column of each wing stood in a line with
                    the great Doric columns of the Megaron; and as both these columns and those of
                    the wings were upon the same level, the three porticoes were all connected
                    together, and the four steps which ascended to the Megaron were continued also
                    along the porticoes of the two wings. But here the symmetry of the building
                    ended; for, in regard to interior size and distribution of parts, the wings were
                    exceedingly dissimilar. In the northern or left wing, a porch of 12 feet in
                    depth conducted by three doors into a chamber of 34 feet by 26, the porch and
                    chamber thus occupying the entire space behind the western wall of that wing;
                    whereas the southern or right wing consisted only of a porch or gallery of 26
                    feet by 16, which, on the S. and E. sides, was formed by a wall connected with
                    and of the same thickness as the lateral wall of the Megaron, and, on the W.
                    side, had its roof supported by a narrow pilaster, standing between the N.W.
                    column of the wing and an anta, which terminated its southern wall. In front of

                    the small Ionic temple dedicated to Athena Nike, and commonly known by the

                    buildings of Cimon. Perhaps before the 18th century this building was pulled
                    down by the Turks, and the only remains of it—parts of the frieze built into a
                    wall—which were known in his day were carried off by Lord Elgin, and are now in
                    the British Museum. In 1835 careful excavations were made under the directions
                    of Professor Ross, when not only were the remains of the Propylaea opened up far
                    more clearly than before, but also nearly all the fragments of this little
                    temple of Victory were discovered; they had been used for building a Turkish
                    battery, and so preserved. Thus the temple was at once restored by a
                    reconstruction of the original fragments. Few quarters of ancient Athens have
                    received more advantage from judicious excavation in recent years than this
                    western end of the Acropolis.</p>
                <p>From the disastrous termination of the Peloponnesian war to the yet more fatal
                    defeat at Chaeroneia, the architectural history of Athens is a blank, only
                    interrupted by the restoration of the Long Walls and the rebuilding of the
                    fortifications of Piraeeus by Conon, both of which had been destroyed by
                    Lysander. The financial genius of the orator Lycurgus, whose administration
                    lasted from 338 to 325 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> replenished to some
                    extent the exhausted resources of his country. He reorganised her finance, he
                    catalogued and rearranged the sacred and national treasuries, and brought order
                    and efficiency into every department of state. This new impulse made itself felt
                    in building activity. The Dionysiae theatre was now first completed; and though,
                    as we have already seen, many of the sculptures and other marbles recently
                    uncovered on its site are the restorations of a very much later age, yet we may
                    confidently assume that in all material points the theatre as we are now able to
                    view it represents the condition of the building as it stood in the time of
                    Lycurgus. Another remarkable work which signalised his administration was the
                    Panathenaic Stadium. On the southern side of the Ilissus, at right angles to the
                    stream, a hollow space was scooped out of the soil, some 680 feet in length and
                    130 in breadth. It is possible that the site had been used for gymnastic
                    contests before the orator’s time; it was he, however, who first undertook to
                    level it properly and lay it out. But it was reserved for the munificence of
                    Herodes Atticus finally to complete it. He furnished the place with magnificent
                    seats of Pentelic marble, tier upon tier, capable of accommodating, at the very
                    least, 40,000 spectators. An attempt was recently made to excavate the Stadium,
                    but it was found that every trace of antiquity had been destroyed, the marble
                    having been used as a quarry for building purposes.</p>
                <p>The administration of Lycurgus is an important era in Athenian architecture; for
                    after his time we never seem to hear of any more buildings having been reared by
                    the Athenian Government. The best-known extant edifices of the period
                    immediately following were the work of wealthy private persons. Round the
                    eastern end of the Acropolis, starting from the eastern entrance of the
                    Dionysiae theatre, then leaving the 0deium of Pericles to the left, and thence
                    sweeping westward to the Agora, there ran a street which formed a favourite
                    promenade in ancient Athens, commonly known as the “Street of Tripods.” It
                    gained this name from the small votive shrines which adorned it, supporting upon
                    their summit the bronze tripods which had been obtained as prizes in the
                    choragic contests. The tripods thus mounted often themselves served as a frame
                    to some masterpiece of sculpture, such, for example, as the famous satyr of
                    Praxiteles. It had early become the custom to dedicate the prize tripods within
                    the sacred precincts of the theatre; but when this space was filled, they
                    gradually extended all along this street, and their erection was made more and
                    more a matter of private display. One of these shrines still stands, and is well
                    known as the monument of 1 Lysicrates. It bears the following inscription upon
                    its <hi rend="superscript"> (</hi> architrave :—“Lysicrates, son of Lysitheides,
                    of the deme ’ Cicynna, was choragus; the tribe Acamantis gained the prize with a
                    chorus of boys; Theon accompanied them upon the flute; Lysiades of Athens taught
                    them; Euaenetus was archon.” In other words, the date of this monument was 335
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Fifteen years after that a somewhat similar
                    shrine was reared at the topmost summit of the back of the great theatre, where
                    an ancient grotto was by Thrasyllus: converted into a choragic monument. The
                    Byzantine ’ Christians transformed the building into a chapel of the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Virgin, under the title of Panaghia Spiliotissa, or
                    Our Lady of the Grotto. Early travellers describe this little shrine as
                    consisting of three pilasters engaged in a plain wall, surmounted by an
                    inscribed architrave; above was supported a figure of Dionysus, now preserved,
                    but in a much injured state, in the British Museum. On the top of the statue
                    originally rested the tripod that formed the prize of Thrasyllus.</p>
                <p>The Macedonian period again marks a new epoch in the history of Athenian
                    topography. Henceforward almost every embellishment Athens received was at the
                    hands of the various foreign princes, whose tastes inclined them to patronise a
                    city so rich in historical associations, and so ready to reward each new admirer
                    with an equal tribute of servile adulation. But whatever decoration the city
                    might owe to royal vanity or munificence, her connection with these foreign
                    potentates brought her far more of injury than advantage. She became entangled
                    in their wars, and usually found herself upon the losing side.</p>
                <p>Upon the death of Alexander the Athenians claimed their liberty, but they at once
                    had to submit to Antipater (322 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), who placed a
                    garrison in Munychia. It perhaps was he who defaced the ancient Pnyx; at all
                    events, from this time forward the political oratory of Athens became silent for
                    ever. In 318 B.c. Demetrius the Phalerean was made governor of Athens by
                    Cassander, and received every kind of homage from his servile subjects. But as
                    soon as the other Demetrius, surnamed Poliorcetes, appeared in the Piraeeus, the
                    Athenians welcomed him with open arms. For restoring to them the forms of
                    democracy he was extolled with abject adulation, and had assigned to him a
                    residence in the Opisthodomus of the Parthenon itself, where he profaned the
                    sanctuary of the virgin goddess with unbridled sensuality. Upon the defeat of
                    Antigonus at Ipsus (301 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), Demetrius fled from
                    Athens, and under Lachares, the leading demagogue of the time, the city enjoyed
                    the shadow of independence. But the demagogue soon developed into a tyrant, and
                    when Demetrius reappeared in 296 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and besieged the
                    city, Lachares had to fly from the indignation of the citizens, taking with him
                    the golden shields that adorned the eastern front of the Acropolis, and having
                    rifled the chryselephantine statue itself. Again, in 268 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> Athens endured a long siege from Antigonus Gonatas, who laid waste
                    the surrounding country. Still more disastrous was the ineffectual siege by
                    Philip V. in 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> who, pitching his camp at
                    Cynosarges, destroyed everything that lay around— the temple of Heracles, the
                    gymnasium there, and the Lyceium as well. At length, in 146 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> Greece became a Roman province, and Athens succumbed peacefully to
                    the Roman yoke.</p>
                <p>During the inglorious period of Athenian history which has just been sketched,
                    several new buildings were reared by the munificence of foreign princes. Ptolemy
                    Philadelphus <pb break="no"

                    Ptolemaeum— built by him near the Theseium. Attalus I., king of Pergamus,
                    erected a stoa on the north-east of the Agora, and laid out a garden in the
                    Academy. His successor, Eumenes II. (197-159 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi>
                    built another stoa near the great theatre. Antiochus Epiphanes designed the
                    completion of the Olympium, a work which w as interrupted by his death. ·</p>
                <p>Under the rule of the Romans Athens enjoyed the privileges of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >libera</hi><hi rend="italic">civitas,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> no
                    garrison was introduced into the town, no tribute was levied upon it, and the
                    constitution was nominally left unaltered. The Areopagus, indeed, under Roman
                    influence, recovered some of its ancient power, and was made to take precedence
                    of the more democratic assemblies of the Boule and Ecclesia. The revision also
                    of the laws by Hadrian would, of course, introduce some changes. Yet it may
                    surely be maintained that Athens under the Roman dominion was in a far better
                    position than in the days before the taking of Corinth by Mummius, when she had
                    been at the mercy of each successive Macedonian pretender. The Romans appear to
                    have shown a remarkable respect for the feelings of the Athenian people. It
                    would be superfluous here to recall the warm expressions of admiration which
                    fall from Cicero and Horace when speaking of Athens. A visit to Athens was
                    regarded by the educated Roman as a kind of pilgrimage.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The beautiful elegy of Propertius, beginning
                    “Magnum iter ad doctas proficisci cogor Athenas” (iv. 21), is worth referring
                    to.</p></note> One great disaster Athens did indeed undergo at the hands of
                    Rome; this was the siege and plunder of the city by Sulla in the Mithridatic
                    War. Yielding to the threats of the king and the representations of the
                    villainous Aristion, the Athenians had joined the cause of the king of Pontus,
                    and Sulla deliberately resolved to gratify his revenge (Athenaeus, v. 47, <hi
                    rend="italic">foil.;</hi> Plut., <hi rend="italic">Sulla,</hi> 12). After a
                    protracted siege, in which the inhabitants suffered the extreme of famine,
                    mocked at once by the insolence of Aristion within, and pressed by a remorseless
                    foe without, Athens at length was taken on March 1, 86 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Many of the public buildings (happily not the most important) were
                    overthrown, much of the sacred treasure was rifled by the soldiers, and many
                    works of art, together with the library of Apellicon, containing the collections
                    of Aristotle and Theophrastus, were carried off by the cultivated Sulla. The
                    loss of life was also great: large numbers were butchered by the soldiery, and
                    the Agora of Cerameicus flowed with blood. We are told that Sulla was wont to
                    take credit for having “spared Athens.” He did not indeed destroy it, but his
                    conduct on this occasion alone would suffice to fix an indelible stain upon his
                    memory. With this disastrous exception, Athens prospered under the Roman rule,
                    and students from all parts of the Graeco-Roman world flocked thither to attend
                    the lectures of the philosophers and rhetoricians, or to view the countless
                    works of art that adorned the city. Athenian society grew more and more
                    academic. The current tone of educated circles was antiquarian even to
                    pedantry.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See note in

                    to us the chief interests of contemporary Athenian life. Epitaphs in abundance
                    testify to the δεισιδαιμονία which delighted in proper names derived from

                    genealogical pedantry. Honorary decrees abound to justify the charge of
                    adulation which was the reproach of the later Athenians. But the commonest class
                    of monuments are the gymnastic inscriptions, which give us lists of the students
                    from all quarters who, while pursuing their studies at Athens, enrolled
                    themselves at a gymnasium, and there had the advantage of a social life and
                    regular discipline, which reminds one somewhat of the college system in the
                    English universities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>But enough has now been said of the condition of Athenian society under the Roman
                    rule; it is time to enumerate the embellishments which the city received during
                    this period. It is uncertain at what exact date the Horologium of Andronicus of
                    Cyrrhus was erected, which is generally known as the Tower of the Winds. It is
                    first mentioned by Varro <hi rend="italic">(De Re Rust.,</hi> iii. 5, 17), and
                    is therefore older than 35 B.C., though certainly not earlier than the Roman
                    conquest. This monument, so familiar to every scholar, is described by Vitruvius
                    (i. 6, 4) as an octagonal tower of marble. It stands at w hat anciently formed
                    the eastern extremity of the Roman Agora, presently to be described. On each
                    face, beneath the cornice, is sculptured the figure of the wind which blew from
                    the corresponding quarter; on the top of the roof was a pedestal supporting a
                    bronze triton (now destroyed), which was constructed to turn with the wind, and
                    to point out the wind’s quarter with a w and which he held in his hand. The
                    sculptured figures of the winds are in good preservation, though of a declining
                    period of art. They represent the four cardinal points and the intermediate
                    quarters between these. Each has his emblems: Boreas, the north wind, blows his
                    noisy conch; Notus, the rainy south wind, bears his water-jar; Zephyrus, the
                    west wind, has his lap full of flowers, and so on. Under each figure are the
                    remains of a sun-dial; and besides all these external features, the interior was
                    constructed to form a water-clock, supplied with water from the spring at the
                    Acropolis called Clepsydra. Thus in cloudy weather a substitute was provided for
                    the dial and the sun.</p>
                <p>The Agora in Cerameicus has already been described, and it was there noticed that
                    the name Cerameicus often appears to be employed alone to denote the Agora. This
                    may be easily accounted for. By the munificence of Julius Caesar and of
                    Augustus, a propylaeum of four Doric columns, which still exist, w as reared at
                    the N.E. extremity of the Cerameicus Agora. The space between the central
                    columns is about 12 feet, between the side columns not quite 5 feet. Over the
                    pediment is a pedestal, with an inscription in honour of Lucius Caesar, the
                    grandson of Augustus, whose equestrian statue it appears to have supported. This
                    propylaeum has by some archaeologists been regarded as a portico of a temple to
                    Athena Archegetis, to whom we learn, from an inscription on the architrave, that
                    the building was dedicated out of the moneys given by Julius and Augustus. But
                    there can be no reasonable doubt that these columns formed the entrance into a
                    new Agora, dedicated to Athena Archegetis, just as it was customary with the
                    Romans to dedicate a forum to some deity, and intended chiefly, it would seem,
                    for the sale of the olive oil which formed so large and characteristic an export
                    from Athens. This appears to be proved by the lengthy inscription (see Bcickh,
                    <hi rend="italic">Corp. Inscr.</hi><hi rend="italic">Groec.,</hi> No. 355) which
                    exists immediately within the entrance, and contains an edict of the Emperor
                    Hadrian regulating the sale of oil and the duties payable upon it. It is easy to

                    times for the old market; they always speak of “the Agora.” Pausanias uses both
                    words in their more modern meanings respectively.</p></note> The “Tower of the
                    Winds,” which had previously been erected, formed, with its useful timepieces,
                    an appropriate embellishment at the north-eastern extremity. The market was
                    enclosed by a wall, and it was reserved for Hadrian to complete its decoration
                    by building a magnificent stoa on its northern side. Augustus himself received
                    the honour of a small circular shrine upon the Acropolis, dedicated to Augustus
                    and Roma. His son-in-law Agrippa was honoured by an equestrian statue in front
                    of the Pro-pylaea, the pedestal of which still exists. The Agrippeium was a
                    theatre erected by Agrippa in the Cerameicus. It is possible, moreover, that the
                    Diogeneium—the only gymnasium mentioned in the Ephebic inscriptions of the
                    imperial period—was built about this time. Its site has recently been thought to
                    have been discovered about 200 yards east of the Tower of the Winds. Whatever
                    licentiousness and misgovernment might mark the reign of succeeding emperors,
                    they at all events refrained from doing injury to Athens. It had been proposed
                    to finish the great temple of Zeus Olympius in honour of Augustus, but the
                    design fell through, and it was reserved for Hadrian to finally complete the
                    building of this magnificent temple, some six centuries from the time when the
                    first stone was laid.</p>
                <p>The reign of Hadrian made literally a new era in the history of Athens.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Many inscribed documents are
                    found, dated “from Hadrian’s first visit.” See Dittenberger in the <hi

                    for Athens, this emperor entertained a passionate admiration. He condescended to
                    hold the office of archon eponymus; in his honour a thirteenth tribe, Hadrianis,
                    was instituted; and the emperor shared with Zeus the title of Olympius, and the
                    honours of the newly-finished temple. While, however, many portions of the city
                    bore witness to his munificence, it was in the south-eastern quarter that most
                    of his new buildings arose, in the neighbourhood of the Olympium. This suburb
                    was accordingly styled Hadrianopolis, or New Athens, to distinguish it from the
                    old city of Theseus and of Themistocles. The arch of Hadrian still stands in a
                    fairly perfect state, and marks the boundary between the ancient town and the
                    new suburb embellished by Hadrian. On the north-western fιont of the architrave
                    is the inscription αtδ ’ eiσ ’ Α0i}vαι Θτ∕σ∈ως <hi rend="italic">η irplv
                    π0λ,</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi> j on the other front,

                    buildings underwent restoration at his command. Nor was his bounty shown in
                    works of building alone. He ceded to the Athenians the island of Cephallenia,
                    and bestowed upon them large presents of money, and an annual largess of
                    corn.</p>
                <p>The immediate successors of Hadrian were guided by his example. Antoninus Pius
                    completed an aqueduct which Hadrian had commenced for bringing water into the
                    town from the Cephisus. Marcus Aurelius visited Athens for the purpose of
                    initiation at the Eleusinian mysteries.</p>
                <p>The list of distinguished persons who made themselves famous as benefactors of
                    Athens may be said to close with the name of Herodes Atticus the rhetorician.
                    Herodes had counted Marcus Aurelius amongst his pupils, and was sure of a
                    distinguished career at Rome; but, like the friend of Cicero, he preferred the
                    more peaceful atmosphere of Greece and took the surname of Atticus. His ambition
                    was to excel as a sophist, but he owed his fame yet more to the enormous wealth
                    he inherited from his father, which he spent in works of public munificence.
                    Various towns of Greece and even of Italy were enriched by his bounty, but
                    Athens most of all. In addition to his many other benefactions, two
                    architectural works in parti cular immortalised his name. One was the Stadium,
                    which he adorned with magnificent marble seats. The other was the 0deium (see
                    Pausan., vii. 20), the ruins of which are still to be seen under the south-west
                    of the Acropolis. An odeiαm resembled a theatre in its general plan and the
                    purposes it served: it differed apparently in being roofed in. The ancient
                    theatres were open to the sky; but the most remarkable feature of this odeium,
                    built by Herodes in honour of his deceased wife Regilla, was its roof of cedar,
                    fragments of which were actually discovered in the excavations made upon this
                    site in 18-57.</p>
                <p>It is a fortunate circumstance that the best and only extant account of ancient
                    Athens came from the pen of a traveller who visited the city just at the time
                    when the munificence of Hadrian and of Herodes had left nothing more to be added
                    to its embellishment. The 0deium of Regilla, indeed, had not been commenced when
                    Pausanias visited Athens, and he describes it later on in his seventh book. We
                    may place his tour through Athens about the year 170 A.D. His manner of
                    description is as methodical as a modern guide-book, and his very knowledge and
                    appreciation of the endless masterpieces of Grecian art prevent him from
                    covering his pages, like some modern tourists, with rapturous word-painting and
                    expressions of delight. He begins his account of Athens (bk. i. ch. i.-ii. § 1)
                    with a description of the Piraeeus and the harbours, and his first tour is along
                    the road from Phalerum to the city, where he enters by the Itonian gate, within
                    which he finds a monument to the Amazon Antiope. In his next tour (ch. ii. §
                    2-ch. V.) he supposes us to start again from Piraeeus, and approach the city
                    along the remains of the Long Walls. Thus entering the city by the Piraean
                    gate,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Curtius and others
                    are probably mistaken in supposing the Dipy-lum to be the gate intended by
                    Pausanias.</p></note> he conducts us along the southern side of the old Agora
                    (which he styles the Cerameicus), describing all the buildings that occur upon
                    the way, from the Stoa Basileius and another stoa near it, adorned with a statue
                    of Zeus Eleutherius, in an eastward direction past the temple of Apollo Patrous,
                    the Metroum, the Bouleuterium, and Tholus, and other buildings, which lay at the
                    northern and north-eastern foot of the Areopagus. This walk ends with the
                    mention of the temple Eucleia and the Eleusinium. It is not easy to see why
                    Pausanias here introduces an account of the fountain Enneacrunus and the temple
                    of Demeter and Core, which every archaeologist hitherto has placed near the
                    Ilissus, in the south-eastern extremity of the city.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Dyer, in his recent work on Athens,
                    Appendix i., endeavours to explain this difficulty by assuming the existence of
                    two fountains called Callirrhoe, one of which (Enneacrunus) he places on the
                    northwest of the Acropolis.</p></note> In his next walk (ch. xiv. § 5-xviii. §
                    3), having already described the south side of the Cerameicus Agora, he starts
                    again from the Stoa Basileius, describes the buildings on the west and north of
                    the Agora, and then enters the new or Roman Agora. In this tour he mentions the
                    altar of Mercy, the gymnasium of Ptolemy, the Theseium, the temple of Aglaurus,
                    and the Prytaneium. In his next walk he starts from the Prytaneium, and
                    proceeding eastward (ch. χviii. § 4, xix.), he mentions the temples of Sarapis
                    and of Ileithuia, until, leaving the eastern end of the Acropolis at some
                    distance on his right hand, he passes through the arch of Hadrian, and describes
                    the Olympium and the other buildings of that emperor. This tour included the
                    temple of Aphrodite eV Kψτoις, the Cynosarges, the Stadium, and other buildings
                    on both sides of the Ilissus. For his next walk he returns again to the
                    Prytaneium (ch. xx.-xxviii. § 3), and enters the Street of Tripods, which leads
                    him to the temple and theatre of Dionysus, which he describes. Thus he at length
                    reaches the western extremity <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n19/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0019-0010"/> of the Acropolis, and entering through the
                    Propylaea, he describes in order each object which adorned the summit, with an
                    accuracy fully borne out by recent excavations. His last walk in Athens (ch.
                    xxviii. § 4, xxix. § 1) conducts us through the various buildings at the western
                    base of the Acropolis. From the temple of the Semnae he passes to the court of
                    the Areopagus, and the mention of this leads him to speak of the other judicial
                    courts of Athens. The rest of his first book is occupied with an account of the
                    suburbs of Athens—the Academy, the sacred way to Eleusis, &lt;fcc., and the
                    topography of Attica in general.</p>
                <p>A few words may suffice to describe the ultimate fate of Athens. In the reign of
                    Valerian the northern barbarians first appeared in the north of Greece, where
                    they laid siege to Thessalonica. This extraordinary apparition having alarmed
                    all Greece, the Athenians restored their city wall, which Sulla had dismantled,
                    and otherwise placed the town in a state of defence sufficient to secure it
                    against a <hi rend="italic">coup· de-main.</hi> But under Gallienus, the next
                    emperor, Athens was besieged, and the archonship abolished, upon which the
                    strategos or general, w ho had previously acted as inspector of the Agora,
                    became the chief magistrate. Under Claudius the city was taken, but recovered
                    soon afterwards. Constantine the Great gloried in the title of General of
                    Athens, which had been conferred upon him, and expressed high satisfaction on
                    obtaining from the people the honour of a statue with an inscription,—a
                    distinction which he acknowledged by sending to the city a yearly gratuity of
                    grain. He also conferred on the governor of Attica and Athens the title of M∈γας
                    Δου£, or Grand Duke, which soon became hereditary; and his son Constans bestowed
                    several islands on the city, in order to supply it with corn. In the time of
                    Theodosius I., that is, towards the end of the 4th century, the Goths laid waste
                    Thessaly and Epirus; but Theodorus, general of the Greeks, acted with so much
                    prudence, that he saved the Greek cities from pillage and the inhabitants from
                    captivity, a service which was most gratefully acknowledged. But this
                    deliverance proved only temporary. The fatal period was now fast approaching,
                    and, in a real barbarian, Athens was doomed to experience a conqueror yet more
                    remorseless than Sulla. This was Alaric, king of the Goths, who, under the
                    Emperors Arcadius and Honorius, overran both Italy and Greece, sacking,
                    pillaging, and destroying. Never, indeed, did the fury even of barbarian
                    conquest discharge itself in a fiercer or more desolating tempest. The
                    Peloponnesian cities were overturned; Arcadia and Lacedaemon were both laid w
                    aste; the gulfs of Lepanto and Aegina were illuminated with the flames of
                    Corinth; and the Athenian matrons were dragged in chains to satisfy the brutal
                    desires of the barbarians. The invaluable treasures of antiquity were removed;
                    stately and magnificent structures were reduced to heaps of ruin; and Athens,
                    stripped of the monuments of her ancient splendour, was compared by Synesius, a
                    writer of that age, to a victim of which the body had been consumed, and the
                    skin only remained.</p>
                <p>. After this dreadful visitation Athens sank into insignificance, and became as
                    obscure as it had once been illustrious. We are indeed informed that the cities
                    of Hellas were put in a state of defence by Justinian, who repaired the walls of
                    Corinth, which had been overturned by an earthquake, and those of Athens, which
                    had fallen into decay through age. But from the time of this emperor a chasm of
                    nearly seven centuries ensues in its history; except that, about the year 1130,
                    it furnished Roger, the first king of Sicily, with a number of artificers, who
                    there introduced the culture of silk, which afterwards passed into Italy. The
                    worms, it seems, had been brought from India to Constantinople in the reign of
                    Justinian.</p>
                <p>Doomed, apparently, to become the prey of every spoiler, Athens again emerges
                    from oblivion in the 13th century, under Baldwin and his crusaders, at a time
                    when it was besieged by a general of Theodorus Lascaris, the Greek emperor. In
                    1427 it was taken by Sultan Amurath II.; but some time afterwards it was
                    recovered from the infidels by another body of crusaders under the marquis of
                    Montferrat, a powerful baron of the West, who bestowed it, along with Thebes, on
                    Otho de la Roche, one of his principal followers. For a considerable time both
                    cities were governed by Otho and his descendants, with the title of dukes; but
                    being unable to maintain themselves in their Greek principality, they were at
                    length succeeded by Walter of Brienne, who, soon after his succession, was
                    expelled by his new subjects, aided by the Spaniards of Catalonia. The next
                    rulers of Athens were the Acciajuoli, an opulent family of Florence, in whose
                    possession it remained until 1455, when it was taken by Omar, a general of
                    Mahomet IL, and thus fell a second time into the hands of the barbarians. The
                    victorious sultan settled a Mahometan colony in his new conquest, which he
                    incorporated with the Ottoman empire; and Athens, as well as Greece, continued
                    to form an integral part of the Turkish dominions, until the treaty of
                    Adrianople in 1829, following up the provisions and stipulations of the treaty
                    of London, 7th July 1827, established within certain limits the new state of
                    Greece, of which Athens is now the capital.</p>
                <p>From the period of the Ottoman conquest to the commencement of the insurrection
                    in 1821, Athens was only known in history by two attempts, on the part of the
                    Venetians, to expel the Turks and make themselves masters of the city. The first
                    of these took place in 1464, only nine years after its capture by the Osmanlis,
                    and proved an entire failure. But the second, which was undertaken in 1687, more
                    than two centuries later, was crowned with a temporary and fatal success. In the
                    month of September of that year, Count Königsmark, a Swede in the service of
                    Venice, having disembarked at the Piraeeus a force of 8000 foot and 870 horse,
                    forming part of the armament under Francesco Morosini, afterwards doge, marched
                    to Athens, and having summoned the citadel without effect, he erected a battery
                    of heavy ordnance on the hill of the Pnyx, and placing two mortars near the
                    Latin convent at the western foot of the Acropolis, bombarded it for several
                    days. The fire of the cannon was chiefly directed against the Propylaea, and the
                    modern defences below that edifice, whilst the mortars continued, without
                    intermission, to throw shells into the citadel. The consequence was, that the
                    beautiful little temple of Nike Apteros, the frieze of which is now in the
                    British Museum, was completely destroyed by the breaching battery; and the
                    Parthenon, besides being greatly injured by the bursting of the shells, was,
                    towards the close of the attack, almost rent in pieces by the explosion of a
                    powder magazine, which reduced the middle of the temple to a heap of ruins,
                    threw down the whole of the wall at the eastern extremity, and precipitated to
                    the ground every statue on the eastern pediment. The western extremity was
                    fortunately less injured, and a part of the Opisthodomos was still left
                    standing, together with some of the lateral columns of the peristyle adjoining
                    to the cell. But the shock was nevertheless abundantly disastrous; and when the
                    Turks afterwards regained possession of the citadel (from which, on this
                    occasion, they were expelled), they did all in their power to complete the
                    destruction which the Venetians had so vigorously begun, by defacing,
                    mutilating, or burning for lime every fragment of the edifice within their
                    reach.</p>
                <p>In the course of the revolutionary war Athens sustained three sieges. The first
                    was laid by the Greeks in 1822. Having carried the town by storm, and driven <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n20/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0020-0011"/> the Turks into the citadel, they established a
                    strict blockade of the fortress, which was continued until the advance of the
                    Pasha at the head of 4000 men induced them to abandon their enterprise, and fly,
                    with the Athenians, to Salamis and Aegina. Two months afterwards, the Pasha
                    having left Athens to the defence of 1500 men, the Greeks again ventured to
                    attack the town, and succeeded in obliging the Turks to seek refuge in the
                    citadel, which they forthwith determined to besiege; but, from ignorance and
                    want of means, no progress whatever was made in the operation until they
                    obtained possession of the well which supplied the garrison with water, when the
                    Turks agreed to capitulate upon condition of being immediately embarked with
                    their families and sent to Asia Minor. On various pretences, however,
                    embarkation was delayed from time to time; and when intelligence at length
                    arrived that a large Turkish force was advancing upon Athens, the Palicari,
                    instead of manning the walls and preparing for a vigorous defence, rushed in a
                    body to the houses where the prisoners were confined, and commenced an
                    indiscriminate massacre. For this atrocity it is no palliation to remember that
                    the Greek character had morally suffered from centuries of servitude, and that
                    they had terrible arrears of vengeance to exact. The third siege was laid by the
                    Turks in 1826. The Greeks had left a strong garrison in the Acropolis, with
                    provisions for several months; and a spring of water having been discovered in
                    the cave of Pan, and enclosed by Odysseus within the defences of the citadel,
                    there was no danger of its being starved into a surrender. But the Turks having
                    established batteries near the Pnyx and on the hill of the Museium, and having
                    drawn a line of trenches round the citadel, with the view of intercepting all
                    communication between the besieged and the Greek army, the garrison was hard
                    pressed; and although Colonel Fabvier succeeded in forcing his way through the
                    Turkish lines with 500 men and a supply of ammunition, and thus affording
                    immediate relief, yet the total defeat of the Greek army under General Church at
                    the battle of Athens, fought in the hope of raising the siege, led soon
                    afterwards to the surrender of the Acropolis, which remained in the hands of the
                    Turks until the termination of the revolutionary war.</p>
                <p>In 1812 Athens could boast of a population of 12,000 souls, but during the war
                    the greater part of the city was laid in ruins, and most of the inhabitants were
                    dispersed. In 1834 it was declared the capital of the new kingdom of Greece.
                    Great exertions have been made since then to restore the city; streets have been
                    opened, levelled, widened; the ancient sewers have been cleared and repaired,
                    and the marshes of Cephisus drained. Excavations of ancient sites and buildings
                    have been carried out,— chiefly through the efforts of the Archaeological
                    Society of Athens, but the antiquaries and scholars of all Europe have anxiously
                    watched their endeavours, and France and Prussia have vied with Great Britain in
                    the prosecution of Athenian discovery. The Theseium has become a treasury of
                    ancient sculpture, and a new archaeological museum has been also erected to
                    contain the ever-increasing stores of ancient inscriptions and sculptures. The
                    royal palace is a large building of Pentelic marble, situated in the eastern
                    quarter of the city, on the highest part of the gentle eminence which rises from
                    the level of the Ilissus and Cephisus towards Lycabettus. The University <hi
                    rend="italic">(^τανεπιστήμιον)</hi> was founded in 1837, and numbers over 1200
                    students, while its staff of 52 professors includes the names of some of the
                    most learned Greek archaeologists in Europe. In fact, the schools and other
                    educational institutions of Athens are very numerous, and thoroughly efficient.
                    The archaeological journals of Athens are full of information concerning the
                    progress of excavations, and publish the texts of newly-discovered inscriptions.
                    The population in 1871 was over 48,000, exclusive of the population of the
                    Piraeeus, which would bring the total up to about 60,000. The harbour is visited
                    by ships of all nations. A railway connects the Piraeeus with the city, and
                    enters the ancient town about half-way between the site of the Dipylum and
                    Piraean gates. The terminus stands in the midst of what once was the Agora in
                    Cerameicus. The principal street is Hermes Street, running from west to east, a
                    little north of the terminus, until it reaches the royal palace. Two other good
                    streets, Athena Street and Aeolus Street, traverse this at right angles. The
                    other streets, with the exception of Stadium Street on the N.E., between the
                    chamber of deputies and the University, are generally narrow and winding.
                    Altogether, Athens, like the rest of Greece, is in a condition of increasing
                    prosperity, and reaps the blessings of freedom. It is true that in our own
                    country the ardent philhellenism of forty years ago has cooled down, and Greece
                    is no longer an object of popular and sentimental admiration. Yet never did the
                    scholars of Europe turn with keener zest to the study of her ancient monuments;
                    and if Attica were cleared for ever of brigands, and furnished with satisfactory
                    roads, then in numbers tenfold greater than now would reverent travellers from
                    the west of Europe delight to make their pilgrimage to the birthplace of
                    philosophy, literature, and art.</p>
