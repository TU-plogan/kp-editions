                    the neighbouring town of Harmaitin, under Nûh ibn Mansir, the Samanide emir of
                    Bokhara. On the birth of Avicenna’s younger brother the family migrated to the
                    capital, then one of the chief cities of the Moslem world, and famous for a
                    culture which was older than its conquest by the Saracens. Avicenna was put in
                    charge of a tutor, and his precocity soon made him the marvel of his
                    neighbours,—as a boy of ten who knew by rote the Koran and much Arabic poetry
                    besides. From a greengrocer he learnt arithmetic; and higher branches were begun
                    under one of those wandering scholars, who gained a livelihood by cures for the
                    sick and lessons for the young. Under him Avicenna read the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isagoge</hi> of Porphyry, and the first propositions of Euclid. But the pupil
                    soon found his teacher to be but a charlatan, and betook himself, aided by
                    commentaries, to master logic, geometry, and the Almagest. Before he w as
                    sixteen he not merely knew medical theory, but by gratuitous attendance on the
                    sick had, according to his own account, discovered new methods of treatment. For
                    the next year and a half he worked at the higher philosophy, in which he
                    encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry he would leave
                    his books, perform the requisite ablutions, then his to the mosque, and continue
                    in prayer till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night he would
                    continue his studies, stimulating his senses by occasional cups of wine, and
                    even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty
                    times, it is said, he read through the metaphysics of Aristotle, till the words
                    were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until
                    one day they found illumination from the little commentary by Alfarabiue, which
                    he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three drachmae. So great was his
                    joy at the discovery, thus made by help of a work from which he had expected
                    only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed an alms
                    upon the poor. Thus, by the end of his seventeenth year, he had gone the round
                    of the learning of his time; his apprenticeship of study was concluded, and he
                    went forth a master to find a market for his accomplishments.</p>
                <p>His first appointment was that of physician to the emir, whom the fame of the
                    youthful prodigy had reached, and who owed him his recovery from a dangerous
                    illness. Avicenna’s chief reward for this service w as access to the royal
                    library, contained in several rooms, each with its chests of manuscripts in some
                    branch of learning. The Samanides were well-known patrons of scholarship and
                    scholars, and stood conspicuous amid the fashion of the period, which made a
                    library and a learned retinue an indispensable accompaniment of an emir, even in
                    the days of campaign. In such a library Avicenna could inspect works of great
                    rarity, and study the progress of science. When the library was destroyed by
                    fire not long thereafter, the enemies of Avicenna accused him of burning it, in
                    order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted
                    his father in his financial laboure, but still found time to write some of his
                    earliest works for two wealthy patrons, whose absolute property they became.
                    Among them was the <hi rend="italic">Collectio,</hi> one of those short synopses
                    of knowledge which an author threw off for different patrons.</p>
                <p>At the age of twenty-two Avicenna lost his father. The Samanide dynasty, which
                    for ten years had been hard pressed between the Turkish Khan of Kashgar on the
                    north and the rulers of Ghazni on the south, came to its end in December 1004.
                    Avicenna seems to have declined the 0ffer3 of Mahmud the Ghaznevide (who, like
                    his compeers, was rapidly gathering a brilliant cortege of savants, including
                    the astronomer Albiruni), and proceeded westwards to the city of Urdjensh in the
                    modern district of Khiva, where the vizier, regarded as a friend of scholars,
                    gave him a small monthly stipend. But the pay was small, and Avicenna wandered
                    from place to place through the districts of Nishapur and Merv to the borders of
                    Khorasan, seeking an opening for his talents. In the restless change which threw
                    the several cities of Iran from hand to hand among those feudal emirs of the
                    Buide family, who disputed the fragments of the caliphate, the interests of
                    letters and science were not likely to be regarded. Shem3 al-Maâli Kabûs, the
                    generous ruler of Deilem, himself a poet and a scholar, with whom he had
                    expected to find an asylum, was about that date (1013) starved to death by his
                    own revolted soldiery. Avicenna himself was at this season stricken down by a
                    severe illness. Finally, at Jorjân, near the Caspian, he met with a friend, who
                    bought near his own house a dwelling in which Avicenna lectured on logic and
                    astronomy. For this patron several of his treatises were written; and the
                    commencement of his <hi rend="italic">Canon of Medicine</hi> also dates from his
                    stay in Hyrcania.</p>
                <p>He subsequently settled at Rai, in the vicinity of the modern Teheran, where a
                    son of the last emir, Medj Addaula, was nominal ruler, under the regency of his
                    mother. At Rai about thirty of his shorter works are said to have been composed.
                    But the constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, Shem3
                    Addaula, compelled the scholar to quit the place, and after a brief sojourn at
                    Kaswin, he passed southwards to Hama-dân, where that prince had established
                    himself. At first he entered into the service of a high-born lady; but ere long
                    the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent
                    him back with presents to his dwelling. Avicenna was even raised to the office
                    of vizier; but the turbulent soldiery, composed of Koords and Turks, mutinied
                    against their nominal sovereign, and demanded that the new vizier should be put
                    to death. Shems Addaula consented that he should be banished from the country.
                    Avicenna, however, remained hidden for forty days in a sheikh’s house, till a
                    fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during
                    this perturbed time he prosecuted his studies and teaching. Every evening
                    extracts from his great works, the <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sanatio,</hi> were dictated and explained to his pupils; among
                    whom, when the lesson was over, he spent the rest of the night in festive
                    enjoyment with a band of singers and players. On the death of the emir Avicenna
                    ceased to be vizier, and hid himself in the house of an apothecary, where, with
                    intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works. Meanwhile, he had
                    written to Abu Jaafar, the prefect of Ispahan, offering his services; but the
                    new emir of Hamadân getting to hear of this correspondence, and discovering the
                    place of Avicenna’s concealment, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile
                    continued between the rulers of Ispahan and Hamadân; in 1024 the former captured
                    Hamadân and its towns, and expelled the Turkish mercenaries. When the storm had
                    passed Avicenna returned with the emir to Hamadân, and carried on his literary
                    labours; but at length, accompanied by his brother, a favourite pupil, and two
                    slaves, made his escape out of the city in the dress of a Sufite ascetic. After
                    a perilous journey they reached Ispahan, and received an honourable welcome from
                    the prince. The remaining ten or twelve years of Avicenna’s life were spent in
                    the service of Abu Jaafar Ala Addaula, whom he accompanied as physician and
                    general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns. During
                    these years he began to study literary matters and philology, instigated, it is
                    asserted, by criticisms on his style. But amid his restless study Avicenna never
                    forgot his love of enjoyment. Unusual bodily vigour enabled him to combine
                    severe <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n169/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0169-0154"/> devotion to work with facile indulgence in
                    sensual pleasures. His passion for wine and women was almost as well known as
                    his learning. With much gaiety of heart, and great powers of understanding, he
                    showed at the same time the spirit of an Aristippus more than that of an
                    Aristotle at the courts of the wealthy. Versatile, light-hearted, boastful, and
                    pleasure-loving, he contrasts with the nobler and more intellectual character of
                    Averroes. His bouts of pleasure gradually weakened his constitution; a severe
                    colic, which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadân, was checked by
                    remedies so violent that Avicenna could scarcely stand. On a similar occasion
                    the disease returned; with difficulty he reached Hamadân, where, finding the
                    disease gaining ground, he refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned
                    himself to his fate. On his deathbed remorse seized him; he bestowed his goods
                    on the poor, restored unjust gains, freed his slaves, and every third day till
                    his death listened to the reading of the Koran. He died in June 1037, in his
                    58th year, and was buried among the palm-treee by the Kiblah of Hamadân.</p>
                <p>It was mainly accident which determined that from the 12th to the 17th century
                    Avicenna should be the guide of medical study in European universities, and
                    eclipse the names of Rhazes, Ali, and Avenzoar. His work is not essentially
                    different from that of his predecessors Rhazes and Ali; all present the doctrine
                    of Galen, and through Galen the doctrine of Hippocrates, modified by the system
                    of Aristotle. But the <hi rend="italic">Canon of</hi> Avicenna is distinguished
                    from the <hi rend="italic">El-Hawi</hi><hi rend="italic">(Continens)</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Summary</hi> of Rhazes by its greater method, due perhaps to the
                    logical studies of the former, and entitling him to his surname of Prince of the
                    Physicians. The work has been variously appreciated in subsequent ages, some
                    regarding it as a treasury of wisdom, and others, like Avenzoar, holding it
                    useful only as waste paper. In modern times it has been more criticised than
                    read. The vice of the book is excessive classification of bodily faculties, and
                    over-subtlety in the discrimination of diseases. It includes five books; of
                    which the first and second treat of physiology, pathology, and hygiene, the
                    third and fourth deal with the methods of treating disease, and the fifth
                    describes the composition and preparation of remedies. This last part contains
                    some contingent of personal observation. He is, like all his countrymen, ample
                    in the enumeration of symptoms, and is said to be inferior to Ali in practical
                    medicine and surgery. He introduced into medical theory the four causes of the
                    Peripatetic system. Of natural history and botany he pretends to no special
                    knowledge. Up to the year 1650, or thereabouts, the <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi>
                    waβ still used as a text-book in the universities of Louvain and
                    Montpellier.</p>
                <p>The rank of Avicenna in the mediaeval world as a philosopher was far beneath his
                    fame as a physician. Still, the logic of Albertus Magnus and succeeding doctors
                    was largely indebted to him for its formulae. In logic Avicenna starts from
                    distinguishing between the isolated concept and the judgment or assertion; from
                    which two primitive elements of knowledge there is artificially generated a
                    complete and scientific knowledge by the two processes of definition and
                    syllogism. But the chief interest for the history of logic belongs to his
                    doctrine in so far as it bears upon the nature and function of abstract ideas.
                    The question had been suggested alike to East and West by Porphyry, and the
                    Arabians w ere the first to approach the full statement of the problem.
                    Alfarabius had pointed out that the universal and individual are not
                    distinguished from each other as understanding from the senses, but that both
                    universal and individual are in one respect intellectual, just as in another
                    connection they play a part in perception. He had distinguished the universal
                    essence in its abstract nature, from the universal considered in relation to a
                    number of singulars. These suggestions formed the basis of Avicenna’s doctrine.
                    The essences or forms—the <hi rend="italic">intelligibilia</hi> which constitute
                    the world of real knowledge—may be looked at in themselves (metaphysically), or
                    as embodied in the things of sense (physically), or as expressing the processes
                    of thought (logically). The first of these three points of view deals with the
                    form or idea as self-contained in the principles of its own being, apart from
                    those connections and distinctions which it receives in real (sensuous) science,
                    and through the act of intellect. Secondly, the form may be looked at as the
                    similarity evolved by a process of comparison, as the work of mental reflection,
                    and in that way as essentially expressing a relation. When thus considered as
                    the common features derived by examination from singular instances, it becomes a
                    universal or common term strictly so called. It is intellect which first makes
                    the abstract idea a true universal. <hi rend="italic">(Intellectus
                    informis</hi><hi rend="italic">agü</hi><hi rend="italic">universalitatem.)</hi>
                    In the third place, the form or essence may be looked upon as embodied in
                    outward things <hi rend="italic">(in</hi><hi rend="italic">singularibus
                    propriis),</hi> and thus it is the type more or less represented by the members
                    of a natural kind. It is the designation of these outward things which forms the
                    “first intention” of names; and it is only at a later stage, when thought comes
                    to observe its own modes, that names, looked upon as predicables and universals,
                    are taken in their <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> second intention.” Logic deals
                    with such second intentions. It does not consider the forms <hi rend="italic"
                    >ante</hi><hi rend="italic">multiplicitatem,,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    as eternal ideas—nor <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >multiplicitate,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as immersed in the matter of
                    the phenomenal world—but <hi rend="italic">post</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >multiplicitatem,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as they exist in and for the
                    intellect which has examined and compared. Logic does not come in contact with
                    things, except as they are subject to modification by intellectual forms. In
                    other words, universality, individuality, and speciality are all equally modes
                    of our comprehension or notion; their meaning consists in their setting forth
                    the relations attaching to any object of our conception. In the mind, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> one form may be placed in reference to a multitude of
                    things, and as thus related will be universal. The form animal, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> is an abstract intelligible, or metaphysical idea. When
                    an act of thought employs it as a schema to unify several species, it acquires
                    its logical aspect <hi rend="italic">(respectus)</hi> of generality; and the
                    various living beings qualified to have the name animal applied to them
                    constitute the natural class or kind. Avicenna’s view of the universal may be
                    compared with that of Abelard, which calls it “that whose nature it is to be
                    predicated of several,” as if the generality became explicit only in the act of
                    predication, in ’ the <hi rend="italic">sermo</hi> or proposition, and not in
                    the abstract, unrelated form or essence. The three modes of the universal before
                    things, in things, and after things, spring from Arabian influence, but depart
                    somewhat from his stand-point.</p>
                <p>The place of Avicenna amongst Moslem philosophers is seen in the fact that
                    Shahrastani takes him as the type of all, and that Algazali’s attack against
                    philosophy is in reality almost entirely directed against Avicenna. His system
                    is in the main a codification of Aristotle modified by fundamental views of
                    Neo-Platonist origin, and it tends to be a compromise with theology. In order,
                    for example, to maintain the necessity of creation, he taught that all things
                    except God were admissible or possible in their own nature, but that certain of
                    them were rendered necessary by the act of the creative first agent,—in other
                    words, that the possible could be transformed into the necessary. Avicenna’s
                    theory of the process of knowledge is an interesting part of his doctrine. Man
                    has a rational soul, one face of which is turned towards the body, and, by the
                    help of the higher aspect, acts as practical understanding; the other face lies
                    open to the reception and acquisition of the intelligible forms, and its aim is
                    to become a reasonable<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0170-0155"/> world, reproducing the forms of the universe and
                    their intelligible order. In man there is only the susceptibility to reason,
                    which is sustained and helped by the light of the active intellect. Man may
                    prepare himself for this influx by removing the obstacles which prevent the
                    union of the intellect with the human vessel destined for its reception. The
                    stages of this process to the acquisition of mind are generally enumerated by
                    Avicenna as four; in this part he follows not Aristotle, but the Greek
                    commentator. The first stage is that of the hylic or material intellect, a state
                    of mere potentiality, like that of a child for writing, before he has ever put
                    pen to paper. The second stage is called <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">habitu</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it is compared to the case of
                    a child that has learned the elements of writing, when the bare possibility is
                    on the way to be developed, and is seen to be real. In this period of
                    halftrained reason, it appears as happy conjecture, not yet transformed into art
                    or science proper. When the power of writing has been actualised, we have a
                    parallel to the <hi rend="italic">intellectus</hi><hi rend="italic">in
                    actu—</hi> the way of science and demonstration is entered. And when writing has
                    been made a permanent accomplishment, or lasting property of the subject, to be
                    taken up at will, it corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">intellectus
                    adeptus</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the complete mastery of science. The whole
                    process may be compared to the gradual illumination of a body naturally capable
                    of receiving light. There are, however, grades of susceptibility to the active
                    intellect, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in theological language, to
                    communication with God and his angels. Sometimes the receptivity is so vigorous
                    in its affinity, that without teaching it rises at one step to the vision of
                    truth, by a certain “holy force” above ordinary measure. (In this way philosophy
                    tried to account for the phenomenon of prophecy, one of the ruling ideas of
                    Islam.) But the active intellect is not merely influential on human souls. It is
                    the universal giver of forms in the world.</p>
                <p>In several points Avicenna endeavoured to give a <hi rend="italic">rationale</hi>
                    of theological dogmas, particularly of prophetic rule, of miracles, divine
                    providence, and immortality. The permanence of individual souls he supports by
                    arguments borrowed from those of Plato. The existence of a prophet is shown to
                    be a corollary from a belief in God as a moral governor, and the phenomena of
                    miracles are required to evidence the genuineness of the prophetic mission. For
                    man, in order to his well-being and the permanence of his kind, requires in the
                    first place a clear vision of right and truth, and must, secondly, depend upon
                    some power capable of carrying out these discoveries of moral law. If providence
                    has so arranged that the eyelids and the hair of the eyebrows shall grow to
                    protect the eye, much more is it needful for a prophet to arise who shall preach
                    the truth of God’s unity, prescribe laws for men, and exhort them to well-doing
                    by the promise of recompense to come. The weal of humanity demands the
                    revelation from God, and, to certify his office, the prophet must work miracles.
                    Just as in ordinary states the soul influences the bodily organs, so in exalted
                    conditions it may attain the level of those high immaterial spirits, whose
                    energy is strong enough to permeate the whole passive world. This mystical union
                    with the hidden universe is a mystery λvhich the ordinary mind cannot
                    understand. Many things then become visible as by a lightning flash in the
                    darkness, and are apprehended by the vigorous grasp of pure intuition. But more
                    generally the imagination throws itself on these intuitions, and presents them
                    to the lower soul under the semblance of forms and sounds—the angelic beauty
                    which the seer beholds, and the harmonious speech which a heavenly voice seems
                    to utter in his ear. Thus Avicenna, like his predecessors, tried to harmonise
                    the abstract forms of philosophy with the religious faith of his nation. But his
                    arguments are generally vitiated by the fallacy of assuming what they profess to
                    prove. His failure is made obvious by the attack of Algazali on the tendencies
                    and results of speculation.</p>
                <p>Upwards of 100 treatises are ascribed to Avicenna. Some of them are tracts of a
                    few pages, others are works extending through several volumes. The best-known
                    amongst them, ana that to which Avicenna owed his European reputation, is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Canon of Medicine;</hi> an Arabic edition of it appeared at
                    Rome 1593, and a Hebrew version at Naples in 1491. Of the Latin version there
                    were about thirty editions, founded on the original translation by Gerard of
                    Cremona. The 15th century has the honour of composing the great commentary on
                    the text of the <hi rend="italic">Canon,</hi> grouping around it all that theory
                    had imagined, and all that practice had observed. Other medical works translated
                    into Latin are the <hi rend="italic">Medicamenta Cordialia,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Canticum</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Medicina,
                    Tractatus</hi><hi rend="italic">de Syrupo Acetoso.</hi> Scarcely any member of
                    the Arabian circle of the sciences, including theology, philology, mathematics,
                    astronomy, physics, and music, has been left untouched by the treatises of
                    Avicenna, many of which probably varied little, except in being commissioned by
                    a different patron and having a different form or extent. He wrote at least one
                    treatise on alchemy, but several others have been falsely attributed to him. His
                    book on animals was translated by Michael Scot. His <hi rend="italic">Logic,
                    Metaphysics, Physics,</hi><hi rend="italic">De Coelo,</hi> are treatises giving
                    a synoptic view of Aristotelian doctrine. The <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Metaphysics</hi> have been printed more than once; the latter,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> at Venice in 1493, 1495, and 1546. Some of his
                    shorter essays on medicine, logic, &amp;c., take a poetical form (the poem on
                    logic was published by Schmoelders in 1836). Two encyclopaedic treatises,
                    dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned. The larger, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Al-Shefa</hi><hi rend="italic">(Sanatio),</hi> exists nearly complete in
                    manuscript in the Bodleian Library and elsewhere; part of it on the <hi
                    rend="italic">De Anima</hi> appeared at Pavia (1490) as the <hi rend="italic"

                    Avicenna’s philosophy given by Shahrastani seems to bs mainly an analysis, and
                    in many places a reproduction, of the <hi rend="italic">Al-Shefa.</hi> A shorter
                    form of the work is known as the <hi rend="italic">Al-Nedjat</hi><hi

                    been modified by the corrections which the monkish editors confess that they
                    applied. There is also a <hi rend="italic">Philosophia Orientalis,</hi>
                    mentioned by Roger Bacon, and now lost, which according to Averroes was
