                    (1517-1583), rector of Houghton-le-Spring, distinguished by the unusual way in
                    which he carried out his conception of the duties of a Christian pastor, was
                    descended from a Westmoreland family, and was born at Kentmere in 1517. At
                    Oxford he first adhered to the conservative side, and defended the doctrines of
                    the church against Hooper; but his confidence was somewhat shaken by another
                    public disputation which he had with Peter Martyr. In 1552 he preached before
                    King Edward VI. a sermon on sacrilege, which was duly published, and displays
                    the high ideal which even then he had formed of the clerical office; and about
                    the same time he was presented to the vicarage of Norton, in the diocese of
                    Durham, and obtained a licence, through William Cecil, as a general preacher
                    throughout the kingdom as long as the king lived. Instead of settling down in
                    England, however, he resigned his vicarage, and went abroad to pursue his
                    theological investigations, and if possible satisfy his mind on some disputed
                    matters. He carried out this intention at Louvain, Antwerp, and Paris; and from
                    a letter of his own, dated Louvain, 1554, we get a glimpse of the quiet student
                    rejoicing in an “excellent library belonging to a monastery of Minorites.”
                    Returning to England towards the close of Queen Mary’s reign, he was invested by
                    his uncle, Dr Tonstall, bishop of Durham, with the archdeaconry of Durham, to
                    which the rectory of Effington was annexed. The freedom of his attacks on the
                    vices, and especially the clerical vices, of his times excited hostility against
                    him, and he was formally brought before the bishop on a charge consisting of
                    thirteen articles. Tonstall, however, not only dismissed the case, but presented
                    the offender with the rich living of Houghton-le-Spring; and when the accusation
                    was again brought forward, he again protected him. Enraged at this defeat,
                    Gilpin’s enemies laid their complaint before Dr Bonner, bishop of London, and he
                    immediately gave orders for his apprehension. Upon this Gilpin prepared for
                    martyrdom; and, having ordered his house-steward to provide him with a long
                    garment, that he might “goe the more comely to the stake,” he set out for
                    London. Providentially, however, he broke his leg on the journey, and his
                    arrival was thus delayed till the news of Queen Diary’s death freed him from
                    further danger. He at once returned to Houghton, and there he continued to
                    labour till his death in 1583. When the Roman Catholic bishops were deprived, he
                    was offered the see of Carlisle; but he declined the honour. At Houghton his
                    course of life was a ceaseless round of benevolent activity. His hospitable
                    manner of living was the admiration of all. In his household, he spent “every
                    fortnight 40 bushels of corn, 20 bushels of malt, and an ox, besides a
                    proportional quantity of other kinds of provisions.” Strangers and travellers
                    found a ready reception; and even their horses were treated with so much care
                    that it was humorously said that, if one were turned loose in any part of the
                    country, it would immediately make its way to the rector of Houghton. Every
                    Sunday from Michaelmas till Easter was a public day with Gilpin. For the
                    reception of his parishioners he had three tables well covered,—one for
                    gentlemen, the second for husbandmen, the third for dap labourers; and this
                    piece of hospitality he never omitted, even when losses or scarcity made its
                    continuance difficult. He built and endowed a grammar-school at a cost of
                    upwards of &lt;£500, educated and maintained a large number of poor children at
                    his own charge, and provided the more promising pupils with means of studying at
                    the universities. So many young people, indeed, flocked to his school that there
                    was not accommodation for them in Houghton, and he had to fit up part of his
                    house as a boarding establishment. Grieved at the ignorance and superstition
                    which the remissness of the clergy permitted to flourish in the neighbouring
                    parishes, he used every year to visit the most neglected parts of
                    Northumberland, Yorkshire, Cheshire, Westmoreland, and Cumberland; and that his
                    own flock might not suffer, he was at the expense of a constant assistant. Among
                    his parishioners he was looked up to as a judge, and did great service in
                    preventing law-suits <pb break="no"

                    a loss, he delighted to make it good; if the harvest was bad, he was liberal in
                    the remission of tithes. And all this he was enabled to do because his frugality
                    was as great as his generosity; for his rectory was worth no more than £400 a
                    year. The boldness which he could display at need is well illustrated by his
                    action in regard to duelling. Finding one day a challenge-glove stuck up on the
                    door of a church where he was to preach, he took it down with his own hand, and
                    proceeded to the pulpit to inveigh against the unchristian custom.</p>
                <p>A life of Bernard Gilpin, written by George Carleton, bishop of Chichester, who
                    had been a pupil of Gilpin’s at Houghton, will be found in Bates’s Vitae
                    Selectorum aliquot Virorum, &amp;c., London, 1681. A translation of this sketch
                    by William Freake, minister, was published at London, 1629; and in 1852 it was
                    reprinted in Glasgow, with an introductory essay by Edward Irving. It forms one
                    of the lives in Christopher Wordsworth’s Ecclesiastical Biography (vol. iii.,
                    4th edit.), having been compared with Carleton’s Latin text. Another biography
                    of Gilpin, which, however, adds little to Bishop Carleton’s, was written by
                    William Gilpin, Μ. A., prebendary of Ailsbury, London, 1753, and 1854.</p>
