                    nearly the same events in somewhat similar language, and are hence called
                    synoptical (σ⅛, together; <hi rend="italic">oψi&lt;s,</hi> view). It wdl be
                    advantageous to begin with the treatment of these, as to their origin, date, and
                    objects, so far as can be determined from (1) internal evidence and (2) external
                    evidence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Internal Evidence.</hi></p>
                <p>In discussing the internal evidence, it will be convenient to speak, first, of
                    those portions of the synoptic narrative which are found in three Gospels; then
                    of those which are found in only two; and, lastly, of those which are found in
                    only one.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Triple Tradition.—</hi> Few are aware of the very small
                    extent to which independent narrators of the same events use the same words. A
                    comparison of a few specimens of independent narratives (of such events, for
                    example, as the attempt to assassinate King Humbert, or the recent death of the
                    Prince Imperial) would show that the narratives often contain scarcely two or
                    three consecutive words in common, and rarely or never a whole clause of five or
                    six words. The same statement applies to narratives of discourses of any length
                    reported from memory, and not from notes taken at the moment. Now it is well
                    known that in many parts of the first three Gospels the same words and phrases
                    are curiously interlaced, in such a way as to suggest that the writers have
                    borrowed either from each other or from some common source. For example, in
                    describing the healing of the sick (Mat. viii. 16; Mk. i. 32; Lu. iv. 40),
                    Matthew begins thus: <hi rend="italic">όψίας</hi> δε <hi rend="italic"
                    >yevopHης;</hi> Mark, δι∕uας δ∈ <hi rend="italic">yevopiwfpi</hi> 6τe ∈δυσεv ό
                    ήλιον; Luke, δυvovτoς δέ <hi rend="italic">του ήλιου.</hi> From this and many
                    similar passages it might seem natural to infer that Mark borrowed one of these
                    expressions from Matthew and the other from Luke, and that the narrative of Mark
                    is little more than a combination of passages from Matthew and Luke. This is an
                    inference which has actually been drawn by many critics both before and since De
                    Wette; but at present it finds comparatively little support among competent
                    investigators. However, the oscillations of New Testament criticism have been so
                    numerous that it may be of use to indicate a method by which the originality of
                    Mark may be established on an immovable basis. That Mark (at all events in many
                    parts) contains the original document or tradition from which Matthew and Luke
                    have borrowed can be proved to demonstration by a necessary inference from the
                    following specimen of narrative common to the three writers.<note

                    Luke have no additional matter in common, except that in verse 3 of Mark they
                    insert <hi rend="italic">οi</hi><hi rend="italic">γεωργοί</hi> for clearness; in
                    verse 7 they insert <hi rend="italic">ιδόντες</hi>; and in verse 9 they insert
                    <hi rend="italic">ovv.</hi> Are these facts compatible with the theory that Mark
                    compounded his narrative out of Matthew and Luke <hi rend="italic">1</hi></p>
                <p>We may begin by dismissing the three trifling words which "Matthew and Luke agree
                    in adding to the Triple Tradition (by which we mean the matter common to the
                    three Gospels), as being words that any early editor of Mark might naturally
                    insert. The insertion of the subject in verse 3, for clearness, requires no
                    comment. The <hi rend="italic">oυv</hi> in verse 9 softens an abruptness which
                    (however characteristic of Mark) would naturally repel readers and editors.
                    Again, in verse 7 the omission of some phrase to denote that thehusbandmen saw
                    the son approaching before they formed their plan, is so abrupt that <hi
                    rend="italic">lδovτες</hi> or <hi rend="italic">θεασάμενοι</hi> has been
                    actually supplied in Mark by several manuscripts and versions (possibly, of
                    course, influenced by Matthew and Luke), and might naturally be supplied by
                    still earlier editors, Having therefore accounted for these words, we are led to
                    this result, that, from Mk. xii. 1 to Mk. xii. 11, Matthew and Luke contain
                    nothing in common which is not also found in a slightly modified edition of
                    Mark.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The verse added in
                    Matt. xxi. 44 is omitted by Tischendorf, and is perhaps not part of the text of
                    Matthew. But, if genuine, it is a reference to the “winnowing-stone” in Daniel
                    ii. 44, 45, which might naturally be added by some early editor of the original
                    tradition, and might readily be adopted into the subsequent editions of it,
                    which are known to us as the Gospels according to Matthew and Luke.</p></note>
                    This being the case, it can be proved by <hi rend="italic">reductio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad absτιrdum</hi> that Mark did not copy from Matthew and Luke.
                    For suppose that he did so copy, it follows that he must not only have
                    constructed a narrative based upon two others, borrowing here a piece from
                    Matthew and here a piece from Luke, but that he must have deliberately
                    determined to insert, and must have adapted his narrative so as to insert, every
                    word that was common to Matthew and Luke. The difficulty of doing this is
                    enormous, and will be patent to any one who will try to perform a similar
                    literary feat himself. To embody the whole of even one document in a narrative
                    of one’s own, without copying it <hi rend="italic">verbatim,</hi> and to do this
                    in a free and natural manner, requires no little care. But to take two
                    documents, to put them side by side and analyse their common matter, and then to
                    write a narrative, graphic, abrupt, and in all respects the opposite of
                    artificial, which shall contain every phrase and word that is common to
                    both—this would be a <hi rend="italic">tour de force</hi> even for a skilful
                    literary forger of these days, and may be dismissed as an impossibility for the
                    writer of the Second Gospel.</p>
                <p>For example, Mark might have begun his narrative, Kα'ι <hi rend="italic">ελεγεv
                    αiτοις,</hi> omitting <hi rend="italic">παραβολήν</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    he might have borrowed <hi rend="italic">οικοδεσπότης</hi> from Matthew and have
                    dropped <hi rend="italic">άνθρωπος</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> he might have
                    borrowed <hi rend="italic">πεμψaι</hi> from Luke (ver. 11) instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">άπεστειλε.</hi> Had he done these things (all natural enough),, we
                    should have at once had, as additional “common matter” for Matthew and Luke, <hi
                    rend="italic">παραβολήν, άνθρωπος,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">άπεστειλεν,</hi>
                    and all in the space of three verses, and “common matter” proportionally in the
                    rest of the narrative. We may assume, therefore, that Mark did not copy Matthew
                    and Luke in this passage, nor in other passages where a similar phenomenon
                    occurs. But it occurs throughout by far the greater part of Mark’s narrative. We
                    may, therefore, regard it as absolutely certain that by far the greater part of
                    Mark is not borrowed from Matthew and Luke, and that the duality of phrase,
                    which is undoubtedly a characteristic of Mark, must be explained by other
                    causes. (For other passages where Matthew and Luke have little or no additional
                    matter in common, compare more especially the passages parallel to Mk. ii.
                    13-17; iii. 1-6;. V. 1-39; X. 17-31; xi. 1-10; xii. 13-27; xiii. 1-19; xiv.
                    1-16; XV. 1-11.)</p>
                <p>The question remains, Were Matthew and Luke entirely dependent upon Mark for that
                    part of their narrative which covers the same ground as Mark? It would not be
                    difficult, from a comparison of the three columns above, to make it probable
                    that both Matthew and Luke did not borrow from the complete Mark as we have it.
                    For though each of the three additions <hi rend="italic">οvv,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ιδόντες, οι γεωργοί,</hi> is in itself natural enough, yet the
                    hypothesis that Matthew and Luke independently adopted precisely these and no
                    other-additions is most improbable. From a comparison of many such passages the
                    improbability of the borrowing hypothesis might be increased. But as the process
                    of proof could not be complete, and would certainly belong, it will be better to
                    bring forward some short passages which are wholly irreconcilable with the
                    hypothesis of deliberate borrowing, and which point to an original source,
                    either written or oral, round which the three narratives play. Those passages
                    will be most convincing where there are traces that some original tradition has
                    been differently understood by the different writers.</p>
                <p>(a) One natural error in interpreting a terse tradition (perhaps translated from
                    Aramaic into Greek) would be to supply different subjects to the same verbs, as
                    in the following important passages, which variously describe the message of the
                    angel or angels to the women at the tomb of Jesus :—</p>

                <p>On the other hand, Luke, who records several appearances of the Lord to the ’
                    disciples in or near Jerusalem, and who does not take the Galilean view of the
                    resurrection, finds the words <hi rend="italic">εls τ⅛v</hi> Γ. out of place in
                    his narrative. Yet his memory or knowledge of the common tradition is too strong
                    to allow him to omit all mention of Galilee, and he therefore inserts it, but
                    differently.</p>

                <p>(ε) In the following, Matthew and Mark concur in attributing “desire” and “fear;”
                    but Matthew attributes the “desire” to Herod, Mark to Herodias; again, Matthew
                    makes the object of the “fear” to be the “crowd,” Mark “John the Baptist.”</p>

                    and all those previously quoted, point to some original tradition (whether
                    written or oral) upon which our three synoptic Gospels are based. These then are
                    the results to which (so far) we are led :—(1) Mark certainly did not borrow
                    from Matthew and Luke; (2) Matthew and Luke, though clearly influenced by some
                    form of Mark, yet probably borrowed, not from Mark, but from some original
                    tradition upon which Mark also is based.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Nature of
                    the Triple Tradition.—</hi> What was the original tradition upon which our three
                    synoptic Gospels are based? Was it Aramaic or Greek? oral or written? single or
                    manifold? Did the earliest of our synoptists receive it fresh from its first
                    source, or after it had passed through many recensions? Few or none of these
                    questions (to some of which reference will be made hereafter) can be answered
                    with absolute certainty; but it is evident that, if Matthew, Mark, and Luke are
                    all based upon an earlier original tradition, then those words and phrases which
                    are common to Matthew, Mark, and Luke (to which we have given the name of the
                    Triple Tradition) must have a peculiar weight, as approximating to the original
                    tradition itself. If it be found that these scattered words and phrases make up
                    of themselves an almost continuous narrative, we may fairly suppose that we are
                    approximating very closely indeed to the original tradition. We shall not expect
                    to find a perfectly continuous narrative. On the contrary, a perfectly
                    continuous narrative, identical in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, would imply, not a
                    floating early variable tradition, but a document simply copied by the authors
                    of our Gospels.</p><p>An early tradition, circulated perhaps in various
                    churches, iu Antioch, in Rome, in Ephesus, in Corinth, before being embodied in
                    a document, will naturally have been modified, supplemented, and sometimes (as
                    above) confused. Mere especially in certain unimportant and constantly recurring
                    words and phrases we may expect variations. The words “said,” “answered,”
                    “went,” “journeyed,” “asked,” “questioned,” “tempted,” “refused,” “rebuked,”
                    &amp;c., may naturally be expected to differ in the three versions. But greater
                    differences will soon arise. One version will lay greater stress on the details
                    of miracles; another on the relations between Jesus and John the Baptist;
                    another on the law; another on the forgiveness of sins; and this varying
                    emphasis will produce certain modifications of the original tradition. Again, in
                    the early times of the church, the Greek of slaves and freedmen may pass without
                    offence; but in later times an editor of the Gospel, writ ing for readers of
                    higher rank and better education, will</p></note><hi rend="italic">(η)</hi> The

                <p>Here (1) in Matthew the bystanders address the man who brings the drink to Jesus;
                    but (2) in Mark the man addresses the bystanders. In (1) the meaning is “desist
                    from giving the drink;” in (2) it appears to be “desist from mocking.” But in
                    any case, the meaning differs in Matthew and Mark.</p>
                <p>Many other instances might be given <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Mat. xiv.

                    which two traditional versions of a saying of our Lord, blended into one by
                    Mark, appear to have caused a confusion: (a) “Every sin and blasphemy shall be
                    remitted to <hi rend="italic">men,</hi> but blasphemy against the Spirit shall
                    not be remitted;” <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> Whosoever
                    speaketh a word against the <hi rend="italic">Son</hi><hi rend="italic">of

                    Spirit, it shall not be remitted to him.” Matthew gives both these versions,
                    Luke one of them (with slight variations). But Mark, combining the former part
                    of the first version with the latter part of the second, so as to omit the
                    phrase “Son of Man,” and yet feeling that some mention of “Son of Man” was made
                    in the tradition, substitutes for “men” “sons of men,” a phrase that is not
                    found elsewhere in the whole of the Gospels :—</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n816/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0816-0793"/>
                <p>substitute less uncouth words for the original barbarisms. Thus, from varying
                    causes, the different versions of the tradition will deviate; and when we come
                    to compare three of them together, and to write down the words common to the
                    three, we shall no longer find the original continuous tradition. Gaps in the
                    sense will occur every now and then, owing to the omission of some necessary
                    word. On the other hand, although the literary cement (so to speak) which fills
                    up the interstices between the words and deeds of the Lord may naturally vary,
                    we may expect that the words of the Lord Himself will be more carefully
                    preserved, and more identically reported by all three synoptists, so that they
                    will give a more continuous sense, and will enable us to approximate to the
                    original tradition. Let us now take the Gospel of Mark, and set down, from the
                    first two chapters of it, all such words as it contains in common with Matthew
                    and Luke, merely adding in italics such words as may enable the reader to
                    perceive the structure of each sentence; and let us see whether the words thus
                    collected show any traces of a continuous narrative;—<note anchored="true"

                <p>Few will have any difficulty in following the above narrative which represents
                    the Triple Tradition of the synoptists. It will be generally admitted that, so
                    far as it extends, it omits little of importance: and its con tinuity will
                    commend it as likely to be, if not the original tradition, at all events a
                    closer approximation to it than we are likely to find elsewhere. It therefore
                    becomes an important business to consider the scope and variations of the Triple
                    Tradition,—where it is full and ample, where it is meagre, where it begins and
                    where it ends.</p>
                <p>The commencement of the Triple Tradition has been given in the specimen quoted
                    above. It begins with the proclamation made by John the Baptist, of the advent
                    of the Stronger One. Describing (Mk. iii.) the cure of the withered hand, the
                    choice of the Twelve, the discourse on blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, and
                    the answer to the question, “Who is My mother and My brethren ?” it passes
                    (chap, iv.) to the parables of the sower and the mustard seed, which it gives
                    very fully; the rebuking of the wind and the exorcism of the legion (Mk. v.) are
                    given as follows :—</p>
                <p>Mk. iv. 35. <hi rend="italic">“Let us</hi> go <hi rend="italic">across</hi> to
                    the other side. <hi rend="italic">They took</hi> Hi(m) I ⅛ a boat. ∣∣ They
                    wak(e) Hi(m) say(ing), We perish: and He, arising, rebuked the win(d). ∣∣ And
                    there was a calm. <hi rend="italic">He said</hi> to them, I Your faith! ∣∣ They
                    said, <hi rend="italic">Who</hi> is this that even the wind obey(eth) Him ?” Mk.
                    v. 1. “And they <hi rend="italic">came</hi> across into the land of the
                    [Gadarenes, Gerasenes, or Gergesenes]. There met Him ∣ <hi rend="italic"
                    >one</hi> [Mat. two] in the ∣∣ tombs ∣∣ crying, ∣ What is there <hi
                    rend="italic">between me</hi> and Thee, Thou Son of God? ∣∣ Torment <hi
                    rend="italic">me not.</hi> ∣∣ And he [Mat. they] besought Him . . . into . . .
                    ∣∣ And He . . . them, ∣ goin(g) forth, they come to (or into) the swine, and the
                    herd rushed down the steep place into the sea [Lu. lake] and were choked [Mat.
                    perished], ∣ Those that were feeding them ∣ fled and brought word into the city.
                    ∣∣ They came ∣∣ Jesus. ∣∣ And ∣ <hi rend="italic">they besought</hi> Him <hi
                    rend="italic">to depart</hi> from ∣ them.”</p>
                <p>This is given as a specimen of those passages where the narrative is not so
                    continuous, and where there is some appearance of confusion. The evidence of
                    confusion is confirmed (1) by the fact that a word is used here (δαipωv) to
                    denote “spirit” or “demon,” which is not found once elsewhere in the whole of
                    the Gospels, nor, indeed, anywhere in the New Testament (except in the
                    Apocalypse twice), whereas δαtpwιov is used forty-five times, and <hi
                    rend="italic">πvevpa</hi> twenty-seven times in the three Gospels alone; (2) by
                    the difference of the names for the locality, Gadara, Gerasa, Gergesa; (3) by
                    the fact that Matthew speaks of two demoniacs instead of one.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It has been suggested
                    (Abbott, <hi rend="italic">Through Nature to Christ,</hi> p. 447) that this
                    extremely difficult narrative may have arisen from a misunderstanding of the
                    phenomena of possession. Compare the story in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Evangelium</hi><hi rend="italic">Infantile</hi><hi rend="italic">Arabicum</hi>
                    (a Gospel which shows special traces of Mark’s influence) in which (chap, xi.)
                    it is said of a certain demoniac that “demons, in the shape of crows and
                    serpents, began to go forth, fleeing from out his mouth.” But it is perhaps more
                    likely that the variation in the name of the place points to some
                    misunderstanding as to the origin of the story. The name Gadara, ΠTJ1, sometimes
                    means a “sheepfold”; and <hi rend="italic">gâdâr,</hi> though not a Syriac word,
                    is yet given in the Syriac lexicons as Hebrew for “flock.” Again, the correct
                    reading in. Mark is probably “Gerasene,” not “Gadarene”; and the word B <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> "&gt;5 means “to cast out.” Lastly, the third
                    reading, “Gergesa,” supported by Origen, is expressly said by that author (<hi
                    rend="italic">Comm, in Ev. Joann.,</hi> vi. 24) to mean ‘ ‘ <hi rend="italic"
                    >παροικία</hi><hi rend="italic">eκβεβλη-κiτωvf</hi> “the district of those who
                    cast out”; and he suggests that the name was probably prophetical, referring to
                    our Lord’s expulsion from the district <hi rend="italic">(fπωvυμ,os obσa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">τάχα</hi><hi rend="italic">πρoφητικωs').</hi> Now, when a
                    narrative of an event reported to have occurred at a certain place contains
                    three different names of the place, and when each of the three names is adapted
                    to the event, such a triple adaptation is obviously likely to be not a mere
                    casual coincidence, but rather a convergence pointing to some misunderstanding
                    or non-historical nucleus as th » centre and origin of the narrative. What the
                    misunderstanding was may be a matter of conjecture, but that there was some
                    misunderstanding is a probability approaching to certainty.</p></note></p>
                <p>The restoring to life of the daughter of a ruler (Mk. and Lu., ruler of a
                    synagogue) is next thus briefly related: “<hi rend="italic">He came</hi> into
                    the house. ∣ <hi rend="italic">She</hi> is not dead, but sleepeth. And they
                    mocked Him. ∣∣ Having taken Λer by the hand ∣ Arise.” Then follow (chap, vi.)
                    the mission of the twelve, Herod’s conjecture about the new prophet, and the
                    feeding of the five thousand, which runs thus (Mk. vi. 44) :—</p>

                <p>The walking on the waves is much more briefly recorded (Mk. vi. 46-51). <hi

                    the sea. II It is I; be not afraid.” Then follows a blank, in which Matthew and
                    Mark generally agree, while Luke is altogether wanting; and, after this, the
                    famous confession of Peter, followed closely by the transfiguration.</p>

                    >They saw</hi> Jesus alone.”</p>
                <p>From Mark ix. 14 to x. 16 there is a break in the common tradition, which here
                    records little except three or four sayings of the Lord.</p>
                <p>“0 faithless generation, how long shall 1 be with you ?” “The</p>
                <p>Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of men.” “Whosoever receiveth a child
                    in My name receiveth Me.” <hi rend="italic">“If any one</hi> cause one of these
                    little ones to stumble, <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    the se(a).” ‘ ‘ Salt <hi rend="italic">is good,</hi> but if the salt <hi
                    rend="italic">lose its savour,</hi> wherewith shall it be salted?” “Suffer the
                    children; forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom.”</p>
                <p>In contrast to this discontinuity, Mark x. 17-52 gives a continuous tradition
                    about the rich young man, the promise of reward to the disciples, the
                    predictions of betrayal, and the healing of the blind man near Jericho. The
                    entry into Jerusalem and the purification of the temple (xi. 1-17) are also
                    fairly continuous. The disputes in the temple touching the baptism of John (xi.
                    27-33), the wicked husbandmen (xii. 1—12), and the tribute-money (xii. 13-17)
                    are very continuous. A brief denunciation of the Pharisees, who love the first
                    seats in synagogues and at feasts, is found in Mark xii. 38-40. The Triple
                    Tradition then touches on the second coming of Jesus. Luke has here omitted many
                    important passages which are recorded by Matthew and Mark alone, and which will
                    be given hereafter (see p. 795). Here we will set down nothing but the common
                    tradition, marking Luke’s omissions.</p>
                <p>Mk. xiii. 1. “And ∣∣ He said. ∣∣ Not a stone shall be left on stone, which shall
                    not be cast down. ∣∣ <hi rend="italic">They asked</hi> Hirn, ∣∣ When shall these

                    in which Matthew and Mark predict “false Christs" and “the darkening of the
                    sum"] “And the powers of (or <hi rend="italic">in)</hi> the heavens shall be

                    knoweth, not even the angels in heaven, nor even the Son, but only the Father.”
                    But Luke omits this. The Triple Tradition passes to the betrayal of Jesus. The
                    traitor’s compact (Mk. xiv. 10, 11) and the visit to the city to eat the
                    Passover are briefly narrated. From this point the Triple Tradition becomes more
                    and more scanty, till it leaves us at last little more than a few disconnected
                    sayings of Jesus.</p>

                <p>At this point the tradition not only becomes discontinuous, but also shows marks
                    of confusion. The tradition appears to have been that the women “beheld,” or
                    came to “behold” (another tradition added at “dawn ”), and came to the tomb; but
                    what “dawn” is meant, and what was the object of their beholding, is left
                    uncertain.</p>

                    added by some later editor; and henceforth the narratives of Matthew and
                    Luke—having lost Mark— present no further traces of agreement.</p>
                <p>To sum up the contents of the common tradition, it omits the genealogies,
                    miraculous incarnation, and the picturesque details of the infancy; it lays
                    emphasis on the relations between John the Baptist and Jesus; it contains none
                    of the parables except the sower, the mustard seed, and the wicked husbandmen,
                    and few of the long discourses of Jesus, except an abridged prediction of the
                    second coming. The disputes between Jesus and the Pharisees about the Sabbath,
                    about fasting, about exorcism, about the baptism of John, and the tribute, and
                    Christ the Son of David, and the dialogue with the Sadducees about the
                    resurrection, are very fully given; and so also is the dialogue with the rich
                    young man. Indeed it is a collection of dialogues and anecdotes rather than a
                    set treatise of doctrine or biography. The sayings of Jesus recorded in it are
                    short, pithy, and abrupt,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    do we find a sentence which goes down deep below all polemics, and reveals a
                    deep-laid spiritual plan. But putting such sentences together we perceive that
                    the Triple Tradition describes a prophet wholly different from any that had
                    before appeared in Israel; a prophet who not only (like Isaiah) protested
                    against sabbaths and purifications as ends in themselve3, but who also preached
                    the Fatherhood of God in a manner entirely peculiar to Himself, and who set
                    aside the Mosaic law of divorce (Mk. x. 2-11). He also instructed His disciples
                    to enter into the kingdom as little children (x. 15), and seems to have attached
                    a certain symbolic mystery to childhood as representing Himself (ix. 37). He
                    taught His disciples further to devote their lives to Him, and to ignore all
                    life apart from Him (viii. 34), (“to confess Christ, to deny themselves ”). From
                    the first He claims the power of forgiving sins (ii. 7); and, as soon as one of
                    His disciples confessed Him to be the Messiah, He prepared for death, predicting
                    that He should die, but rise again. Then, after prophesying the fall of the
                    temple, and great distress in all nations, He predicted a final triumph for His
                    disciples; and after bequeathing Himself, His body and His blood, as at a
                    funeral feast, as His final legacy to His disciples, He was arrested and put to
                    death.</p>
                <p>Several miracles of healing are recorded, and, in addition to these, the exorcism
                    of the Gadarene (in which, however, great confusion is apparent), the stilling
                    of the storm, the feeding of the five thousand, and the transfiguration. From
                    the beginning of the discourse on the second coming, Luke diverges more and more
                    from Matthew and Mark. After the death of Jesus, Matthew and Mark continue to
                    agree in words and phrases, but a little confusion is apparent; and the
                    tradition suddenly terminates without any record of the appearance of Jesus to
                    His disciples. However we may regret this, it is perhaps what may be naturally
                    expected on the hypothesis that we have before us an early tradition originated
                    at a time when the numerous manifestations of Jesus after His death were still
                    attested by living witnesses; when as yet it had been found impossible to reduce
                    the experiences and impressions of those who had seen Him—impressions
                    necessarily variable and transient, blended with fear and with an excitement
                    bordering on ecstasy—to a consistent and historical shape; and when it had not
                    yet been found necessary to define and harden the narrative so as to adapt it
                    for the purpose of meeting doubts and objections.</p>

                    language, but with an almost identical conclusion (Mat. xv. 21-28; Mk. vii.
                    24-30); (9) the feeding of the four thousand (Mat. xv. 32-38; Mk. viii. 1—9),
                    and the comparison between this miracle and that of the five thousand (Mat. xvi.

                    concerning divorce (Mat. xix. 4-8; Mk. x. 2-9); (12) the saying (but Luke
                    inserts it elsewhere) that “many that are first shall be last” (Mat. xix. 30;
                    Mk. x. 31); (13) the petition of the sons of Zebedee for the chief places (Mat.

                    great commandment” (Mat. xxii. 36; Mk. xii. 28); (16) in the discourse on the
                    last day, Luke omits reference to the “consummation,” <hi rend="italic"

                    the Son knoweth not;” (17) later on, Luke omits the anointing of Jesus “for His
                    burial” (Mat. xxvi. 6-13; Mk. xiv. 3-9); (18) “I will smite the Shepherd,”
                    &amp;c., and “1 will go before you into Galilee” (Mat. xxvi. 31, 32; Mk. xiv.
                    27, 28); (19) the compact of Judas with the priests that a kiss should be the
                    signal (Mat. xxvi. 48; Mk. xiv. 44); (20) the false witness about “destroying
                    the temple in three days” (Mat. xxvi. 59, 62; Mk. xiv. 55-60); (21) the taunt
                    “Thou that destroyest the temple” (Mat. xxvii. 40; Mk. XV. 29); (22) the
                    utterance of Jesus, “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me ?” with the
                    consequent misunderstanding of the bystanders (Mat. xxvii. 46-49; Mk. xv.
                    34-36); (23) the utterance of the angel (or angels) at the tomb, “He goeth
                    before you into Galilee: there shall ye see Him” (Mat. xxviii. 7; Mk. xvi.
                    7).</p>
                <p>In considering these passages it is natural to ask whether any reason (besides
                    ignorance of them) can be alleged why Luke should have omitted them. It is
                    scarcely possible to fail to see design in some of these omissions,—for example,
                    in those which relate to John the Baptist and Elias (1), (5), and (10). The
                    author of the Acts of the Apostles is by general consent admitted to be
                    identical with the author of the Third Gospel. Now remembering that Luke in the
                    Acts (xix. 3) informs us that, many years after the death of Jesus, there were
                    in Ephesus several disciples who were baptized with the baptism of John, and
                    knew nothing of the Holy Spirit, we may well understand that the author of the
                    Acts finds it necessary, when writing a gospel, to put in as clear a light as
                    possible the subordination of John to Jesus. Accordingly, in place of the
                    graphic description of the austere food and garb of the prophet, he gives (iii.
                    10-14) a description of his teaching, as containing the elements of a simple and
                    almost commonplace morality, intended merely to prepare the way for a higher
                    teaching, and he adds an express negative from the prophet in answer to those
                    who doubted whether John were the Messiah. Repeatedly does Luke deviate from the
                    common tradition of Matthew and Mark on the subject of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n819/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0819-0796"/> Elias; and in each case the object is apparent.
                    Only a close inspection of a harmony of the Gospels will make this clear; but
                    three or four passages may be mentioned which point in this direction. Luke has
                    already (i. 17) declared that John will go before Jesus “in the spirit and
                    power” of Elias, but he cautiously avoids committing himself to the tradition
                    (Mk. ix. 13; Mat. xvii. 13) that John was Elias. The belief in an actual
                    transmigration of souls he will allow the multitude to entertain (ix. 8, 19),
                    but not Herod: for whereas in Mark (vi. 16) Herod says, “Whom I beheaded, viz.,
                    John, this man <hi rend="italic">(ovτoς, corr.</hi> text), is risen from the
                    dead,” Luke, by a slight transposition of the traditional words, converts the
                    proposition into a question: “John I beheaded; but who is this man?” And,
                    further, in order to prepare the way for the interview between Herod and the
                    Lord—which he purposes to describe at the end of his Gospel (xxiii. 8, 9), and
                    to refer to in his continuation of the Gospel (Acts iv. 27)—he adds the words,
                    “And he (Herod) was desirous to see Him.” Again Mark (ix. 6) tells us that Peter
                    “not knowing <hi rend="italic">what io answer,”</hi> proposed to build three
                    tabernacles for Jesus, M03es, and Elias; but Luke reads (ix. 33), “not knowing
                    <hi rend="italic">xvhat he said,”</hi> as if to caution the reader against
                    supposing that Elias or Moses could be seriously placed on the same level as
                    Jesus. For the same reason he omits the irreverent misunderstanding of the
                    bystander who supposed that Jesus in his last moments called for Elias, and even
                    the utterance itself (Mat. xxvii. 49; Mk. xv. 36).</p>
                <p>With reference to many of the other omissions it will be noticed that Luke seems
                    to have before him somewhat different versions of the narratives, which
                    different versions he inserts elsewhere. For example, he gives a version of the
                    calling of the apostle-fishermen, which adds a miraculous draught of fishes,
                    thereby approximating to the narrative in the Fourth Gospel (xxi. 6-11). Again
                    Luke places the murmuring of the Nazarenes much earlier, in the fore-front of
                    the ministry of Jesus, as was very natural, and gives an entirely different
                    version of it. The ministry of the angels after the temptation he omits; but he
                    alone records the ministry of the angel (xxii. 43) when Jesus was tempted in
                    Gethsemane, for which temptation he carefully prepares the way by saying (iv.
                    13) that the devil departed from Jesus only “for a season.” As regards the
                    anointing “for the burial,” it is probable we have a different version of it in
                    his story of the woman that was “a sinner” (vii. 37). The reasons for the
                    omission of the feeding of the four thousand and the withering of the fig· tree
                    are not so obvious. The omission could hardly have been dictated by any desire
                    to minimize the supernatural (seeing that Luke contains many miracles peculiar
                    to himself, and that he does not shrink from giving in full detail the exorcism
                    of the Gadarene). It is possible that he omitted the former as being too similar
                    to the feeding of the five thousand to require to be repeated; and if he
                    regarded it (as the author of the Fourth Gospel does) as having a sacramental
                    meaning, one story of the kind may have seemed sufficient. If the story of the
                    withered fig-tree was regarded by him in the same way (rather as emblematic than
                    as historical), then it may have been replaced in his narrative by the story of
                    the barren fig tree (peculiar to Luke), to which the master came seeking fruit
                    and finding none. It is also noticeable that the moral (on the power of faith)
                    deduced from the withering of the fig tree in Matthew and Mark is contained in
                    Luke, but in a different form. In Matthew and Mark it runs: “If ye say to this
                    <hi rend="italic">mountain,</hi> Be raised up and cast into the sea;” whereas in
                    Luke (xvii. 6) it is, “Ye might have said to this <hi rend="italic">sycamine
                    tree,</hi> Be rooted up and planted in the sea.” This perhaps slightly confirms
                    the supposition that Luke regarded the narrative of the fig-tree rather as a
                    parable than as a fact. But it is important to bear in mind that we have little
                    more than the evidence of conjecture to explain some of Luke’s omissions. For
                    example, the story of the walking on the waves, as told by Matthew and Mark,
                    represents the disciples as being alarmed by the thought that the apparition of
                    the Lord was only a spirit (φαrτασ∕zα); unless Luke considered that the ground
                    of this narrative was occupied by his account of a similar fear when the
                    disciples beheld the Lord after the resurrection, it is hard to suggest any
                    reason for its omission. This class of omissions may be terminated with that
                    numbered (19) above—the compact of Judas concerning the signal. It is obvious
                    here that Luke has another version of the tradition in his mind. He alone of the
                    three records the words of Jesus, “Betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss,”
                    thereby making it unnecessary to explain (with Matthew and Mark) that the kiss
                    was a signal fixed by the traitor.</p>
                <p>Another class of passages may possibly have been omitted as being not of interest
                    to the Gentile world, or as being liable to misunderstanding or perversion. The
                    story of the Syro-Phcenician woman perhaps appeared to the editor of the Gentile
                    Gospel to exhibit Jesus in too harsh a light; the application to Jesus of the
                    prophecy “I will smite the Shepherd,” appeared more liable to misunderstanding
                    than “He was reckoned with transgressors” (not found in Mark’s genuine text);
                    the discussion of the law of divorce and of the regulations touching
                    uncleanness, and the part played by Herodias in the execution of the Baptist,
                    may have seemed to lack interest for readers outside Palestine. In the discourse
                    on the second coming it would be natural for an editor of the tradition writing
                    after the siege of Jerusalem to substitute “encircled by armies” for the
                    “abomination of desolation ”—a phrase that would perplex a Gentile reader, and
                    also to modify some of the hyperbolic and emblematic expressions. Lastly, the
                    mention of the “false witness” concerning the destruction of the temple, and the
                    raising up of a new temple in three days, may have begun to present a difficulty
                    in times when the temple actually had been destroyed, and when the Lord Jesus
                    Himself had come to be regarded as the new temple not made with hands. Although
                    therefore Luke does not go so far as the author of the Fourth Gospel (who
                    exhibits Jesus as actually predicting the destruction of the temple and as
                    promising to raise it up in three days), yet he not only omits the “false
                    witness,” but also the allusion to it contained in the taunts addressed to Jesus
                    on the cross, “Thou that destroyest the temple and raisest it again in three
                    days, save Thyself” (Mat. xxvii. 40; Mk. xv. 29).</p>
                <p>The above explanation of Luke’s omissions may only partially commend itself to
                    the reader; but few will fail to see that there is at least some method and
                    motive in most of them. It is a matter of certainty that in the Triple Tradition
                    many of Luke’s omissions and modifications of phrases and words are not
                    accidental but editorial: it is but natural therefore to suppose (especially
                    when reasons can easily be assigned) that editorial reasons may also explain
                    omissions and modifications of narratives and discourses. Of course it is not
                    maintained that Luke, or any individual editor, made these changes on his own
                    responsibility. Many of them are probably the result of a “Gentile use” which
                    had gradually sprung up in certain churches, and which was not created but
                    adopted and expressed by the author of the Third Gospel. Consequently we are not
                    obliged to suppose that the omissions resulted from ignorance. The very fact
                    that it is easy to supply motives and reasons for the omission of these
                    narratives increases their credibility, by diminishing the probability <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n820/mode/1up"

                    author of the Third Gospel. The passages omitted are generally in the style of
                    the common tradition, and they contain incidents of a similar kind to the
                    incidents of the common tradition. It only remains to add that (except in the
                    story of the Syro-Phoenician woman, and, in a lesser degree, in the question of
                    the lawyer about the great commandment) Matthew and Mark closely agree whenever
                    Luke separates himself from them. This is also found frequently to be the case
                    in the Triple Tradition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    22; Mat. xix. 22; Lu. xviii. 23). Sometimes the divergence appears to arise from
                    literary motives, and especially from the dislike of repetition (Lu. iv. 32;
                    Mat. vii. 29; Mk. i. 22); but in other cases it cannot be so explained :—Lu. v.
                    29, 30; Mat. ix. 10, 11; Mk. ii. 15, 16: Lu. v. 33, 34; Mat. ix. 14, 15; Mk. ii.
                    18, 19 (see also, in a parable, Lu. v. 36; Mat. ix. 16; Mk. ii. 21): Lu. vi. 11;
                    Mat. xii. 14; Mk. iii. 6: Lu. viii. 13; Mat. xiii. 21; Mk. iv. 17: Lu. viii. 44;
                    Mat. ix. 21; Mk. v. 29. In some of these cases the agreement between Matthew and
                    Mark is so cl03e as to suggest that both writers may have used some common
                    document (not oral tradition) which contained little more than certaiu words of
                    the Lord in a scanty framework of narrative. But this common matter adds little
                    to our knowledge of Christ. The most important narrative in it 13 the story of
                    the Syro-Phoenician, showing how Jesus, as it were, acknowledged in the woman’s
                    persistent faith a divine revelation, extending His gospel even to the heathen.
                    And this narrative is written in language so divergent as to indicate not a
                    document but an oral tradition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Additions of Mark and Luke.—</hi> Additions of any length
                    are very few :—</p>
                <p>(1) An exorcism of an unclean spirit (Mk. i. 21-25; Lu. iv. 31-35); (2) the
                    account of Jesus retiring to a solitary place, when He declares that He must
                    carry the gospel elsewhere (Mk. i. 35-39; Lu. iv. 42-44); (3) the saying of John
                    the son of Zebedee, “Master, we saw one casting out devils in Thy name, and we
                    forbade him,” and the reply of Jesus (Mk. ix. 38-40; Lu. ix. 49, 50); (4) the
                    short denunciation of the Pharisees that devour widows’ houses (Mk. xii. 38-40;
                    Lu. xx. 46, 47); (5) the story of the widow’s mite (Mk. xii. 41-44; Lu. xxi.
                    1-4). Shorteι ’ similarities are—(6) a mention of Jesus as being in retirement
                    (Mk. i. 45; Lu. v. 16); and (7) a mention of “Tyre and Sidon” as places to which
                    the fame of Jesus had spread (Mk. iii. 8; Lu. vi. 17). There is a close verbal
                    agreement between Mark and Luke in the exorcism of the “legion” (a name that
                    does not occur in Mark); in the raising of the daughter of Jairus; and in the
                    stilling of the storm. But gradually as Matthew approximates to Mark, Luke
                    deviates from Mark. There is a return to similarity in the preparation for the
                    Passover (Mk. xiv. 12-16; Lu. xxii. 7-13); but from this point Luke deviates
                    more and more, and, with the exception of two words <hi rend="italic"
                    >(στάσις</hi> and <hi rend="italic">φόνος}</hi> in the incident of Barabbas, and
                    of a somewhat closer approximation in the incident of Joseph of Arimathaea, it
                    may be almost said that Luke has henceforth nothing in common with Mark, except
                    what is found in the Triple Tradition.</p>
                <p>Most of the incidents common to Mark and Luke are so few and so simple that their
                    omission by Matthew requires no explanation. It is possible that the names
                    Jairus and Legion did not exist in the earliest tradition, as it presented
                    itself to Matthew; the “authority” which Mark illustrates (compare i. 22 with i.
                    27) by exorcism, Matthew applies (and perhaps justly) rather to our Lord’s
                    method of teaching (vii. 28, 29); but it is difficult to suppose that any other
                    cause than ignorance could have caused the omission of the saying of Jesus
                    concerning the widow’s mite. It is certain that, in some at least of these
                    passages, Mark represents the earlier, and Luke a modified tradition. Luke (see
                    below, p. 806), writing with a literary purpose, has softened many early
                    irregularities, which in Mark retain their original harshness. For example, the
                    ungrammatical oi κατεσ0ovτ∈ς (Mk. xii. 40) is altered (Tischendorf and
                    Tregelles, <hi rend="italic">pace</hi> Lachmann) into 01 κατ∈σ(hbυσι (Lu. xx.
                    47); and instead of <hi rend="italic">θελόντων</hi> before <hi rend="italic"
                    >ασπασμούς</hi> (Mk. xii. 38) Luke inserts φιλowτωv (Lu. xx. 46). In the story
                    of the widow also, Luke, disapproving of the epithet “beggar” (πτωχ77) applied
                    to the poor widow, substitutes the more respectable <hi rend="italic"
                    >πενιχρά,</hi> yet with a natural but inconsistent reverence declines to cancel
                    the same epithet <hi rend="italic">(πτωχή)</hi> when (Lu. xxi. 3) it occurs in
                    the words of the Lord. The rarer and less correct (ambiguous also when followed
                    by the feminine <hi rend="italic">αυτής) υστερήσεως</hi> (Mk. xii. 44) is
                    altered into <hi rend="italic">υστερήματος</hi> (Lu. xxi. 4); and, lastly, the
                    lengthy duality of Mark, “as many things as she had; all her livelihood” (which
                    looks as if it had arisen from combining two different renderings of the same
                    Aramaic original), is condensed by Luke (who takes one part of one rendering,
                    and another part of the other) into “all the livelihood that she had.” It is
                    probable that not only in these but in all passages common to Mark and Luke
                    alone, wherever Mark and Luke differ, Mark represents an earlier, and Luke a
                    later version of the original. And generally it may be said that Luke follows
                    the tradition of Mark most faithfully when it deals with Galilee, and least when
                    it deals with Jerusalem.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Additions common to Matthew and Luke.—</hi> These introduce an
                    altogether new element into the tradition. Hitherto the Triple Tradition of
                    Matthew, Mark, and Luke (as well as the double tradition of Matthew and Mark,
                    and of Luke and Mark) has consisted mostly of short “words of the Lord,” set in
                    a framework of short narratives, and very seldom agreeing exactly for more than
                    seven or eight consecutive words. But we now come upon “words of the Lord” in
                    Matthew and Luke, some of which agree exactly for several sentences. What was
                    the origin of this close agreement? In order to gain some view of the data for
                    solving this problem, we must briefly consider the principal passages common to
                    Matthew and Luke alone.</p>
                <p>The temptation (Mat. iv. 1-10; Lu. iv. 1-12) and the healing of the centurion’s
                    servant (Mat. viii. 1-13; Lu. vii. 1-10) are the principal narratives of <hi
                    rend="italic">fact</hi> common to Matthew and Luke alone. They resemble the
                    narratives of the Triple Tradition in agreeing so far as concerns the words of
                    Jesus, and of those who address Him, much more than in the general narrative. In
                    the narrative of <hi rend="italic">facts,</hi> the story of the centurion in
                    Luke differs altogether from that in Matthew; in the temptation, the difference
                    is less. Dismissing these, we pass to the “w 0rds of the Lord.” As Luke’s avowed
                    object was to write “in order,” we will adhere to his arrangement in our
                    enumeration.</p>
                <p>(1) Mat. iii. 8-10; Lu. iii. 8, 9. “Generation of vipers,” &amp;c.; this agrees
                    <hi rend="italic">verbatim,</hi> except that Luke has <hi rend="italic"
                    >άρξησθε,</hi> where Matthew has <hi rend="italic">δοξητe.</hi></p>

                <p>(2) After a break in which (Mk. intervening) Matthew and Luke have no more than a
                    general agreement with Mark and one another, we come to another passage
                    describing the purifying of the threshing-floor with fire unquenchable (Mat.
                    iii. 12; Lu. iii.</p>
                <p>17); the two agree <hi rend="italic">verbatim.</hi></p>
                <p>(3) Mat. v., vi., vii.; Lu. vi. Here are some scattered sayings of the Sermon on
                    the Mount, such as, “Blessed are the poor,” “the hungry,” &amp;c. In these the
                    agreement is not <hi rend="italic">verbatim.</hi> The only passage that agrees
                    almost <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi> is that about the mote and the beam.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is noteworthy that,
                    whereas Matthew explains “poor” or “hungry” spiritually, “Blessed are the poor
                    <hi rend="italic">in spirit·, . . .</hi> Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
                    <hi rend="italic">after righteousness,"</hi> Luke, on the other hand, gives
                    these sayings without Matthew’s explanations, “Blessed are ye poor; blessed are
                    ye that hunger now.” Tt is possible that Luke lays greater stress than any of
                    the other evangelists on the sin of covetousness (see the parables of Lazarus
                    and Dives, the “rich fool,” the narrative of the “would-be heir,” &amp;c.; and
                    note also the evident gratification with which the author of this Gospel records
                    in the Acts (iv. 32) the communism of the early church in Jerusalem); and this
                    might predispose us to attribute Luke’s rejection of the spiritual modification
                    of these words to doctrinal grounds. But it must be home in mind that the
                    tendency in the history of the Gospels is everywhere to accretion and addition,
                    rather than to rejection, so that shorter forms are generally more likely to be
                    genuine than longer forms. Moreover, elsewhere Luke (xiv. 26) retains a stronger
                    form of the words of Jesus, “If any man <hi rend="italic">hate</hi> not his
                    father and mother,” while Matthew (x. 37) has a weaker one. On the whole,
                    therefore, it is more probable that Luke, in omitting the words, “after
                    righteousness,” &amp;c., represents the letter of the original words of Jesus
                    more closely than Matthew (as perhaps also in the Lord’s Prayer, see below),
                    however much the latter may better represent the spirit of them.</p></note></p>

                    considerable. But note (a) that Matthew takes the prayer for the increase of the
                    labourers, as a preface to the choice of the twelve, while Luke places it after
                    the choice of the twelve, and uses it as a preface to the choice of the seventy,
                    an incident which he alone records; (ό) Luke applies to the seventy the warning
                    against danger which Matthew applies to the twelve.</p>
                <p>(8) Mat. xi. 21-25; Lu. x. 12-15. “Woe unto thee, Chorazin;” almost <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">κaτa∙</hi><hi rend="italic">βιβασθήσει,</hi> “thou shalt be
                    brought down.”</p>
                <p>(9) In Matthew no interval occurs between the last and the following passage; but
                    in Luke intervenes (x. 17-20) the return of the seventy, and a mention of a
                    vision in which Satan was seen falling from heaven, together with the imparting
                    of a power to tread on serpents (compare the late appendix to Mark’s Gospel,
                    xvi.</p>
                <p>18); then comes Mat. xi. 25-28; Lu. x. 21-22, “I thank thee, Father, Lord of
                    heaven and earth,” &amp;c. There is but a trifling exception to the agreement.
                    Note also that Luke apparently considers the two sayings which are continuous in
                    Matthew to have been. discontinuous, for between vers. 21 and 22 he inserts (so
                    Lachmann, Tischendorf, and Tregelles) “and turning to His disciples, He
                    said.”</p>
                <p>(10) Mat. xiii. 16,17; Lu. x. 23, 24. “Blessed are the eyes,” &amp;c.; here,
                    again Luke inserts his usual note of a discontinuous saying by inserting “and
                    turning to His disciples, He said privately.” Matthew <hi rend="italic"
                    >έπεθΰμησαν,</hi> Luke <hi rend="italic">ήθέλησαν</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>

                <p>(11) Mat. vi. 10-13; Lu. xi. 2-4. The Lord’s Prayer. Here, where (if anywhere) we
                    should expect identity, there is considerable difference. Luke, after <hi

                <p>If any words of the Lord have been handed down by oral tradi tion, the Lord’s
                    Prayer would seem necessarily to have been thus handed down, and from the
                    earliest times. Internal evidence also leaves little doubt that here oral
                    tradition, and not a document, is the origin, and that Luke represents the
                    original most closely in his omissions, though not in his changes. If the Lord’s
                    Prayer had been early committed to writing, and had contained Matthew’s
                    additional clauses, it is inconceivable that Luke should have omitted them. The
                    same tendency which led a later generation to insert (and us in modern times to
                    retain) the interpretation, “For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the
                    glory,” &amp;c., would no doubt in the earliest times favour the insertion,
                    rather than the rejection, of any appropriate clauses that had once gained a
                    footing in the prayer. The abruptness of the simple <hi rend="italic"
                    >∏dτερ,</hi> which is distasteful to us, as implying too great familiarity,
                    would naturally commend to the early church Matthew’s (a) insertion. Matthew’s
                    second insertion (δ) is no less natural. It, or something much like it, is found
                    in 1 Mac. iii. 60, “Whatsoever be His will in heaven, so let Him (or will He)
                    do” (is δ ’ <hi rend="italic">hv</hi><hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >θέλημα</hi><hi rend="italic">èv</hi><hi rend="italic">oυρavφ,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ούτως ποιήσει);</hi> moreover, Luke himself assigns very similar
                    words to our Lord Himself, xxii. 42 <hi rend="italic">(μή</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >τb</hi><hi rend="italic">θέλημά μου αλλά</hi><hi rend="italic">τb σbv
                    yιviσθω),</hi> and to the friends of St Paul (Acts xxi. 14). The fact that our
                    Lord Himself used this prayer may have seemed sufficient cause in the earliest
                    times, and especially to Matthew, who is in the habit of massing together
                    doctrine of a certain kind, as in the Sermon on the Mount, for inserting it in
                    the Lord’s Prayer, (c) Luke’s change of the aor. imperative into a present
                    implies a desire to represent a continuous and not an isolated action; and (d)
                    the change of <hi rend="italic">σήμερον</hi> into <hi rend="italic">καθ’
                    ημέραν</hi> is explicable by the same motive. The word, <hi rend="italic"
                    >επιούσιος,</hi> common both to Matthew and Luke, and not found elsewhere in the
                    whole of Greek literature, seems to indicate that a Greek tradition, and not an
                    Aramaic tradition, of this prayer, was the basis of both Matthew’s and Luke’s
                    version. It is probably derived from <hi rend="italic">ή έπιοΰσα</hi> (Prov.
                    xxvii. 1, où <hi rend="italic">yàp</hi><hi rend="italic">o!δaς</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">τι τέξεται ή έπιοΰσα</hi> (QT <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi>),
                    “Thou knowest not what the day will bring”), and, probably (though this is
                    disputed), means “for the immediate future, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >instant.’’<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>-There
                    appears to be a reference to the manna which (Exod. xvi.</p><p>4) the people of

                    > 1</hi> This meaning is consistent both with Matthew’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >σήμερον</hi> and with Luke’s <hi rend="italic">τb</hi><hi rend="italic">καθ’
                    ημέραν.</hi> Luke’s next three changes, (tZ), (e), and (∕), substitute the more
                    intelligible word “sin” for the less intelligible “debt,” and the more
                    intelligible present “we forgive” for the less intelligible past “we forgave;”
                    and increase the emphasis by adding “every one (that is our debtor).” In all
                    these cases Matthew’s seems to be the earlier form; for it is more likely that
                    the comparatively difficult version of Matthew should have been altered into the
                    comparatively easy version of Luke than <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi>
                    Besides, the retention of the metaphorical <hi rend="italic">oφεiλovτι</hi> by
                    Luke, in the second clause, indicates that the metaphor of “debt,” appeared in
                    the original <hi rend="italic">(g).</hi> Matthew’s insertion of the clause
                    “deliver us from the evil” may naturally have arisen from the reluctance to end
                    a prayer with a negative petition., “lead us not into temptation.” The inserted
                    clause resembles many passages in the Psalms (xvii. 49, LXX.; A.λ'. xviii. 48,
                    <hi rend="italic">aπb avδρbς</hi><hi rend="italic">αδίκου βΰστ) με),</hi> and
                    early commended itself to the church (2 Tim. iv. 18). in any case, there is no
                    reason why Luke should omit such a clause, if it were known to him; and there
                    are many reasons why such a clause should be introduced (even though it were not
                    in the original), and why, when introduced, it should be speedily accepted. To
                    sum up the inferences from this most important passage: the variations (and the
                    nature of the passage) indicate a source oral and not documentary, Greek and not
                    Aramaic; Matthew appears to have massed together a number of prayers taught by,
                    or perhaps used by, the Lord Jesus, while Luke seems to have adhered to an
                    earlier form, which, however, has received late modification for the purposes of
                    daily use. Though, however, we may follow Luke here, as more closely
                    approximating to the original form of the prayer, it does not result that on
                    this account we must commit ourselves to the statement that the Lord’s Prayer
                    was actually given at the exact time, and in the exact manner, which Luke
                    describes. Just as Matthew supplies grouping, so Luke supplies motives and
                    occasions. Often it may be more probable that the grouping and continuity of
                    Matthew may be closer to the historical fact than the attempt at orderly
                    arrangement, and at assignment of motive and cause and time, which characterizes
                    Luke. I nstances of this will be given hereafter.</p>
                <p>(12) Mat. vii. 7-12; Lu. xi. 34-36. “Ask, and it shall be given unto you,”
                    &amp;c. Luke prefaces this by a parable peculiar to himself, and of a peculiar
                    type,—the argument being that if an indolent man grants requests, influenced by
                    mere importunity, much more will the perfectly good God listen to earnest
                    prayer. There is no reason, in the style or thought of this and similar
                    parables, for supposing that we have the exact words of Jesus. Luke inserts in

                    “Beelzebub”), not perhaps perceiving that it is the climax of a condemnation of

                    “men of Nineveh;” and in one of the clauses (very curiously, but perhaps with a
                    desire to bring out the antithesis between the “women” and the “men”) Luke
                    substitutes “the men of this generation” for “this generation,” and “them” for
                    “it.” Otherwise the agreement is almost <hi rend="italic">verbatim.</hi></p>
                <p>(16) Mat. xxiii. 23-39; Lu. xi. 37-52. A denunciation of those who tithed mint
                    and anise, yet were the true children of the murderers of the prophets. Matthew
                    makes this a part of a long and public denunciation of the Pharisees, in
                    Jerusalem; Luke places it early, and as an utterance in the house of a Pharisee,
                    his host. It is certainly remarkable that here, and nowhere else, a Pharisee is
                    addressed in the singular number, “Thou blind Pharisee” (Mat. xxiii. 26). The
                    “Pharisee” is clearly generic; but if the use of the singular were
                    misunderstood, it might originate a tradition that the speech was delivered to a
                    single Pharisee, in whose house Jesus was dining; and though Luke does not
                    insert the “Pharisee,” he may have been influenced by this traditional
                    misunderstanding. Internal evidence is here strongly for Matthew’s, and against
                    Luke’s place and time. Luke has probably been led to place this discourse at the
                    table of a Pharisee, by the metaphor of the “cup and platter.” But the metaphor
                    suits Matthew’s version equally well; and it*∙is in defiance at once of good
                    taste and probability, to attribute to Jesus such a denunciation of a host at
                    his own table, and to place it so early in our Lord’s ministry. The use (Lu. xi.
                    39) of <hi rend="italic">ô</hi><hi rend="italic">Κύριος</hi> (see below, 22)
                    makes it probable that this is a late tradition; and, if it is rejected, there
                    falls with it an accusation brought against Jesus, of neglecting the decencies
                    of life, by coming to a repast with unwashed hands. The agreement is here by no
                    means <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi>; and, besides other differences, Matthew
                    has <hi rend="italic">τb</hi><hi rend="italic">εντός καθάρισον,</hi> where Luke
                    has τα eVo'vτα δ&lt;fre <hi rend="italic">όλεηαοσύνην</hi> (a change, as in the
                    Lord’s Prayer, from the metaphorical to the real). The original and Judaean
                    expression <hi rend="italic">σοφούς</hi><hi rend="italic">κal yρaμμaτε7ς</hi>
                    Luke alters into the Christian απ∙o&lt;rτ&lt;fλoι&gt;s; he also omits the
                    somewhat difficult <hi rend="italic">σταυρώσατε.</hi> It is especially
                    noteworthy that, whereas in Matthew Jesus says, “Wherefore, behold 7 send unto
                    <hi rend="italic">you</hi> prophets,” &amp;c., in Luke Jesus says, “Wherefore,
                    also <hi rend="italic">the Wisdom of God said,</hi> 1 will send unto <hi
                    rend="italic">them</hi> prophets,” &amp;c. Here Luke probably represents the
                    earlier form, although the explanation may be doubtful. It is possible that the
                    book containing the “words of the Lord,” from which Matthew and Luke borrowed
                    this saying, gave to Jesus the name of “the Wisdom of God” (c∕. 1 Cor. i. 24,
                    “Christ the Wisdom of God”), and that this title was retained by Luke, but
                    applied, not to Jesus, but to the divine providence. Matthew adds to Zachariah
                    the words “son of Barachiah;” Luke omits them. Here again Luke probably
                    represents the earlier tradition. The Zachariah here mentioned was the son of
                    Jehoiada. But Matthew, whose manner it is to lay especial stress upon all
                    matters connected with the prophets (Schenkel’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibel-Lexicon,</hi> “Sacliarja”), having in his mind either Zechariah, the son
                    of Jebe-rechiah (Is. viii. 2), or Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah
                    (Zech. i. 1), inserted the erroneous words. The agreement here is by no means
                    <hi rend="italic">verbatim.</hi> Matthew makes the utterance continuous, but
                    Luke (xi. 45), introducing a remonstrance from a “lawyer,” turns the
                    denunciation from the Pharisees to the “lawyers.”</p>

                    more general phrase, “is forgotten in the presence of God.” In other parts of
                    the passage there is considerable dissimilarity.</p>

                    else.</p>
                <p>(19) Mat. vi. 25-34; Lu. xii. 22-34. “Wherefore I say unto you, Take no thought,”
                    &amp;c. This is the second passage (see above, Mat. xxiii. 34; Lu. xi. 49)
                    common to Matthew and Luke, introduced by “wherefore,” though the context is
                    different. Matthew (vi. 25) introduces the passage by a single sentence, to the
                    effect that no one can serve two masters, God and mammon. Luke, on the other
                    hand, after narrating the refusal of Jesus to become a “judge or a divider,” and
                    after describing in language and thought peculiar to himself (for to Luke alone
                    belong the parables of soliloquy) the death of the rich fool, continues thus:
                    “And He said unto His disciples, <hi rend="italic">Therefore</hi> I say unto
                    you, Take no thought,” &amp;c. The comparison of this passage is most useful as
                    illustrating the difference between Matthew’s and Luke’s handling of their
                    subject matter, and also as throwing light on the object (and perhaps on the
                    origin) of many of the parables peculiar to Luke. They seem intended as tales to
                    prepare the way for some famous saying of the Lord as the conclusion and moral.
                    The agreement in language here is not <hi rend="italic">verbatim.</hi> Besides

                    house had known,” &amp;c. In Matthew this sentence comes towards the end of a
                    long discourse on the second coming, uttered in Jerusalem; in Luke it is spoken
                    in Galilee, and it is preceded by a passage peculiar to Luke, and reminding one
                    of the Epistles: “Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning,”
                    &amp;c. With the exception of Matthew <hi rend="italic">εtaσε,</hi> Luke <hi
                    rend="italic">aφηκε</hi> (probably the original word), the passages agree almost

                <p>(22) Mat. xxiv. 45; Lu. xii. 42. “Who then is the faithful and just,” &amp;c.
                    Here there is precise agreement, except where Luke has altered the text with an
                    object. Finding this parable, in the book or tradition from which he extracted
                    it, connected with the name of Peter, and desiring to distinguish the “steward”
                    or upper “servant,” who is placed over the household, from the common slaves, he
                    (a) inserts a question of Peter, “Speakest Thou this parable unto us or even
                    unto all?” (δ) alters the first δoυλor (“slave”) into <hi rend="italic"
                    >οικονόμος</hi> (“steward”); (c)_ alters <hi rend="italic">oικετεias</hi>
                    (“household,” the true reading of Matthew) into a word with somewhat higher
                    associations, <hi rend="italic">θεραπείας</hi> (“suite” or “retinue”); and <hi
                    rend="italic">(d)</hi> changes <hi rend="italic">συνόούλους</hi>
                    (“fellow-slaves”) into “the manservants and maid-servants.” One or two other
                    changes are also made <hi rend="italic">(μεθύσκεσθαι</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >τε)</hi> to improve the text. Luke’s <hi rend="italic">σιτoμετpιov</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">απίστων,</hi> for Matthew’s <hi rend="italic">τροφήν</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">υποκριτών,</hi> might be early variations arising from the varying
                    translation of some Aramaic original. There remains the curious fact that, in
                    introducing this parable, Luke uses the rare <hi rend="italic">Κύριος</hi> (used
                    not as a vocative in speech of address, but in narration), instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">’Ιησούς</hi><hi rend="italic">: “The Lord</hi> said unto Peter.”
                    This is an almost sure sign of a late addition to the Gospels, often of an
                    interpolation. The word <hi rend="italic">Κύριος</hi> is not used once thus in
                    the correct text of Matthew. It is not used once in the genuine Mark; but it is
                    used twice in the short interpolated appendix to Mark (xvi. 19, 20). In Luke it
                    is used about twelve times, always in prefaces or other passages peculiar to
                    Luke, and of these twelve passages three are connected with Peter (xii. 42;
                    xxii. 31; xxii. 61).</p>

                    these words are uttered by Jesus as a comment upon the marvellous faith of the
                    centurion. In Luke they follow a parable peculiar to himself. The clause “there
                    shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth” (which, except in this instance, is
                    peculiar to Matthew) is transferred from the end to the beginning; and there are
                    other variations, seemingly purposed. The agreement is far from <hi

                <p>(27) Mat. xxiii. 37-39; Lu. xiii. 34,35. “Jerusalem, Jerusalem,” &amp;c. This is
                    a conspicuous instance of the manner in which Luke has sometimes deviated from
                    the true chronological order. He represents these words to have been uttered in
                    Galilee, when the Pharisees warn Jesus to flee from fear of Herod. But Matthew
                    represents them as having been uttered in Jerusalem, and in the temple. The
                    reason for Luke’s transposition is possibly contained in the last words, “Ye
                    shall not see Me till the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh
                    in the name of the Lord.” Now these very words, “Blessed is He,” &amp;c., were
                    uttered by the crowd welcoming Jesus on His entrauce into Jerusalem (xix. 39).
                    Luke therefore, regarding the words of Jesus, “Ye shall not see Me,” as a
                    prediction necessarily preceding its fulfilment, is bound to place these words
                    before the entry of Jesus iuto Jerusalem But all internal evidence is on the
                    side of Matthew’s order, and against Luke’s. The agreement is very nearly <hi
                    rend="italic">verbatim,</hi> but Luke (whose arrangement does not require the
                    word) dispenses with the ‘ ‘ henceforth” of Matthew.</p>
                <p>(28) Mat. xxii. 1-14; Lu. xiv. 15-24. The parable of the wedding feast. These
                    parables differ entirely in language, and somewhat in thought. In Matthew those
                    who are first invited slay the messengers, and are slain by the king; and, among
                    those who are subsequently invited, one is rejected for being without a wedding
                    garment. In Luke the guests are simply discourteous, and the host merely invites
                    others (the poor and the maimed, and then the wanderers in the streets) in the
                    place of the first. Matthew’s parable is therefore political, Luke’s social.
                    Note, however, that in the parable of the pounds (Mat. talents, xxv. ), Luke
                    introduces (xix. 27) the missing political element, whereas Matthew there omits
                    it. Clearly no common document nor even detailed tradition originated these
                    parables. They are rather (as also are the parables of the talents and the
                    pounds) of the nature of sermons or stories based upon short “words of the Lord”
                    as texts. It is obvious that Matthew lays special stress upon the exclusion of
                    the unfit intruder, Luke upon the inclusion of all the world.</p>
                <p>(29) Mat. X. 37-39; Lu. xiv. 26, 27. “He that loveth father and mother more than
                    Me,” &amp;c. In Matthew these words are addressed by Jesus to the twelve in
                    Galilee; in Luke to the multitude following Him during His journey to Jerusalem.
                    Here Luke seems to have preserved the older (because more difficult) form of the
                    tradition: “Whosoever <hi rend="italic">hateth not '</hi> (Marcion altered <hi
                    rend="italic">μ,ισei</hi> into <hi rend="italic">κaτaKVιιrιi)</hi> “his father,
                    .... yea, his own life also,” &amp;c. It seems more probable that this was the
                    original form than that Luke intensified the form by any alteration of his own.
                    There is scarcely any agreement of language between Matthew and Luke here.</p>
                <p>(30) Mat. xviii. 12-14; Lu. xv. 4-7. “What man having an hundred sheep,” &amp;c.
                    The thought is the same, but there is scarcely any similarity of language; and
                    even the conclusion characteristically differs, Matthew having “it is not the
                    will of <hi rend="italic">your Father in heaven</hi> that one of these little
                    ones should perish;’’ Luke having “there is joy <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">heaven</hi> over one sinner that re-penteth.” The contrast between
                    the negative (“not the will”) and the positive (“joy”), between the
                    “non-perishing” and the “repenting,” is typical of the contrast between the
                    whole of Matthew and the whole of Luke.</p>
                <p>(31) Mat. vi. 24; Lu. xvi. 13. “No (servant) can serve two masters,” &amp;c. With
                    the exception of “servant” added by Luke for definiteness, this saying is the
                    same <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi> in Matthew and Luke.</p>
                <p>(32) Mat. xi. 12 and v. 18; Lu. xvi. 16, 17. “The law and the prophets were till
                    John,” &amp;c., and “Not one tittle shall pass from the law.” There seems little
                    connexion in these sayings as they stand in Luke, and there is very little
                    similarity of language between Matthew and Luke.</p>
                <p>(33) Mat. xxiv. 26-28, 37-41; Lu. xvii. 23-27, 34-37. These are scattered sayings
                    on the second coming, likening it to the “days of Noah” and to “lightning,” and
                    predicting the severance of those who are “atone mill” and “in one bed.” Luke,
                    after his manner, introduces a question, “Where, Lord?” to which the reply
                    comes, “Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.”
                    Matthew, on the other hand, introduces the sentence in the midst of the
                    discourse, “So shall also the coming of the Son of Alan be, for wheresoever the
                    body is,” &amp;c. The agreement of language is not considerable, except in the
                    last part.</p>
                <p>(34) AIat. xxiii. 12; Lu. xviii. 14, and xiv. 11. “Everyone that exalteth himself
                    shall be abased,” &amp;c. This again furnishes a striking instance of the manner
                    in which Luke utilizes words of the Lord as texts for discourses. The saying is
                    introduced by AIatthew in the midst of the discourse against the Pharisees; but
                    it is made by Luke the conclusion and moral of the parable of the publican and
                    the Pharisee, and of the discourse on choosing the lower room.</p>
                <p>(35) Alat. XXV. 14-30; Lu. xix. 1-28. The parable of the talents or pounds. There
                    is no similarity of language, except in the dialogue between the idle servant
                    and the master. Luke, after his manner, inserts a question from the bystanders
                    (“And they said to him, Lord, he hath ten pounds ”); and Luke here, as Matthew
                    above (28), introduces a political element, making the master a king, and
                    narrating a royal vengeance.</p>
                <p>In' the consideration of the passages quoted above, one fact strikes us at once,
                    that the Lord’s Prayer is not <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi> the same in
                    Matthew and Luke. If <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is not identical, it might be
                    thought that we cannot expect any words of the Lord to be identical. And indeed,
                    as a matter not cf hypothesis but of fact, those words w hich have most strongly
                    appealed to men’s hearts, and have been most frequently on their lips, from the
                    earliest times of the church; those sayings which have given the tone to
                    Christian life, which have encouraged martyrs, and stimulated waverers, such as
                    (17), “Fear not them which kill the body;” (18), “Whosoever shall confess,”
                    &amp;c.; (29), “He that loveth father or mother more than Me,” &amp;c.—all
                    these, though identical as regards thought, and similar as regards words, are
                    nevertheless not exactly similar in Matthew and Luke. The exactly similar
                    passages are of a very different nature: they are for the most part passages of
                    a prophetic or historical rather than a doctrinal character with application to
                    individuals. Some, (1), (2), (5), (6), describe the relations between John the
                    Baptist and Christ; another, (8), calls down woe on Chorazin; another, (9), in
                    language that reminds us of the thoughts, though not of the words, of the Fourth
                    Gospel, thanks God for revealing to babes what He has hidden from the wise and
                    prudent; another, (27), pours forth lamentations over doomed Jerusalem. All
                    these passages, dealing as it were on a large scale with the will of God, as it
                    affects religions and nations rather than as it affects individuals, are better
                    fitted for reading in the services of the church than for being transmitted from
                    mouth to mouth in the family from father to son, or from catechist to
                    catechumen, for personal and individual guidance; and consequently they seem
                    more likely to have been handed down in a book than by means of oral tradition.
                    The same conclusion applies to (21), “But know this, that if the goodman,”
                    &amp;c. and to (22), “Who then is the faithful and just steward,” &lt;fcc.—both
                    of which passages agree <hi rend="italic">verbatim,</hi> and both of which
                    appear to have an ecclesiastical rather than an individual reference, at all
                    events in their primary application. In proportion as a rhetorical passage
                    limits itself to individual application, it seems to have been modified by oral
                    tradition so as to deviate from exact agreement: compare in (3) the “mote and
                    the beam;” also (12), “Ask, and it shall be given unto you;” and (19), “Take no
                    thought for the morrow.” The only exception perhaps to this rule is in the
                    denunciation of the Pharisees (16). This passage, being of the historical type,
                    ought (according to our rule) to be identical; but Luke differs from Matthew
                    considerably. Possibly, in the earliest days of the church, and especially in
                    the synagogues of Palestine a few years after the death of Christ, the angry
                    conflicts between the disciples of the Lord and the Pharisees may have
                    frequently reproduced and modified by traditional influences the original form
                    of our Lord’s denunciation; so that perhaps this'subject comes naturally under
                    the head of traditional doctrine. It must also be remembered that, as Luke
                    approaches the later period of the work of Christ in Judaea, he deviates more
                    and more both from Matthew and from Mark; perhaps because there was a Judaean as
                    well as a Galilean tradition of the life of Jesus, and Luke, in the latter part
                    of his history, depended <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n824/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0824-0801"/> mainly on the former. These two considerations
                    may explain the deviation of Luke from Matthew in the denunciation of the
                    Pharisees.</p>
                <p>That the parables should diverge is natural. Their length and number would
                    prevent them from being remembered, or passed from mouth to mouth, with the same
                    fidelity with which the shorter words of the Lord would be preserved; and as
                    they were probably often repeated by Jesus in varied shapes, no one particular
                    shape of any parable would seem to claim a place in the written document of the
                    words of the Lord, as being of the same importance as the “Woe to Jerusalem,” or
                    the other strains of poetic prophecy. The parable of the sower, coming first in
                    order, and being typical of the rest of the parables, and having appended to it
                    an explanation of the motive of the parabolic teaching, would naturally attract
                    attention from the earliest times, and consequently it found a place in the
                    Triple Tradition; but this privilege was accorded to no other parable. There is
                    therefore no ground whatever for inferring from the discrepancy of the language
                    of a parable in Matthew and Luke (e√7., the parable of the lost sheep) that it
                    was not actually uttered by Jesus. The exact similarity of thought and sequence
                    of incident in that parable, as recorded by Matthew and Luke, proves to
                    demonstration that the two records are derived from one source.</p>
                <p>The following are our conclusions therefore about the additions to the Triple
                    Tradition made jointly by Matthew and Luke. (1.) Their omission by Mark
                    furnishes no argument for their rejection, inasmuch as Mark also omits the
                    Lord’s Prayer, and obviously aims at narrating the acts rather than the sayings
                    of the Lord. (2.) Of the additions, some appear to be based upon common
                    tradition, or on documents modified by tradition,—principally those short
                    trenchant sayings (including the Lord’s Prayer) which are of a universal and
                    private application. (3.) Others appear to be based upon a common document; and
                    in these documentary additions (as perhaps to some extent in the rest) Luke
                    seems to have modified the original tradition, in words and phrases, with a view
                    to purity of style and intelligibility, or to remove difficulties. (4.) In
                    chronological order and arrangement Matthew and Luke pursue divergent paths;
                    Matthew’s object being to group and mass the teaching of the Lord, while Luke
                    aims at supplying motive, occasion, place, and time for each utterance. It is
                    scarcely possible to doubt that the arrangement of neither is to be implicitly
                    adopted. There is much reason to doubt whether what is called the Sermon on the
                    Mount was actually delivered at one time in the shape in which Matthew presents
                    it; and it is equally questionable whether the lamentation over Jerusalem was
                    delivered in a village of Galilee, and whether the denunciation of the Scribes
                    and Pharisees (as murderers, on whom should be avenged all the innocent blood
                    shed from the beginning of the world) was uttered at the table of a Pharisee.
                    (6.) As regards the parables, we have to depend—in our conjecture as to the
                    degree to which the thoughts of Jesus have been preserved—mainly upon the
                    presence in them of the same spiritual power and insight which are perceptible
                    in His other recognized genuine sayings. But the dissimilarity of the language
                    of the parables in Matthew and Luke (where the thought is the same) gives no
                    ground for denying that parables on the same subjects, and to the same effect,
                    were actually delivered by Him. (7.) Since the hypothesis that Luke borrowed
                    from Matthew is untenable, and since therefore we must suppose that Matthew and
                    Luke borrowed these additions independently from some early document, we may
                    infer that, before the times of Matthew and Luke, a document containing words of
                    the Lord had existed long enough, and had acquired authority enough, to induce
                    two editors or writers of Gospels, apparently representing different schools of
                    thought and writing for different churches, to borrow from it independently.</p>
                <p>This last conclusion is of the greatest importance; for though the document may
                    be, and almost certainly was, later than the Triple Tradition, yet it would have
                    the advantage of preserving the original utterances of the Lord comparatively
                    unimpaired by traditional transmutations. When to this consideration is added
                    the authoritative nature of the words of the Lord in this document, their direct
                    reference to events, and the extreme improbability that any disciple would have,
                    or could have, invented them,—for which of the apostles or subordinate disciples
                    could have invented the discourse on “the lilies of the field,” or the
                    lamentation over Jerusalem, or the speech which likens John to “a reed shaken by
                    the wind,” and pronounces him the greatest of the prophets, yet less than the
                    least in the kingdom of God!— we are led to infer that in all probability we
                    have in these additions of Matthew and Luke a very close approximation to some
                    of the noblest and most impressive utterances of Jesus Himself. With the
                    exception of the healing of the son of the centurion, and the narrative of the
                    temptation, the additions common to Matthew and Luke introduce no new
                    supernatural element.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Additions and Peculiarities of Mark.—</hi> It might be
                    expected that when we come to the additions peculiar to each of the three
                    synoptists we should find some increase to the accounts of supernatural events.
                    Now it seems to be a striking proof of the antiquity of the Second Gospel that
                    we find in it no additions of this kind. Not that Mark does not lay stress on
                    what appears to be supernatural; on the contrary, he records acts of
                    instantaneous healing with greater minuteness of detail than any other
                    evangelist (vii. 31-37; viii. 22-26; ix. 14-27); but we find in Mark no mention
                    of our Lord’s birth or childhood, and only the barest prediction of His
                    resurrection. As an explanation of the deficiency of information onthe
                    resurrection, it has been frequently suggested that the latter part of the
                    Gospel may have been lost; and, less frequently (Weiss, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Marcusevangelium,</hi> p. 511), that the Gospel was deliberately closed with
                    the prediction of the resurrection by the mouth of an angel, because “the
                    manifestations of the risen Saviour belong (according to the earliest notions)
                    no longer to the earthly sphere of the action of Jesus, and therefore do not
                    fall within the province of the Gospel.” Few Greek scholars, however, will be
                    induced to believe that the author of the Second Gospel deliberately chose to
                    end a book on the good news of Christ with the words <hi rend="italic">(φοβούντο
                    γάρ.</hi> From a literary point of view the <hi rend="italic">γάρ,</hi> and from
                    ∙a moral point of view the ill-omened <hi rend="italic">(φοβονντο,</hi> make it
                    almost incredible that these words represent a deliberate termination assigned
                    by an author to a composition of his own. Others have suggested that the last
                    page of the MS. may have been accidentally destroyed. But this suggestion seems
                    to overlook the consideration that the MS. was in all probability written not
                    for a private library but for use in the church, and that it would immediately
                    be multiplied by copies. Again, we know, from reference to Mat. xxviii. 8 and
                    Lu. xxiv. 9, that the common tradition ceases with the return of the women from
                    the Lord’s tomb. But it is precisely at this point that the genuine Mark (xvi.
                    8) also terminates. Now, that a page should have been torn out containing just
                    that part of Mark which followed after the close of the common tradition would
                    be a most remarkable and unlikely coincidence. It seems far more probable that
                    Mark ends his Gospel here because the common tradition ended here, and because
                    he scrupled to add anything to the notes and traditions which he knew to rest
                    upon a higher authority than his own. If this be the true explanation, it stamps
                    with the seal of a higher authority such traditions <pb break="no"

                    author. We proceed therefore to an investigation of the peculiarities of Mark,
                    with a confidence in him increased rather than diminished by the fact that he
                    has neither the introductions nor the appendices which are found in the rest of
                    the Gospels.</p>
                <p>The first thing that strikes us in Mark is his duality. Verbosity wo might be
                    tempted to call it at the first sight; but though there is a certain
                    disproportion in the space assigned to detail, duality, and not verbosity, is
                    the better word. It is this duality which gave rise (see above, p. 789) to the
                    erroneous supposition that Mark had borrowed from Matthew and Luke. But it maybe
                    shown, by reference to passages where there can be no possibility that Mark
                    borrowed from Matthew and Luke (Mk. ii. 19; iii. 5 <hi rend="italic">; iii.</hi>
                    27; iii. 22, 30; v. 3, 5; xii. 44), that this duality is a part of Mark’s style.
                    In many cases, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> iii. 22, 30 (B∈eλξε∕8oυλ εχει and
                    <hi rend="italic">τrvcvμa</hi><hi rend="italic">ακάθαρτον</hi> εχeι), it is
                    almost forced on the reader that the evangelist had before him two versions of
                    one saying, and that in his “anxiety to omit nothing”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is a quotation from Papias preserved by
                    Eusebius (Kirchhofer, p. 123): “For he (Mark) took great care about one matter,
                    viz., to omit nothing of all that (μ77δev <hi rend="italic">ωv)</hi> he heard.”
                    If Papias spoke of our Mark, it would seem that this must refer rather to the
                    words than to the incidents recoτded in his very scanty Gospel. It seems to be
                    an apology for the disproportion of the narrative. In writing the narrative just
                    as he took it down in notes (from Peter's discourses) “Mark,” says Papias,
                    “committed no error,” but simply acted as a faithful reporter. We do not, of
                    course, commit ourselves to the truth of this statement; we merely point out
                    that the hypothesis that Mark’s Gospel is a collection of “notes,” will explain
                    some of the peculiarities of its style.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> x</hi>
                    he inserted both. Whether there be any definite traces of translation in his
                    Gospel will be considered hereafter. But, so far, we merely note that some of
                    Mark’s dualities of expression might be explained as double renderings of the
                    same original. Only one parable is peculiar to Mark; it is one that illustrates
                    (iv. 26-29) the spread of the kingdom of God by the quiet, unperceived, and
                    gradual growth of corn. The subdued tone of this (one of the most interesting of
                    all the parables) was perhaps the reason why it was not at first widely known,
                    as it undoubtedly is the reason why modern readers pay it too little attention.
                    Mark also amplifies the story of the Baptist’s execution (vi. 20-28), and the
                    graphic story of the exorcism of the “legion.” For the rest, the other additions
                    peculiar to Mark consist either of dual expressions and amplifications of
                    detail, or of realistic details which would naturally be subordinated in later
                    times, as likely to be stumbling-blocks. For amplifications which treat of the
                    resistance and ultimate submission of unclean spirits see i. 26, 27; i. 44; iii.
                    7- 12; ix. 14-27; for others which relate to the crowding of people round Jesus,
                    the publicity of His work, and His desire for solitude, see i. 28; i. 35-37; i.
                    45; ii. 1-4; ii. 15; iii. 10-12; vi. 32-33, &amp;c. The narrative also, from
                    first to last, abounds with expressions as to the manner and look and minute
                    action of Jesus during dialogues or miracles <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> iii. 5;
                    vii. 31-37; viii. 22-26). In many of these additions Aramaic words are given as
                    the very utterances of Jesus, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> v. 41, Tαλι0α <hi
                    rend="italic">κoυμι</hi>; vii. 34, <hi rend="italic">Έφφαθά</hi>; xiv. 36, <hi

                    writer, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Bartimaeus, Boanerges, and Dalmanutha.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mark’s custom of placing the
                    Aramaic original side by side with the Greek translation is perhaps in part
                    suggested by the Palestinian dialect of our Lord’s time, in which (especially in
                    certain phrases) Greek and Aramaic were blended together, as in the phrase “my
                    Lord,” '“I'D <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> TO, which stands for **)D, <hi

                    for this and other instances. But in Mark the reduplication for the most part is
                    confined to passages expressive of strong emotion.</p></note> Unquestionably,
                    under ordinary circumstances, this elaboration of unimportant detail<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Take, as an instance, the
                    wounding of the high priest’s servant by Peter. Here Mark (xiv. 47) merely
                    records the wound; Matthew (xxvi. 52) adds the reproof addressed by Jesus to
                    Peter; Luke (xxii. 50, 51) adds that it was the “right” ear, and that Jesus
                    healed the man; lastly, the Fourth Gospel, while omitting the healing, retains
                    the “right” ear, and adds that the servant’s name was Malchus. In such a case it
                    is impossible to feel certain that the simpler narrative of Mark may not have
                    been modified by later accretions.</p></note> (and especially the introduction
                    of names—for instances of which see the Apocryphal Gospels <hi rend="italic"
                    >passim)</hi> is a mark of a late writer, and of a composer of fiction rather
                    thau history. But all the characteristics of Mark support the belief that in his
                    case they are rather the excrescences and redundancies of one who trusted his
                    memory rather than his judgment, and who preferred to report rather than to
                    select and arrange.</p>
                <p>One proof of the early composition of Mark is the rudeness and even vulgarity of
                    his Greek. He uses a great number of words which are expressly forbidden by the
                    grammarians. For example, of Mark’s phrase εσχάτως εχει (Mk. v. 23), Phrynichus
                    says (ed. Lobeck, p. 389), “only the <hi rend="italic">canaille</hi> use it in
                    this sense;” the same grammarian also warns his readers against <hi
                    rend="italic">κράββατος</hi> (Mk. ii. 4, 9, 11, 12). Other words noted by
                    Phrynichus, and used by Mark (some of which are also used by Matthew) but
                    avoided by Luke, are <hi rend="italic">p,ovoφθαλpoζ</hi> (ix. 47); ευσχr∕p,ωv
                    (for πλούσιος, xv. 43); <hi rend="italic">κολλυβtστaι</hi> (xi. 15); <hi
                    rend="italic">κοράσιον</hi> (v. 41); <hi rend="italic">ορκίζω</hi> (v, 7); <hi

                    25).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Such arguments as
                    that “Hippocrates used <hi rend="italic">paφis '</hi> cannot count for anything
                    against the general feeling of dislike for the word expressed by the dictum of
                    Phrynichus, “ή Sè <hi rend="italic">l&gt;aφ</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">s τi t&lt;ττιv οbκ &amp;v τιs</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >γνοίη.”</hi></p></note> Such words as these might naturally find their place in
                    the mongrel Greek of the slaves and freedmen who formed the first congregations
                    of the church in Rome; and they are therefore tokens of a date of composition
                    earlier than that of Matthew and Luke. For it is not conceivable that such terms
                    (some of which would so have jarred upon the ear of an educated Greek as almost
                    to correspond to our “slang”) should be substituted in later times for a more
                    tasteful vocabulary; whereas it is easily conceivable, and <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> probable, that better Greek should, in the prosperous days of the
                    church, be substituted for worse.</p>
                <p>It is a natural characteristic of an unpractised reporter that he lays undue
                    stress on a few vivid expressions and striking words, and that he reproduces or
                    exaggerates anacolutha which, though not objectionable in a speech, are
                    inconvenient in a book, because they tend to obscure or subordinate the subject
                    matter. Many such words are inserted by Mark, and avoided by Matthew or Luke, or
                    by both, e.y., σχιζο/χενους, i. 10; dγvαφoς, ii. 21; κωμοπολεις, i. 38; avaλov,
                    ix. 50. For irregular constructions see iv. 28 (7rλ77p77s σίτος, the correct
                    reading); xii. 40, oi <hi rend="italic">κaτiσθοvτtς</hi> (altered by Luke); v.

                    construction from Aα to the infinitive in iii. 15, as compared with iii. 14. The
                    Latinisms of this Gospel are well known: see xv. 15, <hi rend="italic smallcaps"

                    barbarisms are the use of <hi rend="italic">οτav</hi> with the indicative, and
                    the use of oτc to ask a question (ii. 16; ix. 11; ix. 28), both of which idioms

                    perhaps indicate Latin influence.</p>
                <p>A still more cogent proof of the early date of Mark is that this Gospel contains
                    many expressions which would be likely to be stumbling-blocks in the way of weak
                    believers, so that they are omitted in the later Gospels, and would not have
                    been tolerated except in a Gospel of extreme antiquity. For example, the strong
                    expression (vi. 5, 6), “He <hi rend="italic">was not</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >alle</hi> to do there any mighty work;” the statement (i. 32, 34) that <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> the sick were brought to Jesus, but that He healed only
                    <hi rend="italic">many,</hi> whereas Matthew (viii, 16) says that He healed <hi
                    rend="italic">all,</hi> and Luke (iv. 40) that He healed <hi rend="italic">each

                    hands on Him on the ground that He was insane (iii. 20-21); the imputation of an
                    ambitious petition to James and John, instead of (as Matthew) to their mother
                    (x. 35); the mention of the marvel of Pilate at the speedy death of Jesus, which
                    might have been perverted to support those who denied that Jesus had really died
                    upon the cross (xv. 44); the statement that Jesus only gave power to His
                    apostles to cast out devils (iii.</p>
                <p>15, correct text), and not (as Mat. x. 1) to heal diseases; the enumeration of
                    the different stages by which Jesus, at least on one occasion, effected a cure,
                    and the description of the, at first, only partial cure (viii. 24); the
                    statement that the fig-tree, instead of being withered up “immediately” (as
                    Matthew, <hi rend="italic">παρα-χρήμα,</hi> xxi. 19), was not observed tobe
                    withered till after the interval of a day; the bare statement (xvi. 4) that the
                    women found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre (which might have been used
                    to support the statements of those who maintained that the friends or enemies of
                    Jesus had stolen His body), whereas Matthew (xxviii. 2) distinctly meets such an
                    objection by asserting that an angel descended from heaven in the sight of the
                    keepers and rolled away the stone;—these, and probably other expressions,
                    indicate a very early date of composition, and a disposition to record facts as
                    they came, without emphasis or subordination. Mark neither masses similar
                    sayings or deeds, as Matthew does, nor supplies motives and occasions, as Luke
                    does. It is most interesting to note that the words “law,” “lawyer,” which
                    played so prominent a part in Matthew and Luke, are not to be found at all in
                    Mark’s narrative. His business is simply with the life of Christ. Again, whereas
                    Matthew and (in'a less degree) Luke are careful to point out that Jesus
                    fulfilled the sayings of the prophets, Mark, on the other hand, though he
                    recognizes in John the Baptist (i. 2) the messenger predicted by the prophets,
                    sees in Jesus a Being too absorbing and interesting as a man to find much time
                    for contemplation of Him as the mere fulfiller of prophecy. In a word, Mark
                    writes of Jesus, not as the destroyer or fulfiller of the law, not as the
                    Messiah predicted by the prophets, not as the refuge of the Gentiles, but rather
                    as a man; subject to anger, and disappointment, and weariness; not knowing all
                    things; not able to do all things; but endowed with strange powers of healing
                    the souls and bodies of men: and carrying out a mysterious plan for the
                    regeneration of the world, through a spirit of childlike obedience to God and
                    brotherly love towards men; lastly, a man who assumed for Himself and for His
                    disciples a power of forgiving sins, and who based all the success of His plans
                    upon His predicted death and resurrection, to be followed by a second
                    coming.</p>
                <p>True, Mark’s Gospel is disproportioned, inartistic, and uncouth—scarcely, indeed,
                    to be called a book, but rather a collection of graphic anecdotes. Yet it has a
                    unity derived from its naive simplicity and single-mindedness, in recording
                    whatever it records as it was delivered from the earliest sources in its
                    entirety; and possibly in that string of anecdotes the development of Christ's
                    life and work may be traced with not less clearness than in the ampler and more
                    artistic production of Luke.</p>

                <p>The preface (chaps, i. and ii.) reveals a part of the purpose of the whole
                    Gospel, in tracing the genealogy of Jesus, not from David merely, who was under
                    the law, but from Abraham, who was the receiver of the promise (Gal. iii.. 16)
                    and the father of the faithful (Gal. iii. 7). Such a genealogy is the fitting
                    preface of a book which aims at exhibiting the law, not as trampled upon but as
                    fulfilled and developed into a higher law of promise, in which all the families
                    of the world were to be blessed (Gen. xii. 3). But by this time also the church
                    required some distinct affirmation concerning the divine origin of Jesus. The
                    gap left in the opening of Mark’s Gospel needed to be filled up. The mere
                    earthly pedigree from Abraham was insufficient; nor did it suffice that Jesus
                    should be declared to be spiritually the Son of God. It was necessary that the
                    verity of the spiritual birth of Jesus from the Father should be embodied in a
                    narrative so expressed as to be intelligible to all.</p>
                <p>The differences between the prefaces of Matthew and Luke are obvious, and need no
                    stress laid on them, except as illustrations of the freedom which, at this
                    period, was allowed in the handling of the various introductions to the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n827/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0827-0804"/> Gospel tradition. It is obvious, for example,
                    that Luke regards Nazareth as the residence of Joseph and Mary from the first
                    (i. 26; ii. 4), whereas Matthew seems to represent them as selecting Nazareth
                    for their new home after the birth of Jesus and the return from Egypt, only
                    because they were afraid to return to their old home in Judaea, thereby
                    fulfilling an ancient prophecy (ii. 23). Throughout his preface, as throughout
                    his version of the Triple Tradition, Matthew always bears in mind that Jesus
                    came to fulfil the prophets as well as the law. The birth from a virgin (i. 25),
                    the birth in Bethlehem (ii. 6), the return from Egypt (ii. 15), the massacre of
                    the children in Bethlehem (ii. 18), and the residence in Nazareth (ii. 23) are
                    all spoken of as the consequences of prophecies. It is scarcely fanciful, also,
                    to see some reference to the infancy of Moses, and the slaughter of the
                    Israelitish children by Pharaoh in the massacre of the children of Bethlehem by
                    Herod.</p>
                <p>Passing next to Matthew’s version of the Triple Tradition, we note first the
                    prominence given to the law. Instead of giving a chronological account of our
                    Lord’s acts and sayings, Matthew prefers to collecta mass of doctrine into one
                    continuous discourse, known from early times as the Sermon on the Mount. This
                    discourse follows almost immediately (iv. 11; V. 1.) on the commencement of His
                    public life; and it contains the new law of the new kingdom. The Sermon on the
                    Mount corresponds to the law given on Mount Sinai, and a thread of contrast runs
                    through the former, comparing in each case that which had been said “of old time
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> ’ with that which the New Lawgiver prescribed,
                    and showing that in each case the new law, though more gentle, was also more
                    stringent and more exacting than the old, “Depart from Me, ye workers of
                    iniquity” (Lu. xiii. 27) is expressed by Matthew (vii. 23), “Depart from Me, ye
                    that work lawlessness;” and this word “lawlessness” is found four times in
                    Matthew, and not at all in the rest of the Gospels. Luke recognizes that no jot
                    or tittle is to pass from the law till all be fulfilled; but nowhere in Luke
                    shall we find the strong language which declares (Mat. v. 19) that he who
                    breaks, or teaches others to break, one of the least of the commandments of the
                    law shall be called least in the kingdom of God.</p>
                <p>The genealogy traced from Abraham, and the stress laid on prophecy, as well as
                    the prominence thus given to the law, all suggest that this book was primarily
                    intended for Jewish readers; and this supposition is confirmed by the whole
                    tenor of the Gospel. Matthew finds less space than Luke for the parables which
                    point to the inclusion of the Gentiles, and more for those which point to the
                    exclusion of the workers of lawlessness and of the unworthy Jews. He alone among
                    the evangelists has the saying, “Many are called but few chosen;” and the
                    distinction between the “called” <hi rend="italic">(κλητοί)</hi> and “chosen”
                    <hi rend="italic">(lκλeκτoi)</hi> is the more remarkable, because Paul uses the
                    two words almost indifferently, and Luke (though he too has the parable of the
                    unworthy guests) has not ventured to use <hi rend="italic">κλητοί</hi> in
                    Matthew’s disparaging signification. But Matthew, more than the rest of the
                    evangelists, seems to move in evil days, and amid a race of backsliders, among
                    dogs and swine who are unworthy of the pearls of truth, among the tares sown by
                    the enemy, among fishermen who have to cast back again many of the fish caught
                    in the net of the gospel; the broad way is ever in his mind, and the multitude
                    of those that go thereby, and the guest without the wedding garment, and the
                    foolish virgins, and the goats as well as the sheep, and those who even “cast
                    out devils” in the name of the Lord, and yet are rejected by Him because they
                    “work lawlessness.” Where Luke speaks exultantly of “joy in heaven” over one
                    repentant sinner, Matthew in more negative and sober phrases declares that it is
                    not the will of the Father that one of the little ones should perish; and as a
                    reason for not being distracted about the future it is alleged that “sufficient
                    for the day is the evil thereof”: see above, (10), (11), (12), (13), (28), (29
                    <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi>), (50), (52). It is farfetched to suppose that
                    these subjects are selected or amplified in antagonism to the doctrine of Paul.
                    The condition of the Jews, their increasing hostility to the Christians, and the
                    wavering or retrogression of many Jewish converts when the hostility became
                    intensified shortly before and during the siege of Jerusalem,—this may well
                    explain one side of Matthew’s Gospel; and the other side (the condemnation of
                    “lawlessness ”) might find an explanation in a reference to Hellenizing Jews,
                    who (like some of the Corinthians) considered that the new law set them free
                    from all restraint, and who, in casting aside every vestige of nationality,
                    wished to cast aside morality as well. Viewed in the light of the approaching
                    fall of Jerusalem, and the wavering or retrogression of great masses of the
                    nation, the introduction into the Lord’s Prayer of the words, “Deliver us from
                    the evil,” and the prediction (xxiv. 12) that “by reason of the multiplying of
                    lawlessness the love of many shall wax cold,” will seem not only appropriate,
                    but typical of the character of the whole of the First Gospel.</p>
                <p>Besides the fulfilments of prophecy mentioned in the preface, Matthew sees
                    several others (6), (25), (43), (44), (54) which are not mentioned in the Triple
                    Tradition, and these applications of prophecy sometimes contain obvious
                    confusions. For example, Matthew sees in our Lord’s entry into· Jerusalem a
                    fulfilment of the prophecy: “Thy king cometh . . . sitting upon an ass, and a
                    colt the foal of an ass.” The repetition seems to denote one animal, after the
                    manner of H ebrew poetry, and only one is mentioned by Mark and Luke; but
                    Matthew, applying prophecy more closely, speaks of two, and adds (xxi. 7) “they
                    brought the ass and the foal and cast their clothes upon <hi rend="italic"
                    >them,</hi> and he sat upon <hi rend="italic">themT</hi> Again, in speaking of
                    the “potter’s field” (xxvii. 9), he quotes, as from Jeremiah, a prophecy that is
                    really from Zechariah xi. 12 (the word translated “potter” is rendered by Ewald
                    “treasury”; and [though Aquila has 7rλαστψ'] the LXX. has <hi rend="italic"
                    >γwvevτηpiov,</hi> “foundry,’ neither of which renderings will suit Matthew’s
                    application). Again, though Luke speaks of the “sign of Jonah,” Matthew alone
                    makes Jesus publicly declare that, as Jonah was three days and three nights in
                    the belly of the whale (xii. 40), so He shall be three days and three nights in
                    the heart of the earth; and such a declaration, exciting no questioning in the
                    disciples, nor wonder in bystanders, appears in the highest degree improbable,
                    and looks like a later application. It will be remembered that Matthew alone has
                    the inaccurate statement that the murdered Zachariah was the son of Barachiah
                    (xxiii. 35); and perhaps an inaccuracy resulting from a lapse of memory may
                    explain, not only the use of the name of Jeremiah above, but also the quotation
                    “He shall be called a Nazarene” (ii. 23), which is found in no existing book of
                    prophecy. Similarly (perhaps) Mark, through lapse of memory on the part of those
                    whose tradition he records, quotes (i. 2), as from Isaiah, according to the
                    correct reading (the A. V. reads “prophets”), a prophecy composed of two
                    passages, the first of which is from Malachi, and only the second from Isaiah.
                    It must be remembered that, without the modern means for rapid reference,
                    verification was a much harder task then than now, and much more trust was
                    necessarily given to memory.</p>
                <p>Few new miracles are introduced by Matthew into the body of his work (15), (21),
                    (31), (34). Two of these consist of acts of healing; and two are connected with
                    Peter, viz., Peter’s partial success in walking upon the waves, and his
                    (supposed) extraction of a stater from the mouth of a fish. But the words
                    implying the latter miracle have possibly arisen from a misunderstanding; at all
                    events <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n828/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0828-0805"/> they leave in the mind “a doubt whether, in this
                    instance, some essential particular may not have been either omitted or left
                    unexplained” (Farrar’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Christ,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    46).</p>
                <p>In its moral teaching this Gospel lays special stress upon the sin of religious
                    ostentation and hypocrisy. In a strong passage (xii. 33) consistent
                    undissembling wickedness is preferred to dissembled wickedness, and the
                    Pharisees are described at greater length than in any of the other Gospels. Yet
                    this Gospel does not always dwell upon the dark side of Christ’s doctrine. It
                    preserves also some of the Lord’s most “comfortable” sayings: the blessings upon
                    the meek and merciful; the saying that the angels of the little ones always
                    behold the face of the Father; and above all that saying which is a gospel in
                    itself, “Come unto KΓe, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden,” &amp;c. (xi.
                    28-30).</p>
                <p>In speaking of the date of Matthew’s Gospel, so far as it can be determined from
                    internal evidence, we must remember that, if the work be composite, the fact
                    that some of Matthew’s additions are clearly late will not show that others may
                    not be early. The saying, for example, that the disciples shall not have gone
                    over the cities of Israel till the Son of Man shall have come (x. 23), seems to
                    be an early and unaltered reminiscence of a saying of Jesus, which was not
                    generally adopted in the tradition because of its recognized difficulty at a
                    later date. It is possible that Matthew may consider the coming of the Son of
                    Man fulfilled primarily in the transfiguration; for whereas in their prefaces to
                    the transfiguration Mark and Luke write, “There are «orne standing here who
                    shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God” (Mark adds “coming in
                    power”), Matthew substitutes for “kingdom of God,” &lt;kc., “the Son of Man
                    coming in His kingdom.” But, whatever may have been Matthew’s theory, the
                    difficulty of the utterance in Matt. x. 23 implies its early date. On the other
                    hand, a decidedly late date seems implied in the expression “up to this day,”
                    which is twice found—once in the addition xxvii. 8 (the potter’s field) and
                    again in xxviii. 15 (the bribing of the guard by the chief priests). Yet these
                    additions appear to be in the style of the writer both of the preface and the
                    appendix, and of the other passages peculiar to Matthew. <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> It would follow that all these passages are of a late date, not added to
                    the tradition till long after the death of Christ. The interval must have been
                    long enough to allow, for example, the “potter’s field ’’—and this argument
                    holds whether the story of the potter’s field (xxvii. 8) be historical •er
                    not—first, to acquire the name of the Field of Blood, and secondly, to retain
                    that name for so long a period (nearly at least a generation) as to make it
                    possible for a writer to speak of the acquisition of the name as a far distant
                    fact, writing that the name is still borne, even “to this day.” The same
                    expression in xxviii. 15,—where it is said that the false charge against the
                    disciples, of stealing the body of Jesus, is commonly reported “unto this day”
                    by “the Jews,”—warrants the same inference; and this inference is corroborated
                    by the remarkable use of “the Jews.” The author of the Fourth Gospel, writing at
                    a much later date, habitually speaks of “the Jews” as an alien race, quite
                    separated from the Christians; but this is not in the manner of the synoptistic
                    tradition.</p>
                <p>The uncertainty in whieh Mark left the resurrection of Jesus would naturally seem
                    to later writers to require to be removed; and accordingly we find that Matthew
                    adds to the vision of angels (two instead of one) a manifestation of Jesus
                    Himself. But the whole of this narrative (xxviii. 9-20), though apparently in
                    Matthew’s style (c∕., for example, the remarkable use of oi δε', without the oi
                    <hi rend="italic">piv,</hi> in the sense of “others,” in xxviii. 17 with that in
                    xxvi. 67), and though containing internal evidence of being composed long after
                    the events narrated (xxviii. 15), is nevertheless strangely disjointed. Yet its
                    very defects, its disconnectedness, incompleteness, and abruptness, indicate a
                    date earlier than that of the more connected and completer narratives of the
                    Third and Fourth Gospels. Matthew separates from Mark’s narrative at the
                    departure of the women from the tomb, having previously given an account
                    (repeated by no other evangelist) of the resurrection from the dead of a great
                    number of “saints,” who “went into the holy city and appeared unto many.” To
                    Mark’s simple statement that the women “found the stone rolled away” Matthew
                    adds a graphic account of a glorious angel visibly descending from heaven,
                    filling the keepers with fear, and rolling the stone away. Then, immediately
                    after the women have departed with the angelic message, to bid the disciples to
                    go to Galilee, Jesus suddenly appears to them. They clasp His feet, while He
                    repeats over again the message that the disciples must go to Galilee there to
                    behold Him. Without any further mention of the place of meeting, the disciples
                    are said to have gone to <hi rend="italic">“the</hi> mountain, where Jesus made
                    agreement (∈τc⅛ατo) with them (to meet them).” To avoid this dislocation, there
                    has been suggested the desperate remedy (Weiss, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Matthäusevangelium,</hi> p. 582) of rendering <hi rend="italic">iταξατο,</hi>
                    “laid down the law,” with reference to the Sermon on the Mount; but the probable
                    solution is that Matthew here extracts and separates from its context some
                    ancient tradition which is obscured through want of its framework. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> Again Matthew tells us that, upon this mountain, only
                    the eleven were present, and that while some of them worshipped, others
                    “doubted.” This statement is of value as evidence that it was acknowledged, even
                    so late as the compilation of Matthew’s Gospel, that some at least of the
                    manifestations of Jesus were of such a nature that, while they brought immediate
                    conviction to some beholders, they did not at once convince others, even of His
                    nearest disciples; in other words, the manifestation of Jesus depended upon
                    other considerations than the mere physical sense of sight. But, on the other
                    hand, the statement seems quite inconsistent with the supposition that in
                    previous manifestations in or near Jerusalem Jesus had been recognized and
                    worshipped by all the eleven. The last words of the Gospel represent Jesus as
                    commissioning His disciples to go into all nations, preaching His gospel, and
                    baptizing in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. The thought
                    con-</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Want of space renders it impossible to state the
                    grounds on which it seems probable that Matthew consists only of (1) the Triple
                    Tradition; (2) extracts from a book or tradition of the words of the Lord from
                    which Luke also borrowed; and (3) an introduction, framework, and appendix, all
                    added by one hand; though possibly the introduction and appendix, being
                    borrowed, the former from an Aramaic source, the latter from a Latin source, may
                    show differences of idiom not wholly concealed by the overlying style of the
                    author who works up the materials. A similar use of the particles δe and <hi
                    rend="italic">καί,</hi> and of participles, ruu3 throughout almost all the
                    non-traditional narrative parts of Matthew; and the rhythm of the sentences is
                    very similar. But the linguistic evidence has not as yet been so selected,
                    classified, and concentrated as to obtain any certain results. And until this is
                    done, inferences drawn from isolated phenomena are likely to be very misleading.
                    For example, it has been inferred (Weiss, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Matihäusevan·</hi><hi rend="italic">geiiu&gt;n,</hi> p. 502) that the use of
                    the form <hi rend="italic">'Iepουσaλhμ</hi> once only in Matthew (xxiii. 37, in
                    a passage almost identical with Lu. xiii. 34, whereas Matthew uses <hi
                    rend="italic                     superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ιpοσοKυμa</hi> eleven times) proves that Matthew borrowed the
                    passage in which it occurs from an Aramaic source. Now it is true that other
                    reasons make the hypothesis of an Aramaic source for the identical passages in
                    Matthew and Luke extremely probable; but this use of <hi rend="italic"
                    >'ttρουσaKhμ</hi> is quite insufficient proof. For a comparison of Paul’s use of
                    <hi rend="italic                     superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Upοσ6λυμa</hi> (Gal. i. 17, 18; ii. 1) and <hi rend="italic">'Ieρουcra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">i]μ</hi> (Gal. iv. 25, 26) will show that
                    the same author might use the one form geographically and the other in a higher
                    style, theologically or rhetorically. And this may possibly be held to explain
                    the use of <hi rend="italic">'leρουοa</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∙f</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">μ</hi> by Matthew

                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> In a somewhat similar manner the author of the
                    Second Epistle of Peter speaks of “<hi rend="italic">the</hi> holy mount"’ (2
                    Pet. i. 18), assuming that his readers would understand the definite reference
                    to the mountain of the transfiguration.</p>

                <p>tained in these words furnishes a suitable termination to the Gospel; but there
                    is every probability that we have not here the exact words of Jesus Himself. Not
                    to speak of the introduction of the later baptismal formulary, “in the name of
                    the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,” the rest of the vocabulary is not
                    found in the words of Jesus as recorded in the Triple Tradition, but is peculiar
                    to Matthew. For example, (1) the word <hi rend="italic">μαθήτευες</hi> (xxviii.
                    19) is used three times by Matthew, and nowhere else in the New Testament,
                    except once in the Acts; (2) the expression <hi rend="italic">συντέλειας</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">τoυ alωvoς</hi> (xxviii. 20) is found five times in Matthew, and
                    nowhere else in the New Testament, except once in the Epistle to the Hebrews;
                    and (3) the word <hi rend="italic">τηρείν</hi> (xxviii. 20), used by Matthew six
                    times, is used once only by Mark, and not at all by Luke.</p>
                <p>It is noteworthy that Matthew makes no express mention of the ascension of Jesus.
                    But it is possible that he considers this final manifestation on the
                    mountain-top to have terminated with the ascension; for Matthew, describing the
                    farewell of Jesus, appears to have in his mind the picture, contemplated also by
                    Daniel, of the Son of Man endowed with all power and seated on the clouds of
                    heaven. Compare Daniel vii. 14, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >εδόθη</hi><hi rend="italic">aυτω</hi><hi rend="italic">εξουσία,”</hi> with
                    Matthew xxviii. 18, <hi rend="italic">“εδόθη</hi><hi rend="italic">μοι</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">πάσα εξουσία.”</hi> And this perhaps may explain the twice
                    repeated saying of Matthew, that some of the disciples should see the Son of Man
                    coming. The manifestation of Jesus upon the mountain in Galilee, commissioning
                    His disciples to go forth to make disciples of all the world, and claiming all
                    kingdoms for Himself, might well seem a fulfilment of these two prophecies (x.
                    23; xvi. 28), as well as a fitting close to the book of the Gospel.</p>

                <p>Before speaking in detail of the passages peculiar to Luke, it will be convenient
                    to consider his avowed purpose in writing, and some peculiarities of his style.
                    The dedication to Theophilus, a name which is now believed by many to be merely
                    typical of every reader who is so far “loved of God” as to be admitted into the
                    church of Christ, states that the author purposes to write an account “in

                    informs us that the object of the treatise was not to tell the reader anything
                    that was new, but rather to give him an ampler knowledge of the certainty of
                    those things which were then and always had been fully believed in the church,
                    even as they had been handed down by those who had been from the beginning
                    eyewitnesses and ministers of the word. Without going so far as to affirm that
                    the tvord handed down <hi rend="italic">(παpεbοσαv)</hi> excludes written
                    tradition (Westcott’s <hi rend="italic">Introduction,</hi> 186, 203), it is at
                    least remarkable that Luke distinguishes between the “eyewitnesses” and those
                    whose attempts he disapproved,—saying that the latter attempted to draw up a
                    “connected narrative,” whereas the former merely “handed down” the facts. This
                    amounts almost to a denial on the part of Luke that any “eyewitness” (that is to
                    say, apostlej had up to that time written any narrative (so far as Luki knew) of
                    the life of Christ. It implies also that the words and deeds of the Lord had
                    been recorded by many without arrangement, and that the author purposed to
                    arrange them. The literary and artistic purpose of the author appears in words
                    and phrases, as well as in the conceptions. Writing perhaps principally for
                    readers to whom the Greek of the <pb break="no"

                    distasteful, he substitutes more classical words for many that are used by
                    Matthew and Mark in the Triple Tradition (see above, p. 796). Even the use of
                    “sea” to denote the Lake of Gennesareth, is objectionable to him, and he always
                    substitutes “lake.” The Latinism κοδράντ^ς for farthing (Mat. v. 26; Mk. xii.
                    42) is altered or omitted by Luke. He prefers <hi rend="italic">πορεύομαι.</hi>
                    to ύττάγω. Versed as he is, and as his readers would be, in the metamorphoses of
                    the heathen stories, he shrinks from applying the word “metamorphosed” (Mat.
                    xvii. 2; Mk. ix. 2) to the transfiguration of Jesus, and substitutes (ix. 29)
                    “became different.” He dislikes repetitions also, as much as he dislikes
                    low-class words: compare v. 32, 33; vi. 10; viii. 21, 15, with the corresponding
                    passages in Matthew and Mark; and note especially, in the cure of the palsied
                    man (Mat. ix.; Mk. ii; Lu. v.) how Luke not only avoids the word <hi
                    rend="italic">κράββατος,</hi> for “bed” (noted by Phrynichus as objectionable,
                    Lobeck, p. 62), but also, to avoid repetition, uses three substitutes in
                    succession,—(v. 18) <hi rend="italic">κXlvr]&lt;s,</hi> (v. 19 and 24) κλιvιδιω,
                    (v. 25) <hi rend="italic">ε&lt;j&gt;</hi><hi rend="italic">ώ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(or δ) κaτεκειτo,</hi> where Mark is content to use the
                    objectionable <hi rend="italic">κράββατος</hi> four times. When writing in his
                    own style he is fond of long and sonorous words, such as διάδος for δός (Mat.
                    xix. 21; Mk. X. 21; Lu. xviii. 22), δια∕z∙εp⅛o∕zαι, διaγoγγυξειv, and the
                    compounds of διά generally; compare also his use of 7rεpi7roιoυp,αι (xvii. 33,
                    correct text), and of <hi rend="italic">ζωογονεΐν</hi> (ϊά.) for σωξειv.</p>
                <p>The question of Luke’s style is specially important because the striking
                    differences between certain portions of his Gospel which are all, though in very
                    different styles, found in his Gospel alone (occurring neither in the Triple
                    Tradition, nor in the parts which Luke has in common with Matthew or in common
                    with Mark), might naturally induce even a careful student to believe that they
                    are composed by different authors. For example, take as a criterion the use of
                    <hi rend="italic">καί</hi> and δε. In classical Greek, and indeed in almost
                    every Greek except the ultra-Hebraic, the particle δε' is of constant
                    occurrence. The fact that it does not occur more than six or seven times in the
                    whole of the Apocalypse, and not at all in the first book of the Maccabees till
                    chap, iii. 36, would naturally lead us readily to believe that the former was
                    written by a Jew who knew little of Greek literature, and that Jerome was right
                    in saying that the latter is a translation from a Hebrew original. Applying this
                    test to Luke, we find that in the 80 verses of Luke’s first chapter, it occurs
                    16 times, while in the 19 verses of X. 25-42 it occurs 16 times; or in other
                    words, δε' is (proportionately) used more than four times as often in the ninth
                    chapter as in the first. This suggests the inference that Luke’s introduction
                    has an Aramaic origin. But if we turn to the Acts we find that in the first
                    chapter, containing 26 verses (or 19 verses of narrative and 7 of a speech), δε
                    <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> occurs only twice; whereas in the ninth chapter,
                    which contains 43 verses, δεoccurs 35 times. Yet an Aramaic origin has not been
                    thought, by any consensus of competent authorities, necessary or probable for
                    the first chapter in the Acts.</p>
                <p>Although, therefore, it is possible that the first two chapters of Luke may be a
                    direct translation from an Aramaic original, yet there is an alternative. The
                    alternative is that Luke, a man of letters and skilled in composition,
                    consciously or unconsciously adapted his style to the subject, feeling that a
                    different style was required on the one hand by the Magnificat and the Nunc
                    Dimittis, and on the other hand by the graceful domestic narrative of the
                    contrast between the sisters Martha and Mary.</p>
                <p>This will be made all the more probable if it can be shown that Luke had studied
                    and imitated the LXX., and in particular the Greek Apocrypha. Words not used (or
                    seldom) by Matthew and Mark, but by Luke and the Apocryphal writers, are <hi
                    rend="italic">tπiβλεψοv,</hi><hi rend="italic">άποσπασθέντων, επιβάλλει</hi> in
                    the sense of “belonging,” <hi rend="italic">επισιτισμός,</hi> the use of <hi
                    rend="italic">υψιστοs</hi> for God, <hi rend="italic">στιγμή, άντιβάλλειν,
                    εύθετος,</hi><hi rend="italic">περισπaσθaι, κaιpbι</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >επισκοπής,</hi><hi rend="italic">δοχf],</hi> and λuσιτελe^. But far more
                    striking than mere words (for Matthew and Mark might be shown to have some
                    peculiar words in common with the Apocrypha) are the sentences in the Apocrypha
                    which seem to have suggested similar sentences in Luke. For example, compare
                    Luke’s story of the rich fool (xii. 19) with the following passage from Sirach
                    (xi. 18): “There is one that gathereth wealth from his overheed and pinching;
                    and this is the lot of his reward. In the hour when he sayeth, I have found
                    rest, and now let me eat of my good things, even then he knoweth not what season
                    shall pass away, and he shalΓleave these things unto others and shall perish.”
                    Again, in the parable of the unjust judge, there is a striking similarity
                    between the words (xviii. 8) “Though he bear long with them <hi rend="italic"
                    >(μακροθυμεί),</hi> I tell you He will avenge them speedily,” and (Sirach xxii.
                    22), “And He will surely not delay; nor will He bear long <hi rend="italic"
                    >(μακροθυμήσει)</hi> with them”; so also between (i. 42) “Blessed art thou among
                    women,” and (Judith xiii. 17) “Blessed art thou, 0 daughter, by the Most High
                    God, above all the women that are in the earth”; and between (vi. 35) “Love <hi
                    rend="italic">ye</hi> your enemies . . . and ye shall be the children of the
                    Highest,” and (Sirach iv. 10), “Be as a father unto the fatherless . . . and
                    thou shalt be as the son of the Highest.” Occasional similarities of thought and
                    even of words are found between Matthew and Mark and the LXX. Apocrypha; but it
                    cannot be said of either of them, as it can of the Third Gospel, that it is
                    saturated with the LXX. diction. In many cases there is an allusive use of LXX.
                    words. For example, Luke (xxiii. 51), telling us that Joseph of Arimathaea had
                    not “consented to” the wicked decision of the Pharisees against Jesus, uses a
                    word not elsewhere used in the whole of the New Testament. Why? Because the word
                    is used by the LXX. (Exod. xxiii. 1) in a passage expressly prohibiting
                    combinations for false judgment: “Thou shalt not <hi rend="italic">consent
                    with</hi><hi rend="italic">(συγκαταθήσγ)</hi> the unjust to become an unjust
                    witness; thou sbalt not be with the stronger side to do ill; thou shalt not add
                    thyself with the multitude to shut out judgment.” Again, when Luke (xxiii. 49),
                    telling how the “acquaintances” of Jesus stood at a distance from the cross,
                    uses the word “<hi rend="italic">γνωστοί"</hi> —not elsewhere found in the
                    synoptists, —there can be little doubt that he has in his mind the passage from
                    the LXX. (Ps. lxxvii. 9), ‘ ‘ Thou hast put mine acquaintances <hi rend="italic"
                    >(γνωστούς)</hi> far from me.” Compare also the use of <hi rend="italic"
                    >εγκαθέτους,</hi> only found once in Luke (xx. 20), with the use of the word in
                    the LXX. (twice only) Job xix. 12; xxxi. 9. See also a similarity implied
                    between the aged Abraham and Sarah on the one hand, and Zacharias and Elisabeth
                    on the other, in the similarity between “<hi rend="italic">προβεβηκότες
                    ήμερων"</hi> (Gen. xvii. 11) and <hi rend="italic">προβεβηκότες</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tv τa^ις</hi><hi rend="italic">ήμέραις</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >”</hi> (Lu. i. 7).</p>
                <p>Our conclusion must be (1) that as Luke has modified the Triple Tradition, and
                    the words of the Lord common to himself and Matthew, by alterations of words and
                    phrases, so and much more has he modified other traditions or documents which he
                    has introduced into his work; and (2) that those portions of the part of the
                    Gospel peculiar to himself which have a more archaic and Judaic rhythm and
                    vocabulary than the rest may be either translations from Aramaic documents, or
                    imitations, conscious or unconscious, of the books of the LXX.,— natural
                    adaptations of the style to the subject, like the language of Shakespeare’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Julius Casar</hi> as compared with the less simple and dignified
                    language in his English plays of the same date. It is probable, however, that
                    when the evidence is more thoroughly classified than it has hitherto been, it
                    may at least demonstrate the existence of different documents in Luke, whether
                    translations or not.</p>
                <p>Impossible though it is here even to summarize the evidence, we may give the
                    reader a conception of the nature of it. Attention has been called above to the
                    use of the form &lt;5 <hi rend="italic">Κύριος,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> the
                    Lord,” in narration, as being an indication of late authorship. But this form
                    occurs several times in the body of Luke’s Gospel: namely, in the passages
                    containing the raising of the widow’s son at Nain (vii. 13); the appointment of
                    the seventy (x. 1); the rebuke of the Pharisees (xi. 39); the preface to the
                    parable of the faithful and just steward (xii. 42); the healing of the daughter
                    of Abraham bound by Satan (xiii. 15); the parable of the sycamore tree (xvii. 5,
                    6); the parable of the unjust judge (xviii. 6); the story of Zaccliaeus (xix.
                    8); warning to Simon Peter (xxii. 31); Christ’s look (xxii. 61); and the verse
                    where it is said that they found not the body of the Lord Jesus (xxiv. 3). Many
                    of the above passages certainly show signs of translation; and when we remember
                    that the Gospel of the Hebrews (see below, p. 818) always uses the form ό <hi
                    rend="italic">Κύριος,</hi> and never ό <hi rend="italic">’Ιησούς,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">we</hi> see herein a confirmation of the theory that these
                    passages in Luke are translations from Aramaic. Another testing word is <hi
                    rend="italic">Ιερουσαλήμ.</hi> Luke uses <hi rend="italic">Ιερουσαλήμ</hi> about
                    twenty-six times, <hi rend="italic">'Ιεροσόλυμα</hi> only three times (ii. 22;
                    xix. 28; <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n831/mode/1up"

                    latter form is sometimes used geographically by writers who use the former
                    rhetorically or historically; but it is certainly remarkable that in ii. 22 and
                    41 the two forms should be used, apparently in the same sense, <hi rend="italic"

                    evidence of which, added to the internal evidence of thought (and perhaps

                    ήλθαν for jjλθov), may possibly hereafter enable future critics to distinguish
                    with certainty between the different strata of Luke’s narrative. But no
                    certainty is possible in the present condition of the evidence. There has been
                    abundant labour but insufficient classification of evidence, and no attempt at
                    all to represent it in a concentrated form.</p>
                <p>Passing now to the consideration of Luke’s additional subject matter, and
                    reserving the supernatural element to the last, we will speak first of the
                    doctrine. The key-note is struck in the song of Zacharias, and repeated in the
                    first sermon of Jesus in Nazareth. The object of the messenger of Jesus is (i.
                    77) “to give us knowledge of salvation” by “the remission of sins,” by reason of
                    “the tender mercy of our God, whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us
                    to give light to them that sit in darkness;” and the object of Jesus Himself
                    (iv. 18) is “to preach the gospel to the poor,” to “heal the broken-hearted, to
                    preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind.” All
                    through the Gospel {or at least the parts peculiar to Luke) there appears to a
                    greater degree than in the First or Second Gospel the contrast between light and
                    darkness, God and Satan, sin and remission of sins, culminating in the triumph
                    of forgiveness and mercy; so that in the very last words of Jesus to His
                    disciples (xxiv. 47) the proclamation of “repentance and remission of sins” is
                    made the prospect of the future gospel to all nations.</p>
                <p>The law of Moses appears at first sight inconsistently magnified, almost in an
                    Ebionitic spirit, throughout the first two introductory chapters of the Gospel,
                    and afterwards put aside. But there is no inconsistency. Paul himself says that
                    the Saviour placed Himself at His birth “under the law,” and hence it is that
                    Luke, with an almost anxious elaboration, details the exact fulfilments of the
                    law not only by the parents of Jesus, but also by those of His messenger. Hence
                    also it is that in a single chapter of the introduction the word “law” occurs
                    more often than in all the rest of the Gospel put together. For when Jesus
                    attained to manhood, He was no longer under the bondage of the old law, which
                    had now attained its fulfilment in the new law of the remission of sins through
                    love. Yet the law is not trampled on, but only superseded by development; it was
                    only “until John;” yet not “one tittle” of it can fail (xvi. 1G, 17).<note

                    of Luke xvi. 16, and the contrast there between the “law” and the “kingdom,”

                    contrast is almost lost.</p></note> True to its principle of contrast, this book
                    gives Satan a prominent position. When Satan departs from Jesus, he departs only
                    “for a time” (iv. 13); Satan causes diseases and binds a daughter of
                    Abraham;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Note that Luke
                    alone in the description of the cure of Simon’s mother-in-law (iv 39) tells us
                    that Jesus rebuked the fever.</p></note> Satan is beheld by Jesus in a vision
                    cast down from heaven; he enters into Judas (xxii. 3, not mentioned by Matthew
                    or Mark); he demands the Twelve that he may “sift” them; see above (16), (32),
                    (46), (73). But this need not denote (as is thought by Keim) an Ebionitic
                    source; the same recognition of the <hi rend="italic">eξovσia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">τον σκότονς</hi> appears in the Acts and the Epistles to the
                    Ephesians and Colossians, which no one suspects of Ebionitic tendencies (Lu.
                    xxii. 53; Acts xxvi. 18; Eph. ii. 2; vi. 12; Col. i. 13). Something more than
                    the principle of contrast may, however, be required to explain the sharp
                    demarcation between rich and poor. We do not find in Luke that qualification of
                    the epithet “poor” which Matthew (v. 3) inserts, “the poor in spirit.” He
                    enforces the hampering disadvantages cf wealth, pronouncing a woe upon them that
                    are rich; gently rebukes the “cumbered” Martha; exhorts the rich to entertain
                    the poor; aud dooms the rich fool to a sudden and disappointing death, while
                    Dives is consigned to unalterable torment,—(21), (34), (46), (51), (57). But if
                    this seems to savour of Ebionitic thought, let it be remembered that the
                    principle of contrast is even more systematically applied to illustrate the
                    power of the genuine Pauline faith in the parables of forgiveness. As Lazarus is
                    contrasted with Dives, and the grateful Samaritan with the ungrateful Jewish
                    lepers, and the merciful Samaritan with the heartless priest and Levite, and
                    even the trivial anxieties of Martha with the simple devotion of Mary,—so in the
                    stories of forgiveness, the publican finds his foil in the Pharisee who prays by
                    his side; the woman “which was a sinner,” and who “loved much,” contrasts with
                    Simon, the churlish host, who loved little; the prodigal younger son with the
                    envious elder son; and the penitent thief on the right with the impenitent thief
                    on the left. All these stories, as well as the tale of Zacchaeus, and the lost
                    piece of silver, and the lost sheep (peculiar to Luke in language, though the
                    same subject is found in Matthew), magnify the power of forgiveness, and
                    repentance, and faith, for the most part “without works”—contrasting the
                    instantaneous and complete victories of emotional faith with the inferior
                    results of a long life of ordinary and prudent respectability,—(27), (54), (55),
                    (81), (66), (64).</p>
                <p>The universality of the Gospel is more marked in Luke than in Matthew or Mark.
                    The seventy missionaries appear to be emblematic of the preaching of the gospel
                    to the seventy (or seventy-two, see Westcott’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction,</hi> p. 374) nations of the earth. The preference of the Gentiles
                    to the Jews would seem to be indicated at the very outset of the public life of
                    Jesus in the sermon at Nazareth (iv. 16-30), if we could accept this as
                    chronologically and historically accurate. Besides the statement of Jesus in the
                    Triple Tradition, that His kinsmen were those that heard the word of God and did
                    it (Luke prefers this expression to that of Matthew and Mark, “doing the will of
                    God ”), Luke gives us another assurance that God’s special blessing is reserved,
                    not for the mother of the Saviour, but for those who do the word of God. The
                    inclusiveness of the author breaks down the barrier between Jesus and the
                    Samaritans; the sons of Zebedee are rebuked for desiring to call down fire on a
                    Samaritan village; a just Samaritan shames both priest and Levite; and a
                    grateful Samaritan puts nine Jewish lepers to the blush,—see (31), (17), (39),
                    (29), (33), (59).</p>
                <p>In connexion with this, the gentler and more inclusive side of the gospel
                    teaching, it may be mentioned that Luke lays especial stress on the part played
                    by women alike in discerning the providence of God, in ministering to Jesus, and
                    in eliciting some of His most helpful utterances. The songs of Mary and of
                    Elisabeth, and the testimony of the prophetess Anna, are found nowhere but in
                    the Third Gospel; in Luke, for the first time, the mother of the Lord begins to
                    assume a wider province,—she it is, and not Joseph, that ponders in her heart
                    the words of her divine Son, and her sufferings are made the subject of inspired
                    prophecy (ii. 35). Luke alone thinks it worth while to record at some length the
                    names of those women who accompanied Jesus and contributed to His support; he
                    alone knows of the devoted faith of Mary and the domestic anxieties of Martha;
                    he alone records the cure of the afflicted “daughter of Abraham,” the
                    truth-eliciting exclamation of the woman who invoked a blessing upon the womb
                    that bare Him, the story of the woman who “loved much,” and the parable of the
                    woman rejoicing over the lost piece <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n832/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0832-0809"/> of silver. Luke alone holds up the fate of Lot’s
                    wife as a warning; nor do we find in any other Gospel the touching utterance of
                    Jesus to the weeping “daughters of Jerusalem.” The other synoptists concur with
                    Luke in pronouncing a blessing on the man who gives up father or mother or lands
                    or houses for Christ’s sake, and the sense of fitness has induced the scribes of
                    several MSS. to insert in Matthew and Mark the word “wife” as well as “mother”;
                    but it has no legitimate place except in the version of Luke. It is true indeed
                    that Luke, so far from giving to women the prominent part assigned to them by
                    Matthew and the interpolated Mark, and even by the Fourth Gospel, in attesting
                    the resurrection of Jesus, carefully places their evidence in the background;
                    but the evidence of impressionable witnesses might naturally be subordinated by
                    a writer (perhaps a physician too) who was collecting the traditions of the
                    church into an historical narrative. In any case, it is noteworthy that the word
                    “woman” occurs in Luke almost as many times as in Matthew and Mark put
                    together.</p>
                <p>Probably the most perplexing part of Luke’s doctrine is found in the parables of
                    the unjust steward, the unjust judge, and the friend persuaded by importunity.
                    In the last two of these the argument appears to be,—“If an unjust or indolent
                    man can be goaded by importunity into granting requests, much more will
                    assiduous prayer prevail with the Father in heaven;” in the first, “If the
                    fraudulent show forethought in providing for their earthly future, much more
                    should the children of light show forethought for their eternal future.”
                    Although it is quite possible that our Lord drew a contrast (with something of
                    irony) between the single-mindedness of earthly ambition anti the scattered
                    energies of those whose aim is righteousness, yet it is difficult to believe
                    that He uttered these parables in their present shape, or that they are entirely
                    free from misunderstanding. The last two of these three parables (as they stand)
                    seem at variance with His teaching in prayer, which bids us remember that the
                    Father knoweth what things we need before we ask them; and the right moral to be
                    drawn from the unjust judge would seem to be, “Although the unjust judge may be
                    won by importunity, do not suppose that importunity can prevail with the just
                    Judge.” It is to be observed, however, that the language and style of these
                    parables (differing from that of the Triple Tradition) make it somewhat
                    improbable that we have here in Luke’s narrative the exact words of Jesus, see
                    (36), (56), (62). As regards the great day and the coming of the Lord, Luke
                    appears to distinguish (more than Matthew and Mark) between the ultimate coming
                    and the fall of Jerusalem, which was to precede it. As Luke distributes the
                    discourses which Matthew connects with the twelve into two parts,—one connected
                    with the twelve and the other with the seventy,—so he distributes the discourse
                    on the coming (which Matthew reports asonecontinuousdiscour.se uttered at
                    Jerusalem) into two parts,—one uttered at Jerusalem, and dealing principally
                    with the fall of Jerusalem (xxi. 6-38), the other uttered on the way to
                    Jerusalem, and expressed in more general terms (xvii. 20-37). As a preparation
                    for the coming, Luke lays stress on constancy and directness of purpose. No man
                    who puts his hand on the plough must look back (30); better not to begin the
                    tower than leave the tower unfinished (53); remember Lot’s wife (61). The coming
                    is spoken of as possible at any moment—suddenly and without observation (60);
                    and the disciples are exhorted to wait as servants for their master, with their
                    loins girded (41 and 42), avoiding surfeit aud drunkenness (71). When the master
                    or king returns, ignorant disobedience will be less severely punished than the
                    disobedience of knowledge (42); and those who have not increased the “mina” or
                    pound intrusted to them, will be less severely punished than the rebels (65),
                    who will be slain.</p>
                <p>Luke (like Matthew and Mark) predicts a time of trouble; but he sees somewhat
                    clearly, beyond it, the dawn which is to precede the rise of the kingdom.
                    Destruction falls, not by chance, but on all that do not repent (45); all must
                    strive to enter the strait gate (47), for not those that were first called shall
                    enter in (52). Much more clearly than in Matthew and in Mark is the future fall
                    of Jerusalem described, as the result of a <hi rend="italic">siege</hi> and
                    capture; and the slaughter of the citizens, the scattering of the nation, and
                    trampling down of the city are mentioned, with details for which we vainly look
                    in the first two Gospels (59). It is not concealed that the disciples have much
                    tribulation in store, and that they must use all prudence to protect themselves
                    (74). Buta term is set for all these troubles; Luke (omitting the remarkable
                    saying of Matthew and Mark that the Son Himself knoweth not “the hour ”)
                    declares that the trampling down of Jerusalem will be only till “the times of
                    the Gentiles are fulfilled.” Then will come a time of “distress,” not, however,
                    now for Israel but for the Gentiles (69); and amidst convulsions of nature the
                    Son of Man will come. In the hope of this coming, the disciples are to lift up
                    their heads (70), remembering that not a hair of their heads will be injured
                    (68). Certainly the comparatively cheerful tone of the discourse on the coming,
                    combined with the joyful and triumphant tone of the first two chapters of Luke’s
                    Gospel, indicates an author writing at a time when the fall of Jerusalem was an
                    accepted fact, and the establishment of a new and spiritual Jerusalem recognized
                    as a sufficient consolation,—a time when the church, not yet troubled by
                    systematic persecution or by serious desertion (Keim, <hi rend="italic">Jesus
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">Nazara,</hi> Engl, ed., vol. i. p. 96), was still
                    sanguinely looking forward to the moment when the times of the Gentiles should
                    be fulfilled, and the Son of Man should suddenly come.</p>
                <p>The supernatural narratives peculiar to Luke, and found in the main body of his
                    treatise, are the miraculous draught of fishes, the raising of the widow’s son
                    at Nain, the healing of the woman bound by Satan, the cure of the dropsical man,
                    and the appearance of the angel strengthening Jesus,—(18), (25), (46), (49),
                    (75). The first two suggest to many minds a symbolical interpretation, and raise
                    the question whether they (and possibly some of the other miracles) may be
                    emblematical rather than historical. This question cannot suitably be discussed
                    in these pages; but one or two observations may be made. That Jesus wrought
                    instantaneous cures cannot be contradicted, being proved by the whole texture of
                    the Triple Tradition, as well as by the indirect testimony of Paul. That He also
                    had the power of raising the dead no Jew could well doubt or dispute. Elijah had
                    raised a child from the dead; still more notably Elisha, even when dead himself;
                    some (interpreting the prophet literally) said that Ezekiel (Ez. xxxvii. 7) had
                    done the same. But whatever the inferior prophets had done He who was at once
                    <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Prophet and Messiah could not fail to do. Still less
                    could heathen converts suppose that Jesus was inferior in power to Aesculapius.
                    It was therefore certain that, whether the traditions and books of the church
                    contained or omitted any record of a raising from the dead, the church would
                    believe from the first that Jesus possessed and employed this power. Different
                    readers will give different weight to the considerations for and against the
                    authenticity of Luke’s narrative of the raising of the widow’s son. Many will be
                    so far influenced by the extreme beauty of the story (and perhaps by the fact
                    that the custom of early burial among the Jews might reduce this, like the case
                    of Jairus’s daughter, to the level of natural though marvellous events) as to
                    believe that in it we have, not legend, but history; but no one who can weigh
                    evidence at all will maintain that the evidence for this miracle is equal to the
                    evidence for the <pb break="no"

                    principal miracle, the draught of fishes, is also considered by many to have
                    arisen from metaphor misunderstood. It is connected by Luke with the calling of
                    Simon Peter, an incident mentioned both by Matthew and by Mark: yet neither
                    Matthew nor Mark describes or gives the slightest hint of any such miracle in
                    connexion with the calling of Peter. In the next place, the metaphor describing
                    the apostles as fishermen and converts as fish, borrowed from Jeremiah perhaps
                    (xvi, 1 6), is applied by our Lord both to the apostles, as “fishers of men,”
                    and to the preaching of the gospel, which he describes as a “net” catching all
                    sorts of fish, bad and good. As the sea in the Old Testament is regarded a3 the
                    type of “sin,” everything favoured the addition and development of this
                    metaphor. Accordingly Philo <hi rend="italic">(Creation)</hi> describes fishes
                    as typical of the lowest kind of unenlightened existence; and Clement of
                    Alexandria addresses a hymn to Christ, as the fisher of men catching fishes with
                    the bait of eternal life from the hateful wave of the sea of vices <hi
                    rend="italic">(The Instructor,</hi> iii. 12). It is of course possible that the
                    developed symbolism which we find in Clement may have been entirely the effect,
                    and in no degree the cause, of the narrative in Luke v. G; and in any case the
                    full discussion of this question would require more space than the limits of
                    this article allow.</p>
                <p>Passing now from the main body of Luke’s Gospel, we come to the introduction,
                    which name we may give to the first two chapters, describing the birth and
                    childhood of Jesus, and the birth of His forerunner John, the son of Zacharias.
                    The doctrine of the miraculous incarnation, although distinctly stated in
                    Matthew’s Gospel, nevertheless required further confirmation. This doctrine
                    appears to have been spoken of from the earliest time, in language which might
                    give rise to different conclusions, according as it was interpreted literally or
                    metaphorically. For example, in the Apocalypse, “the Man Child who was to rule
                    over all nations with a rod of iron” is said to have been born of a woman who
                    was “clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a
                    crown of twelve stars,” who, after her son had been “caught up into heaven,”
                    fled “into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of God” (Rev. xii.
                    1-6). It seems certain that the writer represents by the woman, not the Virgin
                    Mary, but the Church—the Spiritual Israel; and in later times the letter of the
                    Church of Lyons (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">HE.,</hi> v. 1) speaks of the “Virgin
                    Mother” as having her children restored to her from the dead (meaning that the
                    church received back, as martyrs, those who had first recanted and then
                    renounced their recantation). Justin Martyr also protests that, even though he
                    should not be able to prove the pre-existence of Jesus, and even though it
                    should appear that He was born man of men, yet it would still be true that He is
                    Christ; “for,” adds he, in his dialogue with Trypho (chap, xlviii.; or, ed.
                    Morell, p. 267), “there are some, O my friends, of our race,<note

                    man of men, to whom I do not assent: nor would very many that have formed the
                    same opinions as I have say as they say, because we have been commanded by
                    Christ Himself not to follow the teachings of men, but the proclamations made by
                    the blessed prophets, and taught by Him.” The expression “not very many” (ού
                    πλαστοί) indicates that (a) even in Justin’s time (150 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.)</hi> a large though not very large number of Christians in Samaria or
                    Judaea believed that Christ was the son of Joseph, and that (0) a principal part
                    of the evidence for the contrary belief was based upon “the proclamations of the
                    prophets.” On the other side, what germs of wild and fanciful doctrine were in
                    the air may be inferred from the Gospel of the Hebrews, which will not allow
                    that Jesus had even a human mother, but speaks of His mother as being the Holy
                    Spirit (Kirchhofer, p. 451, and <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> p. 454). In
                    opposition to these divergent but heterodox beliefs, it became increasingly
                    necessary to maintain the doctrine that Jesus was at once a man, born of a human
                    mother, and divine, born of the heavenly Father; and this needed to be
                    reaffirmed now, during the prosperity of the church, in a somewhat less
                    apologetic tone than characterized the narrative of Matthew.</p>
                <p>V hen we speak of Luke’s “supplying the deficiencies of Matthew,” we must not be
                    supposed to mean that Luke had before him, or even knew the existence of,
                    Matthew’s Gospel. It has been shown above that he probably knew of no apostolic
                    written narrative (see p. 806 above). Though Matthew’s was probably written some
                    years before Luke’s Gospel, very many years might elapse before a treatise used
                    in one church or province might be recognized as authoritative beyond its
                    original boundaries. But by “supplying the deficiencies” we mean that the
                    conscience and faith of the church required in Luke’s time some further and more
                    vivid embodiment of the spiritual truth involved in the incarnation than was
                    contained in the unsupplemented narrative of Matthew.</p>
                <p>For example, it was not a sufficient argument against the Jewish slanderers who
                    asserted that Jesus was born of adultery, to say that Joseph, when purposing to
                    put Mary away, was warned by an angel in a dream to give up his purpose.
                    Something more positive, and in a higher tone, not a dream, but an angelic
                    visitation, was needed to confirm the divine origin of the Son of God. Moreover,
                    in order to set forth still more emphatically the subordination of John the
                    Baptist to the Lord, it was needed that the church should know that the prophet
                    (who himself also had his own birth heralded by angels) was from the first
                    acknowledged by his parents as the mere forerunner and messenger of Him that was
                    to come, to whom, even in his mother’s womb, the inferior prophet did obeisance.
                    Further, when Jesus was born, it was not enough that wise and learned men from
                    the East should come to worship Him. It was necessary to show that the poor and
                    simple toilers of the earth, typified by nightwatching shepherds, were also
                    privileged to behold His glory, and were the first to hear with the ear of faith
                    the divine message of the birth of the Redeemer.</p>
                <p>The testimony offered to the divine Son of David by Zacharias, who represents the
                    priestly tribe of Levi, and by Elisabeth, who was one of the daughters of
                    Aaron,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The importance
                    attached to the co-operation of Levi with the “Lion of the tribe of Judah” is
                    clearly seen in the very early (before 135 A.D.) apocryphal book entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs</hi> (Sinker, p. 104), in

                    Levi, as typical of Ilis twofold office of King and Priest.” The symbolism of
                    Origen, as regards Zacharias and Elisabeth is far more fanciful; he sees <hi

                    and the blessing of Simeon, and of Anna who is said to have been of the distant
                    tribe of Asher,—all this emblematic homage from Israel to its Redeemer would be
                    inadequately replaced by Matthew’s brief story of the flight into Egypt; and,
                    although refusing to feed a frivolous curiosity with frivolous legends on the
                    childhood of Jesus, the church would naturally cherish the story which told how
                    the youthful Redeemer, when missed by Mary and Joseph, was found in His Father’s
                    house. A narrative of this kind, not vulgar nor colloquial, and yet not too

                    Apocrypha, setting forth in the sacred vocabulary of the LXX. the earliest
                    Christian psalms and hymns that had been committed to writing, would be justly
                    felt by all the churches tfl&gt; tend to edification, and would soon find a
                    place in every assembly for Christian worship.</p>
                <p>But the resurrection, even more than the incarnation, required amplifications. If
                    Matthew had left gaps in his introduction, still more serious were the
                    deficiencies in his appendix to the traditional gospel. Although Mat thew had
                    added something to the mere suggestions of a resurrection contributed by Mark,
                    he had not added enough. More proof was required, tangible proof, if possible.
                    Tlιe women, it is true (according to the narrative of Mat. xxviii. 9), had held
                    Jesus by the feet, but the disciples themselves were not recorded to have done
                    so; and, besides, the increasing reverence of the church shrank from the thought
                    that the body of the risen Saviour had been actually touched (Jo. xx. 17), even
                    though He might have offered Himself to the touch of His disciples. As far
                    therefore as the evidence went, it was open to the Jewish sceptic to call the
                    manifestations of the Lord delusions, or at best visions, and to apply to them
                    the words of the angel (Tobit xii. 19): “All those days I did but make myself
                    visible unto you, <hi rend="italic">and did neither eat nor drink</hi>; but ye
                    beheld a vision.” Against so formidable an objection, no proof could better
                    commend itself to a close student of the LXX. (such as Luke assuredly was) than
                    a narrative describing how Jesus ate in the presence of His disciples (xxiv.
                    43). Again, whereas the conclusion of Matthew’s narrative leaves Jesus (except
                    by inference) still on earth, Luke omitting the apologetic details which had now
                    become unnecessary, or even liable to perversion (c. <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> 7., the Jewish slander that the Lord’s body had been stolen from the
                    sepulchre, and the fact that some of the eleven disciples “doubted” when they
                    saw the Lord, apparently for the last time, upon the mountain), describes how
                    Jesus was not parted from His disciples till He had produced complete conviction
                    in all of them, and had opened their minds to understand the scriptures.</p>
                <p>Still, even with these important additions, the appendix of Luke seemed to some,
                    and perhaps to Luke himself, incomplete; and, accordingly, either Luke himself,
                    or some early editor or very early scribes, inserted in the appendix several
                    further additions :—(1) that Peter saw the grave-clothes of Jesus lying in the
                    open tomb (xxiv. 12);<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It
                    is most improbable that this passage has been interpolated in Luke from the
                    Fourth Gospel (xx. 4-7); for the passage in the Fourth Gospel is fuller than in
                    Luke, and the tendency of copyists is rather to amplify than to curtail.
                    Besides, there are traces that Luke and John are both different versions of the
                    same tradition, differently understood.</p></note> (2) that Jesus proved His
                    identity to His disciples by showing them His hands and His feet; (3) that He
                    fed not only on the emblematic “fish” but also on the “honeycomb” (xxiv, 42);
                    and lastly, (4) that He ascended into heaven (xxiv. 51). Perhaps the same hand
                    added, in the account of the agony at Gethsemane, the description of the angel
                    from heaven who appeared strengthening Jesus, and of drops as it were of blood
                    falling from Him to the earth. It is by no means improbable that Luke himself
                    added these passages in a later edition of his own work, as authoritative
                    traditions which had subsequently become known to him; and two or three of them,
                    in somewhat different shapes, will present themselves to us subsequently in the

                    found in the appendix of Matthew. Again, unless they are additions (not forming
                    a part oi the first edition of the Gospel), it is hard to see why any of the
                    best MSS. should omit them, since they would recommend themselves to all readers
                    and copyists.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Language of the Original

                    Galilee, were (like the Welsh in the present day) bilingual; and the question
                    has therefore been raised whether our Lord, in His teaching, spoke Greek or

                    the illiterate, who would best understand the national dialect. But the names
                    Cephas, Boanerges, given by our Lord to His Galilean disciples, and the use of
                    Aramaic in His own prayer <hi rend="italic">(f Abba,</hi> Father”), and in His
                    last utterance (as recorded by Mat. xxvii. 46; Mk. xv. 34), indicate that both
                    for Himself and for His disciples Aramaic and not Greek was the natural tongue.
                    Although therefore it cannot be denied that Greek, even in Jerusalem (see Acts
                    xvii. 2, indicating that Greek would have been understood, though they preferred
                    “Hebrew”), was generally intelligible, yet the scanty evidence derivable from
                    our Lord’s words is that He habitually used Aramaic.</p>
                <p>The testimony of Josephus tends in the same direction. He, though a man of
                    education, composed certain books first in his own tongue (pref, to TK&lt;ιrs,
                    1). He also tells us that he found it a laborious task to render the history of
                    his country in Greek, “an alien and strange language” (pref, to <hi
                    rend="italic">Antign., T).</hi> It is to be presumed that he wrote in Aramaic
                    partly for his countrymen in Judaea; but he adds that it was also for the sake
                    of “Parthians, Babylonians, and remotest Arabians, and those of our nation

                    from the fact that Josephus thought it worth while to compose books first in
                    Aramaic the inference that a large number of readers in the East would be more

                    must be regarded as a piece of bombast. For is it credible that a Roman army
                    before a besieged city should have had with it no other interpreter besides one
                    recently captured prisoner? Nevertheless, this exaggeration may be taken as an
                    indication that the lower classes in Jerusalem could not, as a rule, speak
                    Greek; for Josephus assumes this, as a matter of course. Greek, of course, would
                    have been perfectly intelligible to any educated Roman if the deserters had been
                    able to speak it.</p></note></p>
                <p>But it has been thought that the use of the LXX. in our Lord’s quotations from
                    the Old Testament shows that He spoke Greek. The answer is—(1) Even if all the
                    quotations in the syuoptists from the Old Testament exactly agreed with the
                    LXX., the agreement would by no means prove that our Lord used the LXX.; for, in
                    translating Hebrew into Greek, the translator might naturally translate the
                    Hebrew quotations from the Old Testament into the corresponding LXX. version, to
                    which his readers were accustomed. This he might do, even though the LXX. did
                    not quite accurately represent the Hebrew; just as, in translating into English
                    a Latin book, with quotations from the Vulgate, we should naturally use our
                    English version, without considering whether the English exactly represented the
                    Latin. (2) But, in the second place, there is scarcely a single quotation<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An exact illustration may be
                    derived from the Latin translation, by Rufinus, of the <hi rend="italic"

                    Old Testament that exactly agrees with the LXX. when the LXX. differs from the
                    Hebrew; and many of the quotations differ slightly both from the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n835/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0835-0812"/> Hebrew and from the LXX., and even from the same
                    quotations as elsewhere occurring in the New Testament. And this is just what we
                    might expect. A Hellenist, translating a Hebrew document into Greek (in times
                    when reference to books was fur more cumbrous, and trust to memory far more
                    common, than with us) would be likely to be guided principally by his memory of
                    the LXX., but partly by the Hebrew before him. Hence would result translations
                    slightly varying both from the Hebrew and from the LXX., and from other
                    translations made by contemporaneous writers. This argument is, of course,
                    unaffected whether the translation was originally made in a document or, as is
                    more probable, in an oral tradition.</p>
                <p>Some confirmation of this hypothesis is derived from the fact that, although the
                    first book of Maccabees was without doubt originally written in Hebrew, yet the
                    quotations in it from Scripture are not translations from the Hebrew version. On
                    the contrary, if the, quotation in 1 Mac. vii. 17 from Ps. lxxviii. (lxxix.) 2,
                    3, be compared with the latter passage in the LXX., it will be seen at once that
                    the former, though not identical with the latter (nor with the Hebrew), could
                    not have been written but by a writer familiar with the LXX. version; compare
                    also 1 Mac. ix. 23 with the LXX. version of Ps. xci. (xcii.) 8. A similar
                    inference would seem to be justified by the statement (De Wette, quoted by
                    Roberts, <hi rend="italic">Discussions on the Gospels,</hi> p. 50) that Josephus
                    uses the LXX. more than the Hebrew text.</p>
                <p>Mistranslation of an Aramaic original may possibly explain in part some of the
                    confusions in the common tradition noted above (p. 791). It cannot of course be
                    denied that <hi rend="italic">some</hi> of these confusions imply a confusion of
                    Greek, not Hebrew, tradition <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    i. 5) are more easily explicable on the hypothesis of translation. Some of the
                    changes of words are also explicable thus, as may be illustrated by the Latin
                    version. Commenting on the text, “Domine, ne in <hi rend="italic">ira</hi> tua
                    arguas me, nec in <hi rend="italic">furore</hi> tuo corripias me,’’ Augustine
                    (Ziegler, p. 10) says that in some codices of the Latin translations “ira”
                    stands first, and “furor” second, in others “furor” first and “ira” second.

                <p>In the translations from Greek into the early Latin versions of the New
                    Testament, one very common difference is (besides divergent rendering of single
                    words) that one version uses participles where the other uses finite verbs, or
                    relative pronouns where the other uses co-ordinate conjunctions.<note

                <p>It will be seen at once that there is some similarity between the thread common
                    to these two Latin versions and the thread common to many passages in Matthew,
                    Mark, and Lιιke; though the resemblance between any two of the three synoptists
                    would generally exceed the resemblance of the two passages quoted above. In most
                    cases, however, the ante-Jerome versions (as represented by the Codex
                    Corbeiensis, Brixianus, Vercellensis, and Veronensis) agree much more closely
                    together, even more closely than any two of the synoptists agree together, and a
                    portion more closely than the three synoptists agree. On the whole, taking into
                    consideration the greater influence of differentiating causes in the earliest
                    times of the church than in the times when the ante-Jerome versions were
                    composed, we may fairly conclude that if in these later times so great a variety
                    could occur in the process of translation from Greek, the greater variety found
                    in the common tradition, as given by the three synoptists, might well be partly
                    explained in the same way, as originating in part from varieties of translation
                    from Hebrew. But then the questions arise—(a) Were the ante-Jerome versions
                    independent translations from the Greek text? <hi rend="italic">{b)</hi> Or were
                    they divergent corruptions of one original Latin translation from the Greek
                    text? (c) Or were they partly independent, but partly modified by some oral
                    tradition or “ecclesiastical use,” which diminished the divergence? On these
                    questions there is not at present a complete agreement. Wiseman maintained that
                    the second <hi rend="italic">{b)</hi> answer was the right one; but in a recent
                    work (quoted above) Ziegler (p. 123) maintains, with great probability, that the
                    third (c) is correct—viz., that the oral catechizing and preaching in the Latin
                    churches modified and assimilated translations otherwise independent. It is
                    extremely probable that the same hypothesis of combined causes—(1) translations
                    from Aramaic documents, (2) influence of oral Greek tradition—may explain much
                    of the agreement and variation in the passages common to the three
                    synoptists.</p>
                <p>The difference between the Triple Tradition of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and the
                    Double Tradition of Matthew and Luke will, at this stage, occur to us as an
                    important feature in our evidence. The widely different phenomena of the Double
                    and the Triple Traditions suggest different origins for the two traditions. Many
                    of the passages common to Matthew and Luke agree together far more closely than
                    even the Latin versions of the Greek Gospels. It would seem to follow that in
                    such cases Matthew and Luke used one and the same Greek document—a translation
                    of some Aramaic original—which document had not undergone much modification by
                    oral tradition before passing into the several treatises of Matthew and Luke. On
                    the other hand, the more varying language of the Triple Tradition, together with
                    the additions and omissions of the three writers, suggests (a) independent
                    translations of an Aramaic original; (δ) occasional resemblances suggested by
                    the general “usus ecclesiasticus”; (c) divergences created by the local “usus
                    ecclesiasticus,” or by the individual style of the editor or editors.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0836-0813"/> the synoptic Gospels makes it necessary to
                    distinguish carefully between the date of the compilation of each collective
                    treatise and the date of the composition of the several parts of which that
                    treatise may be composed. The original tradition has been shown to have existed
                    before any of the three synoptics; some common document of the words of the Lord
                    has been shown to have probably existed before Matthew’s or Luke’s narrative;
                    other documents or traditions might also possibly be shown to exist embedded in
                    each of the synoptists, and the date of each of these parts would be earlier
                    than the date of the whole. Therefore, even if the date of Matthew, or Mark, or
                    Luke could be exactly determined, it would by no means determine the date of the
                    traditions which they contain. It is even possible that a later Gospel may
                    retain in some cases an earlier version of the common tradition of the words of
                    the Lord, as we have seen in the case of Luke’s version of the Lord’s Prayer
                    (see p. 798 above).</p>
                <p>There is no internal evidence for exactly determining the date of any one of the
                    synoptics. The supposed references in Mark to the death of James, the capture of
                    Jerusalem, or any special earthquakes which might determine the date (Renan’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Évangiles,</hi> p. 123), are so shadowy as scarcely to deserve
                    consideration. The reference to the death of Zachariah the son of Baruch,
                    shortly before the capture of Jerusalem (Joseph., <hi rend="italic">B. J.,</hi>
                    iv. 5, 4), supposed to be found in Mat. xxiii. 35, is still more improbable.
                    Still the marked difference between the detailed prediction (in Lu. xxi. 18-25)
                    of the fall of the city and the scattering of the people, and the more general
                    predictions in corresponding passages in Matthew and Mark, indicates that Luke’s
                    description is modified by reminiscences of the siege of Jerusalem; while
                    Matthew’s and Mark’s accounts are not thus, or at all events not equally,
                    modified. It is an almost certain inference that Luke compiled after 70 A.D. As
                    regards Matthew and Mark inferences cannot be drawn with equal certainty; for of
                    course a compiler may compile at a late date, and yet preserve traditions in
                    their earliest shape; but it is at least a reasonable inference that the
                    compilers of the First and Second Gospels wrote before Luke; and there is a
                    balance of probability in favour of the supposition that they wrote before the
                    fall of Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>Coming to more general evidence, we find (see p. 791) that (1) Mark, at least in
                    many passages, includes the original tradition from which both Matthew and Luke
                    borrowed; (2) his language, less polished than that of Matthew and Luke, appears
                    more natural for an earlier Gospel in the first and rudest age of the church;
                    (3) Mark’s version of the tradition contains many expressions which might
                    naturally be considered “stumbling-blocks,” and which, in fact, were rejected or
                    not inserted in the other Gospels; (4) the omission of all account of the
                    manifestations of Jesus after the resurrection indicates a very early date; and
                    though it may be said that this omission arises from the fact that the Second
                    Gospel was accidentally left incomplete, yet this answer will not account for
                    the omission of the genealogies, and of all account of the birth and infancy of
                    Jesus; (5) the interpolated appendix describing the resurrection of Jesus,
                    quoted as it is by Irenaeus, shows that even in the time of Irenaeus (170 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> the Gospel had been long enough in use to admit of
                    widespread interpolations. All these facts lead to the inference that Mark was
                    compiled earlier than any of the other Gospels, and probably some time before 70
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> It is almost impossible to fix any date (worth
                    stating) after which the compilation must have taken place. Those who accept as
                    literally true Mark’s accounts of the feeding of the four thousand and five
                    thousand, the walking on the waves, and the exorcism of the Gadarene, may
                    naturally carry back his history to the first years of the Galilean church; and
                    even those who interpret these accounts symbolically are ready to admit that a
                    very short space of time is often quite sufficient, by misunderstanding and
                    accretion, to erect supernatural narratives on a basis of natural and symbolic
                    story. But any approximation to a date <hi rend="italic">after</hi> which the
                    Gospel was compiled must be deferred till we consider the external evidence.</p>
                <p>The narrative of Matthew does not leave uβ quite so uncertain. The mention of
                    “the Jews,” which is so frequent in the Fourth Gospel, is justly regarded as a.
                    proof that the author was writing in times when the Christian church was
                    regarded as definitely and antagonistically separated from the Jewish nation. In
                    the synoptists it is the “Pharisees,” not the “Jews,” who are in conflict with
                    Jesus. But in his account of the resurrection Matthew (xxviii. 15) uses the word
                    in this antagonistic sense. Further, he twice (xxvii. 8; xxviii. 15) uses the
                    expression “even to this day,” of events occurring shortly before or after the
                    death of Jesus,—thereby showing that a long interval had occurred between the
                    death of Jesus and the compilation of the narrative. The tone of the Gospel, as
                    compared with Luke, indicates a period when the Jews still existed as a nation,
                    and when the abrogation of the law and the destruction of the temple were not
                    yet accepted as recognized facts; but the number of parables upon the end of the
                    w orld and the judgment, the tendency to dwell on exclusion rather than
                    inclusion, on the “many” that are shut out rather than on the “few” that are
                    chosen, and the atmosphere of gloom generally characterizing the Gospel, point
                    perhaps to the crisis immediately preceding the siege of Jerusalem. The
                    additions concerning the birth and incarnation may seem to imply a later date;
                    but when we reflect how natural it was that in very early times the church
                    should attach importance to these subjects, the wonder will be, not that these
                    narratives were written so soon, but that they were deferred to so late a period
                    as forty years after our Lord’s death. It is also extremely remarkable—and a
                    mark of early date as compared with Luke—that even in this developed form of the
                    Gospel the accounts of manifestation of our Lord after His resurrection should
                    be so scanty, doubtful, and vague.</p>
                <p>In Luke the signs of later date abound :—(1) the preexistence and implied failure
                    of many “attempts” to set forth continuous narratives of the things “surely
                    believed (2) the mention of the “tradition” of the eye-witnesses and ministers
                    of the word as past, not as present (7rαpeδ0σαι-)∙ (i. 2); (3) the dedication of
                    the Gospel to a man of rank (fictitious or otherwise), who is supposed to have
                    been “catechized” in Christian truth; (4) the attempt at literary style and at
                    improvement of the “usus ecclesiasticus” of the common tradition; (5) the
                    composition of something like the commencement of a Christian hymno-l°gy; (θ)
                    <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> he development of the genealogy and the higher
                    tone of the narrative of the incarnation; (7) the insertion of many passages
                    mentioning our Lord as <hi rend="italic">o κνpι,ος,</hi> not in address, but in
                    narrative; (8) the distinction, more sharply drawn, between the fall of
                    Jerusalem and the final coming; (9) the detailed prediction of the fall of
                    Jerusalem, implying reminiscences of its fulfilment; (10) the very great
                    development of the manifestations of Jesus after the resurrection, The inference
                    from all this evidence would be that Luke was not written till about 80 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a d.</hi> at earliest. If it could be further demonstrated that
                    Luke used any Greek Apocryphal book (Judith, for example), and if it could be
                    shown that the book in question was written after a certain date (Renan suggests
                    80 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> for the date of the book of Judith), it might
                    be necessary to place Luke much later; but no such demonstration has been
                    hitherto produced.</p>

                <p>The composite nature of the synoptic Gospels will affect the inferences we shall
                    draw from early quotations of passages found in them, where the authors of the
                    Gospels are not expressly mentioned. If, for example, we find in Justin a
                    passage (quoted as a saying of the Lord) which is found both in Matthew and
                    Luke, Justin may indeed have quoted it from Matthew or from Luke; but it is also
                    possible that he may have quoted it neither from Matthew nor from Luke, but
                    either (a) from the common source whence Matthew and Luke derived the passage,
                    or (6) from some other book or tradition, which, like Matthew and Luke, included
                    the passage in its collection or compilation. The same applies to a quotation
                    from the Triple Tradition. It may be quoted from Matthew or from Mark or from
                    Luke; but it is also possible that it may be drawn from none of these, but from
                    the common tradition itself, or from some other treatise based on the Triple
                    Tradition.</p>
                <p>Taking the evidence chronologically, we come first to the testimony of Paul, who,
                    in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, says (1 Cor. xi. 23), “I received from
                    the Lord that which also I delivered to you and then follows a description of
                    the institution of the Lord’s Supper, differing materially from Matthew and
                    Mark, and agreeing in the main with Luke, except that Paul repeats twice the
                    command, “Do this in remembrance of Me.” It would seem unreasonable and scarcely
                    reverent to suppose that a special revelation revealed to Paul the exact words
                    of the institution; but comparing the passage with Gal. i. 9, 12, we see that
                    Paul merely says here about this part of his teaching what in Gal. i. 9, 12 he
                    says about the whole of it, viz., that he received it from the Lord and not from
                    man. From Ananias, or from other elders of the church, he may have received the
                    words of oral tradition of the church; but for the meaning and spiritual force
                    of it, and the application of each part of it to the work of redemption, he was
                    indebted, not to the elders of the church in Damascus, but to the revelations
                    given to him in the solitude of Arabia. The words of Paul, therefore, do not
                    exclude (and the facts render probable) the use of oral tradition in this
                    passage. This being so, it may seem remarkable that Paul follows the tradition
                    contained in the latest of the three Gospels. It can hardly be that Luke has
                    here preserved the earliest tradition. The insertion of “new” before “testament”
                    (not inserted in the correct text of Matthew and Mark), and the ampler narrative
                    of Luke indicate a later, not an earlier, shape of the tradition. The word
                    “testament” appears to have been used by our Lord in the ordinary sense of
                    “will” and “testament,” indicating that in that funeral feast He was <hi

                    that probably, by the time of the composition of the <hi rend="italic">

                    had been taken into Hebrew in the sense of “will” (Buxtorf, <hi rend="italic">
                    Lex. Ra1Λ.</hi> s.v.). It would seem to follow that long before that date, the
                    word <hi rend="italic"> διαθήκη</hi> was in regular use, in Hebraic Greek, to
                    render the meaning “will” or “testament,’’although of course it also represents
                    (and very much more frequently, owing to the more frequent repetition of the
                    thought in the New Testament) the meaning “covenant.”</p></note> The insertion
                    of “new,” by a sort of play upon the double meaning of the word “testament,”
                    introduces the sense of “covenant,” and therewith a contrast between the old and
                    the new covenants. But this suggestive thought (highly characteristic of Paul)
                    seems more likely to have been added to the original in process of explanation,
                    than to have been dropped by Matthew and Mark through neglect, or discarded
                    owing to difficulty. The probable solution therefore would seem to be that Luke
                    has embodied, not the earliest tradition, but the later Pauline shape of the
                    tradition. We have here therefore not Paul supporting the tradition of Luke, but
                    Luke (in all probability) borrowing from Paul.<note anchored="true"

                    tradition of Luke.</p></note> The only other passage in which Paul (in the Acts)
                    quotes a saying of Jesus contains (Acts XX. 35) words not found in any of our
                    Gospels, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”</p>
                <p>The Second Epistle of Peter (2 Pet. i. 17) contains a reference (apparently) to
                    the transfiguration, of which the writer speaks as an eye-witness. But this
                    testimony, most important if genuine, is almost certainly spurious. The mention
                    of the mount of transfiguration as “the Holy Mount,” and of Paul’s epistles as
                    “scriptures,” would in itself suggest a late date; and Canon Westcott <hi
                    rend="italic">{Gospels,</hi> p. 175) justly says that “the comparative
                    elaborateness of the description (of the transfiguration) seems to offer an
                    instinctive contrast to the simplicity of the earlier Gospel.” External evidence
                    is also against the genuineness of this epistle. Up to the times of Clement of
                    Alexandria “no trace has been found” of its existence (Westcott, <hi
                    rend="italic">Canon,</hi> ρ. 349); and neither Origen nor Eusebius accepts it as
                    canonical. To obtain a complete idea of the judgment of the church upon the
                    canon, we must combine (Westcott, <hi rend="italic">Canon,</hi> p. 264) the two
                    canons of the East and West; by doing this “we obtain, <hi rend="italic">with,
                    one exception,</hi> a perfect New Testament without the admixture ot any foreign
                    element.” That “exception” is the Second Epistle of Peter. The only importance
                    to be attached therefore to the testimony of an epistle thus rejected by the
                    general consent of the early church is that which attaches itself to an early
                    literary fabrication composed so early as to have found a place in our canon.
                    Such a composition (mentioning Paul’s letters as “scriptures ) cannot have been
                    written before the beginning of the second century; yet we find that, even at
                    that date, the common tradition is quoted most inexactly. The voice from heaven,
                    as given by the author of the spurious epistle, is, <hi rend="superscript">

                    both omit <hi rend="italic">ευδόκησα.</hi> The inaccuracy is the more serious
                    because, in describing the baptism of Jesus, Matthew (iii. 17) speaks of a voice
                    from heaven which almost exactly agrees with the words in the Epistle, omitting
                    the words <hi rend="italic">ακούετε αυτοί).</hi> In these circumstances it is
                    impossible to say that the author of this spurious Epistle had Matthew before
                    him. Much more probably he was quoting from memory, or from some document
                    differing from any of our synoptic Gospels.</p>
                <p>The next witness is Clement of Rome, whose Epistle to the Corinthians, probably
                    written in or soon after 95 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> (Lightfoot’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Clement of Rome,</hi> Appendix, p. 267), contains three passages
                    which may indicate a use of our Gospels. (1) In chap, xiii. he blends together
                    (Sunday, <hi rend="italic">The Gospels vn the Second Century,</hi> p. 921)
                    passages common to Matthew (v. 7; vi. 14; vii. 12; vii. 2), Mark (iv. 24; xi,
                    25), and Luke (vi. 36, 37, 31, 38, 37) in a terse, antithetical, and uniform
                    style, inserting the words, <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> ∩s <hi rend="italic"
                    >χρηστεύεσθε</hi><hi rend="italic">oυτωs</hi><hi rend="italic">χρηστευθησεται
                    ΰμίν.</hi> Dr Lightfoot has pointed out that the looseness of this quotation
                    does not exceed the looseness with which (chap. 12) the same author quotes the
                    narrative of Rahab, and therefore it is quite possible that here, as there,
                    Clement may be simply quoting from memory with no other documents than Matthew
                    and Luke in his mind; but to many the “roundness, compactness, and balance of
                    style” which Dr Sanday notices in the quotation will make it probable that
                    Clement was quoting, not perhaps from any other document (for else how is it
                    that no trace remains of a documentary version of the word of the Lord so
                    “rounded and compact” in style, and used 95 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> by so
                    eminent a man as demerit of Rome in writing to the church of Corinth ?), but
                    with some tradition in his memory (which had perhaps served the purpose of
                    preachers, teachers, and catechists in the Roman Church), blending and
                    condensing the versions of Matthew and Luke into a form adapted for the oral
                    instruction of converts. (2) In another passage (chap, xxvi.) Clement combines
                    Mat. xviii. 6 (Mk. ix. 42; Lιι. xvii. 1, 2) and Matt, xxvi. 24 (Mk. xiv. 21; Lu.
                    xxii. 22) in a manner which suggests quoting from memory. (3) A third passage
                    (Sanday, p. 70) contains a quotation from Isaiah (xxix. 13) differing from the
                    Hebrew and from the similar LXX. (which is, e'77iift <hi rend="italic">μoι

                    found in Matt. XV. 8 and Mk. vii. 6 (except that they read <hi rend="italic"
                    >a∙πεχει</hi> for <hi rend="italic">aτrεστιv).</hi> The inference has been drawn
                    that Clement is quoting frans, our Gospels. But this is not the only passage
                    where quotations from the Old Testament in the New appear to have been
                    influenced by an “ecclesiastical use,” arising in some cases from a desire to
                    make the application closer (compare Jo. xix. 37 with the LX2L version of Zech.
                    xii. 10, and note that this version is exactly quoted by Justin, and allusively
                    by the author of the Apocalypse, i. 7), in part from abridgment or other causes
                    (compare Mat. iii. 3; Mk. i. 3; Lu. iii, 4 with Isa. xl. 3). Therefore, even
                    though the citation in Clement exactly coincided with the citation in Mark and
                    Matthew, it would not follow that Clement cited it from them; and as the
                    quotation is not identical, the probability is that it is quoted by Clement,
                    with a slight alteration, from memory of “ecclesiastical use.” There is also in
                    chap ii. (“more gladly giving than receiving”) an allusion to the saying of
                    Jesus mentioned in Acts XX. 35. Our conclusion is—(a) that Clement of Rome,
                    about 95 A.n., is proved to have a knowledge of the several scattered sentences
                    in our common tradition which he quotes as “words of the Lord,” but very loosely
                    and freely; (δ) that his quotation of the Old Testament appears on one occasion
                    to be influenced by Christian “ecclesiastical use”; (c) that he uses (but
                    whether as a quotation or not we have no means of determining) some words not
                    found in our Gospels, which words are attributed to Jesus by the author of the
                    Acts of the Apostles.</p>

                <p>Early in the second century we for the first time meet with a quotation from the
                    addition to the common tradition which are peculiar to Matthew. The Curetonian
                    or shorter version of the epistles of Ignatius (107 or 115 A.l&gt;.) uses Matt.
                    x. 16 almost <hi rend="italic">verbatim,</hi> and possibly refers (Sanday, p.
                    79) to the star of Matthew (chap, ii.). The Vossian or longer version of the
                    Ignatian epistles (which may be accepted as testimony for about 150 A. D. )
                    contains, besides an ample and somewhat exaggerated reference to the star in
                    Matt, ii., three or four (Westcott, <hi rend="italic">Canon,</hi> p. 60) short
                    but striking phrases peculiar to Matthew. But none of these passages have marks
                    of quotation, the words of Matthew being in each case embedded in the writer's
                    own words. It is remarkable that the only words of the Lord expressly quoted by
                    Ignatius are words not found in any of our synoptic writers: “And when He came
                    to those about (πepi) Peter, He said to them, Take, handle Me, and see that I am
                    not a bodiless demon.” These words, although they have some likeness (the word
                    <hi rend="italic">ψηλaφησaτe</hi> is in both) to Lu. xxiv. 39, are expressly
                    said by Eusebius to be derived from some source unknown to him. and by Jerome to
                    be derived from a Gospel which he had translated (from Hebrew), and which was
                    read in his time by the Nazarenes (Kirchhofer, p. 449); and, according to
                    Origen, the passage occurred in the teaching of Peter. It is, of course,
                    impossible for us, upon this evidence, to determine whether Ignatius quoted from
                    the Nazarene gospel, or from the teaching of Peter, or from some other document
                    or tradition embodied before or after in both those documents. Our conclusion is
                    that, by the middle of the second century, the writer of the Vossian version of
                    the Ignatian epistles was familiar with the Gospel of Matthew, but that he also
                    used other sources (not known to us) when quoting the words of the Lord in
                    support of the material resurrection of Jesus.</p>
                <p>In the Epistles of Barnabas (100-125 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> is found
                    (chap. iv.) the first apparent reference (if we except the reference in 2 Pet.
                    iii. 16) to any passage of the New Testament as “written”: “Let us beware lest
                    we be found, as it is written, many called, but few chosen/' words almost
                    exactly found in Matt, xxii. 14 alone (probably interpolated in Matt. xx. 16).
                    There is also an allusive quotation of the words in Matt. ix. 13; Mk. ii. 17;
                    Lu. v. 32: “I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.” The only words
                    expressly assigned to Jesus (chap, vii.) are not found in our Gospels: “Even so,
                    saith He, they that would see Me and touch My kingdom, must take Me, through
                    persecution and suffering.” It is most unfortunate that the inexactness of the
                    verifiable quotations in this epistle prevents us from laying much stress upon
                    the author’s statement as to the source of those which are unverifiable. For
                    example, in chap, xvi., the author has, “The scripture saith, And it shall come
                    to pass in the last days, that the Lord will deliver up the sheep ot His
                    pasture, and their sheepfold and tower to destruction. And it so happened as the
                    Lord had spoken.” But we know of no “scripture” containing these words; and the
                    probability is that the author was quoting from memory and erroneously, as when
                    (chap, v.) he combines Isa. iii. 9 and Wisdom ii. 12, as follows: “The <hi
                    rend="italic">prophet</hi> speaks against Israel, Woe to their soul because they
                    have counselled an evil counsel against themselves, saying, Let us bind the Just
                    One, because He is displeasingto us.” Our conclusion is that, if Barnabas is
                    deceived by his memory in attributing one passage to “writing” or “scripture,”
                    he may be deceived about another, and that we consequently cannot feel sure that
                    he is quoting Matt, xxii. 14 from a document and not from memory of oral
                    tradition. But (a) that the author was acquainted with passages found in Matthew
                    is certain; and (ά) it is also certain and noteworthy that the only words of the
                    Lord quoted by him are quoted from sources not known to us,</p>
                <p>Polycarp (born about 69 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> died 155 or 156) quotes
                    (chap, ii. ) sentences from the Sermon on the Mount, similar to those quoted by
                    Clement above, with the preface, “remembering those things which the Lord said
                    (while) teaching, Judge not,” &amp;c. The quotation, like Clement’s, is
                    antithetical and compressed, but neither in order nor in words agrees so far
                    with Clement’s as to make it in the least degree probable that Polycarp and
                    Clement are quoting from a written version differing from our synoptics. There
                    is also a quotation from Mat. xxvi. 41 and Mk. xiv. 38, and a reference to Mat.
                    vi. 13, “Asking the all-beholding God not to lead us into temptation; even as
                    the Lord said, The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak,” Two other
                    coincidences (chap. v. and vi.) seem to refer to Mat. xx. 28; Mat. ix. 35; Mat.
                    vi. 12, 14; Lu. xi. 4. There are no supposed allusions to apocryphal writings in
                    Polycarp (Westcott, <hi rend="italic">Canon,</hi> p. 61). It will be seen from
                    what has been said above that there is nothing remarkable in the great
                    variations with which the “Sermon on the Mount” was taught and quoted among the
                    Christians in the first century. Like the “Lord's Prayer,” it has not a literary
                    but a practical interest; and being much used in many different churches from
                    the earliest times, it may naturally have assumed many different shapes
                    serviceable for catechists. and preachers. This consideration (and the
                    possibilities of variation arising from translation) may easily account for the
                    variation between Clement and Polycarp, without necessitating or justifying,
                    even as a working hypothesis, the supposition that Clement or Polycarp, in
                    quoting the “Sermon on the Mount,” quoted from other documents than our existing
                    Gospels.</p>
                <p>The “Shepherd” of Hennas, written about 135-40 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi>
                    “contains no distinct traces of any writing of Old or New Testament” (Sanday,
                    <hi rend="italic">Gospels'}.</hi> This is worth bearing in mind, as a warning
                    that the nature of the subject will greatly affect the number of quotations from
                    the scriptures in any early books. The allegorical nature of the “Shepherd,”
                    intended more as a stimulating tale than as a polemical or hortatory discourse,
                    dispenses with scriptural illustrations; and in the same way Justin, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Second Apology,</hi> refrains from quoting the scriptures, while
                    in his other works he multiplies quotations or references. In appealing to the
                    heathen, Justin “quotes the scriptures only when he must speak of things beyond
                    the range of common history, preferring elsewhere to appeal to external
                    documents such as the enrolment of Quirinus and the Acts of Pilate* (Westcott,
                    <hi rend="italic">Canon,</hi> p. 110).</p>
                <p>Papias, who wrote about 130 140 A.D., composed five books, entitled “Exposition
                    (eξη7⅛&lt;τeα&gt;s) of the Oracles <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of the Lord.”
                    It is (apparently) in an introduction to this work that he speaks (Euseb., iii.
                    39) of traditions gathered from different sources: “But I will not shrink from
                    placing along with my interpretations (∈pμηreiαιs) as many (traditions) as at
                    any time I learned well, and well stored up in memory from the elders.” The noun
                    “interpretations” (∈pμηi'eiα <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> s) may receive some
                    light from Papias’s own use of the words <hi rend="italic">lpμi}νeυ∙rm</hi> and
                    epμηr∈υω, as quoted in the same chapter of Eusebius. “Mark,” he says, “was the
                    interpreter of Peter <hi rend="italic">(lpμηveυπηs</hi> ∏eτρou <hi rend="italic"
                    >yevopevos) ι</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">'</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    2</hi> again, “Matthew wrote his scriptures <hi rend="italic">{</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">oyιa}</hi> in Hebrew, and each man
                    interpreted them (⅞ρ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> uηreaσe) as he best could.” So
                    Eusebius himself in the preceding chapter tells us that some believe Clement to
                    have “interpreted” (eρaηveD&lt;rαι) Paul’s (Hebrew) Epistle to the Hebrews into
                    Greek. Our conclusion would be that the word <hi rend="italic">ιpμηvdaι</hi> may
                    here mean something more than mere “commentary”; it may imply that he, as others
                    had done, wrote an interpretation of the “Logia,” accompanied by comments and by
                    supplementary traditions. At all events he does not speak of any one Greek
                    “interpretation” of Matthew as being as yet paramount and authoritative, so as
                    to exclude the necessity of further “interpretations.” Of Mark he speaks (in the
                    person of “the elder”) almost apologetically, implying that his narrative had
                    been censured for its incompleteness and unpolished style; and he defends it by
                    quoting a tradition from “the elder” (apparently, John the elder) thus :— “Mark,
                    having become Peter’s interpreter, wrote down accurately all that he
                    remembered—not, however, in order—both the words and deeds of Christ. For he
                    neither heard the Lord, nor attached himself to Him, but later on, as I said,
                    attached himself to Peter; who used to adapt his lessons to the needs of the
                    occasion, but not as though he were composing a connected treatise of the
                    discourses (λ07ωr, v. r. <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">oyiωv)</hi>
                    of the Lord: so that Mark committed no error in writing down some matters just
                    as he remembered them (cbr∈- <hi rend="italic">μrημ0veυσe}.</hi> For one object
                    was in his thoughts <hi rend="italic">(ιvbs yap iπoιdlτo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >•πρόνοιαν}</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> to make no omissions and no false
                    statements in what he heard.”</p>
                <p>Much of this exactly applies to our Mark. If we desire to know what is meant by
                    Mark’s not writing “in order,” we have only to turn to Luke, who made it his
                    object to write “in order,” and whose arrangement, chronologically as well as
                    artistically, differs from Mark. It is true that we may be disposed to think
                    Mark’s “order” not inferior to Luke’s; but the fact is indisputable that Luke
                    attempted to write “in order,” and that his “order” diffeιs considerably from
                    that of Mark, who manifests no purpose except the desire to put down what he
                    knew as he remembered it. It has been shown above (see p. 802) that Mark’s
                    Gospel is rather a collection of anecdotes than a connected narrative; and of
                    such a collection it would be natural to say that it was not written as an
                    orderly narrative. To the single evidence of Papias, derived from an unknown
                    elder, not much importance can be attached; and it is very doubtful whether the
                    most searching investigations will ever determine with certainty the name of the
                    author or authors of any one of the synoptic Gospels. But at all events, it is
                    only reasonable to admit that the hypothesis of “notes” taken from oral
                    discourses, and serving as the groundwork for the Second Gospel, would explain
                    many of its phenomena. If these oral discourses embodied the early common Greek
                    tradition, it would be easy to see how the First and Third Gospels came to
                    resemble the Second Gospel, although all three Gospels are mutually independent.
                    As regards the Firat Gospel, it has been shown above that internal evidence is
                    against -the theory of a very early authorship; and we <hi rend="superscript">

                    considerationis, not whether the statements of Papias are correct, but what
                    Papias meant when he spoke of Mark as epμrj ∣ 'eυτ⅛v, and of himself as writing

                <p>must add that it exhibits no signs that the portion before the call of Matthew
                    was written from hearsay, and that after the call of Matthew by an eye-witness.
                    But there seems the following strong argument in favour of the tradition of
                    Papias as to the authorship of Matthew: if there was no basis for it, if it was
                    a mere fiction or guess, why not select, as the author, some more distinguished
                    apostle, Peter, John, or James? This argument is neutralized by the following
                    consideration. The apostles (Acts iv. 13) were known in the earliest days to
                    have been unlearned and ignorant men; and although the Holy Spirit gave them
                    power to speak and teach, it was less natural that they should be inspired with
                    power to write and to compose connected treatises. But Matthew being a publican,
                    and necessarily ready with his pen, might naturally be supposed in the
                    post-apostolic generation to be a skilful writer; so that if an early tradition
                    with general apostolic authority was committed to writing, the church would
                    naturally select Matthew the publican and ready writer as the special author of
                    it. N evertheless, the testimony of Papias is important as attesting the belief
                    (1) in a Hebrew origin for the Logia or the Gospel scriptures, and (2) in an
                    early multiplicity of “interpretations.”</p>
                <p>The apologetic tone in which Papias introduces the traditions, which he “will not
                    shrink from placing along with the interpretations” of the scriptures, indicates
                    that the written scriptures were gradually subordinating tradition. He nowhere
                    expresses au opinion that the Logia are unauthoritative, but he implies that
                    they require “interpretation,” and adds (almost as though it were an
                    idiosyncrasy) that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> set a great store on supplementary
                    tradition from the sources nearest to the truth,—not only taking pleasure in
                    those who taught the commandments that came from the Lord (who was) the very
                    truth (i.e., the disciples of the Lord), but also questioning any who had
                    “attached themselves to the elders,” whom he used to examine closely on the
                    utterances of Andrew, Peter, Philip, Thomas, James, John, Matthew, or any other
                    of the disciples of the Lord, and on the sayings of Aristion and the elder John,
                    the disciples of the Lord.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    indicates that Andrew, Peter, John the apostle, Matthew, and all the rest of the
                    apostles were dead at the time “when Papias began his investigations” (westcott,
                    <hi rend="italic"> Canon,</hi> p. 69). Now, John the apostle is supposed to have
                    died at a very advanced age, about 98 <hi rend="smallcaps"> a.».,</hi> and
                    Papias (Lightfoot, <hi rend="italic"> Contemporary Heriew,</hi> May 1875) to
                    have been born about 60-70 A.D., and to have written (westcott, <hi
                    rend="italic"> ut sup.)</hi> about 140-150 <hi rend="smallcaps"> a.d.</hi> we
                    have therefore to suppose on this hypothesis (a) that Papias did not “begin his
                    investigations” till he was twentyeight or thirty-eight years old (i.e., not
                    till seven or seventeen years after he had attained to manhood), although the
                    apostle John was living all that time in his immediate neighbourhood; (6) that
                    two personal disciples of Jesus outlived the aged apostle John for a period long
                    enough to enable Papias to conduct a systematic investigation into their
                    traditions during their lifetime. “Improbable” is too mild a word for such a
                    hypothesis. It seems very much more probable that <hi rend="italic">
                    λέγουσιν</hi> is simply the graphic present used for variety. Papias desires to
                    make a distinction between the <hi rend="italic"> dicta of</hi> the apostles and
                    the less authoritative utterances of Aristion and John the elder, who were not
                    apostles. For this purpose he not only (1) mentions them separately, but also
                    (2) varies the construction, changing <hi rend="italic"> τi</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic"> ä</hi> τe, and (3) <hi rend="italic"> είπε</hi> into <hi

                    St John alone, where <hi rend="italic"> είπε</hi> and <hi rend="italic">
                    λέγει</hi> are used indifferently and alternately for the mere purpose of
                    variety; see John iv. 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17 <hi rend="italic"> (bis),</hi> and

                    τί ποτέ λέγει,</hi> “I was in doubt as to what (the oracle) meant.” It is true
                    that Eusebius, though he denies Irenaeus’s assertion that Papias was a hearer of
                    John the apostle, maintained that Papias heard John the elder. But he appears to
                    have no evidence for this statement except the sentence just quoted, and the
                    fact that Papias set down certain traditions of John the elder, mentioning him
                    by name. His words are: <hi rend="italic"> “</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">
                    Aρισ-τιωvoς</hi><hi rend="italic"> δε και του πρεσβυτέρου Ίωάννου αύτηκοον

                    παραδόσεις.</hi> This is quite insufficient in face of the great difficulties in
                    such a supposition. The only tradition of an elder quoted by Eusebius from
                    Papias with any words of preface begins thus: “The elder said this also.” Such a
                    preface is quite consistent with the supposition that Papias had heard the
                    tradition, not from the elder himself, but from one who had attached himself to
                    the elder <hi rend="italic"> (παρηκολουθηκώς τώ πρεσβυτέριο)</hi>; and the
                    above-quoted sentence of Papias itself better suits such a supposition, for the
                    “cross-examining of those who had attached themselves to the elders” naturally
                    applies to <hi rend="italic"> all</hi> the names that follow, and more
                    especially to John, since he is expressly included in the class of “elders.” “I
                    used to cross-examine any that came in my way who had attached themselves to the
                    elders (asking them), what said Andrew, . . . and about the sayings of Aristion
                    and John the elder;” surely the natural inference is that Aristion and John are
                    included in the “elders.” If this be so, every difficulty vanishes. Papias,
                    though placed before Polycarp by Eusebius, may have been naturally so placed
                    because he died before the aged Polycarp, so that his work fell in a period
                    preceding Polycarp; but he may have been born about the same time or later, say
                    80 <hi rend="smallcaps"> a.d.</hi> In that case the last of the apostles would
                    have passed away before I ’ apias was nineteen; and when Papias began his
                    investigations he would necessarily have to rely on the pupils of the elders,
                    since the elders themselves, whether apostles, as Andrew and Peter, or mere
                    elders, as Aristion and John, had all passed away. If, however, it should appear
                    after all that Papias did hear John the elder, it follows that, when Irenaeus
                    described Papias as “the hearer of John,” he either (1) meant John the elder, or
                    (2) confused John the elder with John the apostle. In either case most important
                    consequences might follow, bearing upon the authorship of the Fourth Gospel. For
                    it follows that, if here, then on other occasions, when speaking of the
                    authorship of the Fourth Gospel, Irenaeus either (1) may have meant John the
                    elder where we at present suppose him to mean John the apostle, or (2) may have
                    confused John the elder with John the apostle.</p></note></p>
                <p>It must be added that Papias, besides recording the raising of a dead man by
                    Philip, and the drinking of poison without injury by Justus surnamed Barsabas,
                    is said by Eusebius to have narrated several “strange parables and teachings of
                    the Saviour,” and other fabulous matters, originating from a literal
                    understanding of figurative expressions. He also published “a story about a
                    woman accused in the presence of the Lord for many sins, which is contained in
                    the Gospel according to the Hebrews” (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">ib.)</hi> It has
                    been demonstrated by Dr Lightfoot that Eusebius, in treating of the disputed and
                    undisputed writings of the earliest times, adopted one course for the former and
                    another for the latter. (1) As to the disputed books, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >antilegomcna,</hi> he pledged himself to “record when any ancient writer
                    employs any book belonging to their class;” but (2) as regards the undisputed
                    canonical books, he only professes to mention them, “when such a writer has
                    something to tell about them” (τivα <hi rend="italic">των</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >εvδιaθi]κωv ε'iρητaι) Contemporary Rcvieιv,</hi> Jan. 1875. We are not
                    therefore to infer from the silence of Eusebius that Papias did not know or
                    quote the Gospels of Luke and John, but only that he said nothing about them;
                    which of course might arise from cither of two causes, either because he did not
                    know of their existence, or because, knowing their existence, he “had nothing to
                    say about them.” What bearing this may have on the authorship of the Fourtlι
                    Gospel we shall see hereafter. But, so far, we see written scriptures still (1)
                    supplanted by oral tradition; (2) freely criticized as inadequate; and (3)
                    accompanied by memoirs of various interpretations from some Hebrew original;
                    though rapidly emerging, if they have not already emerged, to authoritative
                    definiteness.</p>
                <p>One fact is of the highest importance. We have seen that Papias was of a curious
                    disposition, discontented with the written records before him, and anxious to
                    supplement them by traditions. He was also, according to Eusebius, a man of no
                    great judgment, fond of recording wonders, and, by his own account, fond of
                    recording novelties. If therefore there had been any other non-canonical Gospel
                    at that time, rivalling our present Gospels, and known to Papias, it seems
                    probable, if not certain, that he would have used such a book; and, if he had
                    done so, Eusebius could not (in the execution of his plan) have failed to
                    mention such a use; but Eusebius makes no mention of the use of any
                    non-canonical gospel by Papias. Even in the narrative of the sinful woman
                    mentioned above, which was found in the Gospel according to the Hebrews,
                    Eusebius expressly avoids saying that he derived the narrative from that Gospel.
                    He merely says that Papias “has published a narrative which is contained in the
                    Gospel according to the Hebrews” (it is probably the narrative interpolated in
                    Jo. viii. 1-11); whereas, almost in the same sentence, he says that Papias “has
                    used testimonies from the First Epistle of John.” This negative evidence from
                    the silence of Papias is strongly in favour of our Gospels.</p>
                <p>In the works of Justin Martyr (who is supposed to have written his <hi

                    abundant mention of written documents containing the facts of the Gospel
                    narratives, but no assigned names of authors. The Gospel is by him considered as

                    naturally infer that the memoirs were not written by the apostles, but about the
                    apostles or rather about their teaching; and this view is confirmed by what
                    Papias says (above) about Mark, that he <hi rend="italic">άπεμνημόνευσε,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi> recorded from memory,” the teaching of Peter.<note

                    early and not unnatural tendency to deprec at · the Second Gospel.</p></note>
                    This probably was originally the meaning of the title as applied to our Gospels;
                    but it seems to have been understood differently by Justin, as though it meant
                    “written by the apostles.” For in describing the descent of the Holy Spirit on
                    Jesus at His baptism he uses the words, “The <hi rend="italic">ap&gt;ostles</hi>
                    wrote.” It might indeed be said that he has in his mind Matthew and John, for
                    John also records <pb break="no"

                    the whole of his works, and it is inconceivable that, in this latent fashion, he
                    should have referred once to a writing as apostolic, which elsewhere he never
                    quotes. It seems more likely that Justin considered that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >aπoμvημoreυμaτa</hi><hi rend="italic">Πέτρου</hi> were written by Peter, so
                    that the first two Gospels at all events were written by apostles; or else that
                    he considered the First Gospel not to have been written by one apostle, but to
                    have been a joint apostolic production. Elsewhere, in describing the agony of
                    the Lord (Lu. xxii. 44), a passage peculiar to Luke, he seems to have been
                    struck with the inapplicability of his favourite title to a work written by one
                    who was only a follower of the apostles; and instead of his usual formula, he
                    here substitutes “The memoirs which I assert to have been written by the
                    apostles, and by those who attached themselves to them;” but even this more
                    precise description would only hold good of the three Gospels used by Justin, on
                    the supposition that the “Memoirs of Peter” were written not by Mark but by
                    Peter. The subject is important, as showing by what easy stages a work written
                    by a pupil might be supposed (even in the face of direct evidence to the
                    contrary) to be written by the teacher.</p>
                <p>For a full discussion of Justin’s quotations from the Gospels the reader is
                    referred to Westcott, <hi rend="italic">On the Canon of the New Testament,</hi>
                    pp. 95-175, and Sanday, <hi rend="italic">The Gospels in the Second
                    Century,</hi> pp. 88-137. Here it must suffice to state a few general
                    conclusions deduced from an examination of his use of the Old and New
                    Testament.</p>
                <p>We must bear in mind then (1) that Justin is writing polemically, and that
                    (especially in his dialogue with the Jew Trypho) a main object with him is to
                    show that “the prophets are fulfilled in Jesus;” to the proof from prophecy he
                    attaches more importance than to any other. (2) He is a most inexact quoter; and
                    though he quotes long passages from the Old Testament accurately, shorter
                    passages are quoted from memory inexactly, while Messianic passages, even when
                    long, are modified (sometimes with a closer return to the Hebrew original) by
                    Christian use and adaptation to Christ. (3) He often inserts words and notions
                    of his own in the passages quoted from the Old Testament: for example, he says
                    that Moses, in order to heal the children of Israel from the plague of serpents,
                    “took brass and made an image of a cross, and set this in the holy tabernacle,
                    and said to the people, Should you look on this image and believe on it, ye
                    shall be saved” (Ctonon, p. 124). (4) He ascribes texts to wrong authors, and
                    quotes the same text in various shapes, not only in different books, but even in
                    the same book and at short intervals <hi rend="italic">(lb.</hi> 127). This
                    being the case, we shall naturally be prepared, in approaching the New Testament
                    quotations of Justin, to find many inaccuracies, and some alterations of fact;
                    especially where a slight alteration can render some Old Testament prophecy more
                    applicable to the New Testament narrative.</p>
                <p>Reviewing the quotations from the apostolic fathers given above, we shall expect
                    to find in Justin also a great number of the words of the Lord and incidents in
                    the life of Jesus quoted from tradition, which are not found in our Gospels.
                    Clement, we find, has two passages roughly quoted from our Gospels; and one
                    traditional saying quoted in Acts xx. 35. Ignatius (Vossian) uses phrases or
                    sentences from Matthew four times allusively, but quotes a “word of the Lord”
                    found in no Gospel. The author of the Epistle of Barnabas quotes Matthew once,
                    and a non-canonical woιd of the Lord once. Polycarp is the first apostolic
                    father who. while four or five times quoting or alluding to sayings in our
                    Gospels, quotes no non-canonical passages. Papias “published” a narrative
                    contained in the Gospel according to the Hebrews. If then, in the small modicum
                    of quotation hitherto given, so large a proportion (say a fourth) is
                    non-canonical, how much more non-canonical matter might we naturally expect to
                    find in Justin, who in two works quotes our Gospels 67 times (Sanday, p. 116),
                    and occasionally in long continuous passages? We shall also expect to find in
                    Justin many misquotations of our Gospels, arising from interpolations and
                    corruptions of the text, for “the worst corruptions to which the New Testament
                    has ever been subjected originated within a hundred years after it was composed”
                    (Scrivener, quoted by Sanday, p. 135). A generation after Justin, Irenaeus will
                    be found quoting the interpolated appendix of Mark, which the general consent of
                    scholars now recognizes to be spurious; and it has been pointed out that the
                    differences of Justin from the •ordinary text are little more than the
                    differences of Codex D from the same text.</p>
                <p>Bearing these considerations in mind, we ought to bo surprised, not at the large,
                    but at the small amount of extraneous matter which Justin has introduced into
                    the Gospel narrative, and at the comparative accuracy with which he has quoted
                    the Gospels. Treating of the variations of quotation, Dr Westcott has shown
                    that, even where Justin’s misquotations are found in other authors, the
                    resemblances are of such a kind as to be easily derivable from some common
                    tradition, or from some early but now obsolete text <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Canon,</hi> pp. 148-156). The extraneous matter may readily be explained as
                    arising either from sense of an omission or from the morbid desire to find in
                    each incident of the life of Christ the fulfilment of some prophecy in the Old
                    Testament. If, for example, (1) he speaks o’f the voice from heaven at the
                    baptism as being, “Thou art My Son, this day have 1 begotten Thee;” this is
                    explained (apart from the various reading in D, which no doubt arose from the
                    same motive) by a desire to see in the voice a repetition of Ps. ii. 7. (2) If a
                    fire is said to have been kindled in the</p>
                <p>Jordan at the Lord’s baptism, was it not natural that He who came to baptize
                    others with the higher baptism of fire, as well as that of water, should Himself
                    receive the highest baptism; or that the act which was already technically known
                    as <hi rend="italic">g&gt;ωτιaμ0s,</hi> “enlightenment,” should be accompanied
                    (in the case of the Lord of Light) by that symbol which was specially
                    characteristic of the divine presence? (3) If Mark recorded that Jesus was a
                    “carpenter” (a fact not then suppressed by the various reading in Mk. vi. 3,
                    owing to such sneers as those of Celsus, Origen, <hi rend="italic">Cont.
                    Cels.,</hi> v. 34), was it not fitting that the Carpenter, who bade men lay hand
                    on the plough, and take His yoke on them, should have “wrought, when among men,
                    ploughs and yokes”? (4) If he speaks of the Magi as having come “from Arabia,”
                    had it not been prophesied, Ps. lxxi. (lxxii.) 10, that “the kings of the
                    Arabians shall bring gifts'’? (5) If the foal of the ass on which our Lord
                    entered Jerusalem was said by Justin to have been “bound to a vine,” must it not
                    needs have been so, seeing that it was said of Judah (Gen. xlix. 11) that “he
                    bound his foal unto the vine”? (6) Lastly, since Isaiah predicted (xxxiii. 16 in
                    LXX.) that “he shall dwell in a high cave of a strong rock,” was it not
                    necessary that the Messiah should not only be born in Bethlehem, but also “in a
                    cave”?</p>
                <p>In all these additions there is absolutely nothing to make probable, or even
                    suggest (even though the ‘ ‘ fire” at the baptism of Jesus is mentioned in an
                    apocryphal Gospel) that Justin used any other written Gospel than those known to
                    us. These thoughts and others like them were floating in the atmosphere of every
                    Christian church in those days. They were the results naturally developed from
                    that habit of appeal to prophecy which has produced, even in our own canonical
                    Gospels, not inconsiderable effects; and there is nothing in Justin’s additions
                    that is not capable of being explained from the same method (developed a little
                    further) as that by w hich we may explain Matthew’s addition about the potter’s
                    field, and possibly some of the other passages peculiar to the First and Third
                    Gospels. Nor does the omission of the names Matthew, Maιk, and Luke, by Justin,
                    throw any doubt upon the supposition that he used the Gospels called by those
                    names. It is quite possible that the names were given to these Gospels long
                    after their composition. The very title, “The Gospel <hi rend="italic">according
                    to</hi> Matthew,” &amp;c. (not <hi rend="italic">of,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >by,</hi> Matthew), indicates that, even at the time when the tities were
                    assigned, the compilers were regarded rather as editors of an old and received
                    tradition than as authors of a new book. It is therefore quite possible that
                    Justin (who mentions John by name as the author of the Apocalypse) may have used
                    the first three Gospels, and yet have been ignorant of the names under which
                    they are now cun ent.</p>
                <p>Three most important facts remain to be mentioned, (a) Justin tells us that in
                    his days the memoirs of the apostles were read with the books of the prophets in
                    the service of the church. This public reading of the memoirs must have given,
                    if not a complete security, at least a considerable guarantee, against material
                    alterations. The fact that the new traditions were now placed on a level with
                    the ancient and venerable writings or scriptures of the Old Testament was a
                    still more effectual barrier against change, <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> Although
                    Justin mentions sayings of our Lord and events in His life not found in our
                    Gospels, yet “he never does so when he proposes to quote the apostolic memoirs”
                    (Westcott, <hi rend="italic">Canon,</hi> p. 157). (c) In describing the fire
                    kindled in the Jordan and the voice from heaven, he not only does not quote the
                    memoirs, but, by implication, distinguishes these statements from other
                    statements immediately following, which are quoted from the memoirs <hi
                    rend="italic">(Canon,</hi> pp. 158-159).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> Perhaps we may also lay some stress on the fact that, in
                    the seven passages in which Justin uses the phrase, ‘· it is written," as
                    applied to the memoirs, he almost always agrees <hi rend="italic"> verbatim</hi>
                    with Matthew or with Luke <hi rend="italic"> (Canon,</hi> p.
                    130).</p></note></p>
                <p>To conclude, we find that, although Justin knew and used traditions, yet (1) he
                    set a special value on certain writings, which were publicly read in the
                    churches; (2) he believed these to have been written by apostles, or the
                    immediate disciples of apostles, and he repeatedly quotes them under this title;
                    (3) though lie does not lay stress on miracles (for miracles would be assumed by
                    the Jew Trypho, accustomed to the miracles of Moses and Elisha, and they would
                    be rather harmful than helpful to his cause in the eyes of educated Greeks and
                    Romans), nor on the longer lessons involved in Christ’s parables, yet he covers
                    the greater part of our Gospel history, and much of our Lord’s teaching through
                    maxims; this he does to such an extent that it is possible (Sanday, pp. 91-98)
                    to reconstruct from his quotations a fairly connected narrative of the
                    incarnation, birth, teaching, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of the
                    Lord; (4) the whole of this narrative (with the exception of the few unimportant
                    incidents mentioned above, and one or two <pb break="no"

                    Matthew, or Mark, or Luke, or in all three; and there is also a reference to an
                    incident recorded by Mark alone; (5) he never, as from these memoirs, quotes any
                    words, or alleges any incidents not found in our Matthew, Mark, or Luke; (6) he
                    never quotes any rival Gospel, nor alleges any words or facts which make it
                    probable lie used a rival Gospel; (7) such non-canonical sayings and facts as he
                    mentions are readily explicable as the results of lapse of memory, general
                    looseness and inaccuracy, extending to the use of the Old as well as the New
                    Testament, and the desire to adapt the facts of the new scriptures to the
                    prophecies of the old. Our conclusion is that the memoirs of the apostles which
                    include so much that is contained in our first three Gospels, and which were
                    continuously read in the services of the church from the time of Justin
                    downwards, cannot have passed into oblivion a few years afterwards, so as to
                    have given place to rival Gospels not known to Justin. They must be identical
                    with the Gospels, to some or all of which testimony is successively home by
                    Marcion (140 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> in spite of his arbitrary and
                    entirely uncritical excisions; by the heretical Clementine Homilies (160 <hi

                    by the Muratorian fragment (170 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.);</hi> by Athenagoras

                    only uses three synoptical Gospels with the Fourth so fully as to leave no doubt
                    of the identity of his Gospels with ours, but also is so convinced of the
                    essential necessity that there should be four and only four Gospels, that he
                    discerns in the quadriform nature of the cherubim a type of the preordained
                    quadriform nature of the records of the life of Christ.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> As a good deal of stress lias been laid upon
                    the apocryphal Gospel of the Hebrews, from which (according to the testimony of
                    Jerome, Kirchhofer, p. 449) Ignatius quoted, it may be well to show that this
                    was later than our Gospels. (1) we have seen above (p. 807) that in the common
                    tradition <hi rend="italic"> 'Iησοi'S</hi> is habitually employed, and that the
                    use of ό Kιipιos, “the Lord,” in narrative is a sure sign of later origin; but
                    “the Lord” is habitually used in the narrative of the Gospel of the Hebrews (see
                    Kirchhofer, pp. 450, 453. 454). (2) It softens moral difficulties: (a) in the
                    story of the rich young man, the Lord says to him, “Behold, many of the
                    brethren, sons of Abraham, are covered with dung and dying for hunger, and thy
                    house is full with many good things, and naught goeth forth at all from thee to
                    them,” thereby blunting the point of the young man’s rejection; (5) after the
                    words “If thy brother shall sin against thee” (c∕. Matt, xviii. 22), Jesus adds,
                    in the Gospel of the Hebrews, “in word, and if he shall make thee amends” <hi
                    rend="italic"> Ob.</hi> p. 454) (in <hi rend="italic"> νerbο</hi><hi
                    rend="italic"> et</hi><hi rend="italic"> satis</hi><hi rend="italic"> tibi
                    fecerit);</hi> (c) the error in Matt, xxiii. 35, “son of Barachiah,” is
                    corrected into “filium Jojadae,” Jerome <hi rend="italic"> Ob.</hi> p. 455). (3)
                    It increases the marvellous element: (a) at the baptism of Jesus, “It came to
                    pass when the Lord was come up from the water, the whole fountain of the Holy
                    Spirit came down and rested upon Him, and said to Him, O My Son, in all the
                    prophets I was awaiting Thee, that Thou mightest come, and that I might find
                    rest in Thee; for Thou art My rest, Thou art My first-born Son, who reignest for
                    ever” <hi rend="italic"> Ob.</hi> p. 454), <hi rend="italic"> (b)</hi> hence the
                    Holy Spirit is called the Mother of the Lord, and it is said by the Lord, “But
                    now My Mother, the Holy Spirit, took Me by one of My hairs, and carried Me away
                    to the Mount Tabor” <hi rend="italic"> Ob.</hi> p 451); (c) after His
                    resurrection, it is added that the Lord ordered a table and bread to be brought,
                    and caused His brother James to break his fast, when James had sworn not to eat
                    bread till he had seen the Lord; in this story James is called “James the Just,”
                    a title which in itself is a mark of late composition. To this note we may add
                    that Celsus, towards the end of the second century, speaks of “the writings of
                    the disciples of Jesus” <hi rend="italic"> Ob.</hi> p. 330) as the source of his
                    information, and mentions nothing (so far as we know) of any importance that is
                    not found in our Gospels. It is true that Origen <hi rend="italic"> (Cοnt.
                    Cels.,</hi> ii. 74), in answer to Celsus’s boast that he had crashed the
                    Christians with facts taken from their own writings, replies, “But we showed
                    (above) that there has been a great deal of nonsensical blundering, contrary <hi
                    rend="italic"> (παρά)</hi> to the writings of our Gospels,” &lt;fcc.; but if we
                    refer to what has gone before, we find that Origen is referring (1) to Celsus’s
                    unfair inaccuracy, <hi rend="italic"> e.g.,</hi> in saying that Jesus was
                    betrayed, not by one disciple, but by His disciples; (2) to such blunders as the
                    confusion of “Chaldaeans” with “Magi;” (3) to hisignorance of the number of the
                    disciples, &amp;c. There is therefore every reason to believe—for if Celsus had
                    attacked any apocryphal narratives as representing the faith of Christ, Origen
                    could not have failed to take advantage of the triumphant rejoinder which such a
                    mistake would have afforded him—that an assailant of Christianity, writing
                    before the end of the second century, knew of no writings of the disciples of
                    Christ upon which he could base any effective attacks against their refigion,
                    except our four Gospels.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the foregoing remarks attention has been mainly directed to definite evidence,
                    whether external or internal. Limits of space, as well as other considerations,
                    prevent the discussion of that more indefinite evidence which might perhaps be
                    called indirect external evidence, and which would treat of the influences amid
                    which the Gospels grew up and by which they were likely to be moulded. For such
                    a discussion it would be necessary that we should place ourselves in the
                    position of a disciple in some early congregation of Jewish or Gentile
                    Christians, and endeavour to realize the influence exerted upon the Christian
                    records—(1) by prophecy; (2) by heathen religions; (3) by Eastern metaphor
                    acting upon Western literalism; (4)</p>
                <p>by the ritual and language of the Lord’s Supper; (5) by the universal
                    predilection for the marvellous; (6) by the fall of Jerusalem. The results thus
                    obtained would be in a great measure conjectural; but, compared step by step
                    with the results deduced above, they would enable the reader to feel additional
                    confidence in conclusions supported by the double confirmation of indirect as
                    well as direct evidence. The best work in English bearing on this subject is
                    probably the translation of Keim’s <hi rend="italic">Jesus of Na∑ara</hi>
                    (London, 1876-79); and there is also much valuable information in the Appendices
                    to Canon Farrar’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Christ.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">The
                    Fourth Gospel.</hi><hi rend="italic">Authorship.</hi><hi rend="italic">Evidence
                    from earliest Tradition.—</hi> Before considering the subject matter of this
                    Gospel, it will be well to consider the evidence, direct and indirect, bearing
                    on the authorship. The author is not mentioned in the Gospel by name, but only
                    as “the disciple whom Jesus loved” (xxi. 24, 20), “which also leaned on His
                    breast,” and to whom Jesus commended His mother from the cross (xix. 26; xiii.
                    23). The first writer who mentions John as the author in connexion with a
                    passage quoted from our Fourth Gospel is said to be Theophilus, who wrote
                    towards the close of the second century (170-180 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.).</hi> The Muratorian fragment (170 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> speaks
                    of the apostle as the author of a Gospel, but does not quote from it. But
                    Theophilus quotes Jo. i. 1, as written by John, one of those “inspired by the
                    Spirit” (ττνευ/ζατοφόρωι/).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Such at least is the statement of Kirchhofer (p. 153), and it has been
                    reproduced in modern books. But part of the period of Irenaeus might precede
                    part of the period of Theophilus; and Irenaeus quotes John’s Gospel (xx. 31) as
                    from “John the disciple of the Lord,” in a passage of his work <hi rend="italic"
                    >Against Heresies</hi> (III. xvi. 5, or ed. Grabe, iii. 18), a passage omitted
                    by Kirchhofer.</p></note> It is a natural inference that Theophilus (at so late
                    a date), using the name thus without further definition, meant by “John,” the
                    “John” best known to his readers, t.e., John, the son of Zebedee, the apostle.
                    But there is unusually strong evidence to show that John the apostle wrote the
                    Apocalypse, so strong that we may assume the apostolic authorship of that book
                    with more confidence than the authorship of any other book in the New Testament,
                    except some of Paul’s epistles. The question therefore arises, how far does the
                    style of the Gospel, which was said by Theophilus (170-180 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.)</hi> to have been written by John (presumably the apostle), agree with
                    the style of the Apocalypse, which we have so good reason for believing to have
                    been written by the apostle John? If we assume John to have been four or five
                    years younger than his Master, he would be, according to the commonly received
                    date (68 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> of the Apocalypse, about sixtyseven or
                    sixty-eight years of age when he wrote that work. By that age (one would
                    suppose) an author’s style would, if ever, have reached its maturity. Even if he
                    were ten years younger than Jesus, so that he was only a little over sixty years
                    of age, yet his style would not be capable of a complete transformation. Eut
                    when the Gospel is compared with the Apocalypse, instead of similarity, we find
                    an almost complete contrast.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is not necessary, however, to deny that the Gospel
                    exhibits traces of the Apocalyptic doctrine and thought. On the contrary, the
                    impression left by a comparison of the two is, that the Gospel exhibits an
                    attempt to refine and spiritualize some of the more material and concrete
                    expressions of the Apocalypse. From this point of view, we may say that ‘ ‘ the
                    Gospel is the spiritual interpretation of the Apocalypse. . . . The active and

                    which was needed to exhibit Christianity as the absolute and historical religion
                    in contrast with Judaism and heathenism” (Westcott, <hi rend="italic">Intrοd. to

                    same author would be, we will not say impossible, but one of the mo3t marvellous
                    literary phenomena ever authenticated. The change in Shakespeare’s style, or in
                    the style of Burke, cannot be compared with this; for those changes can be in
                    part explained by the transition from youth to maturity or old age. Here we have
                    to explain how a writer could completely change language, style, and thought,
                    after the age of sixty or sixty-seven years. It is possible, but <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> highly improbable.</p>
                <p>It has indeed been suggested that this change of language may be explained by the
                    lapse of more than thirty years, during which the author was living in the midst
                    of a Gentile population. This assumes that the Apocalypse was written in 68 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> before John had resided in Ephesus, and that he
                    wrote the Gospel at the age of ninety-eight. But (1) the minute knowledge of the
                    Seven Churches (Rev. i. ii. iii.) makes it probable that the writer had resided
                    for some time in their neighbourhood; (2) the composition of such a work as the
                    Fourth Gospel at the age of ninety-eight is in itself unlikely; (3) it is by no
                    means certain that the Apocalypse was written in 68 A.D., and not rather in 78
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> simultaneously with the fourth Sibylline Book
                    (and the later the date of the Apocalypse the shorter the interval between it
                    and the Fourth Gospel, and the more improbable becomes the theory of the change
                    of style). An hypothesis based upon three hypotheses, themselves not proved or
                    improbable, requires much evidence before it can be accepted.</p>
                <p>There is yet another difficulty in the way of believing that John the apostle is
                    the author: the words of Jesus in the Fourth Gospel (1) differ altogether in
                    style and rhythm from the synoptic tradition of the words of the Lord, and (2)
                    do not differ at all from the author’s own remarks and observations. So great is
                    the similarity between the words of the writer and the words which are assigned
                    by him either to our Lord or to John the Baptist that Dr Westcott, commenting on
                    Jo. iii. 10-21, 27-36, says <hi rend="italic">(^Introduction to the
                    Gospels,</hi> p. 292), “It is impossible not to feel that the evangelist is in
                    fact commenting on and explaining the testimony which he records. The comments
                    <hi rend="italic">seem to begin</hi> respectively at verses 16 and 31.” The
                    words italicized (not by Dr Westcott) require little comment. It is obvious that
                    a biographer, who so mixes the words of his characters with observations of his
                    own that a most careful and scholarlike commentator is unable to feel sure where
                    the words of the characters end and the observations of the author “seem to
                    begin,” cannot be supposed to be exactly recording, scarcely even to be
                    attempting to record with exactness, the words of the characters themselves. Yet
                    it seems impossible that the “disciple whom Jesus loved” should either remember
                    his Master’s words so ill, or else deliberately transmute them into entirely
                    different language of his own. A work of this kind, notwithstanding the presence
                    of historical elements, seems rather to deserve to be called a poem, or a drama,
                    than a biography; and accordingly the same careful commentator who is quoted
                    above declares that “the spirit of parallelism, the instinctive perception of
                    symmetry in thought and expression, which is the essential and informing spirit
                    of Hebrew poetry, runs through the whole record” <hi rend="italic">(Introd. to
                    the Gospel of St John).</hi> Such a work does not seem likely to have proceeded
                    from one of the sons of Zebedee, a fisherman of the lake district of Galilee,
                    not indeed a poor man, but still not a man of letters nor of any great literary
                    culture.</p>
                <p>“The earliest account of the origins of the Gospel is already legendary”
                    (Westcott, <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Gospels,</hi> p. 255), as given
                    in the fragment of Muratori <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 170). It is there
                    said that, being requested by his fellow-disciples and bishops to write, John
                    desired them to fast for three days, and then to relate to one another what
                    revelation each had received either for or against the project. The same night
                    it was revealed to Andrew, one of the apostles, that “while all called (the
                    past) to mind (or while all revised,—‘cunctis recognoscentibus’), John should
                    write everything <hi rend="italic">in his own ηameT</hi> Legendary though this
                    account may be, it curiously agrees with a passage in tho Gospel itself which
                    implies that others besides the author were “revising,” or otherwise assisting
                    in, the work: “This is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote
                    these things: and we know that his testimony is true” (xxi. 24). Yet immediately
                    afterwards—in a sentence which, though omitted by Tischendorf, is supported by
                    the MSS. almost without exception—the singular number is resumed: “I suppose
                    that the world could not contain the books that should be written.” This passage
                    certainly seems to indicate some kind of joint authorship or revision, or at all
                    events a desire to convey the impression of joint authorship or revision, such
                    as the Muratorian fragment describes. The theory of joint authorship or revision
                    is confirmed by evidence derivable from the 1st Epistle of John, which is justly
                    regarded (Lightfoot, <hi rend="italic">Contemp. Pev.,</hi> 1875) as a kind of
                    postscript to the Gospel. It begins (like the Gospel, and unlike the Apocalypse,
                    as also unlike the 2d and 3d Epistles of John) without mention of the author’s
                    name, and in the plural number: “That which was from the beginning, which we
                    have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our
                    hands have handled, declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with
                    us.” Yet at the conclusion of the first chapter, as though it were to be
                    understood that the whole was written “in the name of John” (“suo nomine,” as
                    the Muratorian fragment has it), the singular number is used, “these things
                    write I unto you” (1 Jo. ii. 1, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21; v. 16).<note anchored="true"

                    thoughts also) in the process of expressing them (just as Paul is said by some
                    to have written the Epistle to the Hebrews in Hebrew, and to have had it freely

                    different in thought and substance, from the teaching of the apostle himself;
                    and a spiritual doctrine, taught in the Ephesian church, and based upon three or
                    four traditions affirmed by the aged apostle, such as the tradition of blood and
                    water, might, even in the lifetime of the apostle, become known, within a
                    limited district, as the Gospel according to the apostle John. How different, in
                    language if not in substance, may be a pupil’s record of a master’s teaching may
                    be perceived from Plato’s and Xenophon’s records of the teaching of Socrates.

                    to be, so far as we have gone, in the highest degree improbable that John the
                    apostle wrote the Fourth Gospel with his own hand at the age of ninety or nearly
                    a hundred, in the same way in which he wrote the Apocalypse at the age of sixty
                    or seventy or eighty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Evidence</hi><hi rend="italic">from Quotations.—</hi> But we
                    pass now to the evidence of the early fathers. Theophilus and Irenaeus are the
                    first to quote John by name, but earlier writers, who do not mention his name,
                    quote words contained in the Fourth Gospel. We will take Papias first. He tells
                    us (see above, p. 816) that he used to inquire about the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dicta</hi> of Andrew, Peter, Philip, Thomas, Janies, John, Matthew, or any
                    other disciples of the Lord, and also about the sayings of Aristion and the
                    elder John, the disciples of the Lord. The order of names is remarkable, and it
                    has been most ingeniously inferred (Lightfoot, <hi rend="italic">Contemp.
                    Rev.,</hi> Oct. 1875) that John is placed, out of his order of precedence, along
                    with Matthew, because the last two had left written Gospels; moreover the order
                    of the first three, “Andrew, Peter, Philip,” quite unlike the synoptic order, is
                    the order in Jo. i. 40-43, which suggests that Papias was aware at all events of
                    the story of the calling of the apostles contained in the first chapter of the
                    Fourth Gospel. We are also told by Eusebius that Papias “used testimonies” from
                    the 1st Epistle of John. This is, of course, no proof that Papias quoted the
                    Epistle with John’s name (for quotations of New Testament documents with the
                    name of the author are not common in the earliest writings of the church); but
                    it may be inferred that he regarded the 1st Epistle of John as an authoritative
                    document; and the Epistle is so closely connected with the Gospel that, if the
                    apostle John is proved to be the author of the one, it must follow that he is
                    the author of the other also. But it is important to note that Papias recognized
                    two Johns, both of whom were “disciples of the Lord;” and Eusebius tells us that
                    Papias quoted certain traditions of the non-apostolic John, distinguishing him
                    as “the elder,”—“the elder used to say,” &amp;c. Now Irenaeus—who speaks highly
                    of Paρias, describing him (wrongly) as a “bearer of John” (the apostle),—quotes
                    Papias as one of “the elders who saw John the disciple of the Lord,” and who
                    remembered how he (John) had repeated to them certain teachings of the Lord
                    Jesus, to the effect that “the days will come in which vines shall grow, having
                    each 10,000 branches, and in each branch 10,000 twigs, and in each twig 10,000
                    shoots, and in every shoot 10,000 clusters, and in every cluster 10,000 grapes,
                    and every grape when pressed will give 25 measures of wine. And when any one of
                    the saints shall lay hold of a cluster, another shall cry out, ‘I am a better
                    cluster, take me; bless the Lord through me,’” &lt;fcc. <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Apostolic Fathers,</hi> Clark’s trans, p. 443). The question therefore arises,
                    Which John is here meant? It seems certain from the context that Irenaeus meant
                    <hi rend="italic">the</hi> famous John, the apostle: yet he calls him nothing
                    but “disciple,” and the tradition imputed to John (though not out of accord
                    perhaps with the imagery of the Apocalypse) is quite unlike anything that we
                    find in the Gospel or 1st Epistle called by John’s name. On the other hand, a
                    passage of the Fourth Gospel (xiv. 2) is quoted by Irenaeus <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Adv. Hα</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">r.,</hi> V. xxxvi. 2) in connexion, not with
                    John the apostle, but with “elders,” and possibly as part of the doctrine
                    communicated to Papias by the “elders” (“the context makes it at least highly
                    probable that the passage was quoted from Papias’s ‘ Exposition,’” Westcott, <hi
                    rend="italic">Introd, to the Gospel of St John).</hi> But, if this be so, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> if a passage of the Fourth Gospel was communicated to
                    Papias, not necessarily by John the apostle, but by “elders,” then it follows
                    that among the “elders” who communicated it to him may have been John the
                    “elder.” Although this is, in great measure, conjectural, yet, even as a
                    possibility, it becomes deserving of attention, when placed in juxtaposition
                    with the certainty mentioned above; (1) it is <hi rend="italic">possible</hi>
                    that a saying in the Fourth Gospel was communicated to Papias, not by John the
                    apostle but by John the elder; (2) it is <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> that the
                    only passage quoted from Papias as coming from John (the apostle) is not to be
                    found in the Fourth Gospel and in no way resembles the style or thought of the
                    Fourth Gospel. Again, the 2d and 3d Epistles of John, which have the name of the
                    author inserted, are written, not in the name of John the apostle, but in the
                    name of “the elder,” and they were so doubtfully regarded (perhaps on that
                    account) by the church that Eusebius places them among the “impeached
                    (αrrtλ∈γ0∕ze∕α) writings,” while Origen speaks of them as only possibly genuine,
                    and Jerome attributes them not to John the apostle but to John the elder. Yet
                    Irenaeus quotes this 2d “impeached” Epistle, not as the work of John the elder,
                    but (twice) as the work of “John the disciple of the Lord.” Evidently there is
                    here, if not confusion, at least a danger of confusion, and one cause of
                    confusion can be immediately indicated. Papias tells us that both John the
                    apostle and John the elder were “disciples of the Lord.” Now, for some reason or
                    other, Irenaeus, though he quotes Matthew as “the apostle” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Adv. Hcer.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> III. ix. 1) and a speech of
                    Peter as spoken by “the apostle” <hi rend="italic">{Ib.</hi> xii. 1), appears
                    not to quote the Fourth Gospel except as written by John “the disciple of the
                    Lord,” or simply “John” <hi rend="italic">{Ib.</hi> xi. 1,2, 3, 7). It cannot
                    indeed be assumed that Irenaeus is here (unconsciously) referring to John the
                    elder, and not to John the apostle. On the contrary, the more probable
                    explanation is, that John the apostle was himself called by preference John “the
                    disciple of the Lord,” as being “the disciple whom Jesus loved.”<note

                    supper.”</p></note> Nevertheless it remains an unfortunate fact that Irenaeus
                    and Theophilus, who are the first to quote John by name, give us no means of
                    ascertaining whether they refer to John the apostle or John the elder, both of
                    whom are described by Papias as being “disciples of the Lord.” In this state of
                    confusion we are naturally led to suspect that possibly the two Johns mentioned
                    by Papias (neither of whom, as we have shown above, was probably known to Papias
                    himself) may have really been one; and this suspicion is confirmed by the
                    testimony of Jerome, who informs us that though two tombs were shown in his time
                    at Ephesus, one as the tomb of John the apostle, and the other as the tomb of
                    John the elder, yet some considered the two persons to be identical; “nonnulli
                    putant duas memorias ejusdem Joannis evan-gelistae esse” (Jerome, quoted by
                    Kirchhofer, p. 159). We have not evidence to prove this theory, but neither have
                    we evidence to disprove it; and we must therefore leave the question who was the

                    probability is that Papias did not know of its existence as an authoritative
                    Gospel written by the son of Zebedee. For, had he known it, would he have had
                    “nothing to say” about its origin, about the contrast between it and the
                    Apocalypse, about the difference between it and the synoptic narrative, and

                    rend="italic">1</hi> That Papias should have “nothing to say” about Luke’s
                    Gospel is intelligible, because the dedication to Theophilus speaks for itself;
                    but why he should describe the origin of the First and Second Gospels and pass
                    over the Fourth, where there was so much to describe and where a joint
                    authorship was not only suggested by tradition but also by internal evidence
                    (John xxi. 24), is by no means easy to explain. In the face of this silence we
                    cannot attach much value to the evidence in Papias for the apostolic authorship,
                    derived from the association of John with Matthew in the list of the apostles.
                    Against that evidence, too, such as it is, must be set the fact that the only
                    tradition detailed by Irenaeus as coming through Papias from John the disciple
                    of the Lord is one quite unlike the tone of the Fourth Gospel. The latter
                    negative at least neutralizes the first positive; and the scale is thus left
                    unaltered, pressed heavily downwards against the apostolic authorship by the
                    discrepancy of style (when the Gospel is compared with the Apocalypse) and by
                    the external and internal evidence of joint authorship.</p>
                <p>Evidence has been drawn from the epistle of Barnabas, the “Shepherd” of Hermas,
                    the Ignatian letters, the epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians, the works of
                    Justin, and the Clementine Homilies, to show that the authors of these writings
                    used the Fourth Gospel (Westcott, <hi rend="italic">Canon, passim;</hi> Sanday,
                    <hi rend="italic">Gospels in the Second Century,</hi> 273-298); and no candid
                    mind can resist the proof that some of them knew and were influenced by the
                    thoughts of the Fourth Gospel, while some even used its language. But it is by
                    no means certain, indeed it is improbable, that they knew of it as a Gospel; and
                    it is still more improbable that they recognized it as a Gospel written by “the
                    disciple whom Jesus loved.” Else, how comes it that Justin quotes Matthew about
                    fifty times and the Fourth Gospel once, or not at all?</p>
                <p>Moreover, the apparent quotations of the Fourth Gospel in the apostolic fathers
                    show not so much the use of a document from the first, as rather the influence
                    of the common atmosphere of the Asian churches, the floating tradition of the
                    Ephesian school, gradually merging into a definite document. Barnabas, for
                    example, speaks of “water,” with a certain mystery, associating it with the
                    “cross”; as also Justin seems to do, mentioning the cross and baptism in
                    consecutive chapters (lx. lxi.) of his <hi rend="italic">First Apology.</hi> But
                    the Clementine Homilies, amplifying the mysterious efficacy of water, as being
                    the origin of all things, and the direct recipient of the impulses of the Spirit
                    (ch. xxiv.), give a loose quotation of Jo. iii. 5, which seems adapted for the
                    Clementine context by beiug blended with the baptismal formulary previously
                    mentioned by the writer in xxviii. 19: “For thus the prophet has sworn to us,
                    saying, Verily I say to you, Unless ye be regenerated by living water into the
                    name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, ye shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.”
                    It can scarcely be an accident that this same passage is the only passage from
                    the Fourth Gospel quoted in the whole of the works of Justin Martyr. Moreover,
                    in Justin also, as in the Clementine Homilies, it is not so much the Gospel as
                    rather the substance of the Gospel that is given; and this too in a shape not so
                    developed as that which appears in the Fourth Gospel.</p>
                <p>It is worth while to sketch the growth of this passage, for the process is a
                    typical one, and will illustrate many other theological developments. The
                    doctrine of the new birth first appears (but only in its germ) in the synoptic
                    Gospels: “Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not
                    enter the kingdom of heaven” (Mat. xviii. 3: <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Mk. x.
                    15; Lu. xviii. 17). But Jesus clearly did not mean that His disciples were to
                    become like little children by becoming ignorant, foolish, or helpless; but only
                    that they must trust the Father in heaven, as earthly children trust their
                    earthly parents; in other words, that they must become children of the heavenly
                    Father, and therefore be born again with a heavenly birth. It was therefore a
                    legitimate development of Christ’s teaching to remind Christians (1 Pet. i. 3,
                    23) that they had been “begotten or born again” <hi rend="italic"
                    >^àvayevvâv')</hi>; and Paul describes his converts as “begotten” <hi
                    rend="italic">(yevvar)</hi> by himself in Christ spiritually, distinguishing
                    such a birth from the “birth according to the flesh” (Gal. iv. 23, 29). It was
                    inevitable that the Christians should early associate this spiritual birth with
                    the rite of purification or baptism, with which they would naturally (as John
                    had done) introduce their converts into the church. But further, as soon as the
                    need of this spiritual “begetting” became a part of the teaching of the church,
                    it would have to be protected against the literalism of misrepresenting enemies
                    and of dull unspiritual friends. Jews and Gentiles would argue, “But it is
                    impossible for a man who has once been bora to enter a second time into his
                    mother’s womb.” This argumentative objection would therefore be naturally placed
                    (in the minds of the teachers and catechists of the first century) side by side
                    with the doctrine of Christ. One teacher, treating the subject dramatically,
                    might put the objection into the mouth of an objector in the shape of dialogue;
                    another might state the answer to the objection in his own person. With this
                    explanation we shall at once understand that Justin, though appearing (in the
                    course of an argument upon baptism) to quote the Fourth Gospel once only
                    (whereas he quotes Matthew fifty times), is not really quoting it, but only the
                    floating tradition of the Ephesian elders, when he writes as follows :—</p>

                </table>
                <p>Note here the inexplicable omission—on the hypothesis that it is an omission. We
                    must bear in mind that in the preceding extract Justin is arguing for baptism by
                    <hi rend="italic">water.</hi> How obvious then to quote the words of Christ
                    Himself, “Except a man be bora of <hi rend="italic">water</hi> and the Spirit,”
                    &amp;c. But Justin does no such thing. He gives as a reason for water-baptism
                    the intention that men may not remain “the children of necessity and ignorance,”
                    which reason, he says, we have learned from the apostles. He also quotes,
                    suitably euough, the saying of Isaiah, “Wash you, make you clean.” Lastly, he
                    quotes a saying of Christ, and omits from it (supposing that he has the Fourth
                    Gospel before him) the very words which tell with greatest force for him, and
                    which indeed make all further argument unnecessary! It is possible, but most
                    improbable, that Justin should quote Matthew fifty times, and a Gospel which he
                    knew to be written by the beloved disciple of the Lord only once; but it is more
                    than improbable—it is inconceivable—that, in this single quotation, he should
                    not only quote inaccurately, but omit the very words that were best ada pted to
                    support his argument.</p>
                <p>The probability is that Justin’s quotation represents one stage, and the Fourth
                    Gospel another stage, of the Christian doctrine of the new birth, and that the
                    Ephesian “usus ecclesiasticus” had not yet come to his knowledge, or, if it had,
                    had not yet superseded the less developed tradition. The stages may be
                    classified as follows: (1) Synoptists, “Except ye become as little children;”
                    (2) Justin, “Except ye be bora again;” (3) a third stage is implied in 1 Pet. i.
                    3, 23, and iii. 21, and it would run thus, “Except a man be born of the Spirit
                    as well as water” (a protest against the Essenistic overvaluing of ablutions,
                    see also <hi rend="italic">Sibylline Books,</hi> iv. 164-174); (4) the
                    inevitable transition hence was to the form in the Fourth Gospel, “Except a man
                    be born of water and of the Spirit.” Here the authority of the Ephesian
                    apostolic school arrested the development, which would else have issued in (5)
                    the Clementine stage, “Except ye be regenerated by living water into the name of
                    Father, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n845/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0845-0822"/> Son, and the Holy Spirit, ye shall not enter the
                    kingdom of heaven.” If (6) “living” had subsequently been omitted, the
                    development would have been completed iu a sixth and last stage.</p>
                <p>Take another case of the apparent use of the Fourth Gospel by Ignatius. “I desire
                    bread of God, heavenly bread, bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ,
                    . . . . and I desire drink of God, His blood, which is love imperishable, and
                    ever-abiding life” <hi rend="italic">[Ep. to the Romans,</hi> ch. vii.). Now
                    here it is true that we have a thought peculiar to the Fourth Gospel. Paul
                    speaks of the “blood” always as sacrificial, the “blood of sprinkling;” and
                    indeed to a Jewish mind, taught to “abstain from blood,” the thought of drinking
                    “blood” would be at first extremely repulsive, even as a spiritual metaphor. It
                    is very unlike anything in the Apocalypse, where blood is never “drunk,” except
                    by the scarlet woman and the murderers of the saints. But it is an image that
                    must have suggested itself to the church as soon as the Gentiles, unfettered by
                    Jewish associations, began to be imbued with eucharistie thought. Indeed, after
                    the first repugnance had worn away, Jewish thought itself—even Pauline thought,
                    and much more the thought of Jewish Christians trained in the school of
                    Philo—would hasten the adoption of the eucharistie metaphor. For was not the
                    blood “the life,” according to Moses! And was not a Christian taught to believe,
                    with Paul, that his individual life was merged and “hid” in Christ’s life?
                    Again, it would soon be felt that to speak merely of feeding on Christ’s flesh
                    was to present the New Testament in an unsymmetrical and almost maimed aspect.
                    Moses had not only fed his people upon bread from the sky (the manna), but had
                    also given them water to drink from the rock. What had the church to show
                    against this symmetrical display of Mosaic power? It was not enough to say (with
                    Paul) that that same “rock” was really Christ: it was necessary to show that the
                    rock still supplied the faithful with divine drink. And for this purpose, what
                    was more appropriate than the cup of the Lord’s blood? Regarded in this way, the
                    metaphor would commend itself speedily even to the Jewish mind. Nay, to the
                    cultivated Alexandrian Jew, it would at once commend itself, as we may perceive
                    from the works of Philo, who uses words so strikingly similar to Christian
                    thought that they might almost seem, to a hasty reader, to have (of themselves)
                    originated the eucharistie miracle of Cana. “Who can pour over the happy soul
                    (which proffers its own reason as the most sacred cup) the holy goblet of true
                    joy, except the cup-bearer of God, the Master of the Feast, the Word?” <hi
                    rend="italic">[On Dreams,</hi> ii. 38). When such thought as this was floating
                    in the atmosphere of Ephesus and Alexandria, it is impossible to draw from the
                    vague resemblance of the Ignatian passage quoted above any inference that
                    Ignatius was quoting, or even referring to, the Fourth Gospel.</p>
                <p>Nor can we infer any quotation of documents from the fact that Polycarp <hi
                    rend="italic">[Ep, to Philip.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> f</hi> ch. vii.)
                    mentions Antichrist in language somewhat similar to 1 Jo. iv. 2, 3. “Every one
                    that doth not confess that Jesus Christ hath come in the flesh,” writes
                    Polycarp, “is Antichrist; and whoso doth not confess the mystery of the cross is
                    of the devil.” The thought indeed is manifestly similar, and the language so far
                    similar as to show that both Polycarp and the author of the epistle lived amid
                    identical traditions of Christian teaching. But the epistle itself testifies
                    that the name “Antichrist,” so far from being invented by the author of the
                    epistle, was already current in the church: “Little children, ye have heard that
                    Antichrist shall come.” If, therefore, it was a fact that already in Asia there
                    had arisen a sect denying that Christ had come “in the flesh,"’ and that the
                    Ephesian circle of apostles first, and the Ephesian school of elders afterwards,
                    had denounced such a belief as being of Satan and of Antichrist, and if this was
                    taught to the Ephesian catechumens, and preached in the Ephesian pulpits, in a
                    form sanctioned by authoritative teaching and by repeated use, what more is
                    wanting to explain the similarity between the Epistle of John and that of
                    Polycarp?</p>
                <p>Again, it is said that Justin <hi rend="italic">[Dial.,</hi> ch. 88) imitates
                    John (i. 23) in putting the words “The voice of one crying,” &amp;c., into the
                    mouth of John the Baptist, instead of placing them as an evangelical comment (as
                    the synoptist3 do) on the appearance of the Baptist (Mat. iii. 3; Mk. i. 3; Lu.
                    iii. 4). But this inference is unsound, as can be shown by analogy; for Mark
                    uses also as an evangelical comment (i. 2), “I send My messenger before thy
                    face;” but Matthew and Luke place it in the mouth of our Lord (Mat. xi. 10; Lu.
                    vii. 27); and therefore, according to the reasoning above, we must infer that
                    Luke had copied Matthew, or Matthew had copied Luke, in taking the evangelical
                    comment, and inserting it in a discourse of Jesus! How fallacious would be such
                    a deduction! How much more reasonable to suppose that—in accordance with the
                    inevitable tendency thus to take prophecy, as it were, out of the framework, and
                    insert it in the picture— Matthew and Luke have independently adopted a
                    tradition later than Mark, which transposed Mark’s evangelistic application of
                    prophecy, and inserted it in the words of the Lord! But if this is the more
                    probable solution in the case of Matthew and Luke, why not also in the case of
                    Justin and John, the circumstances being precisely the same?</p>
                <p>But it has been urged that, although Justin cannot be shown to have quoted the
                    Fourth Gospel, yet his acquaintance with the Valentinians <hi rend="italic"
                    >[Dial.</hi> 35)—“who freely used the Fourth Gospel” (Iren., A&lt;⅛. <hi
                    rend="italic">Hcer.,</hi> I. viii. 5)—“shows that the Fourth Gospel could not
                    have been unknown to him” (Westcott, <hi rend="italic">Introd. to Gospel of
                    St</hi><hi rend="italic">Lohn').</hi> Justin’s words are these: “There are, and
                    there were, many who, coming forward in the name of Jesus, taught both to speak
                    and act blasphemous things, with whom we have nothing in common, since we know
                    them to be atheists. Some are called Marcians, and some Valentinians, and some
                    Basilidians, and some Saturnilians, and others by other names.” Now this mere
                    mention of the Valentinians as one of a number of abhorred sects, with whom the
                    writer has nothing in common, scarcely seems to prove any minute acquaintance on
                    the part of Justin with the opinions or books in use among the Valentinians. But
                    even if it be proved, what is the consequence? Surely this, that Justin, knowing
                    the Fourth Gospel to be freely used by a sect which he stigmatizes by name,
                    altogether abstained from using it himself. Irenaeus, who uses the Fourth
                    Gospel, accuses the Valentinians of misusing it; Justin, who does not use the
                    Gospel, brings no such accusation. The natural inference is (if any inference at
                    all is to be drawn from such slight premises) that either he did not know of the
                    existence of the Gospel or of its misuse, or that he knew of its existence and
                    use but did not recognize its authority.</p>
                <p>Two more instances must conclude the list. It is found that both Justin and John
                    alter the quotations of Zech, xii. 10 from the LXX. version <hi rend="italic"
                    >[i7rιβλiψοrταL πpος μe &lt;ivθ</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">ωv κaτωρχpσavτο)</hi>

                    whom they pierced;” and the Apocalypse (i. 7) also contains the same word in
                    “they also which pierced Him.” But this, as we have seen above, especially as it
                    involves a return to the Hebrew text, is perfectly explicable on the same
                    grounds as those which explain prophecies similarly quoted by the
                    synoptists∙—viz., a common “ecclesiastical use.” Still less can anything but
                    floating tradition be inferred from such an allusion as is contained in
                    Polycarp’s Epistle to the Philadelphians: “The Spirit, coming from God, is not
                    to be deceived; for it knoweth <pb break="no"

                    >(Gospels,</hi> p. 275), imply “an association of ideas,” yet, as the same
                    writer remarks, the thought is different. Polycarp says, “The Spirit knoweth
                    whence it cometh;” John says, “We know not whence the Spirit cometh.” This
                    indicates that Polycarp is vaguely alluding to oral and traditional doctrines
                    current in his province (familiar, perhaps, but by no means as yet
                    authoritative), rather than quoting from a Gospel known to be written by one of
                    the foremost of the apostles, the “beloved disciple of the Lord.”<note

                    Polycarp, “the Spirit is not to bo deceived,” and that Polycarp's words indicate
                    rather a vague reminiscence of tradition than a quotation from a Gospel
                    supported by the authority of the apostle John.</p></note></p>
                <p>But it is urged (1) that Justin has the doctrine of the Christian, as
                    distinguished from the Alexandrian, Logos; (2) that he could not have had
                    originality enough to develop this himself, and therefore (3) he must have
                    borrowed this method of thought from the Fourth Gospel. And the following
                    expressions are quoted: “Jesus Christ is, in the proper sense (iδiωs), the only
                    Son begotten of God, being His Word <hi rend="italic">(λ6yοs),</hi> and
                    First-born, and Power <hi rend="italic">(Πρωτ0τοκοs κal ∆vvaμιs)</hi>;” “But His
                    Son, who alone is rightly <hi rend="italic">(κυpiωs)</hi> called Son, who before
                    all created things was with Him and begotten of Him as His Word, when in the
                    beginning He created and ordered all things through Him,” &amp;c.; “Now, next in
                    order to the Father and Lord of all, the first Power (who indeed may also be
                    called Son) is the Word, concerning whom we shall relate, in what follows, how
                    being made flesh <hi rend="italic">(σapκοποιηθεis)</hi> He became man;” “The

                    >Colossians,</hi> i. 15).</p>
                <p>But it can be shown (1) that all these thoughts were suggested, and many of these
                    expressions actually used, by Philo in Alexandria (40 A.ι&gt;.), about a hundred
                    years before Justin wrote; (2) that the personification of the Wisdom of God
                    (and Logos means Wisdom as well as Word) in the books of Proverbs and Wisdom
                    rendered it necessary for orthodox Christians, who accepted these books, to
                    identify this personified Wisdom with Christ; (3) that the generally recognized
                    Messianic reference of Ps. lxxxix. 27, e ’ γω <hi rend="italic"
                    >πρωτότοκον</hi><hi rend="italic">θησoμaι</hi><hi rend="italic">αυτόν,</hi>
                    leading to the comment, “I will make King Messiah a First-born,” resulted in a
                    recognition of “the First-born” (&lt;5 Πρωτότοκον, "l <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> ∣23) used absolutely, as a title of the Messiah (Lightfoot, <hi
                    rend="italic">Col.</hi> i. 15);'(4) that those elements of the Alexandrian
                    theory of the Logos which are inconsistent with the Christian theory furnish no
                    proof at all that the Christian theory was independent of the Alexandrian. It
                    was inevitable that, when the Christians borrowed, they would adopt what was
                    consistent, and discard what was inconsistent, with the belief in the
                    incarnation of Christ.</p>
                <p>There is abundant evidence to prove these propositions. Even before Paul wrote
                    the Epistle to the Colossians, and <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> before the
                    composition of the Fourth Gospel, that instinct which compels men to set the
                    First Cause of all at a distance from matter had impelled Alexandrian Judaism to
                    adopt the belief that the supreme God did not Himself directly and immediately
                    create the world, or manifest Himself to mankind, but indirectly and mediately,
                    through some medium or mediator. The simplest and subtlest metaphor to express
                    this mediateness was Word—more especially in the Greek language, where Word
                    (Λ&lt;!γos) might mean reason as well as speech, the word in the thought as well
                    as the word in the sound. Man manifests himself through deeds as well as words;
                    but for the Supreme (with whom to speak is to do) the only necessary
                    manifestation was the Word, the Logos. Dr Lightfoot has shown (Col. i. 16) that
                    Philo sometimes regards the Logos as a merely passive instrument, so that he
                    allows himself to use the simple instrumental dative <hi rend="italic">(φ)</hi>
                    to describe the relation of the Word to the Creator (ώ <hi rend="italic"
                    >καί</hi><hi rend="italic">τbv</hi><hi rend="italic">κόσμον</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ε'ρyaζeτo), “</hi> which mode of speaking is not found in the New
                    Testament:” and elsewhere Philo, even where he uses the prepositional
                    construction (δι ’ <hi rend="italic">ob),</hi> expressly likens the world to a
                    house, the Supreme to the builder, and the Logos to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >opyavov</hi> or tool <hi rend="italic">(Of Cain and his Birth,</hi> ch. xxxv.
                    ). Moreover, as a city, while as yet only existing in the conception of the
                    architect, may be said to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> the reason of the architect,
                    so the world (regarded as perceptible only to the intellect) is said to <hi
                    rend="italic">be</hi> the Logos or reason of God busying itself in the work of
                    creation (<hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">World,</hi> vi.). Philo
                    also describes the Logos as “the archetypal model, the idea of ideas.” These
                    passages undoubtedly indicate a great gulf between the Christian and Alexandrian
                    Logos. But other passages abound, which Christians could adopt unchanged,
                    applying them to the incarnate Christ; in particular, the passage quoted above
                    <hi rend="italic">(On Dreams,</hi> ii. 38), where the Word of God is described
                    as “the cup-bearer of God;” and here follow words which would be fraught with
                    eucharistie meaning for a Christian—“the Master of the feast .... not differing
                    from the draught itself.” Again, the Word is said (<hi rend="italic">Who is the
                    Heir,</hi> ch. xxxix.) to divide in equal portions among all that are to use it
                    the heavenly food of the soul which Moses calls manna; and the Word is expressly
                    said to be a Person in the following passage <hi rend="italic">(Questions and
                    Solutions,</hi> 62)— <hi rend="italic">Question'.</hi> “Why is it that He speaks
                    as if of some other god, saying, He made man after the image of God, and not
                    that He made him after His own image ?” <hi rend="italic">Solution·.</hi> “Very
                    appropriately and without any falsehood was this oracular sentence uttered by
                    God; for no mortal thing could have been formed on the similitude of the supreme
                    Father of the universe, but only after the pattern of the second Deity, who is
                    the Word of the Supreme Being.” Even where Philo describes the Word as the
                    instrument of creation, he speaks of it or Him as “the image <hi rend="italic"
                    >(είκών)</hi> of God” <hi rend="italic">(On Monarchy,</hi> ii. 5): “The Image of
                    God is the Word by whom all the world was framed (ίδημιουργίΐτο).” Further, the
                    Word is frequently called by Philo the “First-begotten <hi rend="italic"
                    >(πρωτ0yovov)</hi> Son” and “Eldest Soil." The prophecy of Zechariah (vi. 12,
                    according to the LXX.) “Behold a man, the East is his name,” which is twice
                    applied by Justin <hi rend="italic">(Dialoglie,</hi> cvi. and cxxi.) to Jesus
                    the Son of God, was applied with curious similarity and difference a hundred
                    years before by Philo, who, although he finds it inappropriate for “a man
                    compounded of body and soul,” sees in it a singular appropriateness to “that
                    incorporeal Being who in no respect differs from a divine image For the</p>
                <p>Father of the Universe has caused Him to spring up as the Eldest Son” <hi

                    indicates a plurality of beings, unless we are to suppose that God is conversing
                    with his own virtues;” but Philo seems to incline to the personal
                    theory.</p></note> Many of the very expressions which are sometimes used to show
                    that the Logos of the Alexandrians was impersonal are found applied to God in
                    the Old Testament, or to Christ in the New. For example, if Philo calls the
                    world the “garment” of the Logos, the Psalmist also (Ps. civ. 2), appealing to
                    the Lord his God, says, “Thou coverest Thyself with light a« with a garment;’’
                    or if the Logos is described by Philo as the “bond” which holds the world
                    together, so also does Paul describe Christ as the Being in whom “all things
                    cohere” <hi rend="italic">(τh</hi><hi rend="italic">πάντα</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >σweστηκεv,</hi> Col. i. 17). Nayq further, he attributes to the Logos that
                    function of “reproving” or “convincing” <hi rend="italic">(ελ,ίγχειν)</hi> which
                    is so strikingly assigned in the Fourth Gospel to the Spirit of the ascended
                    Christ (Jo. xvi. 8), “And when He is come, He will reprove <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ελεyξεi)</hi> the world of sin;” compare Philo—who also adds a remark that
                    suggests the thought (Jo. i. 9) of “the Light that lighteth every man"—“As long
                    as the <hi rend="italic">divine Word</hi> has not come to our soul, all its
                    actions are blameless; but when the priest, conviction (or “reproval,”
                    2λ∈∙&gt;χos), enteis our heart like a most pure ray of light, then we see that
                    our actions are liable to blame” <hi rend="italic">(On the Unchangeableness of
                    God,</hi> 28),</p>
                <p>In the face of all these passages (and many others might be quoted) the
                    difficulty would seem to be, at first sight, not to prove that the Alexandrian
                    theory of the Logos was the parent of the Christian theory, but to find any
                    difference between the two. The difference, however, is in reality very great,
                    and very readily explained. Philo looked on the manifestation of God through the
                    Logos as being the old inferior dispensation, while the new dispensation was to
                    be the manifestation of the Supreme as τδ <hi rend="italic">ov,</hi> absolute
                    Being. The Logos manifestation of Philo was a manifestation of God through
                    visible creation; the higher manifestation was to be independent of visible
                    objects. The former was the manifestation of “God as man”— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> as liable to anger, change, repentance, &amp;c.; it was also <hi
                    rend="italic">(On the Unchangeableness of God,</hi> xi.) an appeal to fear
                    through rewards and punishments, not strictly true, and not intended for the
                    esoteric sage, but only for the unspiritual multitude. The latter, on the other
                    hand, was the manifestation of God as not man—a fatherly revelation, appealing
                    to love. It followed that Philo not only did not identify his Logos with the
                    Messiah, but would have regarded any such identification with one who had
                    “become flesh” as a degradation. It followed also that, although Philo declared
                    the highest revelation to be a revelation of love, there was really no basis for
                    love at all in it. Of God as τδ <hi rend="italic">ov,</hi> Philo could not say
                    that He was good, or holy, or loving, because He was superior to all goodness,
                    holiness, and love: “His existence indeed is a fact which we do comprehend
                    concerning Hh <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> j but
                    beyond the fact of His existence we can understand nothing” <hi rend="italic"

                    themselves trained up in the Alexandrian theory, and now superadding to it the
                    belief in an incarnate Son of God—and what would be the consequence? Not,
                    surely, that they would cast the Logos theory aside as baseless; for how could
                    they deny that “by the Word of the Lord were the heavens made”? or how cancel
                    the words of Wisdom in the book of Proverbs (viii. 22-30), “The Lord possessed
                    Me in the beginning of His way, before His works of old. . . . When He prepared
                    the heavens I was there. . . . I was by Him as one brought up with Him; and I
                    was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him’’? Paul might possibly eschew
                    the actual use of the word Logos, as savouring of men’s philosophy, and alter
                    the <hi rend="italic">πpωτ&lt;iyovos,</hi> “First-begotten,” of Philo into <hi

                    from the former title, that the Lord, being First-begotten, was not
                    “Only-begotten but how could he, or any Christian who believed Christ to be the
                    Redeemer of all mankind and the Eternal Son of God, do other than adopt the Old
                    Testament theory about the Word of God, and at the same time Philo’s language,
                    so far as it was personal, while discarding all that was impersonal? If Christ
                    was not identical with the Word of God and the Wisdom of God, then there seemed
                    to follow the intolerable inference that He must be inferior to it; but if He
                    was identical with it, then the introduction of Philo’s felicitous language into
                    Christian thought was simply a matter of time.</p>
                <p>The introduction would be a very easy process, requiring nothing but a few
                    omissions of expressions implying passive instrumentality <hi rend="italic"
                    >{e.g.,</hi> the instrumental dative), and the addition of an emphatic protest
                    that the manifestation of the Supreme as Love, even though it were through
                    visible objects,—yes, even though it were through the Word of God becoming
                    “flesh,”—nevertheless constituted not an inferior but a superior revelation, the
                    highest revelation of all. To the Logos theory of Philo, which stated that all
                    men were made in the image of the Word, the Christians could add that, through
                    forgiveness and by faith, fallen mankind was destined also to be raised up and
                    conformed to that Word, so that He was the goal as well as the starting-point,
                    the ∩ as well as the A; or, as Paul expresses it, “All things are not only
                    created in Him,” but “to Him (eis <hi rend="italic">αυτόν),”</hi> Col. i. 16
                    (Lightfoot). This is accordingly ex- !)ressed emphatically in the Fourth Gospel.
                    Although “no man ιath seen God at any time,” yet “the only begotten Son, who is
                    in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him” (Jo. i. 18); and again, “Have
                    I been so long with you, and hast thou not known Me, Philip? he that hath seen
                    Me hath seen the Father” (Jo. xiv. 9).</p>
                <p>This is the full Christian development of Philo’s doctrine, as applied to the
                    “First-born” becoming “flesh.” But there is not only no evidence that Justin
                    quotes from any written document exhibiting this development, but rather
                    evidence to the contrary, that his doctrine of the Logos, though affected by the
                    teaching of the Ephesian school, had not yet been imbued with it. For, in
                    speaking of baptism, he calls attention to the faet that, in that rite, God is
                    mentioned <hi rend="italic">only</hi> by the name of “God the Father and Lord of
                    the Universe; for,” he continues, “no man can utter the name of the ineffable
                    God; and if any one dare to say that there is a name he is incurably mad” <hi
                    rend="italic">{First Apology,</hi> lxi.). Looked at in the light of the context,
                    this word <hi rend="italic">6,pρ-ητos,</hi> “ineffable,” implies a conception of
                    the revelation of God through Christ hardly reaching the level of the Ephesian
                    doctrine, which teaches that, though God had never been seen, He had been <hi
                    rend="italic">declared</hi> by the only begotten Son, so that whoso had seen Him
                    had seen the Father. But it is in harmony with what Justin says soon afterwards
                    <hi rend="italic">{Ib.</hi> lxiii.), that Jesus is also called “Angel” and
                    “Apostle” (compare also Heb. iii. 1); and it harmonizes well too with the
                    doctrine of Philo, that “no mortal thing could have been framed in the
                    similitude of the supreme Father of the universe, but only after the pattern of
                    the second Deity, who is the Word of the Supreme Being ' <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Solutions,</hi> 62).</p>
                <p>It appears therefore that, although Justin knew certain traditions embodied in
                    the Fourth Gospel, yet (1) it was not real in the church services of the
                    district in the same way as the “memoirs of the apostles”; (2) he did not use
                    the Gospel as an authoritative document; (3) his teaching exhibits less of
                    development than the teaching of the Fourth Gospel. An inevitable inference
                    follows that, if he knew of the existence of the Fourth Gospel as a document, he
                    did not believe it to be the work of the apostle John.</p>
                <p>The general conclusion to which we are thus led by the external evidence of
                    quotations is that, although some of the <hi rend="italic">doctrine</hi> of the
                    Fourth Gospel, expressed in words similar to the words of the Fourth Gospel, was
                    probably current in the Ephesian church towards the end of the first half of the
                    second century, yet it was not by that time widely used, if at all, as an
                    authoritative document; nor have we proof that it was so used till the times of
                    Irenaeus, t.e., towards the end of the second century, by which time the Gospel
                    was authoritatively quoted as a work of John; and those who so quoted it
                    probably meant by “John” John, the son of Zebedee, the apostle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Internal Evidence.</hi><hi rend="italic">The Fourth Gospel
                    compared with the Synoptic Narrative.</hi> —In estimating the Fourth Gospel as a
                    history, we must necessarily attach a special importance to those portions in it
                    which cover the synoptic ground; for these will afford us the best means of
                    judging how far the facts of the life of Christ, as well as the language of
                    Christ may have been transmuted by the author. We will therefore first consider
                    those parts of the Fourth Gospel which afford us an opportunity of comparing it
                    with the Gospels of the synoptists.</p>
                <p>The first point of comparison is the greater scope of the Fourth Gospel as
                    compared with the other three. It includes all past time in its prologue, and
                    exhibits the incarnation of the divine Word as but one act in the drama of the
                    universe.</p>
                <p>Nor is its scope in space narrower than in time. The limited scenery of the
                    synoptic stage—Galilee, Samaria, Judaea,—is (in spirit, though not in letter)
                    exchanged here for “the world.” As Philo tells us that the tabernacle figured
                    the universe, and that the robes of the high priest represented (J/bsw, iii. 12)
                    the different parts of the world, so the High Priest of the Fourth Gospel,
                    though speaking or working in a narrow province of Syria, is always regarded as
                    officiating at the altar steps of the universe, and bearing with Him the
                    destinies of humanity. “The world” is continually on His lips; and John the
                    Baptist is made to proclaim, even at the very outset of the Messiah’s career,
                    that the Lamb of God will take away the sins, not of “the Jews,” but of “the
                    world.” It is true that Judaism is not ignored. Prophecy is constantly appealed
                    to; and the motive of the Gospel is undoubtedly to show that Jesus is “the
                    Christ” (xx. 31), as well as to show that He is the Son of God. Yet nowhere in
                    the Fourth Gospel is found any marked distinction between the Gentiles and
                    Samaritans on the one side and the Jews on the other, as if the former must be
                    neglected for a time (Matt. x. <hi rend="italic">5;</hi> Lu. ix. 52), and as if
                    the latter were entitled to priority in the offer of salvation; on the contrary,
                    Christ is described, early in the narrative, as preaching to the Samaritans, and
                    the Samaritan faith (far more general than the isolated case of the Samaritan
                    leper in Luke) serves as a foil to the Jewish unbelief. “The Jews,” so far as
                    they are distinguished from others, appear throughout as a nation with whom the
                    writer has no sympathy, as the emblem of rebellious, unspiritual
                    scepticism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The passages
                    iv. 22; x. 16; xi. 52, though they give a kind of precedence to the Jews, yet
                    treat of the passing of salvation from the Jews to the Gentiles, in the way of
                    climax; and these two or three passages (which occur in dialogue and not in
                    narrative) cannot count for anything against the forty or fifty passages wherein
                    the author, in his own person, speaks of “the Jews” as “murmuring,” “seeking to
                    slay Jesus,” “taking up stones to stone Him,” and always systematically opposing
                    themselves to Jesus.</p></note> Viewing the drama at a greater distance of time
                    than the synoptists, and purposely withdrawing himself to a still more
                    subjectively distant point of view, for the purpose of unity and compression,
                    the author almost <pb break="no"

                    Sadducees, Herodiaus, scribes, and lawyers, with which the synoptists have made
                    us familiar. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Palestine is seen no longer with the
                    distinctions of a neighbouring diversified coast-line, but like a dark mass upon
                    the horizon of the distant East, serving as a foil to the splendour of the
                    rising Sun of Righteousness, which it strives in vain to obscure.</p>
                <p>In the miraculous part of our evangelist’s narrative especially, there is visible
                    this artistic power of selection and compression. Few miracles are described,
                    not more than eight in all (including the post-resurrection miracle of the
                    draught of fishes), and among these not a single case of exorcism. The element
                    of mere wonder (which comes too prominently forward, at least for a pupil of
                    Philo, in the synoptic miracle on the Gadarene) is carefully subordinated to the
                    symbolical element. It is true that the whole Gospel breathes a supernatural
                    atmosphere. Although the Logos, becoming “flesh” (i. 14), is immediately
                    afterwards called Jesus (i. 17) or the Son (i. 18), and is never henceforth
                    mentioned by the name Logos throughout the whole of the Gospel, yet in reality
                    it is still the Logos, rather than Jesus, that is "described in the following
                    pages. The Logos is never (as in Mark) “unable” to work miracles, never liable
                    to “marvel,” never “in an agony,” never (with the single exception of the scene
                    at the grave of Lazarus in which <hi rend="italic">cτapaξer eaυτov,</hi> John
                    xi. 33) “sorrowful and very heavy;” the words ∈λεos, ∈λεειv, <hi rend="italic"
                    >σπλaγχylζopai</hi> occur repeatedly in the synoptists, never in the Fourth
                    Gospel; the Logos “knows what is in man,” sees Nathaniel “under the fig-tree,”
                    discerns from the first that one of the twelve whom He had chosen is “a devil”;
                    when He asks advice from His followers, it is a mere form, merely “to prove
                    them,for He Himself knew what He would do”; there is not in the drama of the
                    Fourth Gospel (as in Mark) any development of thought or plan in the chief
                    actor; the development must be looked for in the drama taken as a whole, and
                    including the creation, the fall, and all the preparation of the world for the
                    coming of the Word as flesh; but the life of Christ on earth is, in the Fourth
                    Gospel, only one act as it were, in which the previous action of the drama is
                    simply carried on apd sustained; the whole of the future, His destined “lifting
                    up,” His death, His rising in three days, all lie mapped out before the Saviour,
                    so that He walks in a known country and in light, while all around, friends and
                    foes alike, are stumbling or groping in the dark. In this sense, therefore, it
                    is true that the supernatural element is even more prominent in the Fourth
                    Gospel than in the synoptists. But the miracles themselves are subordinated.
                    Though frequent reference is made to the vast number of them (ii. 23; iii. 2;
                    vi. 2; vii. 31; ix. 16; xi. 47; xii. 37; XX. 30), yet, not only are very few
                    described, but even those few are described rather as “emblems” than as “mighty
                    works.” It is remarkable that the word <hi rend="italic">σηp-eia</hi> (“signs
                    ”), which the synoptists almost always use in a bad sense (to denote the “sign
                    from heaven” demanded by the Pharisees, or the “signs” which the false Christs
                    shall work to deceive, if it were possible, even the elect, Mk. xiii. 22), is
                    the very word selected by John to describe the miracles of Jesus; while the word
                    δw&lt;ψ,cις (“mighty works ”), which in the synoptists generally denotes the
                    works of Jesus, is never used in the Fourth Gospel. Partly, no doubt, the author
                    may have felt that miracles were made cheap by excessive enumeration, and that
                    the narrative of a multitude of miracles without apparent motive created a
                    stumbling-block rather than a help to philosophic and educated readers.
                    Especially might this be felt in Ephesus, the home of wizards and wonders and
                    “curious arts” (Acts xix. 19), where even the last-called of the apostles had
                    worked cures and exorcisms past numbering <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 12).
                    Accordingly the author, though he makes mention of very many miracles, describes
                    none but those which are obviously emblematic. It has been stated above that the
                    1st Epistle of John was not only written by the author of the Fourth Gospel, but
                    must be considered as a kind of postscript or appendix, commending the Gospel to
                    the church. Remembering, therefore, the important passage in the Epistle (I Jo.
                    v. 8), which describes the three witnesses on earth as breath (or spirit),
                    water, and blood, and bearing in mind that “blood” in all probability has (among
                    other possible meanings) a reference to the eucharistie wine, we shall not be
                    surprised that the first miracle of all describes the changing of the water into
                    wine. Next is a miracle exemplifying the power of the word of Jesus, where faith
                    is present (iv. 50, and <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> iv. 41); then the Messiah
                    manifests (in the cure of the impotent man) the superiority of the ever-flowing
                    fountain of life to the intermittent power of the pool of the law (v. 3); then
                    comes the eucharistie feeding of the five thousand with bread and fishes,
                    wherein “the Lord gave thanks,” <hi rend="italic">cvχapLστησavτo&lt;s</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">τον Κυρίου</hi> (vi. 23), followed by the walking on the water,
                    which is also appended by Matthew and Mark to the eucharistie miracle; then the
                    opening of the eyes of the blind by Him who was the Light of the world (ix. 5);
                    the raising of Lazarus by Him who was the Resurrection and the Life (xi. 25);
                    and lastly, the miraculous draught of fishes, taken at the command of Him who
                    had sent His apostles to be fishers of men, and to cast the net of the gospel
                    (xxi. 6).</p>
                <p>In all these narratives, although the common people are exhibited as
                    wonder-struck, yet the impression left on the reader is that, for the Word of
                    God, such works are matters of course, and only important because of their inner
                    spiritual meaning. Philo says <hi rend="italic">(Life of Moses,</hi> i. 38) that
                    such miracles as the production of the water from the rock by Moses and the like
                    are the sports (7rαiγμια) of God, and not so really great or deserving of
                    serious attention as the revolutions of the planets. There is no trace of
                    “sport” in any of the works of the Word of God narrated by the author of the
                    Fourth Gospel; yet both he and Philo agree in looking through the letter of the
                    narrative of every miracle to the spiritual essence contained in it, which alone
                    constitutes the importance of the act. Now Philo, in speaking of the creation of
                    Eve from the rib of Adam, declares at once that the literal meaning is fabulous
                    (μ,υ0ωδeς); whereas he treats the emission of the water from the rock as
                    historical, although he suggests, as a first explanation, that possibly there
                    may have been a latent spring in the rock. Yet Philo proceeds to deduce his
                    spiritual inferences as freely from what he deems “fabulous” as from what he
                    deems historical. It is not necessary to assume in the author of the Fourth
                    Gospel precisely the same indifference to the distinction between spiritual and
                    historical narrative; but it appears certain that, in his writings, as in
                    Philo’s, the historical is subordinated to the spiritual. Not but that the
                    picturesque incidents of each miracle receive from him due attention; but it
                    seems to be for the most part the picturesqueness resulting from the skill of a
                    graphic teacher, rather than from the memory of an eye-witness. Compare, for
                    example, Mark’s with John’s account of the feeding of the five thousand. There
                    is less motive, less <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> It has been ingeniously
                    suggested that a distinction is drawn by the author between the “Jews” in the

                    the mixed multitude of pilgrims in Jerusalem at the Passover (xii. 12, 17, 18,
                    29, 34); and besides, if the author had intended to deny any such distinction,
                    he could hardly have expressed himself more cogently than in xii. 9, where he
                    adds that this “multitude was of the ‘ Jews (ii^λos τroλvs <hi rend="italic"

                <p>art, about Mark’s detail than about John’s. John’s omissions and additions <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> all point to one object, the desire to heighten the
                    Logos and to subordinate the disciples and the crowd. Mark begins by saying that
                    “Jesus had compassion on the multitude;” but the Logos, knowing beforehand “what
                    He would do,” determines His course at once as soon as He “lifts up His eyes”
                    and discerns the multitude. In Mark, the disciples come to Jesus begging Him to
                    send the multitude away; in John, it is Jesus who first “proves” one of the
                    disciples with the question, “Whence shall we buy bread that they may eat ?”
                    Then (giving a picturesque variety to the story) Andrew, as well as Philip, and
                    a servant-lad (παιδάριον) are introduced, the latter carrying the <hi
                    rend="italic">viaticum</hi> of the apostles. The loaves, a new circumstance not
                    found in the synoptists, are of an inferior kind, “barley;” and Andrew bases an
                    expostulation on the smallness of the provision. After the command to “sit
                    down,” Mark says that they sat “down on the green grass,” an epithet natural
                    enough for a speaker perhaps, but inartistic, because too prominent, in a
                    written narrative. John, on the other hand, turns a defect into an excellence,
                    by judiciously connecting the “grass” with the command to sit down, so as to
                    enhance the forethought of the wise Master of the feast, who made provision for
                    the comfort of His guests in the minutest details: “Jesus said, Make the men sit
                    down. Now there was much grass in the place.” Lastly, in the synoptic narrative,
                    the gathering of the fragments is the spontaneous act of the disciples; but in
                    John, the feast ends as it began, with the display of the wisdom of the Master,
                    even in the smallest matters, “Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing
                    may be lost.” It is scarcely possible to deny that, in the symmetrical manner iu
                    which the story gathers itself around the Logos as its object and centre, the
                    narrative of the Fourth Gospel is far superior to that of the synoptists, and
                    that many of the additional touches of the former are dictated by what has been
                    happily described by Canon Westcott as “an instinctive perception of symmetry in
                    thought and expression.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The only points in which this narrative can be illustrated by Philo’s
                    remarks <hi rend="italic">(Alleg.,</hi> iii. 56-3) on the manna are two or
                    perhaps three;—(1) As Philo says that the soul is fed not by earthly food but by
                    “words,” so the Gospel says that “words” are the source of life (vi. 63); (2)
                    Philo, speaking of the manna, praises those who seek the food for its own sake
                    and not for ulterior advantage; compare John vi. 26 on the “loaves and fishes;”
                    (3) Philo, speaking of the object of the miracle, quotes Exod. xvi. <hi

                <p>The same remark applies to the other miracle which John has in common with

                    assumption of their identity.</p></note> Every detail of difference in John
                    heightens the dignity of the Saviour. Tn the synoptic account, Jesus offers to
                    go to the house to heal the youth; in John, no such offer is made, and the
                    nobleman and his companions are accosted with a rebuke, “Except ye see signs and
                    wonders, ye will not believe.” In the synoptists, the man is represented as
                    living at Capernaum, and Jesus as entering Capernaum, so that the father sends
                    but a short distance; in John, Jesus is represented as remaining at Cana, while
                    the suppliant father journeys thither in person from Capernaum, a distance of
                    twenty-five miles. In the synoptists, the father sends a message, praying Jesus
                    not to trouble <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> Limself to enter his roof, but to
                    “speak the word only;” in John, the father piteously supplicates the Saviour to
                    “Come down, ere my child die.” In the synoptists, it is recorded that Jesus
                    “marvelled”; in the Fourth Gospel, He simply pronounces the authoritative
                    words,</p>
                <p>“Go thy way, thy son liveth.” In the synoptists, Jesus avails Himself of this
                    incident to proclaim, almost as if it were (and probably it was) a development
                    of His work suddenly revealed to Him by His Father, that many of the Gentiles
                    shall be admitted into the kingdom; in the Fourth Gospel, which exhibits no
                    development, these words would necessarily seem out of place, and are omitted.
                    Contrast could scarcely be more complete; and it is not surprising that many
                    commentators, rather than identify such opposites, prefer to suppose that, about
                    the same time in the life of Jesus, two men, both in high positions, had sons at
                    the point of death, in the same place (Capernaum), both of whom petitioned Jesus
                    to heal their children, and both of whom obtained from Him miraculous cure,
                    performed at a distance from the two patients. To some, however, as to the
                    candid author of <hi rend="italic">The Authorship and Historical Character of
                    the Fourth Gospel,</hi> it will appear more probable that we have the same
                    event, differently described. But those who accept the theory of identity ought
                    to consider how much is involved in it. For the defenders of the difference of
                    the two miracles are undoubtedly justified in drawing a contrast between them in
                    almost every point of spiritual importance (Augustine, <hi rend="italic">Ev.
                    Joh. Tract.,</hi> 16). If, therefore, the Fourth Gospel is historically
                    accurate, then (on the supposition of the identity of these two narratives) the
                    three synoptic Gospels are historically inaccurate; but if the synoptic
                    narrative is historically accurate, the narrative of the Fourth Gospel must be
                    considered rather a new dramatic version, than an independent historical
                    account; and the same remark will necessarily apply to, and affect our estimate
                    of, all the accounts of miracles in the Fourth Gospel.</p>
                <p>Gaining light thus from the comparison of the Fourth Gospel with the synoptists,
                    wherever they occupy common ground, we shall find it useful, before proceeding
                    to the summary of the Fourth Gospel, first to touch on the few remaining points
                    which the fourth has in common with one or more of the three. Luke contains most
                    of these. For example, if we accept the passages Lu. xxiv. 12, xxiv. 40, as
                    being not interpolations, though perhaps additions made by the author to a
                    subsequent edition of his Gospel, it will follow that, in the account of the
                    resurrection, Luke and John agree identically in adopting the traditions (1)
                    that Peter “beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves in the sepulchre;” (2)
                    that the Lord showed His disciples, after His resurrection, His wounded body in
                    token of His identity. In both these cases several minute details are added by
                    John; and this also applies to another important incident which Luke and John
                    have in common, viz., the “entering of Satan” into Judas. Luke records it
                    briefly in two words (xxii. 3), and makes the “entrance” occur some time before
                    the last supper; but John, in a far more powerful scene, reserves the “entrance”
                    for the moment when the “sop” is handed to the traitor by the Saviour, and the
                    disciples seated at the last supper. Here again the incident is the same; but
                    the treatment is very different.</p>
                <p>The agony described by Luke (xxii, 44, and, without Luke’s additions, in Mat.
                    xxvi. 39 and Mk. xiv. 35, 36), when the Lord prayed that “the cup might pass
                    from Him,” and when an “angel” appeared from heaven strengthening Him, may seem,
                    at first sight, to have no counterpart in John. And indeed the synoptic
                    description of the agony in Gethsemane is not adapted for the Fourth Gospel.
                    Inserted in any page of that Gospel it could not fail to jar upon us as being
                    out of harmony with the context. Nevertheless, a remarkable passage in John
                    (xii. 27) appears to bear a striking resemblance to the account in Luke: “Now is
                    My soul troubled.” Thus the Saviour <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n850/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0850-0827"/> avows a certain conflict in His heart, yet by the
                    very deliberateness (as well as by the publicity) of the avowal takes from it
                    something of the intense and almost passionate humanity of the synoptic
                    narrative. Immediately after these words the Saviour, in the Fourth Gospel,
                    deliberately suggests to Himself the synoptic prayer, and repeats it: “What
                    shall I say <hi rend="italic">1</hi> ‘ Father, save Me from this hour?’ But for
                    this cause came I to this hour.” At once triumphing over the—from the point of
                    view of the Fourth Gospel—unworthy suggestion, He exclaims, “Father,glorify Thy
                    name.” Upon this comes the heaven-sent message, but not (as in Luke) an angel to
                    “strengthen” one “in an agony praying more earnestly;” on the contrary, the
                    voice does but ratify the Saviour’s utterance: “I have both glorified it, and
                    will glorify it again.” Finally, the author adds, as usual, the babble of the
                    multitude, as a foil to the all-knowing wisdom of the Divine Word: “The people
                    therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered; others said, An
                    angel hath spoken to Him.” No answer to their doubts and questionings is given
                    by Jesus; but we are left under the impression that the “I” is uttered, neither
                    by thunder nor by any mere angel of God, but by the Father Himself. A soul
                    “troubled”; a prayer to be saved from the trouble; the suppression of that
                    prayer, after more or less of conflict, and the substitution of another prayer
                    in its place; and lastly, a message or messenger (αγγ∈λoς) from heaven—the facts
                    are much the same both in Luke and in John, yet how different is the treatment
                    of the facts, and what a world of difference in the spiritual result!</p>
                <p>Almost the only passage in which John adopts a few consecutive words of the
                    synoptic narrative is the narrative of the anointing (xii. 3-8). There is much
                    less similarity between Peter’s confession, as recorded in Jo. vi. 68, and as
                    recorded in Mat. xvi. 16; Mk. viii. 30; Lu. ix. 20; but the narratives appear to
                    refer to the same event, and if so, the comparison between the two is most
                    instructive. In Matthew and Mark the confession of Peter constitutes a
                    turning-point in the life of Jesus; it is the sign which convinces Him that, the
                    seed of a living faith having been sown, His work is now done, and that the hour
                    of His departure is at hand: “From that time forth” (Mat. xvi. 21; Mk. viii. 31)
                    “began Jesus to show unto His disciples how that He must go unto Jerusalem, and
                    suffer,” &amp;c.; and accordingly the Lord prepares the disciples with the
                    greatest care, and even tenderness, for the all-important answer to the question
                    which He is to put to them, “Whom say ye that I am ?” and when the question is
                    answered, pronounces a fervent blessing on Simon, the son of Jona, but better
                    called Cephas, a rock, whose faithful confession is the token of the laying of
                    the foundation stone of the new temple. If Jesus is to be regarded as a man,
                    “who, though He were a Sen, yet learned obedience by the things which He
                    suffered” (Heb. v. 8), then in the whole synoptic narrative of the life of
                    Christ there is not a more important crisis than this. But in the Johannine
                    narrative crises are altogether out of place, where all is pre-ordained; and
                    instead of the tender questioning, the inspired confession, and the fervent
                    blessing, we have simply an almost casual appeal of the Lord to His disciples,
                    “Will ye also depart?” which, when a response has been made by Peter, is
                    followed, not by a blessing, but by sad words conveying the assurance that the
                    Word of God, who chose the twelve, knows all their weakness as well as their
                    strength, and cannot be surprised either by confession or by betrayal: “Jesus
                    answered, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?” Both in the
                    Fourth Gospel and in the synoptists (Mat. xvi. 23; Mk. ix. 33), immediately
                    after the blessing of Peter, mention is made of “Satan” or “Devil.” To bless
                    Peter, and to call him “Satan” immediately afterwards, is consistent with the
                    human Christ described by Mark and Matthew. The difficulty is avoided, in Luke,
                    by omission; but the Fourth Gospel, retaining the traditional mention of the
                    word “Satan,” or “Devil,” directs it to Judas; upon whom elsewhere the Fourth
                    Gospel (xii. 4-8) concentrates the faults imputed by Matthew (xxvi. 8) not to
                    Judas alone but to all the disciples.</p>
                <p>Readers who may think that this last dislocation of the words of Jesus appears
                    somewhat improbable should consider carefully the patent instance which follows.
                    In the synoptic account of the betrayal, Matthew and Mark represent Jesus as
                    awaking the sleeping disciples (at the moment of the arrival of the traitor and
                    his band), with the words, “Rise, let us be going (∈γ∈φ∈σ0e, <hi rend="italic"
                    >aγωμev).</hi> Behold, he that betrayeth Me is at hand” (Mat. xxvi. 46; Mk. xiv.
                    42), Luke alters this; it is too human for him, seeming to imply flight; and
                    therefore he substitutes a command, in the second person, “Rise up and pray,
                    lest ye enter into temptation” (Lu. xxii. 46). But John, while averse to this
                    change of the traditional words, neutralizes their questionable effect by taking
                    them completely out of their context. Accordingly, he places them between the
                    discourse on peace in ch. xiv. and the discourse on the vine in ch. xv., just at
                    the point when we may suppose the Master with His disciples to be rising from
                    the table, purposing shortly to pass quietly from the lighted upper-room where
                    He had been celebrating the last supper down into the streets of Jerusalem, on
                    His way to Gethsemane. Taken in this context, the words are free from all
                    suspicion of haste or trepidation; on the contrary, they betoken
                    authoritativeness and decision. Rising from the sacred meal, and going forth to
                    welcome “His hour,” the Saviour says,—as if with the consciousness that He is
                    the High Priest of the World, going forth to celebrate the sacrifice
                    foreordained before the foundations of the world,—“But that the world may know
                    that I love the Father, and as the Father gave Me commandment, even so I do.

                <p>The entry into Jerusalem, the crucifixion, and resurrection, are almost the only
                    remaining events common to the Fourth Gospel with the synoptists. The entry is
                    much condensed, and closely connected with the raising of Lazarus (xii. 18); the
                    lengthy account of the sending for the ass is passed over in the words—“Jesus,
                    when He had found a young ass, sat thereon”; and the acclamations of the
                    multitude and the pomp of the procession are all omitted or lightly touched, as
                    if the gleam of popular favour which so impressed the synoptists scarcely
                    deserved the attention it had received from them. It was a mere consequence of
                    the raising of Lazarus: “For this cause the people also met Him, for that they
                    heard that He had done this miracle.” Yet in Matthew (xxi. 11), when the city
                    asks “Who is this?” the crowd replies, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth
                    of Galilee’’—making no mention of the wonder which—according to the Fourth
                    Gospel—was the sole cause of the procession.</p>
                <p>After this, John omits the purification of the temple, which he has placed
                    earlier, at the first visit of Jesus to Jerusalem (ii. 15),<note anchored="true"

                    in the Fourth Gospel as the sermon in Nazareth is to the life of Christ in the
                    Third Gospel. In Luke (the Gospel of mercy), the proclamation of the “healing of
                    the broken-hearted” to His friends at Nazareth; in John (the Gospel of the Word

                    the synoptists, which was preceded by a public procession. Thus prophecy, as
                    well as appropriateness, might induce an account of an early purification of the

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0851-0828"/> the account of the Fourth Gospel with that of the
                    synoptists. In the synoptists the last supper is (apparently) the passover, in
                    which the Lord bequeathes Himself to His disciples as their sacrifice, giving
                    them His body and blood; in John the last supper, so far as he describes it, is
                    merely the last meal shared by the Master and His disciples, at which He washes
                    their feet, and exhorts them to humility, patience, and peace; and it is
                    expressly described as being “before the feast of the passover” (John xiii. 1).
                    Again, in the synoptists, Mark places the crucifixion at the third hour (9 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.μ.),</hi> and the darkness is made by all the synoptists to
                    last from 12 to 3 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.;</hi> but John (who is describing in
                    the crucifixion the sacrifice of the passover, the slaughter of the Lamb of God
                    which was to take away the sins of the world) naturally places the crucifixion
                    later, in order that the Lamb may be slain “between the two evenings,” as
                    prescribed in the law; and therefore he does not place even the delivery of
                    Pilate’s verdict till the sixth hour, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 12 o’clock,
                    and the crucifixion, consequently, later still. The symbolism which prevails in
                    the Fourth Gospel may incline us generally to accept the synoptists’ narrative
                    in preference. But there are special reasons why, at a very early date, a slight
                    misunderstanding, among the Gentile churches, of Jewish custom and of the common
                    tradition may have led to an erroneous supposition that the last supper was the
                    passover meal; and the explanation suggested by Canon Westcott <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Introduction to the Study of the Gospels,</hi> p. 344) seems a very reasonable
                    one. In this case, therefore, the Fourth Gospel must have the credit of
                    dissipating an error which had very early crept into the synoptic narrative
                    (namely, the insertion of the words “The first day of unleavened bread,” Mat.
                    xxvi. 17; Mk. xiv. 12; Lu. xxii. 7); nor is it at all unlikely that this
                    rectification came from the apostle John himself. But as regards the hour of the
                    crucifixion, it seems more likely that the account of Mark is correct, not only
                    because it leaves more time for the burial before sunset, but also because the
                    later hour implied in the Fourth Gospel appears naturally suggested by thi same
                    symbolism which afterwards finds in the wounde I body of Christ a fulfilment of
                    the two prophecies, “A bone of Him shall not be broken,” and “They shall look on
                    Him whom they pierced.”</p>
                <p>Passing now to those details of the crucifixion wherein the Fourth Gospel differs
                    from the synoptists, we find in almost each case but one motive—to enhance the
                    majesty of the Saviour. Even in the arrest of Jesus this motive appeal's. The
                    synoptists tell us that He was arrested by a “crowd” (oχλoς), servants, sent
                    apparently from the houses of <hi rend="italic">(παρά</hi> Mat.; <hi
                    rend="italic">aπo</hi> Mk.) the chief priests and elders; and as the moon shone
                    at the full, so brightly that the disciples could discern their Master from some
                    distance (a stone’s cast), and perceive His agony, as well as hear the words of
                    His prayer in the stillness of the night, they do not think it necessary to make
                    mention of “lights” or “torches.” The Fourth Gospel describes how the “cohort”
                    of the citadel of Antonia is called out, together with the servants of the
                    priests, making up in all, if the whole cohort is meant, five or six hundred
                    men; and these approach, not with “swords and clubs” (as Mk.), but with “torches
                    and lights and arms.” Jesus goes forward to meet them, and intrepidly declares
                    that He is the person whom they are seeking, upon which they “recoiled and fell
                    to tue ground.” Nothing of all this is found in the synoptists.</p>
                <p>Though John agrees with Luke in the tradition that the servant’s ear cut off by
                    Peter was the “right” ear,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    before Herod; but this is in accordance with his fixed purpose— while by no
                    means neglecting graphic and picturesquo detail—to ignore all petty local
                    distinctions, and to draw none but large and clear outlines on his canvas. Rome
                    and “the Jews” alone appear round Christ on the stage of his drama; not one of
                    the Herods is so much as once mentioned from the beginning to the end of it. The
                    irony of providence, by which Pilate is made to proclaim that Jesus is “King of
                    the Jews” (xix. 20), reminds us of the similar irony by which Caiaphas, not
                    speaking “of himself” but inspired by God, is forced to publish the suffering of
                    the Saviour (xi. 51); and both passages are quite in the manner of the Fourth
                    Gospel. So also is the very natural application of the prophecy, “And for My
                    raiment did they cast lots,” to the seamless tunic of Christ. Remembering what
                    stress is laid by our author’s teacher, Philo, on the high priest’s garments <hi
                    rend="italic">(Moses,</hi> 14; <hi rend="italic">Dreams,</hi> 37), which
                    “represent the universe,” tve shall readily perceive that while the outer
                    garment of Christ is freely given to the four quarters of the world, the inner
                    seamless tunic (χtτωv), that which He wears next to His heart, is not to be
                    rent, representing as it does the regenerated world, “those who receive
                    remission of sins through Him” <hi rend="italic">(Dialogue</hi> liv.).<note

                    illustrated by the First Epistle of John.—</hi> It has been said above that the
                    1st Epistle of John is most closely connected with the Gospel. The connexion is
                    so close, in thought as well as in language, that the former may almost be
                    called a summary of the latter. In the Epistle, even more clearly than in the
                    Gospel, we see the author’s habit of dealing rather with elements than with
                    nations or individuals. With the exception of the illustration of “Cain,” which
                    he possibly borrowed from Philo (who uses Cain and Abel to denote the earthly
                    and the spiritual principle, <hi rend="italic">Sacrifices of Cain and Abel,</hi>
                    1), he prefers to dispense with personal illustrations of principles. He does
                    not, like Paul, speak of Abraham, or Hagar, or Sinai,, or Isaac, or Melchisedek,
                    or the Jews, or the Gentiles; but of the world and the flesh, the water, the
                    blood, and the spirit, light and darkness, life and death. In the Epistle, as in
                    the Gospel, we see the rejection of Christ explained, not as a casual outcome of
                    individual caprice or wickedness, but as an inevitable result of the eternal
                    antagonism between light and darkness. In the Epistle, as in the Gospel, the
                    author insists that the new commandment of Christ to “love one another” is
                    really an old commandment which men have had from the beginning: a commandment
                    as old as the promptings of the Light which from the beginning has “lighted
                    every man coming into the world,”—an old commandment only so far made new as it
                    has been brought home to the hearts of men with a quite new intensity by the
                    manifestation of the incarnate Love of God. In tbe Epistle, as in the Gospel, it
                    is recognized that the antagonism between the world and the spirit, oetween
                    light and darkness, must go on without truce till one lias prevailed; and each
                    man must take one or other side, putting away all hope of compromise. There are
                    two principles, says Philo, contrary to and at variance with one another,—the
                    one represented by the God-loving Abel, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n852/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0852-0829"/> other by the self-loving Cain, which must needs
                    be at variance when born, “for it is impossible for enemies to dwell for ever
                    together.” In precisely the same way docs our author illustrate the same
                    antagonism by the same personality: “Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one,
                    and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil
                    and his brother’s righteous”; and then, relapsing from the unfamiliar method of
                    personal illustration into his habitual language about principles or elements,
                    he substitutes for Cain the “world,” and for Abel the “children of God,” and
                    bids his readers “marvel not if the world hate you.”</p>
                <p>In this continuous strife between light and darkness the victory is to be gained
                    by faith,—but faith supported by witnesses; and we read in the Epistle that the
                    object of our victorious faith is “He that came through (διά) water and blood,
                    Jesus Christ; not with the (A τω) water only, but with the water and the blood;
                    and the Spirit is that which beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth;
                    because they that bear witness are three, the spirit (or breath, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">to</hi><hi rend="italic">πνεύμα)</hi> and the water, and the
                    blood, and the three are united so as to make up the one” (∈⅛ <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">to</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">∈</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">v</hi>
                    cι ’ σι) (1 John V. 6-8).</p>
                <p>Passing over many differences of interpretation, and asking, What is the meaning
                    of the water and the blood? we turn to the Gospel, and, in the account of the
                    crucifixion, we find (xix. 34) especial stress laid upon the fact that from the
                    side of Jesus “there came out blood and water; and he that hath seen hath born
                    witness <hi rend="italic">(μeμapτυpηκεv),</hi> and his witness <hi rend="italic"
                    >(μαρτυρία)</hi> is genuine <hi rend="italic">(αληθινή),</hi> and heknoweth that
                    he saith true, that ye might believe.” In what sense is the “blood’’here to be
                    understood? As nourishing? or as cleansing? Almost certainly as cleansing;
                    because above, in this very Epistle, the blood of Jesus is described (i. 7) as
                    cleansing us from all sin. Inferring, then, that the blood signifies a superior
                    purifying or baptismal influence, we necessarily infer simultaneously that the
                    water signifies an inferior baptismal influence. Two purifications are mentioned
                    in all the four Gospels, an inferior and preparatory, and a superior and final:
                    the former is the baptism with water, the latter is the baptism with the Holy
                    Spirit, or (as in Lu. iii. 16) with the Holy Spirit and fire <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi> also Lu. xii. 49). But the conception of “baptism with fire,”— though
                    it is based on the early history of Israel (Num. xxxi. 23), and appears
                    occasionally in the shape of a “fiery trial” of faith, as well as in the fiery
                    tongues of Pentecost—was soon supplanted by one of two other conceptions, either
                    sprinkling with sacrificial blood, or baptism with the Spirit. This higher
                    purification, or baptism with blood, Jesus brought into the world. He not only
                    came working by means of it (διά with gen., as above in the passage quoted, 1
                    John v. 6), but also, in a certain sense, in it (tτ). That is to say, He himself
                    underwent the higher baptism with blood as well as the lower purification with
                    water, which He received from John the Baptist. “Can ye be baptized with the
                    baptism wherewith I shall be baptized? ”—He said to the sons of Zebedee (Mk. x.
                    38). The agony in Gethsemane, which was that baptism, was typified by Luke in an
                    exudation of “sweat, as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground”
                    (Lu. xxii. 44). But this baptism was scarcely public enough to be a sufficient
                    fulfilment of the prophecy which predicted that “In that day there shall be a
                    fountain opened to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for
                    sin and for uncleanness” (Zech, xiii. 1). When it became recognized that the
                    Lord was this “fountain,” and that His blood was the cleansing stream, then the
                    piercing of His side and the visible emission of the purifying blood from the
                    wound became an effective and almost necessary type of the spiritual
                    purification, and the type of the blood of sprinkling, suggested perhaps by Luke
                    in his description of the agony, fell into the background, being supplanted by
                    the more natural type of the pierced side.</p>
                <p>Such a type would all the more commend itself because, without it, the
                    crucifixion might almost seem incomplete. The mere piercing of the hands and the
                    feet might seem an insufficient fulfilment of the prophecy of the “fountain”;
                    and besides, since crucifixion was generally a lingering death extending over
                    many hours, and since the body of Jesus was taken down on the same day on which
                    it had been attached to the cross (and, according to John, only three or four
                    hours after the commencement of the crucifixion), the record of His death,
                    without the spear wound, might seem to justify the statements of those who
                    maintained that Christ never died at all, and that He was a man only in appear,
                    ance. Therefore, as a proof of His humanity and of the reality of His death and
                    sufferings, no less than as a fulfilment of the prophecy of the “fountain,” it
                    was natural that the latest Gospel should insert, and that the church should
                    readily accept, the witness through blood as well as water, which is so
                    emphatically related by the author of the Gospel, and here appealed to by the
                    author of the Epistle.</p>
                <p>But the question remains, What is meant by the connexion of the water and the
                    blood with the breath or spirit —“They that bear witness are three, the breath
                    (or spirit), and the water, and the blood”? Philo may throw light both on the
                    number and on the nature of the witnesses. Only to earthly matters did the rule
                    apply that “in the mouth of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> witnesses shall every
                    word be established :” heavenly matters required, so Philo teaches, “<hi
                    rend="italic">three</hi> witnesses” (άγιον δε <hi rend="italic">πράγμα

                    >Posterity of Cain,</hi> 27). He also calls attention to the fact that Moses
                    declares with apparent inconsistency (1) in Leviticus (xvii. 11) that blood is
                    the essence of life, (2) in Genesis (ii. 7) that breath is the essence of life;
                    and he reconciles the two statements by assigning to men two kinds of life: (1)
                    the irrational, which they have in common with beasts, which life has for its
                    seat (∈λαχε) blood; (2) the rational, which flows from the fountain of reason
                    (λογικές <hi rend="superscript"> 77</hi> V7 <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> 7 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 5</hi>)&gt; which has for its seat breath (or spirit), “not
                    (mere) air in motion, but a kind of type and impress of that divine power which
                    Moses calls by a name especially appropriated to it <hi rend="italic">(κνρίω

                    &amp;c., 23). Elsewhere (<hi rend="italic">Who is the Heir,</hi> 11) he says
                    that blood is the essence of the entire soul, but divine spirit <hi
                    rend="italic">(πνεύμα</hi><hi rend="italic">θeιοv)</hi> the essence of the
                    dominant part of the soul. On the metaphor of the water also Philo throws light.
                    Water and earth, he says, represent the origin, growth, and maturity of the
                    human body; consequently, he tells us, purification by water is that preliminary
                    recognition of one’s own nature (“know thyself ”) which is required from those
                    who aspire to the higher purification. Hence purification by water, he asserts,
                    was appointed by the law as a preparation for the purification by sacrificial
                    blood; and hence the Sacred Word thought meet that the high priest, whenever he
                    purposed to perform the sacrifices ordained by law, should previously sprinkle
                    himself with water and ashes <hi rend="italic">(Dreams,</hi> 36, 37; <hi

                <p>If now we could find in the Gospel narrative of the crucifixion some mention also
                    of the breath or spirit, nothing would remain wanting to make up the triple
                    purification and triple witness mentioned in the Epistle, of “the spirit and the
                    water and the blood.” Such a mention is probably intended in the willing
                    surrender of the “breath” or “spirit,” which is mentioned (xix. 30) in the
                    Fourth Gospel alone [Mk. <hi rend="italic">eζεπvευσe,</hi> Mat. <hi
                    rend="italic">α&lt;ffηκe;</hi> Luke (xxiii. 46) who comes nearest to John only

                    meaning both in the Gospel and in the Epistle appears to be the same. (1) Jesus
                    took unto Himself not only (a) the dead fleshly nature of man, typified by
                    water, but also (6) the life and passions of man, typified by blood, and (c)
                    that higher life of man (iu virtue of which he is described as made in the image
                    of God), typified by the spirit. (2) In these three departments of existence He
                    made three several sacrifices, pouring forth (&lt;ι) water and (6) blood from
                    His side, and giving up (c) His breath as the last sacrifice of all.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A somewhat similar compound
                    sacrifice of “blood” and “mind” is described by Philo <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Alley.,</hi> ii. 15), who represents the High Priest as “having put off the
                    robe of opinion and fancy, and as coming disrobed into (the Holy of Holies) to
                    make an offering of the blood of life (σ-7Γ67σ∙&lt;u τδ <hi rend="italic"
                    >^υχικbv</hi><hi rend="italic">αίμα)</hi> and to offer up as incense all his
                    mind to the God of salvation.”</p></note> (3) Thus these three sacrifices
                    betoken three several purifications:—(a) the purification, by water, of the body
                    in baptism; (6) the purification of the soul by the death of the lower nature
                    (what Paul calls “the old man”), which partakes in the death of Christ; (c) the
                    purified life of the soul rising from the dead through the Spirit, and living
                    with, and in, the risen Saviour. The two latter purifications are two phases of
                    the same (the former implying dying in the blood of Christ, the latter rising
                    again and living in His Spirit); but there is sufficient difference to warrant a
                    distinction. (4) These three purifications go to make up the one perfectly pure
                    and ideal purification and sacrifice for sin, which is the Lamb of God, the Word
                    (∈tς τo tv <hi rend="italic">ecσLV).</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>No doubt these three sacrifices are also connected, in the

                <p>Stress has been laid upon this important passage in the Epistle because it
                    appears to be a key to much that we shall find in the Gospel. It reveals an
                    exaggerated notion of the importance of baptism with water, against which the
                    author feels compelled to contend; “not by water only, but by water and blood.”
                    Somewhat in the same way Paul uses not water but earth (Philo using water and
                    earth) to contrast the natural man, the mere “living soul,” with the “lifegiving
                    breath, or spirit” (1 Cor. xv. 45, 47). But that which distinguishes John from
                    Paul is the use of mystical imagery, arranged with a certain numerical
                    symmetry". Sometimes the imagery is dual, when it describes incompleteness, such
                    as the conflict between the world and the children of God, between light and
                    darkness, between God and the deviL But in other cases it is triple: he appeals
                    to three classes, the children, the young men, the fathers; contending against
                    three enemies, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the imposture
                    (αλt¼eα) of life; and strengthened in their faith by three witnesses on earth,
                    the water, the blood, and the spirit—all of which dimly tends towards that other
                    triple witness which .has been inserted in the Epistle by later scribes (v. 7),
                    the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
                <p>If we could be sure that the Second Epistle was from the same pen as the First,
                    then the very great probability that the “elect lady” and the “elect sister” (2
                    John 1; <hi rend="italic">ib.</hi> 13) represent two churches might prepare us
                    for similar personifications in the Gospel; yet as this personification is
                    disputed by some, we must not lay much stress on it.<note anchored="true"

                    we have seen enough of the nature of the Epistle to be prepared (in passing to
                    the larger work by the same author) for a Gospel of types and symbols, a Gospel
                    of selection rather than of continuous narrative, a Gospel in which principles
                    on a large scale rather than individual characters shall be represented, and in
                    which light and darkness, death and life, the word and the world, the water and

                    corresponding to the seven times repeated “I am” (vi. 35; viii. 12; x. 7; x. 11;
                    xi. 25; xiv. 6; XV. 1), and to the seven “signs” of Christ’s ministry on earth,

                    of the Fourth Gospel.</hi></p>
                <p>As was to be expected from a writer conversant with the system and thought which,
                    for brevity, we call the school of Philo, the prologue of the Gospel opens with
                    a protest against Philo’s doctrine of an impersonal or quasi-impersonal Logos.
                    The Logos or Word is at once declared to be (i. 1), not the mere instrument by
                    which the world was made, but the companion of God, and God; a Light, from the
                    beginning shining in darkness, received by some, to whom power was given to be
                    born of God, but rejected by others who were the children of the flesh. John the
                    Baptist is introduced, in marked distinction from the Word, as a “man;” not the
                    Light, but a witness to the Light; aud the Baptist declares at the very outset
                    of the public life of Jesus (i. 16) that, though the law was given by Moses, the
                    gifts of divine grace and truth came through Jesus, and that He, being the only
                    begotten Son in the bosom of the Father, has manifested the invisible God to
                    men. The baptism of Jesus by John is omitted; but John bears witness to the
                    visible descent of the Spirit upon Jesus, adding that it “abode upon Him,” and
                    he bears record that his own baptism with water is but to prepare the way for
                    Him who will baptize with the Holy Spirit; and that He on whom the Spirit thus
                    descended is the Son of God, the Lamb of God that is to take away the sins of
                    the world. Here, then, at the very outset, we see the thoughts, and one may
                    almost say the <hi rend="italic">dramatis</hi><hi rend="italic">personoe,</hi>
                    of the Epistle reintroduced in the Gospel—light and darkness, the word and the
                    world, the law and grace, the Father, the Spirit, and the Son. The three grades
                    of purification are not as yet mentioned; yet there is perhaps a side-reference
                    to them in the three grades of the world, 7.e., of impure existence, which are
                    alluded to in the contrast between those who are born “of God” (i. 13) and those
                    who are born (1) of blood, (2) of the will of the flesh, (3) of the will of
                    man.</p>
                <p>The narrative of the calling of the disciples implies unmistakably that this book
                    is not to follow the common tradition, nor to be a complete narrative, but
                    rather a selection; for it only narrates the calling of six of the twelve, and
                    one of these, Nathanael (significantly described as a man of Cana, where two out
                    of the eight miracles in this Gospel are to take place), is so far from being
                    universally identified with one of the twelve that Augustine excluded him from
                    the number. The earlier names are mentioned in the same order as in Papias (see
                    above, p. 820), and suggest the inference that some of these apostles, or their
                    disciples, dwelling in the neighbourhood of Ephesus, furnished some of the
                    materials of which the Fourth Gospel is composed. Two points are further to be
                    noted in this narrative. (1) In order to enhance the dignity of the central
                    character, the writer causes the inferior characters to revolve around Jesus,
                    conversing with and questioning one another, doubting and erring, before
                    venturing to obtrude themselves upon Him (see, besides this passage, iv. 27, iv.
                    33, vii. 27, 40- 43, xi. 16, xi. 37, xii. 20-22, xiii. 24, xvi. 17; and note
                    how, both in xvi. 19 and in other passages, Jesus, after the manner of a king,
                    takes the initiative in addressing His disciples, instead of their bringing
                    their difficulties to Him unbidden, as they do for the most part in the
                    synoptists).</p>

                <p>(2) The second point is the error of Philip in saying, “We have found Him, of
                    whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son
                    of Joseph” (i. 45). Philip introduced with this slightly pompous and erroneous
                    statement—in a kind of irony highly characteristic of our evangelist—seems
                    intended as a contrast to the humiliated and wiser Philip of the fourteenth
                    chapter: “Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known Me,
                    Philip ?”</p>
                <p>The next chapter (ii.) opens with a “sign,” of which the symbolism is
                    obvious.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is true that
                    the symbolism of this “sign” is not indicated in the text in the same clear
                    manner in which the symbolism of the feeding of the 5000 is avowed (vi. 32, 33);
                    but there is a clear reference to it in the words (ii. 4) “Mine hour is not yet
                    come,” which seem to look forward to the hour when the “blood of the grape”
                    should stream from the wounded side of Jesus. It may be necessary to point out,
                    at the outset of this analysis, that the language of the Gospel may naturally
                    have been affected, not only by the thought and language of Philo, but also by
                    what was called the “Asiatic” style, which was prone to metaphor and symbolism:
                    see Lightfoot’s <hi rend="italic">Galatians,</hi> p. 362, where we find that
                    Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus (born or converted about 130 A.D.) described John
                    (probably metaphorically) as a priest, wearing the <hi rend="italic"
                    >πeτaλον</hi> or high priest’s mitre, and speaks of Melito as a “eunuch,”
                    meaning merely that Melito devoted himself to Christ (“propter regnum Dei
                    eunuchum ”). It is noteworthy in this context, that the Epistle to the Ephesians
                    is the only Epistle that appears to contain an extract from one of those early
                    hymns which, as Pliny says, the Christians used to “sing to Christ as a god,”
                    and this hymn, as is natural, deals in metaphor: “Awake thou that steepest, and
                    arise from the dead, and Christshall give thee light” (Eph. v. 14). Probablyfrom
                    some such Asiatic metaphor (that “John, though dead, still breathed in the
                    church”) arose the tradition, of which mention is made by Augustine, that the
                    earth over the apostle’s body still rose and fell with his breath.</p></note>
                    The water changed into wine evidently typifies the substitution of grace for the
                    law. It was a common metaphor among the Jews to express the superiority of the
                    oral tradition to the written law by saying that “the law is water, but the
                    words of the scribes are wine”—a metaphor that exactly recalls the words of
                    Origen about this very sign: “Before Jesus the Scripture was water, but from the
                    time of Jesus it has been made wine for us” <hi rend="italic">{Comm. in Ev.
                    Joann.,</hi> xiii. CO). A somewhat similar comparison of old wine and new wine
                    had been adopted by Jesus Himself to illustrate the difference between His
                    teaching and the law of Moses. The identity between the purifying blood of
                    Christ’s sacrifice and the nourishing blood of His sacrament is understood even
                    by Justin independently of the Fourth Gospel, and would be a natural inference
                    from the Messianic prophecy (Gen. xlix. 11), which identified the cleansing
                    stream that was to purify the robe of the Messiah with the blood of the grape,
                    declaring that He should “wash His robe <hi rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> as Justin
                    explains it, His church) in the blood of the grape.” Therefore, in changing
                    water into wine, the Messiah is, by His first √gn, striking the key-note of all
                    that is to come, indicating the object and nature of His work, viz., the
                    supersession of the law by the gospel, and the introduction of a new spiritual
                    nutriment and purification, which shall at once cleanse and strengthen and
                    gladden the soul—all this to be effected by and in Himself through His
                    blood.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This narrative

                <p>The prediction here made of “the hour” when the “blood of the grape” should
                    stream from His wounded side is at once followed by a second similar prophecy.
                    After leaving Cana for the passover in Jerusalem (where He purifies the temple
                    by expulsion of the money-changers; see above, p. 827), Jesus answers the
                    request of the Jews for a sign with these words, “Destroy this temple, and in
                    three days I will raise it up.” It is added that He “spake of the temple of His
                    body.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An inference has
                    been drawn from the words <hi rend="italic">Υeσσepaκorτa κal</hi> ⅛ξ <hi
                    rend="italic">eτeσιr φκoδoμ∙ηθη l&gt; rabs obτos</hi> (ii. 20), that because the
                    year so indicated would be the same year as that assigned by Luke to our Lord’s
                    commencement of His public work, therefore, by their coincidence, the two
                    Gospels mutually support each other. But it seems natural that the writer of
                    this Gospel, an educated Jew, should know both the date of the commencement of
                    the temple and the date as given by Luke of the commencement of our Lord’s
                    ministry; and it seems characteristic of the author, by details of this kind
                    (and especially by numbers), to add picturesqueness and realism to his
                    narrative: <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> the 200 pence (vi. 7), the 200 cubits
                    (xxi. 8), &amp;c. However, it must not be forgotten that Origen <hi
                    rend="italic">(Comm, in Eυ. Joann.,</hi> x. 22) throughout his long discussion
                    of this passage assumes that the meaning is “in” not “during” forty-six years.
                    And this seems to be the natural translation of the words—“the temple was built
                    <hi rend="italic">in</hi> forty-six years” (although the dative may be used for
                    duration of time, the aorist hardly permits the English version); and if so, the
                    author is under a mistake in supposing that the temple was completed. Yet from
                    this passage (ii. 20), and from other indications of a knowledge of J ewish
                    customs, Messianic expectations, and the geography of Palestine, it has been
                    inferred that the author was a Palestinian Jew. A stronger argument is the
                    author’s preference of the Hebrew rather than the LXX. version of the Old
                    Testament (Canon Westcott quotes vi. 45; xiii. 18; xix. 37), which certainly
                    shows either that he used the Hebrew version himself, or that the Ephesian
                    doctrine was based upon that version. The knowledge of the country does not seem
                    to exceed what might be attained by any Alexandrian Jew who had spent one or two
                    passovers in Jerusalem and had travelled for a short time in Palestine; and the
                    geographical argument has been unduly strained by such suggestions as that a
                    “minute knowledge” of the relative positions of Cana and Capernaum is implied in
                    the expression “He went down” (ii. 12). The same argument would show that the
                    author of the hook of Jonah had a “minute knowledge” of the position of Joppa
                    (Jonah i. 3), or that the author of the Acts of the Apostles had a “minute
                    knowledge” of the places from which he or Paul “went down” to Attalia, Troas, or
                    Antioch (xiv. 25; xvi. 8; xviii. 22). Any traveller might know that Capernaum
                    was in the low-lying basin of the Jordan, down on the edge of the sea of
                    Galilee, without having a “minute knowledge” of its position relatively to the
                    inland villages of Galilee.</p></note> It is interesting to note four different
                    stages of development in the expression of this prediction. The synoptists
                    Matthew and Mark declare that a very similar charge (differing only in “I will
                    destroy” and “I am able to destroy,” Mat. xxvi. 61; Mk. xiv. 58) was brought
                    against Jesus by false witnesses; and they give us no hint that the witnesses
                    erred by a simple and natural misunderstanding. Luke, however, who not only
                    wrote after the destruction of Jerusalem (when it would be a common saying that
                    the Lord Jesus had destroyed the temple), but also modified his Gospel in many
                    respects to suit it to the requirements of the changed times, makes no mention
                    of any false accusation. In his subsequent treatise of the Acts he goes a step
                    further; for there the accusation is repeated (Acts vi. 14), and not denied.
                    Now, lastly, the author of the Fourth Gospel adopts the charge as in the main a
                    true one, or at all events as an inevitable misunderstanding in which His
                    disciples, as well as His enemies, participated. At the same time, this
                    prophecy, like the symbol of the wine, prepares the way for Christ’s subsequent
                    doctrine (xiv. 23) that every man is a temple of God, and that He Himself is
                    that Temple in the highest sense. This doctrine had been taught even before Paul
                    by Philo, who scouts the thought of preparing for the Supreme a “house of stone
                    or wood,” and declares <hi rend="italic">{Cain and his Birth,</hi> 20) that the
                    invisible soul is the terrestrial habitation of the invisible God. Yet though
                    Philo’s language may have influenced the language of the Fourth Gospel in such
                    passages as xiv. 23, it is most certain that this doctrine is a necessary
                    inference from the teaching of Christ Himself, who taught us that the body must
                    be “full of light.” There is therefore no essential misrepresentation in this
                    introduction of the Pauline doctrine of Christ the Temple or Church.</p>

                <p>The whole of the next chapter (iii.) deals with purification by water and the
                    spirit. The learned but timid Nicodemus, “the teacher” of Israel (iii. 10),
                    exhibits the blindness of carnal learning as contrasted with the knowledge that
                    belongs to those who are born of the spirit. A third prediction of “the hour” is
                    expressed through a third figure, the serpent in the wilderness. But this figure
                    introduces a new conception, that of faith, an intense <hi rend="italic"
                    >looking</hi> towards Christ, even as the children of Israel looked on the
                    healing serpent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>According to Philo, the brazen serpent represents temperance, the antidote

                    ii. 20).</p></note> This thought of faith as sight, illustrated perhaps by the
                    statement that Nicodemus had come by night, introduces a few remarks on a
                    subject hereafter to be more amply treated by the evangelist—the difference
                    between the children of light and the children of darkness (iii. 18-21). In the
                    second section of this chapter the subject of waterpurification is taken up
                    again by the Baptist, who contrasts his own inferior purification with the
                    higher purification of the Messiah, and his own decrease with Christ’s increase,
                    describing himself (almost in the language of Paul) as “earthly,” whereas the
                    Messiah is “from heaven.” But the Baptist also introduces the subject of faith;
                    the path of life is through faith in the Son of God: “He that believeth in the
                    Son hath everlasting life” (iii. 22-3G).</p>
                <p>Particularly to be noted is verse 24 of this chapter, in which it is expressly
                    stated that “John was not yet cast into prison.” It will be remembered that the
                    synoptists give no account of the public appearance of Jesus till after the
                    imprisonment of John. It was therefore open to the enemies of the church to
                    maintain that Jesus was but a pupil of the Baptist, and that He did not venture
                    to teach till His master John had been shut up in prison. Much more might this
                    be asserted in Ephesus, where, as we have seen, there were some who were
                    baptized only with the baptism of John, and who knew nothing of the Holy Spirit.
                    On this account probably it is that our author introduces Jesus as working by
                    the side of John, before his imprisonment, and even then inevitably, and against
                    His own will, drawing multitudes from the Baptist to Himself. The apostle John
                    himself is one of the first to leave the Baptist for the Greater Teacher (i.
                    37); but the Baptist also is made to witness, and to rejoice in, the desertion:
                    “He must increase, but I must decrease.” And finally, we are told that the
                    superiority of Jesus over the Baptist had become so manifest that the Pharisees
                    had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, and upon this,
                    desiring to avoid this appearance of superiority, Jesus retired to Galilee<note

                    that “Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,” serves two purposes:—(1)

                    (iv. 1). It would not be possible njore effectively to repel every suggestion of
                    the pupilage of Jesus, or of his subordination—even His temporary
                    subordination—to John the Baptist.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is, of course, possible that here (as in the matter of
                    the last supper) the Fourth Gospel may have preserved some historical traditions
                    concerning the acts of the Lord in Judaea, which have not been preserved in the
                    synoptic record. Noris it denied that elsewhere, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in
                    the matter of the three passovers,the Fourth Gospel may be historical. There is
                    scarcely evidence enough to admit of absolute demonstration on either side. All
                    that is contended is that, whether historical or not, the incidents recorded in
                    the Fourth Gospel are suggested (1) often by a clearly discernible motive in the
                    mind of the writer contrasting forcibly with the motiveless, simple, inartistic
                    narrative of St Mark; (2) sometimes by a desire to supplement, if not to
                    correct, the previous narratives of the synoptists. The presence of such a
                    motive and desire is not, of course, absolutely inconsistent with historical
                    accuracy; but, the more we consider the synoptic narrative to be objective, and
                    the more we consider the Fourth Gospel to be subjective, the more we shall be
                    disposed to believe that, in proportion as incidents in the latter are
                    suggestible by motives and desires, in that proportion are they likely to be
                    non-historical, especially if they appear to be difficult to harmonize with the
                    earlier narrative of the synoptists. It has been suggested that the lamentation
                    over Jerusalem (Mat. xxiii. 37; Lu. xiii. 34), expressed in the words, “How
                    often did I desire to gather together thy children . . . and ye would not,”
                    implies many previous visits. These words were no doubt spoken in Jerusalem,
                    where Matthew (not Luke, see p. 800, above) places them; but still, may they not
                    refer to the many occasions in Galilee where the Redeemer, striving to “gather
                    together” the children of Israel, had surely included the “children of
                    Jerusalem” in the scope of his efforts? Even if the words “thy children” are to
                    be taken literally, they may refer to the occasions when the scribes and
                    Pharisees had come dow'iι from Jerusalem to test the Messiah, and Jesus had
                    proclaimed the new kingdom to them in vain. Though preaching in Galilee, Jesus
                    was really conflicting with the spirit of Jerusalem, and striving to “gather
                    together the children of Jerusalem.” In any case the supposition that <hi
                    rend="italic">πo&lt;τακιs</hi> refers to previous public visits to Jerusalem
                    results in an incompatibility. For no one maintains that Jesus had made more
                    than two previous public visits to Jerusalem; and it is impossible that “how
                    many times” can mean twice.</p></note></p>
                <p>Now follows (ch. iv.) what may be called the foreign section of the Gospel. We
                    noticed that <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> even in Luke, the Samaritans assume a
                    prominent position, their faith and unconventional goodness being twice
                    contrasted with the carnal formalism of the Pharisees, at one time in a miracle
                    (Lu. xvii. 1G), at another time in a parable (Lu. x. 33). We are now to see how
                    the contrast between Samaria and Judaea is handled in the Fourth Gospel in the
                    dialogue on the living water, which might fairly be called, from its subject, as
                    from its scenery, the “Dialogue of the Well.” The well is a frequent figure in
                    the books of Philo. To all men, says Philo <hi rend="italic">{Planting of
                    Noah,</hi> χiχ.), there is, in common, the desire to find drink; but some seek
                    drink for the body, others for the soul. The seekers after truth are as those
                    who dig wells, and many seekers have dug wells without finding water; and taking
                    the LXX. version of Genesis xxvi. 32, “We havener found water,” he comments on
                    the well of the oath (Beersheba), which is discovered to be “dry and he declares
                    that the dry well illustrates the failure of all human search after knowledge,
                    as compared with the ideal God-given knowledge which is like a gushing spring.
                    Elsewhere <hi rend="italic">{Dreams,</hi> ii. 2, <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seqj)</hi> he says, even more explicitly, that the well is the
                    emblem of knowledge; that its depth signifies the difficulty of the attainment
                    of knowledge; and that concerning all knowledge the well-diggers have to make
                    but one sad confession, “We can find no water.” Moses sits by the well “waiting
                    to see what water God will send forth for his thirsty soul” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Alleg.,</hi> ii. 4); Israel “sang the song of the well,” <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">{Dreams,</hi> ii. 4); and the remark of the daughter of Samaria
                    (iv. 11) that “the well <hi rend="italic">{φpiαp)</hi> is deep,” followed by the
                    contrast of the “fountain” <hi rend="italic">{ιτ-ηγr</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> of water that “leaps up” (iv. 14), at once
                    suggests Philo’s contrast between the bond-woman Hagar at “the deep <hi
                    rend="italic">well</hi>” and Rebecca who nourishes those who come to her with
                    “the <hi rend="italic">fountain</hi> that never fails” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Posterity of Cain,</hi> 41). Origen, in the same way, considering Jacob’s well
                    to mean the Old Testament, contrasts Samaria leaving her vδpια (the old
                    implement of knowledge) with Rebecca at the fountain <hi rend="italic">{Comm, in
                    Ev. Joann.,</hi> xiii. 10 and 29). The four wells dug by the patriarchs Abraham
                    and Isaac represent <hi rend="italic">{Dreams,</hi> ii. 3, 4) four departments
                    of knowledge. The fourth and dry well represents the search after the fourth and
                    incomprehensible immaterial element corresponding to the material heaven—a
                    search that is necessarily fruitless. This being Philo’s interpretation (and he
                    indignantly protests against any other, as being unworthy of wise men), we shall
                    also see a singular propriety in placing the dialogue on the living water in the
                    neighbourhood of “the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph” (iv.
                    5); for here also Philo has prescribed a metaphorical interpretation, declaring
                    that “Jacob gave Joseph Shechem, meaning<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n856/mode/1up"

                    of the outward senses” <hi rend="italic">(Allegories,</hi> iii. 8). But there is
                    also an appropriateness in the use of the name (iv. 5) “Sychar.” For whether the
                    name be a corruption of “Shechem” or of “Askar” (Sanday, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fourth Gospel,</hi> p. 93), in either case the name contains a possible
                    reference to “drunkenness” (Isaiah, xxviii. 1, 7; <hi rend="italic">Diet, of
                    Bible,</hi> s.v.), and serves as a suitable contrast to the Living Water. The
                    next point for consideration is the “five husbands” of the woman of Samaria. Is
                    there any special meaning in the number “five?” Turningagain to Philo, we find,
                    a little after the passage about wells quoted above, the statement that “the
                    number five is appropriate to the <hi rend="italic">outward sense"
                    (Planting,</hi> 32), and that it represents material enjoyment. This is
                    certainly a natural use of the number, if it is to be used emblematically.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Origen <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Comm, in Ev. Joann.</hi>, xiii. 9) speaks of “the five husbands as

                    Samaria is the type of a soul which has once been wedded to the objects of
                    sense, but lias recently divorced herself from these and allied herself to a
                    “sixth husband,” a false semblance of spiritual truth. If this stood by itself,
                    we might regard it as one of many other specimens of Origen’s baseless allegory;
                    but it assumes importance when we find Philo, who wrote long before the
                    composition of this Dialogue of the Well, using nearly the same language as
                    Origen, who wrote after it and (apparently) without any knowledge of Philo’s
                    pre-existing metaphor.</p></note> Further, the number “five” is connected also
                    by Philo, not indeed with “husbands,” but with “seducers.” Philo <hi
                    rend="italic">(Allegories,</hi> iii. 88) says that the lawful husband is the
                    mind <hi rend="italic">(vovς),</hi> the unlawful husband or seducer <hi
                    rend="italic">(φθοpev&lt;s)</hi> is represented by the five objects of the

                    he says that the “five daughters” of Salpaad represent the “outward senses.” The

                    cities of Sodom.”</p></note> Immediately before the passage, Philo adopts the
                    more common metaphor of the Old Testament in speaking, not of the mind, but of
                    the Lord Himself, as the Husband, being the Father of the perfect nature, and
                    sowing and begetting happiness in the soul. Samaria is supposed by Justin <hi
                    rend="italic">(Dial,</hi> lxxviii.) to represent in Isaiah (viii. 4) “sinful and
                    unjust power;” but here it rather typifies sense-wrapped ignorant unbelief. The
                    whole of this imagery seems so well connected and so appropriately transferred
                    from the pages of Philo to the pages of the Fourth Gospel, that one hesitates to
                    accept another explanation (Keim) which would otherwise seem extremely
                    probable—an explanation borrowed from the five religions of the five nations of
                    Samaria (2 Kings xvii. 30-37). In either case, the sixth “husband” may very well
                    refer to Simon Magus, who, as we know from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts viii.
                    11), had very early in the history of the church “for a long time” held the
                    Samaritans “bound with his enchantments.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Yet the “sixth husband ’ may possibly be illustrated by the
                    contrast which Philo <hi rend="italic">(Abraham,</hi> 5) draws between the
                    “seventh power,” the “power of peace,” and the “six powers of turbulence,” which
                    consist of “the five senses” and uttered “speech.” (ό <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Like all the other narratives of our evangelist, this narrative is in the highest
                    degree dramatic. From her previous repellent attitude, the woman of Samaria is
                    led, first into wonder, then into interest, then into conviction of sin
                    (becoming ashamed of her false husbands), and into admiration of the New
                    Prophet; lastly, she receives from the Messiah a draught of that spiritual water
                    which alone can satisfy the longing soul; and in the climax she is brought to
                    the very brink of the eternal fountain— “I that speak unto thee am He.”</p>
                <p>The journey into Galilee adds one more to the instances in which the Fourth
                    Gospel corrects the synoptists. The saying that “a prophet is not without honour
                    save in his own country” is stated by the synoptists to have been uttered by
                    Jesus in Galilee (Mat. xiii. 57; Mk. vi. 4; Lu. i V. 24) <hi rend="italic"
                    >after</hi> the unexpected rejection of Him by His countrymen; and Mark adds one
                    of those passages which were early “stumbling-blocks” to the church, viz., that
                    “He was not able to do there any mighty work, . . . and He marvelled because of
                    their unbelief.” Not content with Luke’s considerable modification of this
                    passage, the author of the Fourth Gospel boldly places this saying of Jesus <hi
                    rend="italic">before</hi> the visit to Galilee, and assigns it as <hi
                    rend="italic">a reason for His going thither</hi>: “After two days He departed
                    thence (from Samaria) and went into Galilee; <hi rend="italic">for</hi> Jesus
                    Himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in his own country” (iv. 44).
                    The motive is obvious: Jesus is desirous of escaping from notoriety. He has
                    found that the Pharisees (iv. 1) are aware of His superiority to John the
                    Baptist, and that His disciples exceed John’s in number; and for this very
                    reason He leaves Judaea, and comes to Samaria, a hostile district. Even here,
                    however, He cannot help making converts. But having made them, He leaves them
                    and goes into Galilee, where at least He is sure to find “no honour.” Yet even
                    here, adds the author, He <hi rend="italic">was</hi> honoured; for “the
                    Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did at Jerusalem at
                    the feast” (iv. 44). Thus skilfully, after his manner, the author takes those
                    very sayings and traditions which had been turned against Jesus, and, by his
                    delicate handling, uses them to enhance the glory of the Messiah, “who knew what
                    was in man” (ii. 25).</p>
                <p>Passing over the cure of the nobleman’s son, which has been discussed above, we
                    come to the first “sign” wrought on the sabbath (v. 2-9). Once more there is a
                    contrast between the water of the law and the fountain of the Messiah. The
                    rejection of this divine act of mercy, simply because it was wrought on the
                    sabbath, introduces, almost for the first time, the conception of “judgment” or
                    “condemnation.” The word “judgment” had been mentioned in the dialogue with
                    Nicodemus, as a necessary result, though not an object, of the coming of the
                    Light, which, by its very presence, distinguishes and “judges” those who love
                    the darkness (iii. 17-21); and now we have an example of the way in which the
                    Light divides all who hold it into two classes—those who love it, and those who
                    hate it. This is in accordance with the spirit of the synoptists, who (Mat
                    xxiii. 13; Mk. xii. 40; Lu. XX. 47) describe Jesus as addressing the Sabbatarian
                    sign-hindereras “hypocrite,” and as pronouncing on “hypocrites” greater
                    “judgment” or condemnation <hi rend="italic">(περισσότερον κρίμα).</hi> But that
                    part of the discourse in which Christ describes Himself, in the presence of the
                    multitude, as having received all power to judge and to quicken the dead, does
                    not resemble anything in the synoptic narrative, except the discourse—“All
                    things are delivered unto Me of My Father” (Mat. xi. 27; Lu. x. 22); and that
                    was uttered privately to the disciples, after their return from their mission.
                    It is possible that the author here (as elsewhere) sets down, as a public
                    discourse, some sayings that may have been uttered privately; and the words
                    “that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father,” remind us
                    at once of the synoptic saying, “He that receiveth you receiveth Me, and He that
                    receiveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me” (Mk. ix. 37, &amp;c.); which again, in
                    the synoptists, was a private, not a public saying.</p>
                <p>The author’s fidelity to the spirit rather than to the letter of the words of
                    Jesus appears also in the reference to the quickening and raising from the dead.
                    Jesus had in Matthew (κ. 8) bidden His disciples to “raise the dead,” and this
                    precept is amplified, in the Fourth Gospel, into “The hour is coming and now is,
                    when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall
                    live” (v. 25),—a saying that would naturally be interpreted<pb break="no"

                    faith. As elsewhere in this Gospel (i. 50; iii. 1, 2; iv. 39-41; xx. 29; and, if
                    rightly considered, vi. 26), the author lightly esteems belief based on “mighty
                    works” or wonders. The right faith is that of the Samaritans, who, rising out of
                    the lower wonder-faith, attain to the higher faith which comes from hearing
                    Christ (iv. 42). For to this, and to no other testimony, does Christ, in the
                    Fourth Gospel, make His ultimate appeal. Christ does not indeed despise the
                    testimony of John to Himself, but He does not accept it as a final basis for the
                    true faith (v. 32-34). He appeals to the Scriptures, it is true, but rather as
                    an unerring guide to the true source of faith than as being of themselves able
                    to generate faith in the reader (v. 39). What then is the living final testimony
                    to which He appeals! It is to His “works,”—not the “mighty works,” or “wonders,”
                    but all “the works (∈pγα) which the Father hath given Me to do,” meaning the
                    whole of His life, and including both words and deeds. In other words, the
                    Fourth Gospel appeals to that which we should call the influence of the life of
                    Jesus, but which the evangelist better calls the “Spirit” of Jesus, passing from
                    Jesus to His disciples, and from those disciples to others who had not seen
                    Jesus—as the final testimony, convincing every honest heart, and generating in
                    every conscience that loves the light a belief in Jesus as the true Light. In
                    the synoptists, “faith” is, for the most part, that half physical thrill of
                    trust in the presence of Jesus which enables the limbs of a paralysed man to
                    make the due physical response to the emotional shock consequent on the word
                    “arise,” so that in the strength of that shock the paralytic is enabled to shake
                    off the disease of many years; or, at the highest, it is a thrill through the
                    inner being, whereby the soul shakes off the burden of sin. But in the Fourth
                    Gospel faith implies even more than in Paul’s Epistles; it is a faculty that
                    tests, transmutes, and develops the recipient soul; it means a trust in Christ,
                    not only as a sacrifice, nor as propitiation, nor as miracle-worker, nor as Son
                    of God, but as source and object of all love, and the be-all and end-all of
                    every human life. If such a Being is best expressed by “Word,” then the human
                    receptiveness of such a Being will be best expressed by the metaphor of
                    “hearing.” Accordingly the Samaritans believe, not because of miracles, nor
                    because He told the woman “all that ever she did,” but because they had enjoyed
                    His presence for two days, and had <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> Him. “Now we
                    believe, not because of thy saying; for we have <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> Him
                    ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.”
                    Here we have at last a doctrine not borrowed from Philo, a doctrine that
                    constitutes the great difference between Philo’s philosophy and the religion of
                    the Fourth Gospel, making the latter a powerful and lifeinspiring motive for all
                    classes of men, while the former remains a barren philosophy fit only for
                    meditative hermits. For in Philo, faith, as in the Old Testament (Lightfoot, <hi
                    rend="italic">Galatians,∙gg.</hi> 154-162), hasapassive meaning—trustworthiness,
                    stability, constancy,—rather than the active meaning of trust, by which the
                    lower nature is raised to the level of the higher; the “dog” to the level of
                    “man” (Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> xvi. 79); the man to the level of
                    Christ, and, through Christ, to God (1 Cor. iii. 23). Faith, in Philo, is a
                    prize rather than an effort, a harbour rather than a voyage; it is “the only
                    sure and infallible good, the solace of life, the fulfilment of worthy hopes”
                    (Lightfoot, <hi rend="italic">Gal.,</hi> p. 158); whereas, in the New Testament,
                    it is the faculty by which one is able to trust in Christ, to love Christ, and
                    to serve Christ—a faculty implying continuous effort, loyal and enthusiastic
                    service, and progressive activity. The nearest approach in Philo to the Pauline
                    and Johannine faith is perhaps in the words that describe it as “the entire
                    amelioration of the soul which leans for support on Him who is the cause of all

                    in theory, is very different in practice from the faith of the New Testament.
                    For—faith being neutral and colourless and taking its colour from its object—how
                    different must needs be even the faith that is based upon the <hi rend="italic"
                    >things</hi> that are “most excellent” from the faith that rises to the Father
                    through such a one as Jesus of Nazareth, concerning whom even the most
                    incredulous must admit that He made peace in man’s troubled heart, banished sin
                    from those who trusted in Him, and “constrained” (2 Cor. v. 14) even His
                    bitterest persecutor to join in laying the foundations of His empire.<note

                    38), or else of temporary and progressive trust, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    trust in God, in the word of Jesus, or in the Scriptures; all of which are
                    regarded as preparatory acts leading to that final state of trust which can only

                    Jesus, and it is only once used by the synoptists (Matth, xviii. 6;? Mk. ix.
                    42).</p><p>Nothing has been said hero about the difference of John’s chronology
                    from that of the synoptists, because, if the Fourth Gospel is a spiritual rather
                    than an historical composition, it is scarcely to be expected that its
                    chronology should be limited by historical considerations; and, in any case, the
                    subject is too large a one to be discussed here. Canon Westcott remarks <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gospels,</hi> p. 285) that “a very strong case has been made out
                    by Mr Browne <hi rend="italic">(Ordo</hi><hi rend="italic">Soeclorwm)</hi> for
                    the limitation of the Lord’s ministry to a single year. If there were <hi

                    his arguments would appear to bo convincing.” The context suggests that the
                    words τδ πάσχα may not improbably be an insertion based on a sense of the
                    spiritual meaning of the narrative rather than on history.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the discourse that follows the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand,
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> it is noteworthy that the author speaks of the
                    eucharistie food not as the Lord’s body and blood, but as His “flesh” and blood.
                    Most characteristically: for “flesh” is, as in Paul’s epistles, a principle, an
                    element, and the author desires to show that the Lord’s flesh and blood are the
                    only satisfying element for the human soul. He has before spoken of blood and
                    flesh and man (i. 13) as antagonistic elements to the divine elements; now he
                    wishes to point out the divine elements themselves, and they are the flesh and
                    blood of the Word, who “became flesh” (i. 14, <hi rend="italic">σαρξ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">eγiveτo)</hi> for men. Here, as before, we must add that the use
                    of this language—“Whoso eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood ”—in a public
                    discourse is quite unlike anything in the synoptists, and though it represents
                    the essence of the teaching of the Lord’s supper, somewhat amplified, it can
                    hardly be considered in its chronological, or even perhaps in its artistic
                    place, as a public discourse here. Yet it is necessarily placed here to account
                    for the desertion of many of HÎ3 fol lowers. In the synoptists the desertion is
                    otherwise explained. There we see Jesus, as He develops the constitution of His
                    Kingdom, alienating, step by step, the Pharisees, Herod, the patriots or
                    Galileans, the followers of John the Baptist, and at last the whole of His
                    countrymen, till He is compelled to flee from Herod to the neighbourhood of
                    Caesarea Philippi, where, as an exile with no more than twelve other outcast
                    companions, He who had never revealed Himself to be the Messiah finds, upon
                    questioning His disciples, that they have been led by the divine guidance to the
                    sense that He and He alone must needs be their Redeemer; so that the seed of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n858/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0858-0835"/> faith has at last begun to germinate, and He can
                    now prepare to leave them, because He discerns already the temple of the new
                    kingdom founded upon the inspired confession of Simon Peter. In the Fourth
                    Gospel, on the other hand, the desertion of the disciples is represented as due
                    to another cause, namely, their unspiritual dulness and their inability to
                    understand the doctrines of their Master. Here and there in this discourse
                    appear glimpses of the synoptic utterances,—for example, in the words “No man
                    can come unto Me except My Father draw him” (vi. 44); and in the words “It is
                    the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing” (vi. 63), one seems to
                    recognize a version of part of the blessing of Peter, “Blessed art thou Simon,
                    son of Jona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father
                    which is in heaven.” But elsewhere, in the greater part of this discourse, the
                    author departs entirely from the synoptists. In the confession of Peter, a very
                    striking peculiarity is presented. Not only do we find brought out in a very
                    touching manner what may be almost called the despairing faith of the confessing
                    apostle—“Lord, to whom shall we go?”—as though the disciples were driven in
                    desperation to remain with Jesus because, if they deserted Him, they had no
                    hope, no refuge, elsewhere; but we also find Peter avowing the cause of his
                    belief, and it is the same cause as moved the believing Samaritans; it is not
                    the “signs’’but the “words” of Jesus—“Thou hast the <hi rend="italic">words</hi>
                    of eternal life.” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>Hitherto the Gospel has dealt with the Word as purifying and nourishing; now it
                    has to speak of it as enlightening. The types have hitherto been water (under
                    various aspects), wine, flesh, blood, bread; now we are to read of Jesus as
                    Light. This is the highest or nearly the highest doctrine; for it is another
                    aspect of the doctrine of the Spirit. The two doctrines are closely connected in
                    Philo, who <hi rend="italic">{Creation of the World,</hi> 8) declares that God
                    assigned a “pre-eminence to the elements of spirit (or breath or air) and light,
                    calling the former the spirit of God because it is the most life-giving element,
                    and God is thecause of life;” and the visible light Philo declares to be the
                    image of the invisible light, which is the image of God. In the short summary of
                    Christ’s doctrine set forth to Nicodemus (iii. 3-21), a brief suggestion of the
                    doctrine of the light follows on the doctrine of baptism; now the higher
                    doctrine is to be expanded. But light implies darkness, and therefore the
                    development of the doctrine of light connects itself naturally with the period
                    of conflict between light and darkness, t.e., between the Word and “the Jews,”—a
                    conflict that becomes from this time more and more prominent.</p>
                <p>First of all, however, comes a climax of the doctrine of water, and a preparation
                    for the doctrine of light. This section (vii. 2-40) begins with a very distinct
                    indication, differing widely from the synoptic treatment, of the relations
                    between the Lord and his brethren. It is possible that the Ebionite school based
                    their low views of Christ’s nature upon traditions derived, or supposed to have
                    been derived, from the Lord’s brethren, and that the author is here striking at
                    a particular school of thought. Comparing Mk. iii. 21 with Mk. iii. 31, we see
                    clearly that the mother and brethren of Jesus, alarmed perhaps for His safety,
                    and deceived by false reports about His sanity, desired to place Him under
                    restraint; and Matthew and Luke unite in asserting that the mother as well as
                    the brethren desired to speak to Him, and were rejected. But there is no mention
                    of the mother in the Fourth Gospel as ever doubting or ever alarmed concerning
                    her Son; the brethren alone doubt, and their doubt amounts almost to an
                    antagonistic scepticism. They do not “believe in Him,” yet they urge Him to go
                    to “Judaeathat the disciples may see the works that Thou doest. <hi
                    rend="italic">If Thou doest these things,</hi> show Thyself to the world” (vii.
                    3-5). No reproof could be more severe (from the point of view with which the
                    Fourth Gospel regards the “world”) than the reply of Jesus: “The world cannot
                    hate you; but Me it hateth.” So imbued are the Lord’s brethren in fleshly
                    worldliness, that the world recognizes in them that familiar darkness which it
                    loves, because its works are dark, while it hates the convicting light. It is
                    not surprising, after this, that Mary, who throughout this Gospel is regarded
                    with affectionate reverence, is not committed to the guardianship of these
                    sceptical brethren of the Lord.</p>
                <p>The discourse itself is, as has been said, mainly preparatory. After one brief
                    appeal to the conscience as the final test of the truth of His teaching (vii.
                    17), the conflict is predicted: “Why go ye about to kill Me ?” A hint of the
                    synoptic saying “He casteth out devils through Beelzebub” is perhaps contained
                    in the reply of the people, “Thou hast a devil;” but the author deviates from
                    the synoptists, in the justification of the sabbath-cure, not from the “ass” or
                    the “ox” in the pit (Lu. xiv. 5), but from the practice of circumcision on the
                    sabbath (vii. 22, 23). The violent spirit first manifested after the cure of the
                    impotent man (v. 16, 18) now breaks out again, and a direct attempt made by the
                    Pharisees to arrest Him (vii. 32), frustrated by the wonder of His words (vii.
                    46; and compare xviii. 6), leads Jesus once more to predict that He will soon
                    pass away from them, and finally to conclude the “doctrine of water,” by
                    exclaiming in “the last day, the great day of the feast, . i . he that believeth
                    in Me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
                    water” <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> (vii. 38). The spiritual climax thus given
                    to the doctrine of water is very striking. The well of living water, before
                    promised to the woman of Samaria, is now not merely to spring up in the
                    believer, as there stated (iv. 14), but it is also to flow forth from Him to
                    others, thus preparing the way for the higher doctrine of the Spirit of
                    fellowship which the author touches on in the next verse: “But this He spake of
                    the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive” (vii. 39).</p>
                <p>The method of the author is admirably illustrated by the dialogue between the
                    people (vii. 41, 42): “Others said, This is the Christ, But some said, Shall
                    Christ come out of Galilee? Hath not the scripture said that Christ cometh <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Although the word used by Peter (∕5i)μα) is not the
                    same as that used by the Samaritans (λJγor), yet a comparison of a great number
                    of passages in which the “word” of Jesus (λoγos μoυ) is said to be the object of
                    belief, and the source and province of spiritual life (ii. 22; iv. 50; v. 38,
                    the word of God; viii. 31; viii. 37, 43, 51, 52; xii. 48; xiv. 23, 24) seems to
                    show that the name Λoγos itself had some influence in leading the author to
                    insist so frequently upon the “word” rather than “the works” as being the prime
                    cause by which the incarnate Word generated faith in the souls of men. In the
                    Fourth Gospel the plural λJγoi is only once used by Jesus of His words (xiv.
                    24); and there in a passage where (seemingly) it is desired to distinguish the
                    separate from the collective ‘ ‘ words :” 'O μ¾ <hi rend="italic">αγαπών</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">με τουs</hi><hi rend="italic">λόγους μου ου τηρεΐ' καί δ λόγος ον

                    the other hand, the synoptists frequently represent Jesus as speaking of “my
                    words” and of “the word,” but never of “my word.” Note also the remarkable
                    passage (xii. 48) where it is said that Jesus does not judge men, but that the
                    word which He has spoken will judge them.</p>

                    the midst of drought to them that walk in a waterless land; I will place My

                    quoted above were probably separated from their context; <hi rend="italic"
                    >άνατελοΰσιν</hi> was taken transitively and connected with <hi rend="italic"

                    unlike the method of quoting the Scripture assigned to our Lord by the
                    synoptists.</p>

                <p>of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem where David was ?” It is a
                    curious instance of the degree to which the dramatic character of the Fourth
                    Gospel has been ignored, that even an acute commentator has inferred from this
                    passage that John “was not aware of the birth at Bethlehem.” The fact is that
                    the author uses these and similar errors and blind gropings of the people, the
                    enemies, and eveu the disciples of the Lord, to enhance the majesty and insight
                    of Him who walks above them all, high in the light of heaven, while they are
                    creeping in the mist around His feet. He does not stop to correct these vulgar
                    errors, for he presupposes that his readers are in the light, and able to see
                    through them all; and it is with a frequency almost betokening enjoyment that he
                    repeats this device over and over again, in every case holding up the error in
                    silence to the contempt or pity of his reader, and delighting to exhibit human
                    folly glorifying the wisdom of God. Instances of this device occur in this very
                    chapter. “Who goeth about to kill Thee <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >”</hi> says the ignorant multitude (vii. 20), at the very time when the arrest
                    of Jesus is being planned by the Pharisees: “Out of Galileeariseth no prophet,”
                    say the learned students of the law (vii. 52), so blinded by their malignity
                    that they cannot even read the books that describe the birthplaces of Elijah and
                    Jonah; “We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write,
                    Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph,” says Philip, happy in the completeness of
                    his new-fledged knowledge (i. 45), and ignorant that a time will come when he
                    will hear from “the son of Joseph’’this humiliating rebuke, “Have I been with
                    you so long, and hast thou not known Me, Philip <hi rend="italic">1”</hi></p>
                <p>Passing over the story of the woman taken in adultery as being an interpolation,
                    we are led to that section of the Gospel which treats of the doctrine of light.
                    The mention of the Father and the Son, as being two witnesses, bearing witness
                    to thi Son—according to the saying of “your law” that “the testimony of two men
                    is true” (viii. 12-17)—is a subtle use of the words of Scripture, such as we
                    look for vainly in the teaching of Christ as preserved by the synoptists.<note

                    light and the truth, and between truth and freedom, and the dialogue that
                    follows upon the genuine children of Abraham, remind us, in part, of the
                    synoptic version of the Baptist’s teaching about the children of Abraham (Mat.
                    iii. 8; Lu. iii. 8); in part, of the teaching of St Paul concerning the freedom
                    of “Jerusalem which is above” (Gal. iv. 26; and compare Rom. vi. 16-20).<note

                    to connect with ver. 34, “<hi rend="italic">Whosoever committeth sin is the

                    in the house for ever, but the Son abideth ever; if the Son therefore shall make
                    you free, ye shall be free indeed.” The italicized words seem to confuse the
                    thought. The argument that seems required is this. “No mere servant, such as
                    Moses, is a safe patron for those slaves who desire the master of the house to
                    enfranchise them; the safe patron is the Son, whose influence in the house is
                    permanent.” Just such an argument is found in the Epistle to the Hebrews (iii.
                    5; viii. 3). “Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, . . . but Christ
                    as a son over His own house, whose house are we and in the same epistle Christ
                    is said to “abide” <hi rend="italic">(μivnv)</hi> a priest continually, and to

                    teaching of the church is here confused by the addition of the italicized
                    words.</p></note></p>
                <p>The climax of hatred and insult of the Jews is most appropriately expressed
                    (viii. 48), “Say we not well that Thou art a Samaritan and hast a devil ?” and
                    it is also appropriate to a discourse on “the Light that lighteth every man
                    coming into the world” that the Jews should be informed that even Abraham saw
                    that light and rejoiced. It is probable that both here and in xii. 3G we ought
                    (in spite of the LXX. usage) to translate <hi rend="italic">lκpvβη</hi> “was
                    hid” (c∕'. Lu. xix. 42; Heb. xi. 23), and that we must suppose the intervention
                    of some supernatural agency in a judicial retribution hiding the Light from the
                    children of darkness who seek to destroy it.</p>
                <p>The section on light terminates with an appropriate sign, the opening of the eyes
                    of the blind man, who is sent to wash his eyes in the waters of a pool named
                    Siloam. The evangelist sees a mysterious meaning in the name of the pool. As the
                    Baptist had baptized in Aenon near to Salim, 7.c.,the “waters” near to and
                    preparing the wayfor “peace”;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    emphasizes the fact that Melchisedek, the true High Priest, the giver of wine

                    or drunkenness, and the impotent man had been healed in Bethesda or the “house
                    of mercy,” so now the opening of the eyes of the blind man is effected in part
                    by the direct action of the Light of the world, but in part also by the
                    instrumentality of water at apool named “Sent,”·— a word which may apply to an
                    aqueduct, “<hi rend="italic">missio</hi> aquarum,” or to Him whom the Jews
                    expected as the “Sent,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Messiah. The conclusion
                    of the section on light (ix. 39), “For judgment I am come into this world; that
                    they which see not might see, and that they which see might be made blind,”
                    accords with the passage in Matthew and Luke where Christ acknowledges to the
                    Father that it hath seemed good to Him to reveal these things to babes and to
                    hide them from the wise and prudent (Mat. xi. 25; Lu. x. 21); and the climax
                    appropriately introduces the Pharisees, confident in the “lamp of the law,”
                    asking, in a tone which suggests the utter impossibility of an affirmative
                    answer, “Are we blind also?” The answer of Jesus distinguishes two kinds of
                    darkness in the soul—the involuntary darkness arising from inexperience of the
                    light, and the voluntary darkness which arises from experience and rejection of
                    the light. His answer explains the sense in which the word “hypocrite” was so
                    often applied to the Pharisees by Jesus in the synoptists. The Pharisees were in
                    darkness, and, like all other men, had received gleams from “the light which
                    lighteth every man,” convicting them of their darkness, and leading them to say,
                    “We see not,” if they had but been honest. But they persisted in saying, “We
                    see.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    41). These latter words, whether uttered or not by Jesus in the exact shape in
                    which the Fourth Gospel gives them, are undoubtedly true to the spirit of His
                    teaching; and they furnish a suitable end to the discourses on light, bringing
                    prominently forward that “reproving” or “convincing” power of light which is one
                    of the special attributes of that Holy Spirit to whom, step by step, the Fourth
                    Gospel is leading us.</p>
                <p>The metaphor of the good shepherd suggests an important difference between the
                    Fourth Gospel and the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, viz., the absence of all
                    allegory and almost all parable in the former. Why did the author, who rejected
                    so many other parabolic subjects, retain only this parable of the shepherd in
                    common with them? The answer may be, partly that it is a parable based upon the
                    teaching of Philo, who distinguishes between mere indulgent “keepers of
                    sheep’’and “shepherds,” somewhat in the same way in which our parable
                    distinguishes between “hirelings”and shepherds; and he adds that the Supreme
                    Shepherd is God, who orders all His flock of created things through the Logos,
                    Plis first-born Son <hi rend="italic">{Plantatio,</hi> &lt;fcc., 11). In part,
                    perhaps, the author may have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n860/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0860-0837"/> felt that the synoptic picture of the shepherd
                    “leaving the ninety and nine sheep in the wilderness” while He seeks the single
                    wanderer, requires at least to be supplemented by the picture of Him who putteth
                    forth His sheep, and is followed by them, so that none of them wander. But a
                    principal reason for introducing this parable at the conclusion of the doctrine
                    of light, and before the narration of the death of Christ, is to prepare the way
                    for that death, by exhibiting the reason for it in a clear light. It is true
                    that Jesus has, before now, predicted that He is to be “lifted up” (iii. 14,
                    viii. 28) and slain (vii. 19, viii. 40); but it needs to be distinctly stated
                    that Jesus will not only be slain, but voluntarily slain; and the motive
                    requires to be expressed. This is explained in the synoptists by saying that He
                    came to give His life as a ransom (λυτpov) for many (Mat. xx. 28; Mk. x. 45).
                    But to whom was this “ransom” to be paid <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi>! To God
                    or to the evil one? The question was a difficult one to answer; and the Fourth
                    Gospel avoids, though it does not solve, an insoluble difficulty by substituting
                    a new metaphor for that of ransom: “I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd
                    giveth His life for the sheep.” Then, in a master-piece of delicate spiritual
                    subtlety, while the expression “the Good Shepherd will even be slain by the wolf
                    for the sheep’s sake”—which would have introduced all sorts of intricate
                    difficulties—is avoided, the same thing is, by antithesis, indirectly
                    suggested—-“But the hireling seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and
                    fleeth.” A repetition of this statement leads to a more emphatic reiteration
                    that the Shepherd will lay down His life of His own free will (the essence of
                    sacrifice), “in order that He may take it again” (x. 17)—thus entirely
                    neutralizing the suspicion (so carefully avoided above) that the Good Shepherd
                    may be doomed to succumb to the wolf.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The use of ύψοΰν (“exalt”) to denote what the synoptists
                    (Mat. XX. 19; xxvi. 2; Lu. xxiv. 7) denoted by <hi rend="italic">στaυρουv</hi>
                    (“crucify ”) is very remarkable. In the synoptists, ΰψοΰν always means “to
                    honour highly” (“every one that <hi rend="italic">exalteth</hi> himself shall be
                    abased” (Mat. xxiii. 12; Lu. xiv. 11); but, in the Fourth Gospel, Jesus uses it
                    in addressing (viii. 28) His future murderers, “When ye <hi rend="italic">exalt
                    (iψω&lt;τητε)</hi> the Son of Man”: comp, viii. 40, “Ye seek to slay Me.”
                    Strictly speaking, of course, we must say that ύψοΰν is not the <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;ττaυpοvv,</hi> but the result of it.</p></note></p>
                <p>Two points remain to be considered in this chapter (x.). The words, “All that
                    ever came before Me are thieves and robbers,” have naturally caused some
                    difficulty; but it is possible that some words, such as “in comparison with Me,”
                    are to be understood; and if the meaning was, “all previous redeemers of mankind
                    have been, in comparison with the true Redeemer, self-interested and ambitious,”
                    then, such language becomes compatible with the author’s point of view; and,
                    even looked at from the synoptic side, it presents little more difficulty than
                    the saying that John the Baptist, though the greatest of the prophets, was less
                    than the least in the kingdom of God.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Compare Philo, <hi rend="italic">Abraham,</hi> 44, where a
                    similar contrast is drawn between the distinctive “kingdoms” of human rulers and
                    the beneficent “kingdom” of the ideal mam</p></note> But the second point is of
                    more importance. In defending Himself (x. 35) against the charge of making
                    Himself God, Jesus is made by the author to argue that, if the judges of Israel
                    in the Psalms are addressed as, in a certain sense, divine and gods,—“I have
                    said ye are gods,”— <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> might He Himself without
                    blasphemy call Himself the Son of God. But, if this argument might be adopted,
                    then it might be urged that the Son of God differed from other sons of God only
                    in degree, or, if in anything else, only in pre-existence, and the special
                    privilege of pre-existence has been already destroyed by the evangelist; for, in
                    the introduction to the healing of the blind man, he has caused the disciples of
                    Jesus to take for granted, and Jesus not to impugn, the doctrine that all men
                    exist before birth: “Master, who did sin, this man or his parents, that he was
                    born blind? Jesus answered, Neither this man nor his parents; but that the works
                    of God should be made manifest in him” (ix. 2, 3). But if all men pre exist, and
                    if to all men, in a certain sense, may be addressed the title of “God,” it would
                    follow that even the Eternal Son of God, by whom the world was made, would be
                    but the eldest among many brethren. It is scarcely possible that the evangelist
                    intended his readers to follow out this train of thought; but it is
                    unquestionable that in spite of the readiness to admit supernatural incidents,
                    the author’s habit of referring all phenomena to the action of certain
                    elements—water, spirit, light, darkness, flesh, blood, and the rest—leads him
                    (perhaps unconsciously) into a habit of describing and perhaps even conceiving
                    the life and work of Christ Himself as conforming itself to an unalterable law,
                    which is none the less a law, because it isalso a will, the will of our Father.
                    The works that He does are “prepared by the Father.” His sheep hear Him; those
                    that are not His sheep do not hear Him. The same thought is expressed, whether
                    the law be regarded as the fixed order of things or as the will of the Father:
                    “No man can come unto Me except the Father which has sent Me draw him.”</p>
                <p>Again and again He disclaims caprice, and even the exercise of an independent
                    will: “I came down from heaven not to do Mine own will but the will of Him that
                    sent Me” (vi. 38). Though judgment is committed to Him by the Father, yet so
                    rigidly is His power and desire to judge restrained by facts or laws (or by
                    whatever other name the truth may be called), that He solemnly declares that <hi
                    rend="italic">He</hi> does not really judge, it is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >facts</hi> that judge. “I do not judge,” He says (xii. 47), but “the word that
                    I have spoken shall judge him;” and even where He accepts the task of judging,
                    He declares that He judges “as He hears” (v. 30), and “with the Father that sent
                    Him” (viii. 16), <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> according to truth. The same
                    conception of the work of the Word as being (like the working of the elements)
                    universal, continuous (v. 17), and according to law, is expressed both in the
                    prologue to the Gospel (John i. 1-9), and in the Epistle also, where the writer
                    declares that the commandment which he gives to the church from Christ is “no
                    new commandment,” but an old commandment which men had had “from the
                    beginning.”</p>
                <p>We come nowto the last of the pre-resurrection “signs” of Jesus—the raising of
                    Lazarus. Even those who maintain the historical accuracy of every detail of this
                    narrative will scarcely deny that its symbolic meaning goes down, and is
                    intended to go down, to an act far deeper and far vaster than the revivification
                    of the brother of Mary and Martha. Remembering the teaching of Γaul (1 Cor. xv.
                    45) that there are two men,—the former the “living soul” or fleshly animal
                    nature <hi rend="italic">(ψvχη ζωσα),</hi> the latter the “quickening or
                    life-giving spirit” <hi rend="italic">(πνεύμα</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ζωοποιοvv)</hi>; the former the first Adam, the latter the second Adam—we see
                    at once in this miracle the second Adam raising up the first Adam from spiritual
                    death, by imparting to him His own life. The very word used by Paul to describe
                    the second Adam <hi rend="italic">(ζωοποιειv)</hi> is used by our author to
                    describe the prerogative of the Son—“the Son quickeneth <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ζωοποιεί)</hi> whom He will” (v. 21). Other meanings may, no doubt, be
                    conveyed beneath this central incident of the Fourth Gospel; nor is it
                    impossible that the author, before describing how the Saviour laid down His life
                    for mankind, wished to give the best possible proof of the spontaneousness of
                    the action (asseverated above, x. 17, 18) by showing that He was actually the
                    source of life to others. As a preparation for His resurrection on the third
                    day, what could be better than that He should raise from the dead one who had
                    been four days lying in the grave? If, also, a preparation was needed for the
                    doctrine of the Spirit, which is soon to come before <pb break="no"

                    purpose too. For the Spirit is the source of life (ζω∏κωτατov, Philo calls it,
                    <hi rend="italic">Creation,</hi> 7); and, therefore, just as the doctrine of the
                    living water is preceded by the miracle of the water changed into wine, and the
                    doctriue of bread by the miracle of bread, and the doctrine of the supersession
                    of the intermittent sabbath by the continuous loviug activity of the Father and
                    the Son (v. 17) is preceded by the miracle of sabbathhealing vouchsafed to the
                    man to whom the intermittent spring was useless, and the doctrine of the Light
                    of the world is preceded by the miracle of giving light to the blind, so is it
                    natural, and, as it were, proportionate, that the doctrine of the quickening
                    Spirit (c∕. vi. G3, το <hi rend="italic">πvεvpΛ</hi><hi rend="italic">:στε

                <p>The anointing and the triumphal entry into Jerusalem having been discussed above,
                    we pass to the last discourses (xii. 20 to xvii. 26). The last discourses in the
                    synoptists treat of the second coming of Jesus in the clouds of heaven, and of
                    the day of judgment; the last discourses in the Fourth Gospel treat rather of
                    the continuous and increased presence of Jesus in the hearts of the disciples,
                    of the reproving or judgment of the world by the Holy Spirit, and generally of
                    the function of the Spirit in the church. In other words, the Fourth Gospel
                    exhibits in a spiritualized form that which the synoptists set forth through
                    material imagery. The promise of the future presence of Christ had been
                    expressed by the synoptists in the legacy of His body and blood, which Christ is
                    described as bequeathing to His disciples. The Fourth Gospel, which omits this
                    incident (possibly as being already sufficiently known and receiving sufficient
                    attention), lays more stress on the presence of the Spirit as Christ’s
                    substitute. It is important to observe that both the synoptic account of the
                    last supper, and the last discourses in the Fourth Gospel, are founded on one
                    and the same basis of historical fact, viz., that Christ approached death with
                    the expressed conviction that His work would not be frustrated by it, but that
                    He would remain for ever a living power in the hearts of His disciples. There is
                    also, even in the Gospel of St Mark, an intimation that His disciples were to be
                    aided by a “Holy Spirit,” which should speak for them before princes and kings:
                    “And when they lead you away, betraying you, take no forethought what ye shall
                    speak, neither rehearse it; but whatsoever shall be given to you in that hour,
                    this speak: for it is not ye that speak, but the <hi rend="italic">Holy
                    Spirit</hi>” (Mk. xiii. 11). To the same effect Jesus speaks in the parallel
                    passage of Luke (xxi. 14,15), bidding His disciples not to rehearse their
                    defence (προ/ζελετάμ ΰττολογί/^ναι), for He will give them “a <hi rend="italic"
                    >mouth</hi> and wisdom,” which their adversaries shall not be able to gainsay.
                    Thus, even from our earliest Gospel, it would seem that to those unlettered
                    Galilean peasants, diffident (as Moses had been before them) of the sufficiency
                    of their rhetoric to plead their cause before the bar of the great ones of the
                    earth, a promise had been made of a “mouth” that should plead for them. The Holy
                    Spirit was to be their Advocate. It is not likely that Jesus should have uttered
                    these two expressions (quoted above) and no more, about the Spirit which was to
                    be His substitute. Therefore, if the author of the Fourth Gospel had access to
                    any apostolic sayings and traditions that illustrated the teaching of Christ
                    during the last two or three days before His death, we might naturally expect to
                    find in these traditions something more about the Spirit which was to be the
                    Advocate of the disciples when pleading without their Master before the
                    sanhedrin, and before princes and kings. Accordingly, finding in the last
                    discourses of the Fourth Gospel an ampler doctrine on this subject, we have no
                    ground, <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> for regarding it with suspicion. True,
                    the doctrine is set forth here, as elsewhere, in the peculiar language of the
                    writer, so that we are absolutely certain that we have not the exact words
                    uttered by Jesus; but this need not hinder us from accepting the thoughts as the
                    thoughts of Jesus, if we can throughout trace the synoptic doctrine. In the
                    synoptists Jesus predicts that He will “rise again obviously the letter of this
                    prediction, though important, implies a still more important spiritual meaning
                    beneath it. For this prediction would not have been satisfied by any amount of
                    literal fulfilment if Jesus had merely walked from His grave and exhibited
                    Himself alive, by tangible as well as ocular proof, to thousands of curious
                    observers, hostile as well as friendly, unless He had at the same time poured a
                    new influence or influent spirit into the hearts of those to whom He manifested
                    Himself. It is characteristic of our evangelist that he realized (1) that the
                    essence of the resurrection of Christ consists in His spiritual resurrection and
                    intensified presence in the hearts of His disciples; (2) that this resurrection,
                    triumphing over death, and making death the stepping-stone to a more active
                    life, is as much in accordance with law, as is the growth of the corn of wheat
                    which (xii. 24), “except it fall into the ground and die, abideth alone; but if
                    it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.” This law—illustrated daily by the
                    increased influence of the dead upon the living, no less than by the fruitful
                    death of the “corn of wheat ”—a law so simple and yet so profound, like all the
                    other laws enunciated by Jesus, can hardly have proceeded from any other than
                    from Jesus Himself. The spiritual depth of the doctrine, and the similarity
                    which it bears to the synoptic prediction (in spite of the difference of outward
                    form), furnish strong arguments that, in the last discourses of the Fourth
                    Gospel, we have much of our Lord’s own teaching, though modified by the medium
                    through which it is conveyed to us.</p>
                <p>The doctrine of the Spirit, regarded not now as the purifying element in
                    conjunction with water, but as the Advocate or Paraclete—being the highest and
                    most esoteric doctrine of all—is reserved for the inner circle of His disciples.
                    First, therefore, it is necessary to bring to an end the doctrine of Jesus to
                    the outside world; and the battle between light and darkness, between Jesus and
                    the Pharisees, ends with a recapitulation and conclusion of the doctrine of
                    light. The Gentile world, appearing on the stage in the person of some inquiring
                    Greeks, stretches out her hand to the Messiah (xii. 20); a voice from heaven
                    attests His glory (xii. 28). The Son of God pronounces the fall of the evil one,
                    and, almost in the same word, His own victorious death (xii. 31, 32). Then the
                    light is hidden from the rebellious nation (xii. 36); the evangelist pronounces
                    against them the sentence of condemnation, that they are blinded because they
                    loved darkness more than light, and the praise of men more than the praise of
                    God; and for the last time the voice of Jesus is heard, as it were from behind a
                    cloud, warning those whom He has left in darkness that in rejecting Him they
                    have rejected the Father also (xii. 37-50).</p>
                <p>The esoteric doctrine begins with a parable of action, in which the Lord, by
                    washing the feet of His disciples, teaches them humility. Two classes of
                    heretics seem aimed at in this parable,—those who reject the washing of Jesus,
                    to whom Jesus replies, “If I wash thee not, thou <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n862/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0862-0839"/> hast no part with Me;” and those who laid stress
                    on repeated baptisms or purifications, “He that is (wholly) washed (λ∈λoυ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> j</hi> α∈voς) needeth not save to wash (√7rτeιv) his feet.”
                    Now Judas, the child of darkness, goes forth from the chamber, and the
                    evangelist seizes the moment to tell us that “it was night” (xiii. 30). Yet in
                    this hour of darkness the hour of glorification is hailed by Jesus; and He
                    conveys to His disciples, not indeed a new testament, but a new commandment,
                    “that ye love one another ”,(ver. 34). How could this be called a new
                    commandment for those who had been commanded long ago by Jesus to love even
                    their enemies, much more their friends'? The answer is found in the context: “As
                    I have loved you, that ye also love one another,” the meaning being, that after
                    the death of Jesus, the memory of His love, enhanced in His absence, would
                    spring up as an entirely new power within their hearts, so that “love” would
                    assume a new meaning, and the command to love—though as old as the first
                    influence of the Word, and therefore as the creation of man—would become
                    essentially a new commandment. These words occur almost verbatim in the First
                    Epistle of John (ii. 7), and, from their language, they can hardly be accepted
                    as giving the letter of the words of Jesus; but they go down to the very roots
                    of His teaching. The importance here attached to this new commandment of love
                    leads us to observe that, throughout the whole of these discourses, love, almost
                    as much as the Spirit, occupies the thoughts; and, indeed, in chapters xiii.,
                    xiv., XV , and xvii.,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Note the curious break in chapter xvi., where the word άγαπάν does not occur
                    at all, and <hi rend="italic">&lt;pιλt7v</hi> is twice used, xvi. 27.</p></note>
                    the word αγαπάν occurs 24 times, against 10 times in all the rest of the Gospel.
                    The connexion is obvious: step by step we are being led up to God; and God is
                    love. The doctrine of the Spirit can reveal no higher manifestation of Him than
                    this; and the Spirit itself is a Spirit of love, which will find its home only
                    in the hearts of those that love.</p>
                <p>Although Jesus has not expressly predicted His death, yet the warnings of
                    betrayal and departure have troubled the hearts of His disciple3. To comfort
                    them Jesus promises that He will return, and be still present with them. But
                    neither is the path of His departure and return, nor is His presence itself—so
                    He warns Thomas and Philip—to be regarded as material. He will (spiritually) be
                    more present with them, when, and because, He will be (materially) absent.
                    Greater works will they do than He has done, because He, abiding with the Father
                    above, will lift up their hearts to heaven—their home henceforth because their
                    treasure, Christ, is there—and will make them one with Himself and with the
                    Father, in will and in power. And here is repeated the saying, also found in the
                    synoptists, that whatsoever the disciples pray for they shall obtain,— joined
                    with the assurance that they shall do greater works (tpγα) than He Himself does
                    (xiv. 12). Note here that our evangelist brings out more clearly than the
                    synoptists the spiritual meaning of the promise concerning prayer, and makes it
                    evident that, as above, the works (∈pγα) meant are not “miracles”
                    (Swàjueiç),—not the casting of a material mountain into the sea, as might be
                    inferred from a misinterpretation of the synoptists,—but the Messianic “works”
                    of forgiveness and regeneration.</p>
                <p>The nature of Christ’s future presence in the hearts of His disciples is
                    differently described in different passages. At one time (xiv. 30) He declares
                    that He Himself, together with the Father, will take up His abode in every heart
                    that loves Him; but more often He uses the word used by Mark above, and speaks
                    of a <hi rend="italic">Spirit</hi> which shall be sent to them by the Father. He
                    applies to the Spirit the very title we have been led to apply to the Spirit as
                    described by Mark— the Advocate (Παράκλητο?, or Advocatus). As a paracletus or
                    advocatus was wont to explain the law to Greek or</p>
                <p>Roman clients, and to put words into their mouths, or rather to be himself their
                    spokesman, so the spiritual Paraclete or Advocate would not only put words into
                    the mouths of the disciples when they stood before the bar of kings (Mk. xiii.
                    11), but would also teach them all things, and bring to their remembrance all
                    the spiritual laws laid down by their lawgiver Christ (xiv. 26). In one sense,
                    the Spirit is a witness, .because He testifies of Christ (xv. 26); but even here
                    He is in reality an advocate, for the testimony is regarded as not uttered by
                    the Spirit directly, but indirectly through the mouths of the inspired disciples
                    who are to be “martyrs” or witnesses <hi rend="italic">(paρτvρeς)</hi> for
                    Christ (xv. 27). It was very natural that that aspect of the advocate’s work
                    which most impressed the editor of our earliest Gospel should retire into the
                    background when the first brunt of the collision between the church and the
                    world was over; and that gradually the work of the advocate should assume a
                    wider province than that of merely educating the disciples to plead the cause of
                    Christ in the presence of Gentile judges. Hence Paul regards the Spirit as
                    teaching the disciples not so much what to say in their defence before, earthly
                    kings as rather in their prayers before the King of Kings: “We know not what we
                    should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us
                    with groanings which cannot be uttered” (Rom. viii. 26); “The Spirit searcheth
                    all things, yea, the deep things of God, .... which things also we speak, not in
                    the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Spirit teacheth” (1
                    Cor. ii. 10-13). But this conception, carried a stage further, makes the
                    paraclete an advocate not revealing the laws of the celestial kingdom to the
                    enfranchised citizen of it, nor yet revealing the will of the Father in heaven
                    to the child on earth, but rather pleading the cause of the child before the
                    offended Father; and in this sense Philo seems to use the word when he describes

                    to the Father of the world that he should have as his paraclete the Son, in
                    order (through Him) to obtain pardon of sins and supply of blessings <hi

                    lastly, in this sense, the First Epistle of John (i. 1, 2) seems to use the word
                    in the passage, “If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
                    Christ the righteous; and He is the propitiation for our sins.”<note

                    the word in this somewhat lower sense in the Epistle, in the Gospel he nowhere
                    uses it thus. Thêre the Paraclete’s function is to be, as in Luke, “a mouth, a
                    wisdom” (Lu. xxi. 15); to be a substitute for the helping presence of Christ
                    (xiv. 16); to teach and remind (xiv. 26); to testify and to aid the disciple to
                    testify (xv. 26); and to convict the world of sin (xvi. 8);—but nowhere to
                    obtain forgiveness of sins from the Father by pleading the cause of the
                    disciples in His presence. It is not an unreasonable inference that the
                    evangelist’s different use of this word in the Gospel and the Epistle may have
                    arisen from the fact that in the former he is adhering more closely to the
                    original use of it as handed down by Christ Himself.</p>
                <p>Besides describing the work of the Paraclete as a consequence of the departure of

                    seem to suggest the influence of Philo; and in both of these Philo is rather

                    is impossible that the Spirit of God should remain for ever in the soul (though
                    it may for a time) because of our inseparable connexion with the flesh; lie adds
                    (in language which is at least liable to the interpretation of asceticism) that,
                    as Moses fixed his tent outside the camp, so those who would have the Divine
                    Spirit as a permanent tenant of their souls must put off all the things of
                    creation; the safest course being to contemplate God, not even through the

                    righteousness.</p></note> The Fourth Gospel emphasizes no less the work of the
                    Spirit in “convicting” (∈λeγχ∈ιv) the world of sin; but it is also careful to
                    say that the gift of the Spirit shall be permanent, “not as the world giveth
                    give I unto you” (xiv. 27), and that the disciples are to remain in Jesus, while
                    nevertheless not taken out of the world (xvii. 15). The Saviour is no more in
                    the world, and the disciples are in the world (xvii. 11); yet He will not pray
                    that they should be removed from the world, but only that they should be
                    delivered from the evil (ver. 15). The discourse concludes with the prayer that
                    all future believers may be knit together into one great body, which shall be in
                    the Father and the Son. while at the same time the Father and the Son are in it
                    (ver. 21, 23); and the last words of all, after innumerable periphrastic
                    metaphors to describe the promised presence of Christ with His disciples, recur
                    at last to the plain expression of His presence, “and I in you ”—not greatly
                    differing from the promise in the First Gospel (Mat. xxviii. 20), “I am with you
                    always.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is an
                    attractive symmetry in the supposition of Canon Westcott <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Iηtτod. to St John's Gospel),</hi> that these discourses (xiii., xiv., XV.),
                    in which alone is any mention made of “commandments,” are intended to be a kind
                    of Sermon in the Chamber, corresponding to the Sermon on the Mount. The Sermon
                    on the Mount sets forth the new law of Christ; the Sermon in the Chamber
                    vivifies the new law with the new Spirit. This supposition exactly corresponds
                    with the “spiritual” (Muratorian fragment) motive of the Gospel; and the
                    esoteric nature of the doctrine is not inconsistent with the statements which
                    are said to be mainly “based on direct knowledge of Papias’s book” (Westcott,
                    <hi rend="italic">Canon,</hi> p. 76), that Papias, “a dear disciple of John,”
                    wrote five books entitled “exoterica.” For “exoterica” imply
                    “esoterica.”</p></note></p>
                <p>There is doubtless a purpose in this accumulation of •obviously inconsistent
                    statements of the local relations between the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and
                    the Church: “I am in the Father, and the Father in Me;” “Ye in Me, and I in
                    you;” “I go unto the Father;” “The Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My
                    name;” “The Comforter whom I will send unto you from the Father;” “I came forth
                    from the Father, and am come into the world —the intention being to prevent the
                    mind of the reader from attaching any importance to mere local relations between
                    the Three Persons, and to force him to form spiritual conceptions instead of
                    local by showing that the most opposite local relations may be simultaneously
                    predicated. Thus contradiction after contradiction leads the reader at last to
                    pierce beneath the literal integuments to the spiritual truth concealed below
                    them; and, aided by the bold analogy (xvii. 21) derived from human unity (“that
                    they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also
                    may be one in us”), we are led at last to discern that the unity is not that of
                    place, but of will; and that the bond of unity is not sight working through
                    material presence in material light, but Love working through spiritual sight or
                    the spirit of truth, independently of material presence. And so, after all, the
                    evangelist leads his reader to see that the coming of the Paraclete (like all
                    things else in his Gospel) is according to law; “If I go not away, the Comforter
                    will not come unto you” (xvi. 7); “The Holy Spirit was not yet given, because
                    that Jesus was not yet glorified” (vii. 39). Not until the dead has passed away
                    from us does the “idea of his life” creep into our minds—</p>
                <p>“Apparelled in more precious habit,</p>
                <p>More moving-delicate and full of life</p>
                <p>Than when He lived indeed and the Eternal Word, who subjected Himself to the laws
                    of human nature in birth and life, may be supposed without irreverence to have
                    subjected Himself to, or perhaps rather we should say to have availed Himself
                    of, the same laws of human nature which regulate God’s ordinance of death.</p>
                <p>The crucifixion having been considered above, we pass to the narrative of the
                    resurrection. Matthew and Mark imply that Jesus manifested Himself to the
                    disciples in Galilee; Luke mentions none but manifestations in Judaea; the
                    Fourth Gospel mentions manifestations in both places. Compared with Matthew and
                    Luke, the Fourth Gospel may be said to handle the subject more familiarly,
                    taking the resurrection, so to speak, more as a matter of course, and
                    representing Jesus as moving in a more human fashion among His disciples after
                    He had risen from the grave, helping them in their fishing, holding long
                    conversations with them, and, in a word, renewing almost without a break the
                    intercourse of the days before the crucifixion. In Matthew, the Christ after
                    death appears once, upon a mountain, doubtfully discerned by some, and emits one
                    final message, sending His disciples to evangelize the world, and promising them
                    His perpetual presence. In Luke the risen Christ “vanishes,” causes fear and
                    terror to His disciples, and is supposed to be a “spirit” till He eats food in
                    their presence; finally He is “parted from them.” In John, the ascension, though
                    alluded to, is not described; and everything else that might give the
                    manifestation a phantasmal character is studiously kept in the background. No
                    mention is made of the angel who descends (Mat. xxviii. 2) from heaven to roll
                    away the stone from the sepulchre, terrifying the keepers of the grave, and
                    bidding the women “fear not.” It is rather assumed that, by His own unaided
                    strength, Christ burst the bars of the grave, and after leisurely laying aside
                    the grave-clothes, and the “napkin in a place by itself” (John xx. 7), went
                    forth to converse with His disciples. It is true that the Fourth Gospel does not
                    attempt to conceal the fact that the manifestations of Jesus were more than once
                    not recognized by His disciples at first; but, in the cases of non-recognition,
                    it is suggested (as in Luke), not that the manifestation was faint or shadowy
                    (as seemingly in Mat. xxviii. 17, “And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him;
                    but some doubted”), but that they mistook Him for a stranger (xx. 14; xxi. 4).
                    That Jesus ate in the presence of His disciples is not stated, nor can it be
                    said to be implied; but His familiar presence at the meal of the disciples (xxi.
                    13) suggests a real presence almost as effectively as the narrative of the
                    eating of the fish and honeycomb in Luke. Additional conviction is also obtained
                    by taking one of the apostles, Thomas, as a type of resolute scepticism,
                    refusing to believe unless he touches the body of the risen Saviour, and by
                    describing how even such scepticism as this was converted into certainty.
                    Moreover, as the water and the blood were visibly given by Jesus on the cross,
                    so—lest the giving up of the breath on the cross should be a scarcely
                    sufficiently noticeable type of the gift of the holy breath or Spirit—</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n864/mode/1up"

                <p>our evangelist records that Jesus breathed on His disciples and said, “Receive ye
                    the holy breath” (or Spirit)—at the same time connecting with this highest gift
                    the highest activity for which a human soul can be inspired by God, the faculty
                    of forgiving sins. It is probable that the Gospel originally ended at xx. 31:
                    “But these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of
                    God, and that believing ye might have life through His name.” This is a most
                    appropriate termination; and what follows bears every appearance of being an
                    appendix added by the author, describing a miraculous draught of 153 fishes, and
                    a meal of Jesus with seven of the disciples, followed by a dialogue between
                    Jesus and Peter, in which the death of the latter is predicted, and the
                    erroneous tradition that the beloved disciple should not die is shown to be
                    baseless.</p>
                <p>Three inferences seem probable from this last narrative :— (1) that there had
                    been at Ephesus a tradition (arising perhaps from the extreme old age of John
                    and from some such expression as is recorded in John xxi. 22) that John would
                    not die till the Lord had appeared; (2) that John had died when this account was
                    written (for if he were living and past his ninetieth year, at a time when the
                    church daily expected the coming of the Lord, the Ephesian Christians would not
                    have needed any explanation or softening away of a prediction which would seem
                    to them very likely to be fulfilled); but (3) if John was dead, it must seem
                    that the words “we know” <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not have been added (as
                    they might be supposed to have been added, according to the Muratorian legend)
                    by Andrew and Philip, who in all probability died before John died; and if John
                    was dead, it must seem that the words <hi rend="italic">would</hi> not have been
                    added by any elders of Ephesus representing the generation after John; for how
                    could they—who stood on a footing altogether subordinate and inferior in point
                    of reputation, and with no opportunities of information— have ventured to ratify
                    the testimony of the “beloved disciple?”</p>
                <p>It is more easy to arrive at negative than at positive results, when evidence is
                    so slight; but it seems probable that the author, attempting to give the
                    spiritual essence of the gospel of Christ, as a gospel of love, and assigning
                    the Ephesian Gospel to the beloved disciple who had presided over the Ephesian
                    church, by way of honour and respect (for the same reasons which induced the
                    author of the 2d Epistle of Peter to assign that Epistle to the leading
                    apostle), and being at the same time conscious that the book (though
                    representing the Ephesian doctrine generally, and in part the traditions of John
                    the apostle, as well as those of Andrew, Philip, Aristion, and John the elder)
                    did not represent the exact words and teaching of the disciple—added the words
                    “We know, &amp;c.,’’partly as a kind of <hi rend="italic">imprimatur</hi> of
                    Andrew, Philip, and the rest; partly in order to imply that other traditions
                    besides those of John are set forth in the book; partly to characterize the book
                    as a Gospel of broader basis and greater authority than the less spiritual
                    traditions issuing from non-apostolic authors, which our evangelist desired to
                    correct or supplement. Nor is it in the least unlikely that this Gospel does
                    represent the teaching of Andrew and Philip, and Aristion and John the elder, as
                    well as that of John. If Papias of Hierapolis gathered up the traditions of
                    these apostles and elders, why not also our author, writing in Ephesus perhaps
                    several years before Papias? It is assuredly not for nothing that the name of
                    “Matthew,” mentioned in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, is not found in the Fourth
                    Gospel; noris it without significance that the Gospel begins and ends with an
                    inner apostolic circle. The “twelve” are indeed mentioned, but as in the
                    background. The beloved disciple, Andrew and Peter, Γhilip and Nathanael,—these,
                    and these only, are mentioned as called by Jesus in the beginning; Peter and
                    Thomas, Nathanael and the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples (presumably
                    the same list as those above, with the addition of James, the son of Zebedee,
                    and Thomas), are mentioned as alone admitted to the sacred meal which closes the
                    Gospel. This fact marks the whole character of the book; it is esoteric and
                    eclectic, and designedly modifies the impression produced by the tradition
                    previously recorded by the synoptics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The criticism of the first three Gospels.—</hi> For fourteen
                    centuries the church was content to follow Augustine <hi rend="italic">{f)c

                    humble companion (pedissequus) and abridger” of Matthew. Towards the end of the
                    18th century this dogma was shaken, and two different hypotheses were put
                    forward: (1) that the evangelists had borrowed from one another, either Matthew
                    from Mark, or Mark from Luke, or even (so capricious and baseless were the
                    hypotheses which now started into existence) Matthew and Mark from Luke; (2)
                    that all the three Gospels depended upon an original and common Gospel. The
                    first of these hypotheses may for convenience be called the “borrowing”
                    hypothesis; the second may be called the “traditional” hypothesis. Eichhorn was
                    the first to systematize the “traditional” hypothesis, maintaining (1794) that
                    the original tradition was a written Aramaic Gospel, known to the three
                    synoptists, but afterwards (1804) so far modifying his views as to recognize
                    that the Aramaic tradition had been translated into Greek, and passed through
                    several documentary stages, before it assumed the form preserved in the triple
                    version of our synoptists.</p>
                <p>Inside the circle of those who maintained the traditional hypothesis there now
                    arose inner divisions upon the question, which evangelist most closely
                    approximated to the “original” tradition. Eichhorn had assigned (1804) the
                    priority to Matthew, Gιatz (1812) to Mark. Moreover, a new form of the
                    hypothesis was shaped out by Schleiermacher (1817), who maintained that our
                    Gospels were composed on the basis of a number of disconnected documents; while
                    Gieseler (1818) showed that it must have been, in any case, oral tradition which
                    served the needs of the earliest disciples,— tradition stereotyped by time, and
                    reduced to some kind of similar pattern before being committed to writing by the
                    synoptists. Still no certain conclusions wtre arrived at. De Wette (beginning
                    from 1826) assumed a common oral tradition for Matthew and Luke, and treated
                    Mark as an epitomizer. Credner (1836) joined Schleiermacher in tracing our
                    Gospels back to a collection of words of the Lord, which he supposed Matthew to
                    have combined with the oldest Gospel, viz., Mark; similarly Lachmann (1835).
                    Bleek (1862-1866) relapsed into Griesbach's view (1784-1790) that Mark was based
                    on Matthew’ and Luke.</p>
                <p>All these conflicting hypotheses might naturally induce those who had not
                    themselves closely studied the synoptic texts to believe that the truth of the
                    matter was unattainable, and that, in any case, the synoptic narratives (not
                    being the records of eye-witnesses, nor being preserved in unaltered documents
                    written contemporaneously with or soon after the events) must necessarily be
                    untrustworthy. Accordingly, in 1835, Strauss maintained that the whole synoptic
                    narrative was legendary or otherwise untrustworthy. The defenders of the
                    synoptists against Strauss found little consideration, and the hypothesis that
                    Mark contained the original Gospel was discredited by the extravagance of its
                    supporters. In 1846-7 Schwegler and Baur, recurring to the “borrowing
                    hypothesis,” issued it in a new form as an “adapting hypothesis.’ The original
                    Gospel was now supposed to be the Gospel of the Hebrews (seep. 818 above), which
                    was imagined to contain in all its bare truthfulness the Ebionite doctrine of
                    the early church. Matthew combined this original Jewish-minded document with
                    some other document of more liberal sentiments. Luke was at first a Pauline
                    protest against Judaism, but was afterwards supplemented, in a conciliatory
                    spirit, with passages coloured with Ebionitic and Jewish thought; Mark was
                    treated as a neutral and colourless adapter of Matthew and Luke,—“pedissequus et
                    breviator.” This was the Tübingen doctrine, sometimes called the “tendency
                    hypothesis,” because the adaptations were supposed to proceed from theological
                    “tendencies.”</p>
                <p>Ewald (beginning from 1849) combated the Tübingen theory, maintaining that (1)
                    there was an original Gospel, perhaps composed by the evangelist Philip; (2) in
                    addition to this, there was a collection of “logia” made by Matthew; (3) and,
                    out of both these documents, or by an author acquainted with these documents,
                    was formed Mark, or, at all events, Mark in its original shape; (41 Matthew
                    contains (1) (2) and (3), together with extracts from a “book of higher
                    history”; (5) three anonymous evangelists revived this narrative, which received
                    its last form at the hands of Luke (see the account of Ewald's theory in
                    Westcott’s <hi rend="italic">Gospels,</hi> p. 203). From this time the
                    compilatory and artistic character of Luke began to be generally recognized; and
                    even the Tubingen school gave up the theory that Mark had adapted Luke.
                    Hilgenfeld, “in a five years’ literary struggle with Baur” (see Holtzmann, in
                    Schenkel’s <hi rend="italic">Bibcl-Lexicon,</hi> art. “Evangelien”), proved
                    Mark’s independence. Kostlin (1853) <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n865/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0865-0842"/> advocated an original Mark as the groundwork of
                    the synoptists; together with a “Gospel of Peter” as the basis for the parts
                    common to Matthew and Luke. Ritschl (1851), recanting his former opposition, and
                    Meyer (1853) became converted to the belief in an “original Mark.” Volkmar
                    (1857) and a number of other theologians took the same view; Weiss (1861)
                    advocated a parity of originality, or rather a common original source, from
                    which Matthew and Mark borrowed equally, while occasionally Matthew borrowed
                    from Mark itself. But the work which most approximates to a proof of the
                    originality of the tradition contained in Mark is Holtzmann’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Synoptischen Evangelien,</hi> &amp;c., 1863, from
                    whose summary of the criticism of the first three Gospels (SchenkeΓs <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibel-</hi><hi rend="italic">Lexicon,</hi> “Evangelien”) these
                    statements are mainly drawn. The author of <hi rend="italic">Jesus of</hi><hi

                    Urchristenthum,</hi> 1878), the “mane-shaking of the Mark lion;” but even he,
                    with qualification <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> p. 30).</p>
                <p>The work of Dr Holtzmann last referred to is of great value; and so are Dr
                    Weiss’s <hi rend="italic">Marcusevangelium</hi> (1872) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >MaUhauscvangelivιm</hi> (1876); but it is truly lamentable that nearly a
                    century has passed in the accomplishment of so little. The reason is perhaps to
                    be looked for (1) in the amount of personality which has been introduced into
                    discussions of this kind; (2) in the haste, with which theories have been
                    erected upon the basis of single causes; (3) in the general absence of attempt
                    to classify and concentrate evidence; (4) in the failure to recognize the
                    distinction between probabilities and certainties, and the amount of labour
                    necessary to attain certainty; (5) most of all, in the absence of mechanical
                    helps. It is probable that the publication of Bruder’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Concordance</hi> in the middle of this century has done more than all the rest
                    of the hypothesis inventors, from Augustine to Hitzig, to forward the scientific
                    study of the synoptic Gospels; nor could Dr Holtzmann’s valuable work have been
                    written but for the humble assistance of Bruder. It is lamentable to think how
                    much industry, ink, and paper, and occasionally intellect as well, might have
                    been saved if there had been in common circulation from the beginning of this
                    century, along with Bruder, a harmony of the Gospels, printed after the manner
                    suggested above (p. 790), from which any one, almost without knowing Greek at
                    all, could have seen at a glance that the “pedissequus” theory of Mark was not
                    for a moment tenable, and·.that Mark <hi rend="italic">contains—</hi> by no
                    means, necessarily, <hi rend="italic">is—</hi> the original tradition from
                    which, at least in some places, Matthew and Luke independently borrowed.</p>
                <p>There are signs that a similar waste of industry is to be apprehended in the
                    further discussion of the question whether the common tradition is derived from
                    oral or documentary sources. When, for example, we find so able a critic as Dr
                    Holtzmann (Schenkel, “Evangelien,” p. 210) laying stress on the irregular form
                    <hi rend="italic">aπeκaτeστaθη</hi> occurring in the same place in all the three
                    synoptists (Mat. xii. 13; Mk. iii. 5; Lu. vi. 10) as a convincing proof that the
                    copying of documents (and not oral tradition) can alone explain so strange a
                    similarity, we naturally suppose that this irregularity is nowhere else found in
                    the Old or New Testament. But so far is this from being the case that the
                    irregular form may be with greater truth said to be the only form current in the
                    Old and New Testament, occurring not only in the three passages above, but also
                    in Mk. viii. 25 <hi rend="italic">{aπeκaτeστη)∙,</hi> in Jerem. xxiii. 8; in
                    Exod. iv. 7; in var. interpret. Gem xxiii. 16 [Trommius quotes 3 (1) Esdr. i. 36
                    (?33), but Tischendorf reads <hi rend="italic">άπΐσ-τησΐν]</hi>; and the only
                    passage in which the regular form is found, Gen. xl. 21, contains a var. lect.
                    <hi rend="italic">aπeκaτlστησev,</hi> which, no doubt, ought to be inserted in
                    the text. This may serve as an example to show how ultimately circuitous the
                    path must be through these attempted short cuts to certainty. The truth is that
                    the question of oral or documentary sources is not to be settled without a great
                    deal more of labour and of judgment than the subject has hitherto received. For
                    a statement of the oral hypothesis, which is generally adopted by English
                    scholars, the reader is referred to Westcott’s <hi rend="italic">Introduction to
                    the Gospels,</hi> pp. 161-208. It has been pointed out, however, by Dr Sanday
                    <hi rend="italic">{Academy,</hi> Sept. 21, 1878) that there has been of late an
                    increasing tendency in the three theories— the Tübingen or adaptation theory,
                    the documentary Mark theory, the oral tradition theory—to approximate to each
                    other; so that the tendency theory lias given less weight to dogmatic tendencies
                    and more weight to literary considerations. The documentary Mark theory allows
                    the previous influence of tradition, only stipulating for some lost documentary
                    links between the oral tradition and our Mark; while the oral theory approaches
                    to the documentary Mark theory in assuming that the oral Gospel is represented
                    most nearly by our present Mark. Nevertheless, says Dr Sanday, between the two
                    last theories (for the Tübingen theory may be left out of account) “the struggle
                    has yet to come. The division between these is almost national. In Germany no
                    one of any significance as a critic holds the oral theory. In England none of
                    our prominent writers hold anything else. France is divided. Godet ranges
                    himself on the side most popular in England. Réville was an early supporter of a
                    view similar to that which is gaining the ascendency in Germany; and the same is
                    substantially adopted by Μ. Renan.”</p>
                <p>It is greatly to be desired that, in this “struggle,” the disputants may
                    illustrate the subject in a somewhat ampler manner than has been hitherto
                    common. Different versions of the same original—tales, histories,
                    ballads—transmitted through documentary and oral sources should be compared
                    together; and more especially the phenomena of the ante-Jeromc versions of the
                    New Testament should receive the most careful study, before even the ablest
                    commentator should allow himself to use the dogmatic tone which unfortunately
                    characterizes Dr Weiss’s <hi rend="italic">Matthausevangclium</hi> in deciding
                    against the oral theory. But this is a natural characteristic of an author who
                    sees in a single <hi rend="italic">'</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">eρoυσaKhμ</hi> convincing proof of an Aramaic original (see p. 805
                    above), and to whom a <hi rend="italic">κa</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">iδoυ</hi> settles all critical disputes. With this dogmatism the
                    tone of Canon Westcott’s remarks on the oral Gospel contrasts advantageously.
                    Nevertheless, it will probably be hereafter found that the phenomena of our
                    present synoptists are due not to one, but to all, of the causes advocated by
                    the various disputants of the 18th century. Tradition, documents, theological
                    tendencies, literary modifications, misunderstanding of metaphorical parable,
                    misunderstanding of eucharistie language, misunderstanding of spiritual
                    language—all these causes will be found to have contributed to produce the
                    present synoptic result; and it will not improbably be found, as Dr Sanday
                    shrewdly suggests, that early documents have been much more modified, and early
                    oral traditions much less modified, than modern associations might have led us
                    to suppose. Future investigations will receive a considerable stimulus and help,
                    as soon as a harmony of the synoptists showing the Triple Tradition as well as
                    the double traditions (pp. 795-800 above) becomes a recognized text-book for all
                    students of the Gospels. It will also be a useful check, if no demonstration of
                    different documents (in Luke, for example) be recognized as sound until it has
                    been tested by application to other authors. For example, the proof from <hi
                    rend="italic">καί,</hi> δε, τε, <hi rend="italic">eιπe, λiγeι,</hi> λάλε?, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ιερουσαλήμ,</hi><hi rend="italic">κiριos,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ενώπιον,</hi><hi rend="italic">ebθis,</hi><hi rend="italic">καϊ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">iS</hi><hi rend="italic">ον,</hi> is by no means to be despised;
                    but it requires expression in a clea ^ picturesque way by the well-known means
                    of curves; and no proof of this kind ought to be accepted until it (or
                    corresponding proof) has been applied,—first <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi>
                    negatively, to several passages recognized as genuine productions of the same
                    author (Plato, for example), and then (5), positively, to several passages, some
                    of which are recognized as genuine,others as spurious. In the first case (a) the
                    curves will exhibit no fluctuations; in the second (δ) the curves will exhibit
                    fluctuations corresponding to the fluctuations in Luke; and this will be a
                    strong and clearly intelligible proof (even to those who know no Greek—for the
                    same illustrative proof might be deduced from the application of the test to <hi
                    rend="italic">Titus</hi><hi rend="italic">Andronicus</hi> and to <hi
                    rend="italic">Hamlet)</hi> that the fluctuations of the curves are caused in
                    each case by the incoming of different documentary strata. But perhaps, to do
                    this thoroughly, it would be necessary to do it four or five times over for each
                    of the four or five principal ancient MSS. (nor ought, perhaps, even varieties
                    of spelling, and certainly not varieties of form, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >ήκθαν,</hi> &amp;c., to be neglected, as possibly pointing to the incoming of
                    different documents); and the labour is so great that, even with the avoidance
                    of all broaching of hasty theories and all personalities, a single worker could
                    hardly accomplish it with the devotion of a life,—at least that is the
                    conclusion to which the present writer has been forced after devoting some years
                    to this labour. Yet, in any case, one signal advantage will result from our
                    keeping before ourselves a high standard of demonstration, viz., that, although
                    we may bring forward theories for discussion, we shall draw a very distinct line
                    between what is proved and not proved, and shall shrink with a just horror from
                    short cuts to knowledge.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Criticism of the Fourth Gospel.—</hi> No criticism of a
                    systematic kind, says Dr Holtzmann (Schenkel’s <hi rend="italic">Bibel-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lexicon),</hi> began till the publication of Bretschneider’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Probabilia</hi> (1820), which provoked so much opposition that the
                    author retracted it. The apostolic authorship was supported by Schleiermacher,
                    and by Credner (1836), even while admitting that the Gospel could not be
                    regarded as a purely objective work. Similarly De Wette, after some doubt and
                    hesitation (1837), and Reuss (1840-64) decided for the Johannine authorship,—the
                    former being influenced by a comparison of the Fourth Gospel with the other
                    works of the 2d century. The attack of Strauss, in his <hi rend="italic">Life of
                    Jesus,</hi> being passed over (as indicating no attempt, or possibly ability, to
                    appreciate the depth of the spiritual doctrine in the Fourth Gospel, in spite of
                    the suggestiveness and occasional accuracy of his method), we come to Baur
                    (1847), who pronounced the Gospel to be a religious ideal poem, composed in the
                    2d century. A great number of writers accepted, this theory; among them, Zeller
                    and Hilgenfeld, and Schenkel and Keim in their lives of Christ, together with
                    Béville (1864) and Scholten. In the meantime an hypothesis of ‘ ‘ partial
                    authorship” had been suggested, some (Weisse in 1838, and Freytag in 1861)
                    believing that the discourses, others, as Renan (1863), believing that the
                    historical naιτatives, were genuine; while some wished to detach the Judaean
                    from the Galilean portier of the Gospel, as being distinct in authorship and
                    origin. Lücke, Ewald, Brückner, and Wittichen, adopting in various forms the
                    view of a divided authorship,-recognized in the Gospel a framework of historical
                    fact, but noted also the prominence<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n866/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0866-0843"/> of the ideal, the want of historical development,
                    and the subjective colouring given by the author to the discourses of Christ—
                    views which find a full expression in Weizsäcker’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Untersuchungen</hi><hi rend="italic">uber die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >evangelische Geschichte</hi> (1864). Canon Westcott, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction to the Gospels</hi> (5thed,, 1875), maintains apostolic
                    authorship, which is also in a special treatise <hi rend="italic">{Authorship
                    and Historical Character of the Fourth Gospel,</hi> 1872) maintained by Dr
                    Sanday. The latter work lays perhaps somewhat too much emphasis on the
                    geographical expressions which are used to prove that the author was a Jew of
                    Palestine. Many of these would appear natural for an Alexandrian Jew who had
                    spent two or three passovers at Jerusalem, and had travelled through the
                    country. Still more doubtful is the canon assumed throughout the treatise, that
                    graphic details, particularities of name, place, &amp;c., imply an
                    eye-witness—the contrary being suggested by the phenomena of the apocryphal
                    Gospels. Nor does Dr Sanday make any attempt to illustrate the Fourth Gospel
                    (except in respect of the Logos doctrine) by the teaching of Philo. Nevertheless
                    the book is eminently candid, and there is no other book in English to compare
                    with it for the light it throws, not only on the Fourth Gospel itself, but also
                    on the history of its criticism. Dr Sanday also recognizes, even more fully than
                    Canon Westcott, the subjective nature of the Gospel, at least so far as to make
                    this admission, that the words of Jesus himself and the words of the evangelist
                    are, in more than one instance, so inextricably intermixed that it is impossible
                    to tell where the former end and the latter begin. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction to the Gospel of St John,</hi> published (1879) in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Speaker's Commentary,</hi> Canon Westcott has greatly amplified
                    the valuable remarks on the Fourth Gospel contained in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction to the Study of the Gospels,</hi> and states most forcibly the
                    views of those who see in the multiplicity of detail in the Fourth Gospel one
                    among many proofs that the Gospel was composed by an eye-witness of the events
                    which it records. For the doctrine of the Logos Canon Westcott gives the
                    following list:— Gfroerer, <hi rend="italic">Philo u. d. Jud.</hi><hi
