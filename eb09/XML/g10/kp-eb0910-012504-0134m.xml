                    history of chemistry, little is definitely known about him, and about the origin
                    of the works which pass under his name. It has been a very general tradition to
                    regard Geber as an Arabian, but until the publication in recent years by
                    European scholars of the works of Arabian historians and bibliographers, the
                    probable source of the tradition has not been known. It seems to be pretty
                    generally believed that the Geber of Western Europe is the same as the person
                    who is called in full Abu Musa Dschabir (or Jabir) Ben Haijan Ben Abdallah
                    el-Sufi el-Tarsusi el-Kufi, who was reckoned the most illustrious of the
                    alchemists by the Arabs, and who is mentioned in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kitab-al-Fihrist</hi> (10th cent.), by Ibn Khallikan (13th cent.), by Haji
                    Khalfa (17th cent.), and other writers. If this be correct, Geber must have
                    flourished in the 8th century, for, according to Haji Khalfa, Dschabir Ben
                    Haijan died in the 160th year of the Hegira, which corresponds with the year
                    beginning October 19, 776 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> This date is
                    incidentally confirmed by other writers, though there are difficulties arising
                    from the date of his teacher Kalid Ben Jezid, and his patron Dschaafar
                    ess-Sadik. His birthplace was Tarsus, or, as others say, Kufa; and he is said to
                    have resided at Damascus and at Kufa. This account, though apparently the most
                    trustworthy, does not agree with the statements of D’Herbelot, quoted seemingly
                    from native sources, that Geber was born at Harran in Mesopotamia, was a Sabaean
                    by religion, and lived in the 3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> d century of the
                    Hegira. Nor does it agree with that of Leo Africanus, who in 1526 gave a
                    description of the Alchemical Society of Fez, in Africa, and told how the chief
                    authority of that society was a certain Geber, a Greek, that had apostatized to
                    Mahometanism, and lived a century after Mahomet. Leo’s story has circulated very
                    widely, but its accuracy has been impugned by Reiske and Asseman, and the works
                    of both Leo and D’Herbelot have been rejected as authorities by Wüstenfeld.
                    Other writers have tried to show that Geber was a native of Spain, or at least
                    lived at Seville, but this has probably arisen from confusing Geber the chemist
                    with other persons of the same or similar name. From the doubt encircling the
                    personality of Geber, some have gone the length of questioning whether such a
                    person ever existed but in name, and this view has been again expressed by
                    Steinschneider, who mentions “Abu Musa Dschabir Ben Haiyan, commonly called
                    Geber, an almost mythical person of the earliest period of Islam, renowned as an
                    alchemist.” While Steinschneider here exhibits notable scepticism with respect
                    to Dschabir’s very existence, he exhibits equal credulity in his belief that
                    this mythical Dschabir is identical with Geber. In the present state of the
                    question there is no alternative but to accept the account given in the Fihrist,
                    and admit the possibility of Dschabir and Geber being one and the same.
                    Confirmation of this view is to be sought in a comparison of the works ascribed
                    to Geber with those bearing the name of Dschabir. The latter are divisible into
                    two classes, those mentioned in Arabic bibliographies, and those existing in
                    manuscript in European libraries. To Dschabir is assigned the authorship of an
                    immense <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n135/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0135-0126"/> number of works ou chemistry and many other
                    topics besides. Titles of 500 of these are given in the Fihrist, and have been
                    reproduced by Hammer-Purgstall, but nothing else is known about them. Haji
                    Khalfa also enumerates the titles of several alchemical works by Dschabir, and
                    other works are mentioned by other writers. Again Arabic MSS. on alchemy bearing
                    the name of Dschabir Ben Haijan exist at Leyden, at Paris, in the British
                    Museum, and elsewhere; but these have not been critically examined as to their
                    date, age, authenticity, contents, &lt;c, It is not known if they correspond
                    with the lists already mentioned, or with the Latin MSS. or the printed
                    versions. The Latin MSS. are contained in the Vatican, at Leyden, Oxford, and
                    other places. Of these the Vatican MS. is the alleged basis of some of the
                    printed editions: and the Bodleian MSS. have been described by W. H. Black, but
                    no collation of the text of these writings for critical purposes has as yet been
                    made. The oldest of the MSS. dates from the 14th century; but if the works
                    ascribed to Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus, and others be genuine, Geber’s name
                    and writings must have been known and esteemed at a still earlier period. The
                    works which purport to have been written by Geber, and which have been printed,
                    bear the following names :— <hi rend="italic">Summa perfectionis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">; Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">investigationis,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">investigatione perfectionis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">; De</hi><hi rend="italic">inventione veritatis; Liber Pornacum;
                    Testamentum.</hi> None of the editions appear to contain the whole of these
                    tractates; there are usually found only two or three of them, but the English
                    translation contains them all except the <hi rend="italic">Testament,</hi> which
                    is considered spurious by some writers. The printed editions of these works are
                    very numerous, but they are all uncommon, and some of them are exceedingly rare.
                    No approximately complete list is contained in any bibliography, and very few
                    writers have seen more than half a dozen at most. The most complete catalogue
                    from personal inspection is given by Beckmann. It contains twelve editions, but
                    that does not comprise nearly all those which are known. While some of the
                    editions correspond exactly, being merely reprints, there are important
                    differences among others. What light these variatione may throw upon the origin
                    of the text has never been investigated. A critical edition of the works with
                    the various readings would be necessary before deciding that what is found in
                    them is really Geber’s, and dates back eleven centuries. It may be that some of
                    the knowledge of chemistry credited to Geber was really interpolated at a later
                    date. It is quite possible that the account given of the various acids, salts,
                    and metals, and of the apparatus and operations, may have been modified or
                    extended. But, on the other hand, the general theory that runs through the whole
                    of the writings is in all probability original. The theory is that the metals
                    are composed of the same elements, and that by proper treatment the less perfect
                    can be gradually developed into the more perfect metals. This theory is very
                    clearly, and one may even say logically, worked out, and it was the leading idea
                    in chemistry down to the 16th century at least. In carrying out this theory
                    practically, certain materials were employed and were subjected to operations,
                    and the knowledge acquired about them took shape by degrees. Though subsequent
                    workers added to what was known, Geber’s reputed works are so clear, so precise,
                    so complete, that they differ in a most striking manner from the works of even
                    the best writers in the later alchemical period, and make it difficult to
                    account for their existence at all. Older writings there are none; subsequent
                    writings as clear as Geber’s do not appear until far more was known; the
                    unsolved problem therefore remains, Who was Geber, and how does it happen that
                    his works stand quite alone in chemical literature?</p>
