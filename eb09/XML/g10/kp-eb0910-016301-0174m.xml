                    to divide) is the science of surveying extended to large tracts of country,
                    having in view not only the production of a system of maps of very great
                    accuracy, but the determination of the curvature of the surface of the earth,
                    and eventually of the figure and dimensions of the earth. This last, indeed, may
                    be the sole object in view, as was the case in the operations conducted in Peru
                    and in Lapland by the celebrated French astronomers Bouguer, La Condamine,
                    Maupertuis, Clairaut, and others; and the measurement of the meridian arc of
                    France by Mechain and Delambre had for its end the determination of the true
                    length of the “metre” which was to be the legal standard of length of
                    France.</p>
                <p>The basis of every extensive survey is an accurate triangulation, and the
                    operations of geodesy consist in—the measurement, by theodolites, of the angles
                    of the triangles; the measurement of one or more sides of these triangles on the
                    ground; the determination by astronomical observations of the azimuth of the
                    whole network of triangles; the determination of the actual position of the same
                    on the surface of the earth by observations, first for latitude at some of the
                    stations, and secondly for longitude.</p>
                <p>To determine by actual measurement on the ground the length of a side of one of
                    the triangles, wherefrom to infer the lengths of all the other sides in the
                    triangulation, is not the least difficult operation of a trigonometrical survey.
                    When the problem is stated thus—To determine the number of times that a certain
                    standard or unit of length is contained between two finely marked points on the
                    surface of the earth at a distance of some miles asunder, so that the error of
                    the result may be pronounced to lie between certain very narrow limits,—then the
                    question demands very serious consideration. The representation of the unit of
                    length by means of the distance between two fine lines on the surface of a bar
                    of metal at a certain temperature is never itself free from uncertainty and
                    probable error, owing to the difficulty of knowing at any moment the precise
                    temperature of the bar; and the transference of this unit, or a multiple of it,
                    to a measuring bar, will be affected not only with errors of observation, but
                    with errors arising from uncertainty of temperature of both bars. If the
                    measuring bar be not self-compensating for temperature, its expansion must be
                    determined by very careful experiments. The thermometers required for this
                    purpose must be very carefully studied, and their errors of division and index
                    error determined.</p>
                <p>The base apparatus of Bessel and that of Colby have been described in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Figure of the Earth</hi> (vol. vii. p. 598). The average
                    probable error of a single measurement of a base line by the Colby apparatus is,
                    according to the very elaborate investigations of Colonel Walker, C.B., R.E.,
                    the Surveyor-General of India, ± l ’ 5∕x,(μ, meaning “one millionth”). W. Struve
                    gives ± 0'8μ, as the probable error of a base line measured with his apparatus,
                    being the mean of the probable errors of seven bases measured by him in Russia;
                    but this estimate is probably too small. Struve’s apparatus is simple: there are
                    four wrought iron bars, each two toises (rather more than 13 feet) long; one end
                    of each bar is terminated in a small steel cylinder presenting a slightly convex
                    surface for contact, the other end carries a contact lever rigidly connected
                    with the bar. The shorter arm of the lever terminates below in a polished
                    hemisphere, the upper and longer arm traversing a vertical divided arc. In
                    measuring, the plane end of one bar is brought into contact with the short arm
                    of the contact lever (pushed forward by a weak spring) of the next bar. Each bar
                    has two thermometers, and a level for determining the inclination of the bar in
                    measuring. The manner of transferring the end of a bar to the ground is simply
                    this: under the end of the bar a stake is driven very firmly into the ground,
                    carrying on its upper surface a disk, capable of movement in the direction of
                    the measured line by mean3 of slow-motion screws. A fine mark on this disk is
                    brought vertically under the end of the bar by means of a theodolite which is
                    planted at a distance of 25 feet from the stake in a direction perpendicular to
                    the base. Struve investigates for each base the probable errors of the
                    ,measurement arising from each of these seven causes:— alignment, inclination,
                    comparisons with standards, readings of index, personal errors, uncertainties of
                    temperature, and the probable errors of adopted rates of expansion.</p>
                <p>The apparatus used in the United States Coast Survey consists of two measuring
                    bars, each 6 metres in length, supported on two massive tripod stands placed at
                    one quarter length from each end, and provided, as in Colby’s apparatus, with
                    the necessary mechanism for longitudinal, transverse, and vertical adjustment.
                    Each measuring rod is a compensating combination of an iron and a brass bar,
                    supported parallel to one another and firmly connected at one end, the medium of
                    connexion between the free ends being a lever of corhpensation so adjusted as to
                    indicate a constant length independent of temperature or changes of temperature.
                    The bars are protected from external influences by double tubes of tinned sheet
                    iron, within which they are movable on rollers by a screw movement which allows
                    of contacts being made within <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> ¾ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 00</hi> of an inch. The abutting piece acts upon the contact
                    lever which is attached to the fixed end of the compound bar, and carries a very
                    sensitive level, the horizontal position of which defines the length of the bar.
                    It is impossible here to give a full description of this complicated apparatus,
                    and we must refer for details to the account given in full in the United States
                    Coast Survey Report for 1854. This apparatus is doubtless a very perfect one,
                    and the manipulation of it must offer great facilities, for it appears to be
                    possible, under favourable circumstances, to measure a mile in one day, 1Ό6 mile
                    having been measured on one occasion in eight and a half hours. In order to test
                    to the utmost the apparatus, the base at Atalanta, Georgia, was measured twice
                    in winter and once in summer 1872-73, at temperatures 51°, 45°, 90° F.; the
                    difference of the first and second measurements was +0 ’ 30 in., of the second
                    and third + 0 ’ 34 in.,—the actual length and computed probableerror expressed
                    in metres being 9338 ’ 4763 ± 0Ό166. It is to be noted that in the account of a
                    base recently measured in the United States Lake Survey, some doubt is expressed
                    as to the perfection of the particular apparatus of this description there used,
                    on account of a liability to permanent changes of length.</p>
                <p>The last base line measured in India with Colby’s compensation apparatus had a
                    length of 8912 feet only, and in consequence of some doubts which had arisen as
                    to the accuracy of this compensation apparatus, the measurement was repeated
                    four times, the operations being conducted in such a manner as to indicate as
                    far as possible the actual magnitudes of the probable errors to which such
                    measures are liable. The direction of the line (which is at Cape Comorin) is
                    north and south, and in two of the measurements the brass component was to the
                    west, in the other two it was to the east. The differences between the
                    individual measurements and the mean of the four are + Ό017, - <hi

                    rate of such work in India being about a mile in five days.</p>
                <p>The method of Μ. Porro, adopted in Spain, and by the French in Algiers, is
                    essentially different from those just described. The measuring rod, for there is
                    only one, is a thermometric combination of two bars, one of platinum and one of
                    brass, in length 4 metres, furnished with three levels and four thermometers.
                    Suppose A, B, C three micrometer microscopes very firmly supported at intervals
                    of 4 metres with their axes vertical, and aligned in the plane of the base line
                    by means of a transit instrument, their micrometer screws being in the line of
                    measurement. The measuring bar is brought under say A and B, and those
                    micrometers read; the bar is then shifted aud brought under B and C. By
                    repetition of this process, the reading of a micrometer indicating the end of
                    each position of the bar, the measurement is made. The probable error of the
                    central base of Madridejos, which has a length of 14664 ’ 500 metres, is
                    estimated at ÷ 0 ’ 17^. This is the longest base line in Spain; there are seven
                    others, six of which are under 2500 metres in length; of these one is in
                    Majorca, another in Minorca, aud a third in Iviça. The last base just measured
                    in the province of Barcelona has a length of 2483 ’ 5381 metres according to the
                    first measurement, and 2483 ’ 5383 according to the second.</p>
                <p>The total number of base lines measured in Europe up to the present time is about
                    eighty, fifteen of which do not exceed in length 2500 metres, or about a mile
                    aud a half, and two—one in France, the other in Bavaria—exceed 19,000 metres.
                    The question has been frequently discussed whether or not the advantage of a
                    long base is sufficiently great to warrant the expenditure of time that it
                    requires, or whether as much precision is not obtainable in the end by careful
                    triangulation from a short base. But the answer cannot be given generally; it
                    must depend on the circumstances of each particular case.</p>
                <p>Itis necessary that the altitude above the level of the sea of every part of a
                    base line be ascertained by spirit levelling, in order that the measured length
                    maybe reduced to what it would have been had the measurement been made on the
                    surface of the sea, produced in imagination. Thus if <hi rend="italic">l</hi> be
                    the length of a measuring bar, <hi rend="italic">h</hi> its height at any given
                    position in the measurement, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the radius of the earth,
                    then the length radially projected on to the level of the sea is <hi
                    rend="italic">l - l.</hi> In the Salisbury Plain base line the reduction to the
                    level of the sea is - 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6294 feet.</p>
                <p>In working away from a base line <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> stations c, <hi
                    rend="italic">d, e, f</hi> are carefully selected so as to obtain from
                    well-shaped triangles gradually increasing sides. Before, however, finally
                    leaving the base line it is usual to verify it by triangulation thus: during the
                    measurement two or more points, as <hi rend="italic">p, q</hi> (fig. 1), are
                    marked in the base in positions such that the lengths of the different segments
                    of the line are known; then, taking suitable external stations, as <hi
                    rend="italic">h, k,</hi> the angles of the triangles <hi rend="italic">blip,
                    plιq, hqk, kqa</hi> are measured. From these angles can be computed the ratios
                    of the segments, which must agree, if all operations are correctly performed,
                    with the ratios resulting from the measures. Leaving the base line, the sides
                    increase up to ten, thirty, or fifty miles, occasionally, but seldom, reaching a
                    hundred miles. The triangulation points may either be natural objects presenting
                    themselves in suitable positions, such as church towers; or they may be objects
                    specially constructed in stone or wood on mountain tops or other prominent
                    ground. In every case it is necessary that the precise centre of the station be
                    marked by some permanent mark. In India no expense is spared in making permanent
                    the principal trigonometrical stations—costly towers in masonry being erected.
                    It is essential that every trigonometrical station shall present a fine object
                    for observation from surrounding stations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Horizontal Angles.</hi></p>
                <p>In placing the theodolite over a station to be observed from, the first point to
                    be attended to is that it shall rest upon a perfectly solid foundation. The
                    method of obtaining this desideratum must depend entirely on the nature of the
                    ground; the instrument must if possible be supported on rock, or if that be
                    impossible a solid foundation must be obtained by digging. When the theodolite
                    is required to be raised above the surface of the ground in order to command
                    particular points, it is necessary to build two scaffolds,—the outer one to
                    carry the observatory, the inner one to carry the instrument,—and these two
                    edifices must have no point of contact. Many cases of high scaffolding have
                    occurred on the English Ordnance Survey, as for instance at Thaxted Church,
                    where the tower, 80 feet high, is surmounted by a spire of 90 feet. The scaffold
                    for the observatory was carried from the base to the top of the spire; that for
                    the instrument was raised from a point of the spire 140 feet above the ground,
                    having its bearing upon timbers passing through the spire at that height. Thus
                    the instrument, at a height of 178 feet above the ground, was insulated, and not
                    affected by the action of the wind on the observatory.</p>
                <p>At every station it is necessary to examine and correct the adjustments of the
                    theodolite, which are these :—the line of collimation of the telescope must be
                    perpendicular to its axis of rotation; this axis perpendicular to the vertical
                    axis of the instrument; and the latter perpendicular to the plane of the
                    horizon. The micrometer microscopes must also measure correct quantities on the
                    divided circle or circles. The method of observing is this. Let A, B, C.... be
                    the stations to be observed taken in order of azimuth; the telescope is first
                    directed to A and the cross-hairs of the telescope made to bisect the object
                    presented by A, then the microscopes or verniers of the horizontal circle (also
                    of the vertical circle if necessary) are read and recorded. The telescope is
                    then turned to B, which is observed in the same manner; then C and the other
                    stations. Coming round by continuous motion to A, it is again observed, and the
                    agreement of this second reading with the first is some test of the stability of
                    the instrument. In taking this round of angles—or “arc,” as it is called on the
                    Ordnance Survey— it is desirable that the interval of time between the first and
                    second observations of A should be as small as maybe consistent with due care.
                    Before taking the next arc the horizontal circle is moved through 20° or 30°;
                    thus a different set of divisions of the circle is used in each arc, which'
                    tends to eliminate the errors of division.</p>
                <p>It is very desirable that all arcs at a station should contain one point in
                    common, to which all angular measurements are thus referred,—the observations on
                    each arc commencing and ending with this point, which is on the Ordnance Survey
                    called the “referring object.” It is usual for this purpose to select, from
                    among the points which have to be observed, that one which affords the best
                    object for precise observation. For mountain tops a “referring object” is
                    constructed of two rectangular plates of metal in the same vertical plane, their
                    edges parallel and placed at such a distance apart that the light of the sky
                    seen through <pb break="no"

                    The best distance for this object is from one to two miles.</p>
                <p>It is clear that no correction is required to the angles measured by a theodolite
                    on account of its height above the sea-level; for its axis of rotation coincides
                    with the normal to the surface of the earth, and the angles measured between
                    distant points are those contained between the vertical planes passing through
                    the axis of the instrument and those points.</p>
                <p>The theodolites used in geodesy vary in pattern and in size—the horizontal
                    circles ranging from 10 inches to 36 inches in diameter. In Ramsden’s 36-inch
                    theodolite the telescope has a focal length of 36 inches and an aperture of 2 ’
                    5 inches, the ordinarily used magnifying power being 54; this last, however, can
                    of course be changed at the requirements of the observer or of the weather. The
                    probable error of a single observation of a fine object with this theodolite is
                    about 0" ’ 2.</p>
                <p>Fig. 2 represents an altazimuth theodolite of an improved pattern now used on the
                    Ordnance Survey. The horizontal circle of 14 inches diameter is read by three
                    micrometer microscopes; the vertical circle has a diameter of 12 inches, and is
                    read by two microscopes.</p>
                <p>In the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India the theodolites used in the more
                    important parts of the work have been of 2 and 3 feet· diameter,—the circle read
                    by five equidistant microscopes. Every angle is measured twice in each position
                    of the zero of the horizontal circle, of which there are generally ten; the
                    entire number of measures of an angle is never less than 20. An examination of
                    1407 angles showed that the probable error of an observed angle is on the
                    average ÷ 0 ’ 28.</p>
                <p>For the observations of very distant stations it is usual to employ a heliostat
                    In its simplest form this is a plane mirror 4, 6, or 8 inches in diameter,
                    capable of rotation round a horizontal and a vertical axis. This mirror is
                    placed at the station to be observed, and in fine weather it is kept so directed
                    that the rays of the sun reflected by it strike the distant observing telescope.
                    To the observer the heliostat presents the appearance of a star of the first or
                    second magnitude, and is generally a pleasant object for observing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Astronomical Observations.</hi></p>
                <p>The direction of the meridian is determined either by a theodolite or a portable
                    transit instrument. In the former case the operation consists in observing the
                    angle between a terrestrial object—generally a mark specially erected and
                    capable of illumination at night—and a close circumpolar star at its greatest
                    eastern or western azimuth, or, at any rate, when very near that position. If
                    the observation be made <hi rend="italic">t</hi> minutes of time before or after
                    the time of greatest azimuth, the azimuth then will differ from its maximum
                    value by</p>

                <p>sin <hi rend="italic">z</hi> in secouds of angle, omitting smaller terms. Here
                    the symbol δ is the star’s declination, ε its zenith distance. The collimation
                    and level errors are very carefully determined before and after these
                    observations, and it is usual to arrange the observations by the reversal of the
                    telescope so that collimation error shall disappear. If <hi rend="italic">b,
                    c</hi> be the level and collimation errors, the correction to the circle reading
                    is <hi rend="italic">b</hi> cot <hi rend="italic">z ÷ c</hi> cosec <hi
                    rend="italic">z, b</hi> being positive when the west end of the axis is high. It
                    is clear that any uncertainty as to the real state of the level will produce a
                    corresponding uncertainty iu the resulting value of the azimuth,—an uncertainty
                    which increases with the latitude, and is very large in high latitudes. This may
                    be partly remedied by observing in connexion with the star its reflexion in
                    mercury. In determining the value of “one division "of a level tube, it is
                    necessary to bear in mind that in some the value varies considerably with the
                    temperature. By experiments on the level of Ramsden’s 3~foot theodolite, it was
                    found that though at the ordinary temperature of 66° the value of a division was
                    about one second, yet at 32° it was about five seconds.</p>
                <p>The portable transit in its ordinary form hardly needs description. In a very
                    excellent instrument of this kind used on the Ordnance Survey, the uprights
                    carrying the telescope are constructed of mahogany, each upright being built of
                    several pieces glued and screwed together; the base, which is a solid and heavy
                    plate of iron, carries a reversing apparatus for lifting the telescope out of
                    its bearings, reversing it, and letting it down again. Thus is avoided the
                    change of temperature which the telescope would incur by being lifted by the
                    hands of the observer. Another form of transit Î3 the German diagonal form, in
                    which the rays of light after passing through the object glass are turned by a
                    total reflexion prism through one of the transverse arms of the telescope, at
                    the extremity of which arm is the eye-piece. The unused half of the ordinary
                    telescope being cut away is replaced by a counterpoise. In this instrument there
                    is the advantage that the observer without moving the position of his eye
                    commands the whole meridian, and that the level may remain on the pivots
                    whatever be the elevation of the telescope. But there is the disadvantage that
                    the flexure of the transverse axis causes a variable collimation error depending
                    on the zenith distance of the star to which it is directed; and moreover it has
                    been found that in some cases the personal error of an observer is not the same
                    in the two positions of the telescope.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n177/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0177-0166"/>
                <p>To determine the direction of the meridian, it is well to erect two marks at
                    nearly equal angular distances on either side of the north meridian line, so
                    that the pole star crosses the vertical of each mark a short time before and
                    after attaining its greatest eastern and western azimuths.</p>
                <p>If now the instrument, perfectly levelled, is adjusted to have its centre wire on
                    one of the marks, then when elevated to the star, the star will traverse the
                    wire, and its exact position in the field at any moment can be measured by the
                    micrometer wire. Alternate observations of the star and the terrestrial mark,
                    combined with careful level readings and reversals of the instrument, will
                    enable one, even with only one mark, to determine the direction of the meridian
                    in the course of an hour with a probable error of less than a second. The second
                    mark enables one to complete the station more rapidly, and gives a check upon
                    the work. As an instance, at Findlay Seat, in latitude 57° 35', the resulting
                    azimuths of the two marks were 177° 45' 37"∙29 ÷ 0' ’ ∙20 and 182° 17' 15"∙61 ÷
                    0"∙13, while the angle between the two marks directly measured by a theodolite
                    was found to be 4° 3Γ 37"∙43 ÷ 0" ’ 23.</p>
                <p>We now come to the consideration of the determination of time with the transit
                    instrument. Let fig. 3 represent the sphere stereographi-cally projected on the
                    plane of the horizon,— <hi rend="italic">ns</hi> being the meridian, <hi
                    rend="italic">we</hi> the prime vertical, Z, P the zenith and the pole. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> be the point in which the production of the axis of the
                    instrument meets the celestial sphere, S the position of a star when observed on
                    a wire whose distance from the collimation centre is <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>
                    Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the azimuthal deviation, namely, the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">uι7ιp, b</hi> the level error so that Zp = 90° - <hi rend="italic"
                    >b.</hi> Let also the hour angle corresponding to <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> be
                    90° - <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and the declination of the same <hi
                    rend="italic">= m,</hi> the star’s declination being δ, and the latitude
                    &lt;∕&gt;. Then to find the hour angle ZPS = τ of the star when observed, in the
                    triangles ∕&gt;PS, jt&gt;PZ we have, since· pPS = 90 + τ - <hi rend="italic"

                <p>-Sin c=sin <hi rend="italic">m</hi> sin δ + cos7∕ι cos δ sin (π-τ), Sin <hi

                    >φ</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></p>
                <p>And these equations solve the problem, however large be the errors of the
                    instrument. Supposing, as usual, <hi rend="italic">a, b, rn, n</hi> to be small,
                    we have at once τ = <hi rend="italic">n + c</hi> sec δ + <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> tan δ, which is the correction to the observed time of transit. Or,
                    eliminating <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> by means of
                    the second and third equations, and putting <hi rend="italic">z</hi> for the
                    zenith distance of the star, <hi rend="italic">t</hi> for the observed time of
                    transit, the corrected time is</p>
                <p>α sin z + &amp; cos <hi rend="italic"> z+c</hi> cos δ</p>
                <p>Another very convenient form for stars near the zenith is this—</p>
                <p>τ = δ sec <hi rend="italic">φ + c</hi> sec <hi rend="italic">δ+n</hi> (tan δ-tan
                    φ).</p>
                <p>Suppose that in commencing to observe at a station the error of the chronometer
                    is not known; then having secured for the instrument a very solid foundation,
                    removed as far as possible level and collimation errors, and placed it by
                    estimation nearly in the meridiaD, let two star3 differing considerably in
                    declination be observed—the instrument not being reversed between them. From
                    these two star3, neither of which should be a close circumpolar star, a good
                    approximation to the chronometer error can be obtained; thus let ∈ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, ε <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> be the apparent clock
                    errors given by these stars, if δ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, δ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> be their declinations the real error is tan <hi

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>-tanδ∕</p>
                <p>Of course this is still only approximative, but it will enable the observer (who
                    by the help of a table of natural tangents can compute ε in a few minutes) to
                    find the meridian by placing at the proper time, which he now knows
                    approximately, the centre wire of his instrument on the first star that
                    passes—not near the zenith.</p>
                <p>The transit instrument is always reversed at least once in the course of an
                    evening’s observing, the level being frequently read and recorded. It is
                    necessary in most instruments to add a correction for the difference in size of
                    the pivots.</p>
                <p>The transit instrument is also used in the prime vertical for the determination
                    of latitudes. In the preceding figure let <hi rend="italic">q</hi> be the point
                    in which the northern extremity of the axis of the instrument produced meets the
                    celestial sphere. Let <hi rend="italic">nZq</hi> be the azimuthal deviation <hi
                    rend="italic">= a,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> being the level error, <hi
                    rend="italic">Zq =</hi> 90° <hi rend="italic">- b;</hi> let also 7⅛P⅛ = τ and P#
                    = <hi rend="italic">ψ.</hi> Let S' be the position of a star when observed on a
                    wire whose distance from the collimation centre is c, positive when to the
                    south, and let <hi rend="italic">h</hi> be the observed hour angle of the star,
                    viz., ZPS'. Then the triangles gPS', ⅛PZ give</p>
                <p>— Sin <hi rend="italic">c</hi> = sin δ cos ψ - cos δ sin <hi rend="italic">ψ cos

                <p>Now when <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are very small, we

                    rend="italic">a</hi> is not very small and <hi rend="italic">z is</hi> small,
                    the formulae required are more complicated.</p>
                <p>The method of determining latitude by transits in the prime vertical has the
                    disadvantage of being a somewhat slow process, and of requiring a very precise
                    knowledge of the time, a disadvantage from which the zenith telescope is free.
                    In principle this instrument is based on the proposition that when the meridian
                    zenith distances of two stars at their upper culminations—one being to the north
                    and the other to the south of the zenith—are equal, the latitude is the mean of
                    their declinations; or, if the zenith distance of a star culminating to the
                    south of the zenith be Z, its declination being δ, and that of another
                    culminating to the north with zenith distance Z' and declination δ', then
                    clearly the latitude is ^(δ + δ') + ^(Z-Z'). Now the zenith telescope does away
                    with the divided circle, and substitutes the measurement micrometrically of the
                    quantity Z'-Z.</p>
                <p>The instrument (fig. 4) is supported on a strong tripod, fitted with levelling
                    screws; to this tripod is fixed the azimuth circle and a long vertical steel
                    axis. Fitting on this axis is a hollow axis which carries on its upper end a
                    short transverse horizontal axis. This latter carries the telescope, which,
                    supported at the centre of its length, is free to rotate in a vertical plane.
                    The telescope is thus mounted excentrically with respect to the vertical axis
                    around which it revolves. An extremely sensitive level is attached to the
                    telescope, which latter carries a micrometer in its eyepiece, with a screw of
                    long range for measuring differences of zenith distance. For this instrument
                    stars are selected in pairs, passing north and south of the zenith, culminating
                    within a few minutes of time and within about twenty minutes (angular) of zenith
                    distance of each other. When a pair of stars is to be observed, the telescope is
                    set to the mean of the zenith distances* and in the plane of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n178/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0178-0167"/> meridian. The first star on passing the central
                    meridional wire is bisected by the micrometer; then the telescope is rotated
                    very carefully through 180° round the vertical axis, and the second star on
                    passing through the field is bisected by the micrometer on the centre wire. The
                    micrometer has thus measured the difference of the zenith distances, and the
                    calculation to get the latitude is most simple. Of course it is necessary to
                    read the level, and the observations are not necessarily confined to the centre
                    wire. In fact if n, s be the north and south readings of the level for the south
                    star, <hi rend="italic">n', s'</hi> the same for the north star, <hi

                <p>It is of course of the highest importance that the value <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    of the screw be well determined. This is done most effectually by observing the
                    vertical movement of a close circumpolar star when at its greatest azimuth.</p>
                <p>In a single night with this instrument a very accurate result, say with a
                    probable error of about 0" <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3 or 0" <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 4, could be obtained for latitude from, say, twenty
                    pair of stars; but when the latitude is required to be obtained with the highest
                    possible precision, four or five fine nights are necessary. The weak point of
                    the zenith telescope lies in the circumstance that its requirements prevent the
                    selection of stars whose positions are well fixed; very frequently it is
                    necessary to have the declinations of the stars selected for this instrument
                    specially observed at fixed observatories. The zenith telescope is made in
                    various sizes from 30 to 54 inches in focal length; a 30-inch telescope is
                    sufficient for the highest purposes, and is very portable. The zenith telescope
                    is a particularly pleasant instrument to work with, and an observer has been
                    known (a sergeant of Royal Engineers, on one occasion) to take every star in his
                    list during eleven hours on a stretch, namely, from 6 o’clock p.M. until 5 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. μ.,</hi> and this on a very cold November night on one of
                    the highest points of the Grampians. Observers accustomed to geodetic operations
                    attain considerable powers of endurance. Shortly after the commencement of the
                    observations on one of the hills in the Isle of Skye a storm carried away the
                    wooden houses of the men and left the observatory roofless. Three observatory
                    roofs were subsequently demolished, and for some time the observatory was used
                    without a roof, being filled with snow every night and emptied every morning.
                    Quite different, however, was the experience of the same party when on the top
                    of Ben Nevis, 4406 feet high. For about a fortnight the state of the atmosphere
                    was unusually calm, so much so, that a lighted candle could often be carried
                    between the tents of the men and the observatory, whilst at the foot of the hill
                    the weather was wild and stormy <hi rend="italic">Calculation of
                    Triangulation.</hi></p>
                <p>The surface of Great Britain and Ireland is uniformly covered by triangulation,
                    of which the sides are of various lengths from 10 to 111 miles. The largest
                    triangle has one angle at Snowdon in Wales, another on Slieve Donard in Ireland,
                    and a third at Scaw Fell in Cumberland; each side is over a hundred miles, and
                    the spherical excess is 64".</p>
                <p>The more ordinary method of triangulation is, however, that of chains of
                    triangles, in the direction of the meridian and perpendicular thereto. The
                    principal triangulations of France, Spain, Austria, and India are so arranged.
                    Oblique chains of triangles are formed in Italy, Sweden, and Norway, also in
                    Germany and Russia, and in the United States. Chains are composed sometimes
                    merely of consecutive plain triangles; sometimes, and more frequently in India,
                    of combinations of triangles forming consecutive polygonal figures. In this
                    method of triangulating, the sides of the triangles are generally from 20 to 30
                    miles in length—seldom exceeding 40.</p>
                <p>The inevitable errors of observation, which are inseparable from all angular as
                    well as other measurements, introduce a great difficulty into the calculation of
                    the sides of a triangulation. Starting from a given base in order to get a
                    required distance, it may generally be obtained in several different ways—that
                    is, by using different sets of triangles. The results will certainly differ one
                    from another, and probably no two will agree. The experience of the computer
                    will then come to his aid, and enable him to say which is the most trustworthy
                    result; but no experience or ability will carry him through a large network of
                    triangles with anything like assurance. The only way to obtain trustworthy
                    results is to employ the method of least squares, an explanation of which will
                    be found in <hi rend="smallcaps">Figure of the Earth</hi> (vol. vii. p. 605). We
                    cannot here give any illustration of this method as applied to general
                    triangulation, for it is most laborious, even for the simplest cases. We may,
                    however, take the case of a simple chain—commencing with the consideration of a
                    single triangle in which all three angles have been observed.</p>
                <p>Suppose that the sum of the observed angles exceeds the proper amount by a small
                    quantity e: it is required to assign proper corrections to the angles, so as to

                    rend="italic">weight</hi> of the determinations of each angle. When a series of
                    direct and independent observations is made, under similar circumstances, of any
                    measurable magnitude —as an angle—the weight of the result is equal to half the
                    square of the number of observations divided by the sum of the squares of the
                    differences of the individual measures from the mean of all. Now let A, <hi
                    rend="italic">k, l</hi> be the weights of the three measured angles, and let <hi
                    rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> be the corrections which should be applied to them.
                    We know that x + y + c + e = 0; and the theory of probabilities teaches us that
                    the most probable values are those which make <hi rend="italic">hx</hi><hi

                    which shall be proportional to the reciprocals of the weights of the
                    corresponding angles. In what follows we shall, for simplicity, suppose the
                    weights of the observed angles to be all equal.</p>
                <p>Suppose now that A, B, C are the three angles of a triangle, and that the

                    by adding up the observed angles and finding that the sum is in excess of the

                <p>Now these actual errors must remain unknown; but we here make use of the

                    of a quantity which is a function of several independently observed elements is
                    equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the probable errors that
                    would arise from each of the observed elements taken singly. Now suppose that

                <p>A spheroidal triangle differs from a spherical triangle, not only in that the
                    curvatures of the sides are different one from another, but more especially in
                    this that, while in the spherical triangle the normals to the surface at the
                    angular points meet at the centre of the sphere, in the spheroidal triangle the
                    normals at the angles A, B, C meet the axis of revolution of the spheroid in
                    three different points, which we may designate α, <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> y
                    respectively. Now the angle A of the triangle as measured by a theodolite is the
                    inclination of the planes BAα and CAα, and the angle at B is that contained by
                    the planes AB/3 and CB∕3. But the planes ABα and AB/3 containing the line AB in
                    common cut the surface in two distinct plane curves. In order, therefore, that a
                    spheroidal triangle may be exactly defined, it is necessary that the nature of
                    the lines joining the three vertices be stated. In a mathematical point of view
                    the most natural definition is that the sides be geodesic or shortest lines.
                    Gauss, in his most elegant treatise entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Disquisitiones</hi><hi rend="italic">generales circa superficies</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">curvas,</hi> has entered fully into the subject of geodesic
                    triangles, and has investigated expressions for the angles of a geodesic
                    triangle whose sides are given, not certainly finite expressions, but
                    approximations inclusive of small quantities of the fourth order, the side of
                    the triangle or its ratio to the radius of the nearly spherical surface being a
                    small quantity of the first order. The terms of the fourth order, as given by
                    Gauss for any surface in general, are very complicated even when the surface is
                    a spheroid. If we retain small quantities of the second order only, and put 3β,
                    (Γ for the angles of the geodesic triangle, while A, B, C are those of a plane
                    triangle having sides equal respectively to those of the geodesic triangle,

                <p>The geodesic line being the shortest that can be drawn on any surface between two
                    given points, we may be conducted to its most important characteristics by the
                    following considerations: let <hi rend="italic">p, q</hi> be adjacent points on
                    a curved surface; through s the middle point of the chord py imagine a plane
                    drawn perpendicular to 2&gt;&lt;7, and let S be any point in the intersection of
                    this plane with the surface; then pS + S? is evidently least when sS is a
                    minimum, which is when sS is a normal to the surface; hence it follows that of
                    all plane curves on the surface joining p, <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> when those
                    points are indefinitely near to one another, that is the shortest which is made
                    by the normal plane. That is to say, the osculating plane at any point of a
                    geodesic line contains the normalto the surface at that point. Imagine nowthree
                    points in space, A, B, C, such that AB = BC = cj let the direction cosines of AB
                    be <hi rend="italic">l,m,n,</hi> those of BC <hi rend="italic">l',m',n',</hi>
                    then <hi rend="italic">x,y,z</hi> being the coordinates of B, those of A and C
                    will be respectively— <hi rend="italic">x-cl:</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi

                    C,ds.</hi> This again may be put in the. form <hi rend="italic">r</hi> sin α =
                    C, where a is the azimuth of the geodesic at any point—the angle between its
                    direction and that of the meridian—and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the distance of
                    the point from the axis of revolution.</p>
                <p>From this it may be shown that the azimuth at A of the geodesic joining AB is not
                    the same as the astronomical azimuth at A of B or that determined by the
                    vertical plane AaB. Generally speaking, the geodesic lies between the two plane
                    section curves joining A and B which are formed by the two vertical planes,
                    supposing these points not far apart. If, however, A and B are nearly in the
                    same latitude, the geodesic may cross (between A and B) that plane curve which
                    lies nearest the adjacent pole of the spheroid. The condition of crossing is
                    this. Suppose that for a moment we drop the consideration of the earth’s
                    non-sphericity, and draw a perpendicular from the pole C on AB, meeting it in S
                    between A and B. Then A being that point which is nearest the pole, the geodesic
                    will cross the plane curve if AS be between ∣AB and f AB. If AS lie between this
                    last value and ⅜AB, the geodesic will lie wholly to the north of both plane
                    curves, that is, supposing both points to be in the northern hemisphere.</p>
                <p>The circumstance that the angles of the geodesic triangle do not coincide with
                    the true angles as observed renders it inconvenient to regard the geodesic lines
                    as sides of the triangle. A more convenient curve to regard as the side of the
                    spheroidal triangle is this: let L be a point on the curve surface between A and
                    B, λ the point in which the normal at L intersects the axis of revolution, then
                    if L be subject to the condition that the planes ALλ, BLλ coincide, it traces
                    out a curve which touches at A and B the two plane curves before specified.
                    Joining A, B, C by three such lines, the angles of the triangle so formed
                    coincide with the true angles.</p>
                <p>Let the azimuths (at the middle point, say) of the sides BC, CA, AB of a

                    from 0° to 360° continuously, and the angles of the triangle lettered in the

                    having sides equal respectively to <hi rend="italic">a, b, c.</hi> If A', B', C'
                    be the angles of the spheroidal triangle, A, B, C those of the spherical

                <p>By adding these together, it appears that, to the order of terms here retained,
                    the sum of the angles of the spheroidal triangle is equal to the sum of the
                    angles of the spherical triangle. The spherical excess of a spheroidal triangle
                    is therefore obtained by multiplying its area by —,, Gauss’s measure of
                    curvature.</p>

                <p>It is but seldom that the terms of the fourth order are required. Omitting them,
                    we have Legendre’s theorem, viz., “If from each of the angles of a spherical
                    triangle, the sides of which are small in comparison with the radius, one-third
                    of the spherical excess be deducted, the sines of the angles thus diminished
                    will be proportional to the length of the opposite sides, so that the triangle
                    may be computed as a plane triangle.” By this means the spherical triangles
                    which present themselves in geodesy are computed with very nearly the same ease
                    as plane triangles. And from the expressions given above for the spheroidal
                    angles A', B', C' it may be proved that no error of any consequence can arise
                    from treating a spheroidal triangle as a spherical, the radius of the sphere
                    being as stated above.</p>
                <p>When the angles of a triangulation have been adjusted by the method of least
                    squares, the next process is to calculate the latitudes and longitudes of all
                    the stations starting from one given point. The calculated latitudes,
                    longitudes, and azimuths, which are designated geodetic latitudes, longitudes,
                    and azimuths, are not to be confounded with the observed latitudes, longitudes,
                    and azimuths, for these last are subject to somewhat large errors. Supposing the
                    latitudes of a number of stations in the triangulation to be observed,
                    practically the mean of these determines the position in latitude of the
                    network, taken as a whole. So the orientation or general azimuth of the whole is
                    inferred from all the azimuth observations. The triangulation is then supposed
                    to be projected on a spheroid of given elements, representing as nearly as one
                    knows the real figure of the earth. Then, taking the latitude of one point and
                    the direction of the meridian there as given—obtained, namely, from the
                    astronomical observations there—one can compute the latitudes of all the other
                    points with any degree of precision that may be considered desirable. It is
                    necessary to employ for this purpose formulae which will give results true even
                    for the longest distances to the second place of decimals of seconds, otherwise
                    there will arise an accumulation of errors from imperfect calculation which
                    should always be avoided. For very long distances, eight places of decimals
                    should be employed in logarithmic calculations; if seven places only are
                    available very great care will be required to keep the last place true. Now let
                    <hi rend="italic">φ, φ'</hi> be the latitudes of two stations A and B <hi
                    rend="italic">; a, a</hi> their mutual azimuths counted from north by east
                    continuously from 0° to 360°; ω their difference of longitude measured from west
                    to east; and s the distance AB.</p>
                <p>First compute a latitude <hi rend="italic">φ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">

                <p>It is frequently necessary to obtain the coordinates of one point with reference

                <p><hi rend="italic">Irregularities of the Earth's Surface.</hi></p>
                <p>In considering the effect of unequal distribution of matter in the earth’s crust
                    on the form of the surface, we may simplify the matter by disregarding the
                    considerations of rotation and excentricity. In the first place, supposing the
                    earth a sphere covered with a film of water, let the density <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> be a function of the distance from the centre so that surfaces of equal
                    density are concentric spheres. Let now a disturbance of the arrangement of
                    matter take place, so that the density is no longer to be expressed by <hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> a function of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> only, but is
                    expressed by <hi rend="italic">p</hi> + p', where p' is a function of three
                    coordinates <hi rend="italic">θ, φ, r.</hi> Then p' is the density of what may
                    be designated disturbing matter; it is positive in some places and negative in
                    others, and the whole quantity of matter whose density is p' is zero. The
                    previously spherical surface of the sea of radius <hi rend="italic">a</hi> now
                    takes a new form. Let P be a point on the disturbed surface, P' the
                    corresponding point vertically below it on the undisturbed surface, PP' = <hi
                    rend="italic">u.</hi> The knowledge of w over the whole surface gives us the
                    form of the disturbed or actual surface of the sea; it is an equipotential
                    surface, and if V be the potential at P of the disturbing matter p', M the mass
                    of the earth,</p>
                <p>M __ Μ M , <hi rend="subscript"> τ α</hi>-^+V=C≡--- <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    u <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi> V.</p>
                <p>As far as we know, <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is always a very small quantity, and
                    we have with sufficient approximation w = where δ is the mean density of the
                    earth. Thus we have the disturbance in elevation of the sea-level expressed in
                    terms of the potential of the disturbing matter. If at any point P the value of
                    <hi rend="italic">u</hi> remain constant when we pass to any adjacent point,
                    then the actual surface is there parallel to the ideal spherical surface; as a
                    rule, however, the normal at P is inclined to that at P', and astronomical
                    observations have shown that this inclination, amounting ordinarily to one or
                    two seconds, may in some cases exceed 10, or, as at the foot of the Himalayas,
                    even 30 seconds. By the expression “mathematical figure of the earth” we mean
                    the surface of the sea produced in imagination so as to percolate the
                    continents. We see then that the effect of the uneven distribution of matter in
                    the crust of the earth is to produce small elevations and depressions on the
                    mathematical surface which would be otherwise spheroidal. No geodesist can
                    proceed far in his work without encountering the irregularities of the
                    mathematical surface, and it is necessary that he know how they affect his
                    astronomical observations. The whole of this subject is dealt with in his usual
                    elegant manner by Bessel in the <hi rend="italic">Astronomische
                    Nachrichten,</hi> Nos. 329, 330, 331, in a paper entitled “Ueber den Einfluss
                    der Unregelmässigkeiten der Figur der Erde auf geodätische Arbeiten, &amp;c.”
                    But without entering into further details it is not difficult to see how local
                    attraction at any station affects the determinations of latitude, longitude, and
                    azimuth there.</p>
                <p>Let there be at the station an attraction to the north-east throwing the zenith
                    to the south-west, so that it takes in the celestial sphere a position Z', its
                    undisturbed position being Z. Let the rectangular components of the displacement
                    ZZ' be <hi rend="italic">ξ</hi> measured southwards and <hi rend="italic">η</hi>
                    measured westwards. Now the great circle joining Z' with the pole of the heavens
                    P makes there an angle with the meridian PZ = 77 cosec PZ' = ι∕ sec <hi
                    rend="italic">φ,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> is the latitude of the
                    station. Also this great circle meets the horizon in a point whose distance from
                    the great circle PZ is <hi rend="italic">η</hi> sec &lt;∕&gt; sin <hi
                    rend="italic">φ — η</hi> tan &lt;∕&gt;. That is, a meridian mark, fixed by
                    observations of the pole star, will be placed that amount to the east of north.
                    Hence the observed latitude requires the correction <hi rend="italic">ξ;</hi>
                    the observed longitude a correction <hi rend="italic">η</hi> sec <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi>; and any observed azimuth a correction <hi rend="italic"
                    >η</hi> tan <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> Here it is supposed that azimuths are
                    measured from north by east, and longitudes eastwards.</p>
                <p>The expression given for <hi rend="italic">u</hi> enables one to form an
                    approximate estimate of the effect of a compact mountain in raising the
                    sea-level. Take, for instance, Ben Nevis, which contains about a couple of cubic
                    miles; a simple calculation shows that the elevation produced would only amount
                    to about 3 inches. In the case of a mountain mass like the Himalayas, stretching
                    over some 1500 miles of country with a breadth of 300 and an average height of 3
                    miles, although it is difficult or impossible to find an expression for V, yet
                    we may ascertain that an elevation amounting to several hundred feet may exist
                    near their base. The geodetical operations, however, rather negative this idea,
                    for it is shown in a paper in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine</hi>
                    for August 1878 by Colonel Clarke that the form of the sea-level along the
                    Indian arc departs but slightly from that of the mean figure of the earth. If
                    this be so, the action of the Himalayas must be counteracted by subterranean
                    tenuity.</p>
                <p>Suppose now that A, B, C, . . . . are the stations of a network of triangulation
                    projected on or lying on a spheroid of semiaxis major and excentricity <hi
                    rend="italic">a, e,</hi> this spheroid having, its axis parallel to the axis of
                    rotation of the earth, and its surface coinciding with the mathematical surface
                    of the earth at A. Then basing the calculations on the observed elements at A,
                    the calculated latitudes, longitudes, and directions of the meridian at the
                    other points will be the true latitudes, &amp;c., of the points as projected on
                    the spheroid. On comparing these geodetic elements with the corresponding
                    astronomical determinations, there will appear a system of differences which
                    represent the inclinations, at the various points, of the actual irregular
                    surface to the surface of the spheroid of reference. These differences will
                    suggest two things,—first, that we may improve the agreement of the two
                    surfaces, by not restricting the spheroid of reference<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n182/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0182-0171"/> by the condition of making its surface coincide
                    with the mathematical surface of the earth at A; and secondly, by altering the
                    form and dimensions of the spheroid. With respect to the first circumstance, we
                    may allow the spheroid two degrees of freedom, that is, the normals of the
                    surfaces at A may be allowed to separate a small quantity, compounded of a
                    meridional difference and a difference perpendicular to the same. Let the
                    spheroid be so placed that its normal at A lies to the north of the normal to
                    the qarth’s surface by the small quantity <hi rend="italic">ξ</hi> and to the
                    east by the quantity <hi rend="italic">η.</hi> Then in starting the calculation
                    of geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths from A, we must take, not the
                    observed elements <hi rend="italic">φ, a,</hi> but for <hi rend="italic">φ, φ +

                    >η</hi> sec <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> At the same time suppose the elements of
                    the spheroid to be altered from <hi rend="italic">a, e</hi> to <hi rend="italic"

                    gives no additional information, but is available as a check upon the azimuthal
                    observations.</p>
                <p>If now there be a number of astronomical stations in the triangulation, and we
                    form equations such as the above for each point, then we can from them determine
                    those values of <hi rend="italic">ξ, η, da, de,</hi> which make the quantity <hi

                <p>The precise determination of the altitude of his station is a matter of secondary
                    importance to the geodesist; nevertheless it is usual to observe the zenith
                    distances of all trigonometrical points. The height of a station does indeed
                    influence the observation of terrestrial angles, for a vertical line at B does
                    not lie generally in the vertical plane of A, but the error (which is very
                    easily investigated) involved in the neglect of this consideration is much
                    smaller than the errors of observation. Again, in rising to the height <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> above the surface, the centrifugal force is increased and
                    the magnitude and direction of the attraction of the earth are altered, and the
                    effect upon the observation of latitude is a very small error expressed by the
                    formula</p>
                <p>· sin 2&lt;∕&gt;, where <hi rend="italic">g, f</hi> are the values of gravity at
                    the equator and at the pole. This is also a quantity which may be neglected,
                    since for ordinary mountain heights it amounts to only a few hundreths of a
                    second.</p>
                <p>The uncertainties of terrestrial refraction render it impossible to determine
                    accurately by vertical angles the heights of distant points. Generally speaking,
                    refraction is greatest at about daybreak; from that time it diminishes, being at
                    a minimum for a couple of hours before and after mid-day; later in the afternoon
                    it again increases. This at least is the general march of the phenomenon, but it
                    is by no means regular. The vertical angles measured at the station on Hart Fell
                    showed on one occasion in the month of September a refraction of double the
                    average amount, lasting from 1 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> to 5 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> The mean value of the coefficient of refraction <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> determined from a very large number of observations of
                    terrestrial zenith distances in Great Britain is ’ 0792 ÷ ’ 0047; and if we
                    separate those rays which for a considerable portion of their length cross the
                    sea from those which do not, the former give <hi rend="italic">k</hi> = Ό813 and
                    the latter Zr=∙0753. These values are determined from high stations and long
                    distances; when the distance is short, and the rays graze the ground, the amount
                    of refraction is extremely uncertain and variable. A case is noted in the Indian
                    Survey where the zenith distance of a station 10 ’ 5 miles off varied from a
                    depression of 4' 52'' ’ 6 at 4.30 p.M. to an elevation of 2' 24"O at 10.50 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi></p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">h, h'</hi> be the heights above the level of the sea of two
                    stations, 90° + δ, 90° + δ' their mutual zenith distances (δ being that observed
                    at <hi rend="italic">h),</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi> their distance apart, the
                    earth being regarded as a sphere of radius = <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> then,
                    with sufficient precision, <hi rend="italic">h'-h≈3</hi> tan <hi rend="italic"

                <p>∖ 2α <hi rend="italic">J</hi></p>
                <p>If from a station whose height is <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the horizon of the sea
                    be observed to have a zenith distance 90° + δ, then the above formula gives for

                    >h =</hi> 1 ’ 040⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. To take an example: the mean
                    of eight observations of the zenith distance of the sea horizon at the top of
                    Ben Nevis is 91° 4' 48", or δ = 64 ’ 8; the ray is pretty equally disposed over
                    land and water, and hence <hi rend="italic">h=</hi> 1O47u <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 2</hi> = 4396 feet. The actual height of the hill by spirit-levelling is 4406
                    feet, so that the error of the height thus obtained is only 10 feet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Longitude.</hi></p>
                <p>The determination of the difference of longitude between two stations A and B
                    resolves itself into the determination of the local time at each of the
                    stations, and the comparison by signals of the clocks at A and B. Whenever
                    telegraphic lines are available these comparisons are made by
                    electro-telegraphy. A small and delicately-made apparatus introduced into the
                    mechanism of an astronomical clock or chronometer breaks or closes by the action
                    of the clock a galvanic circuit every second. In order to record the minutes as
                    well as seconds, one second in each minute, namely that numbered 0 or 60, is
                    omitted. The seconds are recorded on a chronograph, which consists of a cylinder
                    revolving uniformly at the rate of one revolution per minute <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n183/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0183-0172"/> covered with white paper, on which a pen having a
                    slow movement in the direction of the axis of the cylinder describes a
                    continuous spiral. This pen is deflected through the agency of an electromagnet
                    every second, and thus the seconds of the clock are recorded on the chronograph
                    by offsets from the spiral curve. An observer having his hand on a contact key
                    in the same circuit can record in the same manner his observed times of transits
                    of stars. The method of determination of difference of longitude is, therefore,
                    virtually as follows. After the necessary observations for instrumental
                    correctione, which are recorded only at the station of observation, the clock at
                    A is put in connexion with the circuit so as to write on both chronographs,
                    namely, that at A and that at B. Then the clock at B is made to write on both
                    chronographs. It is clear that by this double operation one can eliminate the
                    effect of the small interval of time consumed in the transmission of signals,
                    for the difference of longitude obtained from the one chronograph will be in
                    excess by as much as that obtained from the other will be in defect. The
                    determination of the personal errors of the observers in this delicate operation
                    is a matter of the greatest importance, as therein lies probably the chief
                    source of residual error-</p>
                <p>Since the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Figure of the Earth</hi> was written,
                    considerable additions to the data for the determination of the semiaxes of the
                    earth have been obtained from India, viz., a new meridian are of 20°, the
                    southern point of which is at Mangalore, together with several arcs of
                    longitude, the longest of which, between Bombay and Nizagapatam, extends over
                    10° 30'. The effect of the accession of these new measures is to alter the
                    figure previously given to the following: the semiaxes of the spheroid best
                    representing tire large arcs now available are</p>
                <p>« = 20926202; c=20854895; c: a = 292∙465: 293*465.</p>
                <p>This value of the major semiaxis exceeds that previously given by 140 feet,
                    whereas the new polar semiaxis is less than the old by 226 feet. If we admit
                    that the figure may possibly be an ellipsoid (not of revolution), then the
                    investigation leads us, through the solution of 51 equations, to these values of
                    the semiaxes—</p>
                <p>α = 20926629, 5=20925105, c=20854407.</p>
                <p>The greater axis of the equator lies in longitude 8" 15' west of Greenwich, a
                    meridian which passing through Ireland and Portugal cuts off a portion of the
                    north-west corner of Africa, and in the opposite hemisphere cuts off the
                    north-east corner of Asia. The apparent ellipticity of the equator is much
                    reduced by the addition of the new data, and it would not be right to put too
                    much confidence in the ellipsoidal figure until many more arcs of longitude
                    shall have furnished the means of testing the theory more decisively than can be
                    done at present. (See <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine,</hi> August
