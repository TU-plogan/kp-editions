                    1708 he fought bravely at Oudenarde. At his father’s accession to the English
                    throne he was thirty-one years of age. He was already on bad terms with his
                    father. The position of an heir-apparent is in no . case an easy one to fill
                    with dignity, and the ill treatment of the prince’s mother by his father was not
                    likely to strengthen in him a reverence for paternal authority. It was most
                    unwillingly that, on his first journey to Hanover in 1716, George I. appointed
                    the prince of Wales guardian of the realm during his absence. In 1717 the
                    existing ill feeling ripened into an open breach. At the baptism of one of his
                    children, the prince selected one godfather whilst the king persisted in
                    selecting another. The young man spoke angrily, was ordered into arrest, and was
                    subsequently commanded to leave St James’s, and to be excluded from all court
                    ceremonies. The prince took <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0435-0422"/> up his residence at Leicester House, and did
                    everything in his power to support the opposition against his father’s
                    ministers.</p>
                <p>When therefore George I. died in 1727, it was generally supposed that Walpole
                    would be at once dismissed. The first direction of the new king was that Sir
                    Spencer Compton would draw up the speech in which he was to announce to the
                    Privy Council his accession. Compton, not knowing how to set about his task,
                    applied to Walpole for aid. The queen took advantage of this evidence of
                    incapacity, advocated Walpole’s cause with her husband, and procured his
                    continuance in office. This curious scene was indicative of the course likely to
                    be taken by the new sovereign. His own mind was incapable of rising above the
                    merest details of business. He made war in the spirit of a drill-sergeant, and
                    he economized his income with the minute regularity of a clerk. A blunder of a
                    master of the ceremonies in marshalling the attendants on a levee put him out of
                    temper. He took the greatest pleasure in counting his money piece by piece, and
                    he never forgot a date. He was above all things methodical and regular. “He
                    seems,” said one who knew him well, “to think his having done a thing to-day an
                    unanswerable reason for his doing it to-morrow.”</p>
                <p>Most men so utterly immersed in details would be very impracticable to deal with.
                    They would obstinately refuse to listen to a wisdom and prudence which meant
                    nothing in their ears, and which brought home to them a sense of their own
                    inferiority. It was the happy peculiarity of George II. that he was exempt from
                    this failing. He seemed to have an instinctive understanding that such and such
                    persons were either wiser or even stronger than himself, and when he had once
                    discovered that, he gave way with scarcely a struggle. Thus it was that, though
                    in his domestic relations he was as loose a liver as his father had been, he
                    allowed himself to be guided by the wise but unobtrusive counsels of his wife
                    until her death in 1737, and that when once he had recognized Walpole’s
                    superiority he allowed himself to be guided by the political sagacity of the
                    great minister. It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of such a temper
                    upon the development of the constitution. The apathy of the nation in all but
                    the most exciting political questions, fostered by the calculated conservatism
                    of Walpole, had thrown power into the hands of the great landowners. They
                    maintained their authority by supporting a minister who was ready to make use of
                    corruption, wherever corruption was likely to be useful, and who could veil over
                    the baseness of the means which he employed by his talents in debate and in
                    finance. To shake off a combination so strong would not have been easy. George
                    II. submitted to it without a struggle.</p>
                <p>So strong indeed had the Whig aristocracy grown that it began to lose its
                    cohesion. Walpole was determined to monopolize power, and he dismissed from
                    office all who ventured to oppose him. An Opposition formidable in talents was
                    gradually formed. In its composite ranks were to be found Tories and
                    discontented Whigs, discarded official hacks who were hungry for the emoluments
                    of office, and youthful purists who fancied that if Walpole were removed, bribes
                    and pensions would cease to be attractive to a corrupt generation. Behind them
                    was Bolingbroke, excluded from parliament but suggesting every party move. In
                    1737 the opposition acquired the support of Frederick prince of Wales. The young
                    man, weak and headstrong, rebelled against the strict discipline exacted by his
                    father. His marriage in 1736 to Augusta of Saxony brought on an open quarrel. In
                    1737 just as the princess of Wales was about to give birth to her first child,
                    she was hurried away by her husband from Hampton Court to St James’s Palace at
                    the imminent risk of ħer life, simply in order that the prince might show his
                    spite to his father who had provided all necessary attendance at the former
                    place. George ordered his son to quit St James’s, and to absent himself from
                    court. Frederick in disgrace gave the support of his name, and he had nothing
                    else to give, to the Opposition. Later in the year 1737, on November 20, Queen
                    Caroline died. In 1742 Walpole, weighed down by the unpopularity both of his
                    reluctance to engage in a war with Spain and of his supposed remissness in
                    conducting the operations of that war, was driven from office. His successors
                    formed a composite ministry in which Walpole’s old colleagues and Walpole’s old
                    opponents were alike to be found.</p>
                <p>The years which followed settled conclusively, at least for this reign, the
                    constitutional question of the power of appointing ministers. The war between
                    Spain and England had broken out in 1739. In 1741 the death of the emperor
                    Charles VI. brought on the war of the Austrian succession. The position of
                    George II. as a Hanoverian prince drew him to the side of Maria Theresa through
                    jealousy of the rising Prussian monarchy. Jealousy of France led England in the
                    same direction, and in 1741 a subsidy of £300,000 was voted to Maria Theresa.
                    The king himself went to Germany and attempted to carry on the war according to
                    his own notions. Those notions led him to regard the safety of Hanover as of far
                    more importance than the wishes of England. Finding that a French army was about
                    to march upon his German states, he concluded with France a treaty of neutrality
                    for a year without consulting a single English minister. In England the news was
                    received with feelings of disgust. The expenditure of English money and troops
                    was to be thrown uselessly away as soon as it appeared that Hanover was in the
                    slightest danger. In 1742 Walpole was no longer in office. Lord Wilmington, the
                    nominal head of the ministry, was a mere cipher. The ablest and most energetic
                    of his colleagues, Lord Carteret, attached himself specially to the king, and
                    sought to maintain himself in power by his special favour and by brilliant
                    achievements in diplomacy.</p>
                <p>In part at least by Carteret’s mediation the peace of Breslau was signed, by
                    which Maria Theresa ceded Silesia to Frederick (July 28, 1742). Thus relieved on
                    her northern frontier, she struck out vigorously towards the west. Bavaria was
                    overrun by her troops. In the beginning of 1743 one French army was driven
                    across the Rhine. On June 27th another French army was defeated by George II. in
                    person at Dettingen. Victory brought elation to Maria Theresa. Her war of
                    defence was turned into -a war of vengeance. Bavaria was to be annexed. The
                    French frontier was to be driven back. George II. and Carteret after some
                    hesitation placed themselves on her "side. Of the public opinion of the
                    political classes in England they took no thought. Hanoverian troops were indeed
                    to be employed in the war, but they were to be taken into British pay.
                    Collisions between British and Hanoverian officers were frequent. A storm arose
                    against the preference shown to Hanoverian interests. After a brief struggle
                    Carteret, having become Lord Granville by his mother’s death, was driven from
                    office in November 1744.</p>
                <p>Henry Pelham, who had become prime minister in tho preceding year, thus saw
                    himself established in power. By the acceptance of this ministry, the king
                    acknowledged that the function of choosing a ministry and directing a policy had
                    passed from his hands. In 1745 indeed he recalled Granville, but a few days were
                    sufficient to convince him of the futility of his attempt, and the effort to
                    exclude Pitt at a later time proved equally fruitless.</p>
                <p>Important as were the events of the remainder of the reign, therefore, they can
                    hardly be grouped round the name <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0436-0423"/> of George II. The resistance to the invasion of
                    the young Pretender in 1745, the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, the great war
                    ministry of Pitt at the close of the reign, did not receive their impulse from
                    him. He had indeed done his best to exclude Pitt from office. He disliked him on
                    account of his opposition in former years to the sacrifices demanded by the
                    Hanoverian connexion. When in 1756 Pitt became secretary of state in the
                    Devonshire administration, the King bore the yoke with difficulty. Early in the
                    next year he complained of Pitt’s long speeches as being above his
                    comprehension, and on April 5, 1757, he dismissed him, only to take him back
                    shortly after, when Pitt, coalescing with Newcastle, became master of the
                    situation. Before Pitt’s dismissal George II. had for once an opportunity of
                    placing himself on the popular side, though, as was the case of his grandson
                    during the American war, it was when the popular side happened to be in the
                    wrong. In the true spirit of a martinet, he wished to see Admiral Byng executed.
                    Pitt urged the wish of the House of Commons to have him pardoned. “Sir,” replied
                    the king, “you have taught me to look for the sense of my subjects in another
                    place than in the House of Commons.” When George II. died in 1760, he left
                    behind him a settled understanding that the monarchy was one of the least of the
                    forces by which the policy of the country was directed. To this end he had
                    contributed much by his disregard of English opinion in 1743; but it may fairly
                    be added that, but for his readiness to give way to irresistible adversaries,
                    the struggle might have been far more bitter and severe than it was.</p>
                <p>Of the connexion between Hanover and England in this reign two memorials remain
                    more pleasant to contemplate than the records of parliamentary and ministerial
                    intrigues. With the support of George II., amidst the derision of the English
                    fashionable world, the Hanoverian Handel produced in England those masterpieces
                    which have given delight to millions, whilst the foundation of the university of
                    Göttingen by the same king opened a door through which English political ideas
                    afterwards penetrated into Germany.</p>
                <p>George II. had three sons,—Frederick Louis (1707- 1751); George William
                    (1717-1718); and William Augustus, duke of Cumberland (1721-1765); and five
                    daughters, Anne (1709-1759), married to William, prince of Orange, 1734; Amelia
                    Sophia Eleonora (1711—1786); Elizabeth Caroline (1713-1757); Mary (1723-1772),
                    married to Frederick, landgrave of Hesse Cassel, 1740; Louisa (1724-1751),
                    married to Frederick V., king of Denmark, 1743. (s. <hi rend="smallcaps">r.
