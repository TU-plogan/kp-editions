                <p><label type="entry">GEORGE III</label>. <hi rend="italic">(George William
                        Frederick,</hi> 1738- 1820), born 4th June 1738, was the son of Frederick
                    prince of Wales and the grandson of George IT,, whom he succeeded in 1760. After
                    his father’s death in 1751 he had been educated in seclusion from the
                    fashionable world under the care of his mother and of her favourite counsellor
                    the earl of Bute. He had been taught to revere the maxims of Bolingbroke’s
                    “Patriot King,” and to believe that it was his appointed task in life to Break
                    the power of the Whig houses resting upon extensive property and the influence
                    of patronage and corruption.</p>
                <p>That power had already been gravely shaken. The Whigs fromtheir incompetency were
                    obliged when the Seven Years’ War broke out to leave its management in the hands
                    of William Pitt. The nation learned to applaud the great war minister who
                    succeeded where others had failed, and whose immaculate purity put to shame the
                    ruck of barterers of votes for places and pensions. In some sort the work of the
                    new king was the continuation of the work of Pitt. But his methods were very
                    different. He did not appeal to any widely spread feeling or prejudice; nor did
                    he disdain the use of the arts which had maintained his opponents in power. The
                    patronage of the crown was to be really as well as nominally his own; and he
                    calculated, not without reason, that men would feel more flattered in accepting
                    a place from a king than from a minister. The new Toryism of which he was the
                    founder was no recurrence to the Toryism of the days of Charles II. or even of
                    Anne. The question of the amount of toleration to be accorded to Dissenters had
                    been entirely laid asleep. The point at issue was whether the crown should be
                    replaced in the position which George I. might have occupied at the beginning of
                    his reign, selecting the ministers and influencing the deliberations of the
                    cabinet. For this struggle George III. possessed no inconsiderable advantages.
                    With an inflexible tenacity of purpose, he was always ready to give way when
                    resistance was really hopeless. As the first English-born sovereign of his
                    house, speaking from his birth the language of his subjects, he found a way to
                    the hearts of many who never regarded his predecessors as other than foreign
                    intruders. The contrast, too, between the pure domestic life which he led with
                    his wife Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, whom he married in 1761, and the
                    habits of three generations of his house, told in his favour with the vast
                    majority of his subjects. Even his marriage had been a sacrifice to duty. Soon
                    after his accession he had fallen in love with Lady Sarah Lennox, and had been
                    observed to ride morning by morning along the Kensington Road, from which the
                    object of his affections was to be seen from the lawn of Holland House making
                    hay, or engaged in some other ostensible employment. Before the year was over
                    Lady Sarah appeared as one of the queen’s bridesmaids, and she was herself
                    married to Sir Charles Bunbury in 1762.</p>
                <p>At first everything seemed easy to him. Pitt had come to be regarded by his own
                    colleagues as a minister who would pursue war at any price, and in getting rid
                    of Pitt in 1761 and in carrying on the negotiations which led to the peace of
                    Paris in 1762, the king was able to gather round him many persons who would not
                    be willing to acquiesce in any permanent change in the system of government.
                    With the signature of the peace his real difficulties began. The Whig houses,
                    indeed, were divided amongst themselves by personal rivalries. But they were
                    none of them inclined to let power and the advantages of power slip from their
                    hands without a struggle. For some years a contest of influence was carried on
                    without dignity and without any worthy aim. The king was not strong enough to
                    impose upon parliament a ministry of his own choice. But he gathered round
                    himself a body of dependants known as the king’s friends, who were secure of his
                    favour, and who voted one way or the other according to his wishes. Under these
                    circumstances no ministry could possibly be stable; and yet every ministry was
                    strong enough to impose some conditions on the king. Lord Bute, the king’s first
                    choice, resigned from a sense of his own incompetency in 1763. George Grenville
                    was in office till 1765; the marquis of Rockingham till 1766; Pitt, becoming
                    earl of Chatham, till illness compelled him to retire from the conduct of
                    affairs in 1767, when he was succeeded by the duke of Grafton. But a struggle of
                    interests could gain no real strength for any Government, and the only chance
                    the king had of effecting a permanent change in the balance of power lay in the
                    possibility of his associating himself with some phase of strong national
                    feeling, as Pitt had associated himself with the war feeling caused by the
                    dissatisfaction spread by the weakness and ineptitude of his predecessors.</p>
                <p>Such a chance was offered by the question of the right to tax America. The notion
                    that England was justified in throwing on America part of the expenses caused in
                    the late war was popular in the country, and no one adopted it more
                    pertinaciously than George III. At the bottom the <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0437-0424"/> position which he assumed was as contrary to
                    the principles of parliamentary government as the encroachments of Charles I.
                    had been. But it was veiled in the eyes of Englishmen by the prominence given to
                    the power of the British parliament rather than to the power of the British
                    king. In fact the theory of parliamentary government, like most theories after
                    their truth has long been universally acknowledged, had become a superstition.
                    Parliaments were held to be properly vested with authority, not because they
                    adequately represented the national will, but simply because they were
                    parliaments. There were thousands of people in England to whom it never occurred
                    that there was any good reason why a British parliament should be allowed to
                    levy a duty on tea in the London docks and should not be allowed to levy a duty
                    on tea at the wharves of Boston. Undoubtedly George III. derived great strength
                    from his honest participation in this mistake. Contending under parliamentary
                    forms, he did not wound the susceptibilities of members of parliament, and when
                    at last in 1770 he appointed Lord North—a minister of his own selection—prime
                    minister, the object of his ambition was achieved with the concurrence of a
                    large body of politicians who had nothing in common with the servile band of the
                    king’s friends.</p>
                <p>As long as the struggle with America was carried on with any hope of success they
                    gained that kind of support which is always forthcoming to a Government which
                    shares in the errors and prejudices of its subjects. The expulsion of Wilkes
                    from the House of Commons in 1769, and the refusal of the House to accept him as
                    a member after his re-election, raised a grave constitutional question in which
                    the king was wholly in the wrong; and Wilkes was popular in London and
                    Middlesex. But his case roused no national indignation, and when in 1774 those
                    sharp measures were taken with Boston which led to the commencement of the
                    American rebellion in 1775, the opposition to the course taken by the king made
                    little way either in parliament or in the country. Burke might point out the
                    folly and inexpedience of the proceedings of the Government. Chatham might point
                    out that the true spirit of English government was to be representative, and
                    that that spirit was being violated at home and abroad. George IIL, who thought
                    that the first duty of the Americans was to obey himself, had on his side the
                    mass of unreflecting Englishmen who thought that the first duty of all colonists
                    was to be useful and submissive to the mother-country. The natural dislike of
                    every country engaged in war to see itself defeated was on his side, and wſhen
                    the news of Burgoyne’s surrender at Saratoga arrived in 1777, subscriptions of
                    money to raise new regiments poured freely in.</p>
                <p>In March 1778 the French ambassador in London announced that a treaty of
                    friendship and commerce had been concluded between France and the new United
                    States of America. Lord North was anxious to resign power into stronger hands,
                    and begged the king to receive Chatham as his prime minister. The king would not
                    hear of it. He would have nothing to say to “that perfidious man” unless he
                    would humble himself to enter the ministry as North’s subordinate. Chatham
                    naturally refused to do anything of the kind, and his death in the course of the
                    year relieved the king of the danger of being again overruled by too overbearing
                    a minister. England was now at war with France, and in 1779 she was also at war
                    with Spain.</p>
                <p>George III. was still able to control the disposition of office. He could not
                    control the course of events. His very ministers gave up the struggle as
                    hopeless long before he would acknowledge the true state of the cgse. Before the
                    end of 1779, two of the leading members ofi∣ithe cabinet, Lords Gower and
                    Weymouth, resigned rather than bear the responsibility of so ruinous an
                    enterprise as the attempt to overpower America and France together. Lord North
                    retained office, but he acknowledged to the king that his own opinion was
                    precisely the same as that of his late colleagues.</p>
                <p>The year 1780 saw an agitation rising in the country for economical reform, an
                    agitation very closely though indirectly connected with the war policy of the
                    king. The public meetings held in the country on this subject have no
                    unimportant place in the development of the constitution. Since the presentation
                    of the Kentish Petition in the reign of William III. there had been from time to
                    time upheavings of popular feeling against the doings of the legislature, which
                    kept up the tradition that parliament existed in order to represent the nation.
                    But these upheavings had all been so associated with ignorance and violence as
                    to make it very difficult for men of sense to look with displeasure upon the
                    existing emancipation of the House of Commons from popular control, The
                    Sacheverel riots, the violent attacks upon the Excise Bill, the no less violent
                    advocacy of the Spanish war, the declamations of the supporters of Wilkes at a
                    more recent time, and even in this very year the Gordon riots, were not likely
                    to make thoughtful men anxious to place real power in the hands of the classes
                    from whom such exhibitions of folly proceeded. But the movement for economical
                    reform was of a very different kind. It was carried on soberly in manner, and
                    with a definite practical object. It asked for no more than the king ought to
                    have been willing to concede. It attacked useless expenditure upon sinecures and
                    unnecessary offices in the household, the only use of which was to spread abroad
                    corruption amongst the upper classes. George III. could not bear to be
                    interfered with at all, or to surrender any element of power wſliich had served
                    him in his long struggle with the Whigs. He held out for more than another year.
                    The news of the capitulation of York Town reached London on November 25, 1781.
                    On March 20, 1782, Lord North resigned.</p>
                <p>George III. accepted the consequences of defeat. He called, the marquis of
                    Rockingham to office at the head of a ministry composed of pure Whigs and of the
                    disciples of the late earl of Chatham, and he authorized the new ministry to
                    open negotiations for peace. Their hands were greatly strengthened by Rodney’s
                    victory over the French fleet, and the failure of the combined French and
                    Spanish attack upon Gibraltar; and before the end of 1782 a provisional treaty
                    was signed with America, preliminaries of peace with Franceand Spainbeingsigned
                    early in the following year. On September 3,1783, the definitive treaties with
                    the three countries were simultaneously concluded. “Sir,” said the king to Mr
                    Adams the first minister of the United States of America accredited to him, “I
                    wish you to believe, and that it may be understood in America, that I have done
                    nothing in the late contest but what I thought myself indispensably bound to do
                    by the duty which I owed to my people. I will be very frank with you. I was the
                    last to consent to the separation; but the separation having been made and
                    having bect&gt;me inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that I would be
                    the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent
                    power.”</p>
                <p>Long before the signature of the treaties Rockingham died (July 1, 1782). The
                    king chose Lord Shelburne, the head of the Chatham section of the Government, to
                    be prime minister. Fox and the followers of Rockingham refused to serve except
                    under the duke of Portland, a minister of their own selection, and resigned
                    office. The old constitutional struggle of the reign was now to be fought out
                    once more. Fox, too weak to obtain a majority alone, coalesced with Lord North,
                    and defeated Shelburne in the House of Commons on February 17, 1783. On April 2
                    the coalition took office, with Portland as nominal <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n438/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0438-0425"/> prime minister, and Fox and North the
                    secretaries of state as its real heads.</p>
                <p>This attempt to impose upon him a ministry which he disliked made the king very
                    angry. But the new cabinet had a large majority in the House of Commons, and the
                    only chance of resisting it lay in an appeal to the country against the House of
                    Commons. Such an appeal was not likely to be responded to unless the ministers
                    discredited themselves with the nation. George III. therefore waited his time.
                    Though a coalition between men bitterly opposed to one another in all political
                    principles and drawn together by nothing but love of office was in itself
                    discreditable, it needed some more positive cause of dissatisfaction to arouse
                    the constituencies, which were by no means so ready to interfere in political
                    disputes at that time as they are now. Such dissatisfaction was given by the
                    India Bill, drawn up by Burke. As soon as it had passed through the Commons the
                    king hastened to procure its rejection in the House of Lords by his personal
                    intervention with the Peers. He authorized Lord Temple to declare in his name
                    that he would count any peer who voted for the Bill as his enemy. On December
                    17, 1783, the Bill was thrown out The next day ministers were dismissed. William
                    Pitt became prime minister. After some weeks’ struggle with a constantly
                    decreasing majority in the Commons, the king dissolved parliament on March 25,
                    1784. The country rallied round the crown and the young minister, and Pitt was
                    firmly established in office.</p>
                <p>Since the publication of a letter from Mr Orde in Lord E. Fitzmaurice’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Lifo</hi><hi rend="italic">of Shelburne</hi> (iii. 393) there
                    can be no reasonable doubt that Pitt not only took advantage of the king’s
                    intervention in the Lords, but was cognizant of the intrigue before it was
                    actually carried out. It was upon him, too, that the weight of reconciling the
                    country to an administration formed under such circumstances lay. How he
                    acquitted himself under the task, what were his great achievements, and what his
                    still greater unaccomplished projects should be told in connexion with his name
                    rather than with that of the king. The general result, so far as George III. was
                    concerned, was that to all outward appearance he had won the great battle of his
                    life. It was he who was to appoint the prime minister, not any clique resting on
                    a parliamentary support. But the circumstances under which the victory was won
                    were such as to place the constitution in a position very different from that in
                    which it would have been if the victory had been gained earlier in the reign.
                    Intrigue there was indeed in 1783 and 1784 as there had been twenty years
                    before. Parliamentary support was conciliated by Pitt by the grant of royal
                    favours as it had been in the days of Bute. The actual blow was struck by a most
                    questionable message to individual peers. But the main result of the whole
                    political situation was that George III. had gone a long way towards
                    disentangling the reality of parliamentary government from its accidents. His
                    ministry finally stood because it had appealed to the constituencies against
                    their representatives. At the present day it has properly become a
                    constitutional axiom that no such appeal should be made by the crown itself. But
                    it may reasonably be doubted whether any one but the king was at that time
                    capable of making the appeal. Lord Shelburne, the leader of the ministry
                    expelled by the coalition, was unpopular in the country, and the younger Pitt
                    had not had time to make his great abilities known beyond a limited circle. The
                    real question for the constitutional historian to settle is not whether under
                    ordinary circumstances a king is the proper person to place himself really as
                    well as nominally at the head of the government; but whether under the special
                    circumstances which existed in 1783 it was not better that the king should call
                    upon the people to support him, than that government should be left in the hands
                    of men who rested their power on close boroughs and the dispensation of
                    patronage, without looking beyond the walls of the House of Commons for
                    support.</p>
                <p>Of the glories of Pitt’s ministry this is not the place to write. That the king
                    gained credit by them far beyond his own deserts is beyond a doubt. Nor can
                    there be any reasonable doubt that his own example of domestic propriety did
                    much to strengthen the position of his minister. It is true that that life was
                    unsufferably dull. No gleams of literary or artistic taste lightened it up. The
                    dependants of the court became inured to dull routine unchequered by loving
                    sympathy. The sons of the household were driven by the sheer weariness of such
                    an existence into the coarsest profligacy. But all this was not visible from a
                    distance. The tide of moral and religious improvement which had set in in
                    England since the days of Wesley brought popularity to a king who was faithful
                    to his wife, in the same way that the tide of manufacturing industry and
                    scientific progress brought popularity to the minister who in some measure
                    translated into practice the principles of the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of
                        Nations.</hi></p>
                <p>Nor were there wanting subjects of importance beyond the circle of politics in
                    which George III. showed a lively interest. The voyages of discovery which made
                    known so large a part of the islands and coasts of the Pacific Ocean received
                    from him a warm support. In the early days of the Royal Academy, its finances
                    were strengthened by liberal grants from the privy purse. His favourite pursuit,
                    however, was farming. When Arthur Young was issuing his <hi rend="italic">Annals
                        of Agriculture,</hi> he was supplied with information by the king, under the
                    assumed name of Mr Ralph Robinson, relating to a farm at Petersham.</p>
                <p>The life of the king was suddenly clouded over. Early in his reign, in 1765, he
                    had been out of health, and it is now known—what was studiously concealed at the
                    time— that symptoms of mental aberration were even then to be perceived. In
                    October 1788 he was again out of health, and in the beginning of the following
                    month his insanity was beyond a doubt. Whilst Pitt and Fox were contending in
                    the House of Commons over the terms on which the regency should be committed to
                    the prince of Wales, the king was a helpless victim to the ignorance of
                    physicians and the brutalities of his servants. At last Dr Willis, who had made
                    himself a name by prescribing gentleness instead of rigour in the treatment of
                    the insane, was called in. Under his more humane management the king rapidly
                    recovered. Before the end of February 1789 he was able to write to Pitt thanking
                    him for his warm support of his interests during his illness. On April 23 he
                    went in person to St Paul’s to return thanks for his recovery.</p>
                <p>The popular enthusiasm which burst forth around St Paul’s was but a foretaste of
                    a popularity far more universal. The French Revolution frightened the great Whig
                    landowners till they made their peace with the king. Those who thought that the
                    true basis of government was aristocratical were now of one mind with those who
                    thought that the true basis of government was monarchical; and these two classes
                    were joined by a far larger multitude which had no political ideas whatever, but
                    which had a moral horror of the guillotine. As Elizabeth had once been the
                    symbol of resistance to Spain, George was now the symbol of resistance to
                    France. He was not, however, more than the symbol. He allowed Pitt to levy taxes
                    and incur debt, to launch armies to defeat, and to prosecute the English
                    imitators of French revolutionary courses. At last, however, after the Union
                    with Ireland was accomplished, he learned that Pitt was planning a scheme to
                    relieve the Catholics from the disabilities under which they laboured. The plan
                    was revealed to him by the chancellor, Lord Loughborough, a selfish and
                    intriguing politician who had served all parties <pb break="no"

                    interests by falling in with the king’s prejudices. George III. at once took up
                    the position from which he never swerved. He declared that to grant concessions
                    to the Catholics involved a breach of his coronation oath. All thinking men of a
                    later generation are of opinion that the objection was untenable. But no one has
                    ever doubted that the king was absolutely convinced of the serious nature of the
                    objection, or that he believed the measure itself to be beyond measure injurious
                    to church and state. Nor can there be any doubt that he had the English people
                    behind him. Both in his peace ministry and in his war ministry Pitt had taken
                    his stand on royal favour and on popular support. Both failed him alike now, and
                    he resigned office at once. The shock to the king’s mind was so great that it
                    brought on a fresh attack of insanity. This time, however, the recovery was
                    rapid. On March 14, 1801, Pitt’s resignation was formally accepted, and the late
                    speaker, Mr Addington, was installed in office as prime minister.</p>
                <p>The king was well pleased with the change. He was never capable of appreciating
                    high merit in any one; and he was unable to perceive that the question on which
                    Pitt had resigned was more than an improper question, with which he ought never
                    to have meddled. “Tell him,” he said, in directing his physician to inform Pitt
                    of his restoration to health, “I am now quite well, quite recovered from my
                    illness; but what has he not to answer for, who has been the cause of my having
                    been ill at all <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ?” Addington was a minister after
                    his own mind. Thoroughly honest and respectable, with about the same share of
                    abilities as was possessed by the king himself, he was certainly not likely to
                    startle the world by any flights of genius. But for one circumstance Addington’s
                    ministry would have lasted long. So strong was the reaction against the
                    Revolution that the bulk of the nation was almost as suspicious of genius as the
                    king himself. Not only was there no outcry for legislative reforms, but the very
                    idea of reform was unpopular. The country gentlemen were predominant in
                    parliament, and the country gentlemen as a body looked upon Addington with
                    respect and affection. Such a minister was therefore admirably suited to preside
                    over affairs at home in the existing state of opinion. But those who were
                    content with inaction at home would not be content with inaction abroad. In time
                    of peace Addington would have been popular for a season. In time of war even his
                    warmest admirers could not say that he was the man to direct armies in the most
                    terrible struggle which had ever been conducted by an English Government.</p>
                <p>For the moment this difficulty was not felt. On October 1, 1801, preliminaries of
                    peace were signed between England and France, to be converted into the
                    definitive peace of Amiens on March 27, 1802. The ruler of France was now
                    Napoleon Bonaparte, and few persons in England believed that he had any real
                    purpose of bringing his aggressive violence to an end. “Do you know what I call
                    this peace î” said the king; “an experimental peace, for it is nothing else. But
                    it was unavoidable.”</p>
                <p>The king was right. On May 18, 1803, the declaration of war was laid before
                    parliament. The war was accepted by all classes as inevitable, and the French
                    preparations for an invasion of England roused the whole nation to a glow of
                    enthusiasm only equalled by that felt when the Armada threatened our shores. On
                    October 26 the king reviewed the London volunteers in Hyde Park. He found
                    himself the centre of a great national movement with which he heartily
                    sympathized, and which heartily sympathized with him.</p>
                <p>On February 12, 1804, the king’s mind was again affected. When he recovered, he
                    found himself in the midst of a ministerial crisis. Public feeling allowed but
                    one opinion to prevail in the country,—that Pitt, not Addington, was the proper
                    man to conduct the administration in time of war. Pitt was anxious to form an
                    administration on a broad basis, including Fox and all prominent leaders of both
                    parties. The king would not hear of the admission of Fox. His dislike of him was
                    personal as well as political, as he knew’ that Fox had had a great share in
                    drawing the prince of Wales into a life of profligacy. Pitt accepted the king’s
                    terms, and formed an administration in which he was the only man of real
                    ability. Eminent men such as Lord Grenville refused to join a ministry from
                    which the king had excluded a great statesman on purely personal grounds.</p>
                <p>The whole question was reopened on Pitt’s death on January 23, 1806. This time
                    the king gave way. The ministry of All the Talents, as it was called, included
                    Fox amongst its members. At first the king was observed to appear depressed at
                    the necessity of surrender. But Fox’s charm of manner soon gained upon him. “Mr
                    Fox,” said the king, “I little thought that you and I should ever meet again in
                    this place; but I have no desire to look back upon old grievances, and you may
                    rest assured I never shall remind you of them.” On September 13 Fox died, and it
                    was not long before the king and the ministry were openly in collision. The
                    ministry proposed a measure enabling all subjects of the crown to serve in the
                    army and navy in spite of religious disqualifications. The king objected even to
                    so slight a modification of the laws against the Catholics and Dissenters, and
                    the ministers consented to drop the bill. The king asked more than this. He
                    demanded a written and positive engagement that this ministry would never, under
                    any circumstances, propose to him “any measure of concession to the Catholics,
                    or even connected with the question.” The ministers very properly refused to
                    bind themselves for the future. They were consequently turned out of office, and
                    a new ministry was formed with the duke of Portland as first lord of the
                    treasury and Mr Perceval as its real leader. The spirit of the new ministry was
                    distinct hostility to the Catholic claims. On April 27,1807, a dissolution of
                    parliament was announced, and a majority in favour of the king’s ministry was
                    returned in the elections which speedily followed.</p>
                <p>The elections of 1807, like the elections of 1784, gave the king the mastery of
                    the situation. In other respects they were the counterpart of one another. In
                    1784 the country declared, though perhaps without any clear conception of what
                    it was doing, for a wise and progressive policy. In 1807 it declared for an
                    unwise and retrogressive policy, with a very clear understanding of what it
                    meant. It is in his reliance upon the prejudices and ignorance of the country
                    that the constitutional significance of the reign of George III. appears. Every
                    strong Government derives its power from its representative character. At a time
                    when the House of Commons was less really representative than at any other, a
                    king was on the throne who represented the country in its good and bad qualities
                    alike, in its hatred of revolutionary violence, its moral sturdiness, its
                    contempt of foreigners, and its defiance of all ideas which were in any way
                    strange. Therefore it was that his success was not permanently injurious to the
                    working of the constitution as the success of Charles I. would have been. If he
                    were followed by a king less English than himself, the strength of
                    representative power would pass into other hands than those which held the
                    sceptre.</p>
                <p>The overthrow’ of the ministry of All the Talents was the last political act of
                    constitutional importance in which George III. took part. The substitution of
                    Perceval for Portland as the nominal head of the ministry in 1809 was not an
                    event of any real significance, and in 1811 the reign practically came to an
                    end. The king’s reason finally broke <pb break="no"

                <p>George III. had nine sons. After his successor came Frederick, duke of York and

                    king of Würtemberg; Augusta Sophia (1768-1840); Elizabeth (1770-1840), married
