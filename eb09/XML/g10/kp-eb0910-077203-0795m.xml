                    (1744-1809), “the Portuguese Petrarch,” perhaps better known as <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dirceu,</hi> was born at Oporto in 1744, and received his early
                    education there and at Bahia, where his father, after having held various
                    judicial appointments, became a member of the supreme court in 1759. Having
                    completed his law studies at the university of Coimbra, which he attended from
                    1763 to 1768, Gonzaga in the latter year returned to Brazil, and after having
                    acted for some years as juiz de fora or local magis träte at Beja and elsewhere
                    he ultimately was appointed a judge (ouvidor) at Villa-Rica in the province of
                    Minas, where he highly distinguished himself it is said both by his
                    administrative ability and by the many excellences of his private character. He
                    appears before this time to have developed some talent for versification, and
                    his literary tastes soon brought him into intimate association with Claudio
                    Manoel, Alvarenga Peixoto, and other writers of the so-called Minas school; but
                    the love which makes the poet did not, in his own opinion at least, come upon
                    him until he had made the acquaintance (about 1788) of D. Maria Joaquina
                    Dorothea de Seixas, the “Marilia de Dirceu” to whom all his extant poems relate.
                    He had just been nominated a member of the supreme court of Bahia, and was on
                    the eve of his marriage, when discovery was made of the treasonable plot of
                    Minas, and he was arrested on suspicion of having been implicated in it. On
                    merely circumstantial evidence, and that of a very incon clusive kind, he was
                    condemned, 18th April 1792, to banishment for life to Pedras de Angoche, a
                    sentence which was afterwards commuted to one of ten years’ exile at Mozambique.
                    Here he made some effort to practise as an advocate, but he never recovered from
                    the wearing-out depression into which he had been thrown by his cruel lot; an
                    attack of nervous fever undermined his health, and after years of an
                    ever-deepening melancholy, which occasionally alternated with fits of acute
                    mania, he died in 1809. <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi></p>
                <p>His collection of poems, entitled <hi rend="italic">Mαrιliα de L)ireeu,</hi>
                    consists of two parts. In the first of these, the charms of Marilia and his own
                    happiness in the love he bears to her are his endlessly varied theme. The
                    second, written during his imprisonment, is full of laments over his terrible
                    fate, protestations of his innocence, and many fine expressions of the support
                    and comfort he still finds in the remembrance of his love. Almost everywhere
                    these “lyras” plainly enough betray a conscious imitation of Petrarch or other
                    models; but they also exhibit an imaginative charm, a naturalness and delicacy
                    of feeling, a harmoniousness of diction, and a gracefulness of versification
                    which, in the unanimous opinion of competent critics, entitle them to rank among
                    the best love lyrics in the language. In Brazil their popularity, perhaps aided
                    by feelings of sympathy for their unfortunate author, has from the first been
                    very great. The editions are very numerous, the best probably being that of J.
                    Μ. P. da Sylva which is accompanied with an historical and biographical
                    introduction (1845). A critical notice, along with selections from the poems of
                    Gonzaga, will be found in Wolf’s <hi rend="italic">Brésil Littéraire</hi>
                    (1863). They have been translated into French by Monglave and Chalas (1825),
                    into Spanish by Vedia, and into Italian by Ruscalla.</p>
