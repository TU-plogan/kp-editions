                <p><label type="entry">GEORGIA</label>, one of the thirteen original States of the
                    American Union, has Tennessee and North Carolina on the N., South Carolina and
                    the Atlantic Ocean on the E., Florida S., and Alabama W. The Savannah river
                    separates the State on the E. from South Carolina; the St Mary’s, on the S.,
                    divides it in part from Florida; the Chattahoochee, on the W., flows between
                    Georgia and Alabama for nearly half its course. Georgia lies between 30 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> β</hi> 21' 39" and 35° N. lat., and between 81° and 85° 53'
                    38" W. long. It is 320 miles long from N. to S., and 256 miles in its greatest
                    breadth from E to W., with an area of 58,000 square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface.—</hi> Georgia has three distinctly marked zones,
                    varying in soil, climate, and productions. Her sea-coast is similar to that of
                    the Carolinas, being skirted by fertile islands, separated from the mainland by
                    narrow lagoons or by sounds. This section is essentially tropical. Beginning at
                    the sea-coast, a gradually ascending sandy plain extends northward and westward
                    as far as the head of navigation on the Savannah, Ogeechee, Oconee, and Ocmulgee
                    rivers, where it meets a Primary formation. Augusta, Milledgeville, and Macon
                    indicate the northern limit of this tract. Here begins the hilly and finally
                    mountainous region, the most, extensive, fertile, and salubrious of the State. A
                    second plateau, 60 or 70 miles broad, stretches above the falls of the rivers
                    until it meets the southernmost ranges of the great Appalachian chain of
                    mountains which traverses Virginia, North Carolina, and northern Georgia under
                    the name of the Blue Ridge, and is finally lost in Alabama. This picturesque
                    district extends in Georgia from Rabun county in the north-east corner of the
                    State to Dade in the extreme north-west, where the summit of Lookout Mountain
                    dominates the valley of the Tennessee. Here are the sources of the two principal
                    rivers of the State; here is the gold-producing region; and here is also the
                    theatre of some of the most sanguinary battles of the civil war. The elevations
                    of the Blue Ridge vary from 1200 to 4000 feet. In the south-east of the State is
                    the extensive Okefinokee swamp, which has an estimated circumference of 180
                    miles, is filled with pools and islands, and is the congenial home of
                    alligators, lizards, and other reptiles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers and Harbours.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> There are
                    many fine rivers in Georgia. A north and south line passing through Macon would
                    nearly divide the streams flowing into the Atlantic from those discharging into
                    the Gulf of Mexico. The Savannah, Ogeechee, Alta maha, Santilla, and St Mary’s
                    fall into the Atlantic, and the Chattahoochee, Flint, and tributaries of the
                    Suwanee flow to the Gulf coast. The rivers are generally navigable for
                    steamboats to the falls which occur on the great central plateau of the
                    State—that is to say, the Savannah to Augusta, the Oconee and Ocmulgee
                    (confluents of the Altamaha) to Milledgeville and Macon, and the Chattahoochee
                    to Columbus. Besides their ordinary purposes as avenues of travel and commerce,
                    her rivers have given to Georgia the character of a manufacturing State, and she
                    is developing and increasing their abundant water-powers with energy and
                    success.</p>
                <p>The Savannah is formed of two small streams which rise near the North Carolina
                    line, and unite on the boundary between S. Carolina and Georgia in Hart county.
                    Flowing thence in a nearly S.S.E. direction for 450 miles, it enters the
                    Atlantic near 32° N. lat. The Savannah is navigable from November to June. Ships
                    ascend it 18 miles to the city of Savannah, steamboats to Augusta, 230 miles,
                    and by means of a canal around the falls there, constructed in 1845, light
                    draught vessels navigate it 150 miles higher. This canal, 9 miles long,
                    furnishes the water-power of Augusta. The river is here about 300 yards wide.
                    From Augusta the traveller descends the Savannah through the cotton-fields of
                    the table-lands, and the long reaches of semi-tropical vegetation dominated by
                    groves of live oak, to the rich rice plantations of the seaboard.</p>
                <p>The Chattahoochee is one of the largest and most interesting rivers of Georgia.
                    It rises on the declivity of the Blue Ridge, in Habersham county, in the N.E. of
                    the State, pursues a devious S.W. course through the gold region of upper
                    Georgia until it reaches West Point, on the Alabama frontier. It then flows
                    nearly south to the Florida State line, where it is joined by the Flint, when
                    the two streams flow on through Florida to the Gulf under the name of the
                    Appalachicola. Large steamboats ascend the Chattahoochee in the season of
                    navigation to Columbus, 350 miles from the Gulf. The whole estimated length of
                    the river is 550 miles. The falls at Columbus create a valuable water-poλver,
                    constituting that city one of the three important manufacturingcentres of
                    theState. Justabove Columbus the Chattahoochee is broken in picturesque rapids,
                    overlooked by a rocky cliff called the “Lover’s Leap,” which is the subject of
                    an interesting legend. Besides Columbus, the towns of West Point and Fort Gaines
                    are the most important on the Chattahoochee in Georgia; Appalachicola at its
                    embouchure on the Gulf is its shipping and distributing port, but is decreasing
                    in importance since the railway system of the State has assumed a large share of
                    the traffic once confined to the navigable streams.</p>
                <p>The Oconee and Ocmulgee rise near each other, in the N. of the State, flow
                    through its centre to within 100 miles of the sea, when their united streams
                    pass on S.E. to the Atlantic under the name of the Altamaha. Milledgeville, the
                    former capital of Georgia, is on the Oconee, and Macon on the Ocmulgee. Darien
                    on the Altamaha is reached by vessels drawing 11 to 14 feet of water. The
                    Ogeechee, rising also in the north, is about 200 miles long. It drains the
                    country between the Savannah and Altamaha, entering the Atlantic a few miles
                    south of the Savannah. The Ogeechee is navigable for light vessels 30 or 40
                    miles, and for keel-boats to Louisville. The Santilla and St Mary’s drain the
                    south-eastern counties, and are each navigable 30 or 40 miles for sloops. The
                    Flint, Ockloconee, and Suwanee drain the south-westem counties; the Flint is
                    navigable to Albany, 250 miles from the Gulf, for steamboats. The Tallapoosaand
                    Coosa, head-waters of the Alabama, and theHiawassee, one of the sources of the
                    Tennessee, rise in the mountains of Georgia —the last, however, finding its way
                    to the Gulf of Mexico by the Ohio and Mississippi valleys.</p>
                <p>Georgia has about 128 miles of sea-coast,but has few good harbours, except within
                    the rivers emptying upon it. St Mary’s, Brunswick, Darien, and Savannah are the
                    principal. Tlιe chain of islands lying off the mainland produces the celebrated
                    Sea-island cotton, but owing to the changes brought about by the secession war
                    it is now little cultivated. These islands are flat, and generally little
                    elevated above the sea. Cumberland island, one of the most attractive, is nearly
                    30 miles long. It is covered with magnificent forests of oak, and its shores are
                    skirted with palms, <pb break="no"

                    from S. to N. are Jykill, St Simon’s, Sapello, St Catharine’s, Ossabaw, and
                    Cabbage. The Sea Islands, with the main shore, constitute a coast of 480 miles.
                    St Andrew’s, St Simon’s, Altamaha, Doboy, Sapello, St Catharine’s, and Ossabaw
                    are the principal sounds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate, Soil, and Productions.—</hi> The central and southern
                    portions of Georgia, including the seaboard, are subject to excessive heats in
                    summer. At Savannah observations show the mean temperature for July to have
                    sometimes reached 99° Fahr. In the northern district of the State the same
                    season is cooler and less enervating. Indeed, the mountain region is becoming
                    noted for its genial and healthful climate, and is attracting invalids and
                    pleasure seekers from all parts of the Union. In the low marshy lands lying
                    contiguous to or upon the coast, malarious fevers prevail in spring and summer.
                    The belt of country stretching from Augusta across the State to Columbus, having
                    a width of from 30 to 60 miles, is pronounced a very healthy district. At
                    Augusta the mean summer temperature is about 79°, the winter 47°. At Atlanta
                    careful observations give the average of summer heat as 75°, aud winter 45°.
                    Diseases of the respiratory organs are rare among natives of northern and
                    central Georgia. The interior is comparatively free from the dreaded epidemics
                    cholera and yellow fever, but Savannah and the coast are periodically scourged
                    by them.</p>
                <p>There is in Georgia as great diversity of soil as of climate. Beginning with the
                    Sea Islands, which are composed of a sandy alluvium, intermixed with decomposed
                    coral, we pass from the rich alluvions near the coast, in which the great rice
                    plantations are, to the thinner soil of the Pine Belt, sometimes inaptly
                    denominated Pine Barrens. These are at present valuable for their timber and
                    naval stores, but are susceptible of cultivation. The middle region consists cf
                    a red loam, once productive, but from long cultivation impoverished. With the
                    aid of fertilizers it produces cotton, tobacco, and the cereals. We now reach
                    the so-called Cherokee country of the north, containing lands among the most
                    fertile in the State, lands which, notwithstanding their tillage from an unknown
                    period by the aboriginal inhabitants, grow jvheat, corn, Irish potatoes, pease,
                    beans, &lt;fcc., abundantly. Cotton may also be successfully cultivated, but
                    with less advantage than in other districts of the Stated This fibre is chiefly
                    produced along the fertile bottom-lands or contiguous uplands of the rivers. The
                    same lands yield rice, Indian corn, and sugar. Middle and south-west Georgia are
                    the most productive cotton areas. In the southwest the soil, though light and
                    sandy, produces cotton. In southern Georgia there are millions of acres of
                    magnificent yellow pine forests of great value for house or ship-budding, aud in
                    these forests turpentine plantations havebeen opened. The live-oak, also
                    valuable for ship-building purposes, abounds in the south-east of the State. The
                    swamps afford cedar and cypress, the central region oak and hickory. Walnut,
                    chestnut, ash, gum, magnolia, poplar, sycamore, beech, elm, maple, fir, and
                    spruce trees are found in different localities; but in the older settled
                    districts the original forests have disappeared.</p>
                <p>It is frequently said that there is nothing grown in any of the States except
                    Florida that Georgia cannot profitably produce. A few of the tropical fruits of
                    Florida cannot be raised in Georgia, but all those of the temperate zone succeed
                    well. Tobacco may be grown in any part of the State, although it is not
                    extensively cultivated for export. Cotton is the great crop of Georgia. She
                    ranks third among the eight cotton States, having exported or consumed in her
                    own manufactures, for the year ending September 1878, 604,676 bales, worth at
                    the point of export $30,000,000. Of this crop 3608 bales is classed as
                    Seaisland. Her crop for 1877 was 491,800 bales. The counties of Burke,
                    Dougherty, Lee, Monroe, Stewart, Sumter, and Washington yield 25 per cent, of
                    the whole product of the State.</p>
                <p>The emancipation of the slaves in the Southern States has naturally produced
                    great and important changes in the labour system of that section. The planter
                    must now purchase the labour he formerly owned. The black is free to dispose of
                    his labour to the best advantage. The contracts for labour are of three
                    kinds,—for money wages by the month or year, for a share of the crop, or for
                    specific rent in money or products. The first has been practised to a limited
                    extent by the best and most prosperous planters. The share system has been the
                    one generally adopted, because the blacks greatly affected quasi-proprietorship
                    ot the soil, and because the owners were inexperienced in the management of free
                    labour, and not inclined to come personally in contact with it. The share varies
                    in different localities, but usually one-third to half the crop goes to the
                    labourers, the landlords furnishing the necessary tools. The readjustment of
                    labour in the south is watched with the keenest interest in other sections of
                    the Union as one of the difficult problems growing out of the suddenly changed
                    relation between white and black; and though some traces of his original
                    servitude remain a cause of irritation between North and South, the agreement
                    between the enfranchised black and his late master is likely to be harmonious,
                    where each is so dependent on.the other as is the case in the cotton-growing
                    States of the Union.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Statistics.</hi> —A carefully tabulated statement shows that,
                    in addition to her cotton crop, Georgia produced, in 1876, 23,629,000 bushels of
                    Indian corn, valued at §14,172,000; 2,840,000 bushels of wheat, worth
                    $3,805,600; 5,700,000 bushels of oats, worth $3,876,000; and 23,600 tons of hay,
                    worth $347,628. To these principal cτoj&gt;s should be added the timber and
                    naval stores exported from Atlantic outports. In January 1877 there were in
                    Georgia 118,300 horses, 404,900 oxen and other cattle, 96,200 mules, 270,400
                    milch cows, 378,600 sheep, and 1,483,100 swine, having a total valuation of
                    $30,815,117. The State is admirably adapted for stock-raising, but, as cotton
                    culture offers the quickest returns, it has hitherto engrossed the attention of
                    planters and farmers. The grain and root crops are largely cultivated for the
                    support of the agricultural population.</p>
                <p>The rice crop of Georgia in 1870 was 22,277,380 îb; tobacco, 288,596 1b;
                    molasses, 553,192 gals.; wine, 21,927 gals.; sugar, 644 hhds; sweet potatoes,
                    2,621,562 bush.; Irish potatoes, 197,101 bush.; butter, 4,499,572 tó; honey,
                    610,877 lb; wool, 846,947 lb, increased in 1878 to about 1,000,0001b. The latest
                    official census shows that 6,831,856 acres, valued at $94,559,468, are improved
                    in farms; value of farm implements and machinery, $4,614,701; estimated value of
                    all farm products, $80,390,228; estimated value of manufactured products,
                    $31,196,115. The total valuation of the State in 1870 was $268,169,207, against
                    $645,895,237 in 1860. The decrease is owing to the emancipation of the slaves;
                    but the State is steadily gaining ground in increased acreage cultivated,
                    increased number and value of manufactories, and increased productive capacity
                    everywhere.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mineral</hi><hi rend="italic">products.—</hi> Georgia was
                    perhaps the El Dorado of which the Spaniards who invaded Florida were in search.
                    Before the gold discovery in California, the “placers” of northern Georgia were
                    profitably worked for many years; but since 1852 their produce has almost wholly
                    ceased. The gold-bearing region is comprised in the counties of Lumpkin,
                    Habersham, Forsyth, and Hall,—the precious metal being found in the alluvial
                    deposits of the streams, and also intermixed with the quartz rock of the hills.
                    A branch mint was established by the Government at Dahlonega, the shire town of
                    Lumpkin county. In 1853 it coined gold bullion of nearly half a million dollars’
                    value; but, as in California, the placers, or surface deposits, have become
                    exhausted. Besides this precious metal, Georgia contains, mainly in N.E. or
                    Cherokee Georgia, coal and fossiliferous iron ore distributed along the ridges
                    between the Tennessee and Alabama border. The Cohutta mountains contain copper,
                    and also silver and lead ores. Iron ore, manganese, slate, baryta, and brown
                    haematite are found on the western declivity of this range. Between the Cohutta
                    mountains and the Blue Ridge is a vein of marble, and adjacent to it are the
                    gold-bearing schists, which reappear on the south side of the Blue Ridge. Other
                    minerals are granite, gypsum, limestone, sienite, marl, burrstone, soapstone,
                    asbestos, shales, tripoli, fluor-spar, kaolin, porcelain clay, arragonite,
                    tourmaline, emerald, carnelian, ruby, opal, calcedony, agate, amethyst, jasper,
                    garnets, schorl, zircon, rose-quartz, béryl, and even diamonds.</p>

                    gives a population of 1,184,709 souls, 638,926 being white and 545,142, or
                    nearly one half, black. This population is distributed among 136 counties, which
                    include 8 cities and 134 incorporated towns. Georgia, which ranks tenth in area,
                    is the twelfth of the Union in respect to population. Though showing an increase
                    of 127,423 persons in the previous decade, which embraced the period of the war
                    with the North, she has fallen behind one in her rank; but indications of
                    prosperity in her agricultural and manufacturing interests warrant the belief
                    that Georgia will show a marked gain in 1880. A large proportion of this
                    anticipated increase may be confidently assigned to the northern section of the
                    State, though the middle section is at present most thickly settled.</p>

                    >—</hi> Georgia has no large cities. Savannah, the chief sea-port, has a
                    population of about 30,000; Atlanta, the capital, 35,000; Augusta, 23,768;
                    Macon, 10,810; Columbus, 7401; Athens, 4251; Milledgeville, 2750; and Rome,
                    2748. The important towns are Albany, Americus, Bainbridge, Brunswick,
                    Cartersville, Covington, Cuthbert, Dalton, Dawson, Eatonton, Fort Valley,
                    Griffin, La Grange, Marietta, Newnan, Thomasville, Valdosta, Washington, and
                    West Point. Columbus, Americus, Atlanta, and Rome, as well as Savannah, are
                    considerable shipping points, for cotton; Athens is the seat of the university
                    of Georgia; Augusta and Columbus are manufacturing centres; Macon has three
                    religious colleges; Darien, Brunswick, and St Mary’s manufacture and export
                    lumber. Andersonville, in Sumter county, acquired terrible celebrity during the
                    civil war as the site of the chief military prison of the Southern Confederacy.
                    Atlanta is by far the best example of rapid growth the State affords. From a
                    population of 21,189 exhibited by the census of 1870 the city advanced to 35,000
                    in 1876. It is a railway and manufacturing centre. In the vicinity and for its
                    possession were conducted some of the most important military operations of the
                    secession war.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> Georgia is the foremost southern State in
                    her railway and manufacturing enterprises. Both have been chiefly developed
                    since the war, from which everything in the south of the Union dates. Her rivers
                    and railways afforα, abundant facilities for the movement of merchandise as well
                    as crops. Her streams also provide excellent and unfailing water-power. In the
                    development of her industries a great future is predicted for Georgia. Indeed
                    some of the more sanguine claim that she is already becoming a formidable rival
                    of New England in the manufacture of cotton and woollen fabrics.</p>
                <p>There are in the State 38 cotton factories, with 123,233 spindles and 2125 looms.
                    There are 14 woollen factories, with 4200 spindles and 135 looms. Augusta and
                    Columbus take the lead in the number and capacity of these works, for which
                    certain important advantages are claimed. The water-power is so ample that the
                    mills are run by it alone. The streams do not freeze in winter. The cotton and
                    wool are grown at the factory door, saving to the mill-owner the cost of
                    transporting his raw material from a great distance. Labour is cheaper. Finally,
                    the State in order to encourage the investment of foreign capital in
                    manufactures, has by law exempted such capital from taxation for ten years. The
                    product of the Georgia mills finds a ready market in the Southern and Western
                    States. It is asserted on good authority that during the years 1875,1876, and
                    1877—years of unparalleled depression to the manufacturing interests of the
                    United States—the mills of Georgia, especially those of Augusta and Columbus,
                    were never idle, and paid a handsome return on their invested capital. Besides
                    the 52 factories which convert so large a share of her raw product into cloths,
                    there are 1375 grain mills, having 1453 run of stones for corn and 556 for
                    wheat. There are 734 sawmills, 77 waggon and carriage factories, 6
                    iron-furnaces, 7 iron-foundries, 11 limekilns, 4 potteries, 68 tanneries, 6
                    turpentine distilleries, 2 rolling-mills, 5 paper-mills, 12 furniture
                    manufactories, 3 rice-mills, &amp;c. Tlíe manufacture of rope, bagging, twine,
                    tobacco, ice, sashes and blinds, agricultural implements, boilers and machinery,
                    fertilizers, &amp;c., is carried on more or less extensively Besides Augusta and
                    Columbus, the largest manufacturing city of the State, there are cotton
                    factories at Athens, Macon, West Point, Decatur, and Atlanta. The latter city
                    also has large iron works. Thomasville, Dalton, Albany, Marietta, and Rome are
                    also manufacturing points.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> Large vessels can enter only four harbours,
                    viz., Savannah, Darien, Brunswick, and St Mary’s. The inlets or sounds which
                    divide the coast islands from each other or from the mainland are generally only
                    navigable for small craft. At mean low tides the bar of the Savannah (Tybee
                    entrance) has 19, the Altamaha 14, that of St Simon’s sound (entrance to
                    Brunswick) 17, and that of St Mary’s river 14 feet of water. Savannah,
                    Brunswick, and St Mary’s are ports of entry. Cotton and lumber are the principal
                    exports. Of the former 610,419 bales of Upland, and 11,309 of Seaisland were
                    exported during the year ending September 2, 1878. The shipment of wool for the
                    same time was 988,389 lb. These figures should not be taken to represent the
                    crop of the State. The ship-timber, boards, deals, clapboards, &amp;c., are
                    chiefly shipped from the other ports. About 100 vessels, of 22,000 tons burden,
                    are employed in the foreign and coastwise trade. For the year ending December
                    31, 1878, the total tonnage of the port of Savannah was— entered, 280,995 tons
                    foreign and 385,532 coastwise; cleared, 223,885 foreign and 418,958 coastwise;
                    value of imports $505,596, and of exports §24,014,535. In the district of
                    Brunswick and Darien the entries were 124,711 and the clearances 32,579 tons;
                    value of exports $1,030,943. The St Mary’s entries were 16,052 tons foreign and
                    20,065 coastwise; value of exports $120,186, and of imports $1421.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> Atlanta, Columbus, Macon, Albany, and Augusta
                    are railway centres. In 1860 there were in Georgia 1404 miles of completed
                    railway; in 1878 there are 2340 miles. The Atlantic and Gulf Railway crosses the
                    State from Savannah to Bainbridge, in the extreme south-west, on the Flint
                    river. It is 236 miles long, passing through Blackshear, Valdosta, and
                    Thomasville (from which there is a branch line to Albany—58 miles—and Macon),
                    while from Dupont there is a junction with the Florida lines. The Brunswick and
                    Albany also extends from the coast at Brunswick to Albany, 172 miles, whence it
                    is to be continued in a westerly direction to the Chattahoochee, in Early
                    county. A third line connects Brunswick with Macon (187 miles); and another, the
                    Central Georgia, unites Savannah with Macon and Atlanta (294 miles). The Central
                    Georgia works a branch-line from Millen to Augusta; the Milledgeville and
                    Eatenton from Gordon to Eatonton (22 miles); the South-Western from Macon to
                    Eufaula, Ala. (144 miles), with branches from Fort Valley to Columbus (72
                    miles), Smithville to Albany (23⅜ miles), Cuthbert to Fort Gaines (20 miles),
                    Fort Valley to Perry (13 miles), and Albany to Arlington (36 miles); the Macon
                    and Western from Macon to Atlanta; and the Upson County line from Barnesville to
                    Thomaston (16 miles).</p>
                <p>Atlanta is situated on the great iron highways from Boston, New York, and
                    Philadelphia to Mobile and New Orleans, and from Chicago to Florida. The Western
                    and Atlantic connects Atlanta and the Georgia system with the Tennessee lines at
                    Chattanooga (138 miles). Several great battles were fought for the possession of
                    this railway during the secession war. The Atlanta and Charlotte Air Line
                    extends to Charlotte, N.C. (269 miles). The Georgia railway connects Atlanta
                    with Augusta (171 miles), with lateral lines from Carnak to Warrenton (4 miles),
                    Union Point to Athens (40 miles), and Barnet to Washington (18 miles); it also
                    works the Macon and Augusta line from Carnak to Augusta (70 miles). The Atlanta
                    and West Point (80 miles) unites those places. The Alabama and Chattanooga
                    crosses the N. W. corner of the State. The Cherokee extends from Cartersville on
                    the Western and Atlantic to Rockmart (23 miles). The Columbus and Atlanta,
                    projected between Columbus and Rome, the Memphis branch (Rome to Decatur, Ala.),
                    and Savannah, Griffin, and N. Alabama, from Griffin to Newnan, to be extended to
                    Guntersville, Ala., are in progress. The Georgia Southern extends from Dalton to
                    the Ala. State line (portion of Selma, Rome, and Dalton road); North-Eastern
                    from Athens to Lulah (39 miles); Ocmulgee and Horse Creek (7 miles); Rome
                    Railroad, Rome to Kingston (20 miles). I</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi> The executive power is vested in a governor
                    elected for four years by a majority of the people. If there is no election by
                    the people, the general assembly chooses one of the two receiving the highest
                    number of votes. The legislative authority is conferred upon a senate, members
                    of which are elected for four years, and a house of representatives elected for
                    two years. The legislature holds annual sessions, beginning on the second
                    Wednesday of January. The State judiciary consists of a supreme court of three
                    judges, who hold office for twelve years, one retiring every four years, and of
                    inferior courts, presided over by nineteen judges, appointed by the executive
                    with the consent of the senate. Except jn probate cases, these courtshave
                    original jurisdiction, civil and criminal, in law and equity. County courts are
                    established in most of the counties. There is an ordinary for each county

                    State now forbids slavery or involuntary servitude except for the punishment of
                    crime. Imprisonment for debt, and legislation affecting the free exercise of
                    that personal liberty guaranteed to the citizen by the amendments to the
                    constitution of the United States, are also prohibited. All male inhabitants
                    between eighteen and forty-five are subject to military duty. There is a
                    homestead exemption of §2000 on real and $1000 on personal property, except for
                    taxes, for money borrowed or expended on the homestead, or for labour or
                    materials used upon it. The property held by a married woman at the time of
                    marriage, or subsequently inherited or acquired by her, is not liable for the
                    husband’s debts. A married woman may also sue and be sued in matters pertaining
                    to her separate estate, and may carry on trade as if single. Georgia is entitled
                    to seven representatives and two senators in Congress.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> Previous to the war, there was no common
                    school system in Georgia. Although a plan of public instruction was organized at
                    an earlier date, it was not given effect to until 1873. In that year the schools
                    were put in working condition, and are now to be found in every county of the
                    State. The attendance in 1876 was —whites 121,418, coloured 57,987, showing a
                    small but steady increase for the three years the schools had been in operation.
                    It is computed by the school commission at 200,000 for 1879. The higher branches
                    of education are well represented. As early as 1801 steps for founding a
                    university were taken at Athens. The first commencement took place in 1804. The
                    college proper (Franklin College at Athens) annually admits free of charge
                    “fifty meritorious young men of limited means,” and also such as may be studying
                    for the ministry who need aid. There is also connected with the university a
                    medical college, located at Augusta, and an agricultural college at Dahlonega,
                    with nearly 250 students, whose tuition is free. The State college of
                    agriculture and mechanic arts, also connected with the university, has a special
                    endowment derived from the United States of $240,000; the whole endowment of the
                    university is $376,500. The university, exclusive of its establishments at
                    Augusta and Dahlonega, has five departments, 13 professors, and 200 students,
                    with a library of 14,000 volumes, and two literary societies. Besides the usual
                    collegiate course, there are a preparatory school and a law school. Mercer
                    College, at Macon, is a Baptist institution. It was founded in 1838; and until
                    1870 it was located at Penfield, in Greene county. It has an endowment of
                    $160,000, a library of 12,000 volumes, and about 135 students. Besides the
                    regular academic course, there are schools of law and theology. The high schools
                    at Penfield and Dalton are connected with this college. Emory College at Oxford,
                    Newton county, was chartered in 1836. It is the property of the Georgia and
                    Florida conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church (South). The present
                    number of students is 156. Emory has a valuable college apparatus and a good
                    working library, but lacks an endowment. The Wesleyan Female College at Macon
                    was one of the first female colleges, if not the first, in the world, its
                    charter having been granted in 1836. It has 200 students, and is the property of
                    the Methodist denomination. Since 1840 degrees have been conferred upon 1080
                    graduates. The Southern Masonic Female College at Covington belongs to the Grand
                    Lodge of Georgia, and is designed to educate female orphans of freemasons. Pio
                    Nono College at Macon is a recently established Catholic institution, chiefly
                    founded by the efforts of the bishop of Savannah. The Atlanta University for the
                    education of negroes was established by the now extinct Freedmen’s Bureau and
                    various charitable societies of the Northern States. It receives an annual
                    appropriation from the Georgia legislature of $8000. It accommodates 240 pupils.
                    There are a number of institutions, in addition to those enumerated, that are
                    entitled colleges, but come more properly within the designation of high
                    schools. There are also institutions for the blind (at Macon), and for the deaf
                    and dumb (near Rome).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Objects of Interest—</hi> Perhaps the most beautiful scenery in
                    Georgia is to be found in the mountain region traversed by the Air Line railway.
                    About 2j miles from the town of Toccoa the creek of that name falls 185 feet
                    over a precipice. Fifteen miles beyond Toccoa are the cascades of Tallulah,
                    where the river descends successive terraces of broken rock between the walls of
                    a chasm 800 feet deep. In this vicinity are the charming valley of Nacoochee and
                    Mount Yonah. In the extreme north-east is Rabun gap and the cascades of
                    Eastatoia. Connected with this region, once the huntinggrounds of the warlike
                    Cherokees, are many Indian legends. I he country between Atlanta and Chattanooga
                    is deeply interesting from having been the battle-ground of opposing armies in
                    the civil war. Kenesaw mountain, itself the scene of a bloody encounter,
                    commands a view of the country which for two months the Confederate commanders
                    disputed foot by foot. Stone mountain, 9 miles from Decatur, is much visited.
                    The Chattahoochee, in the neighbourhood of Columbus, is picturesque; and
                    Savannah is one of the most attractive and idiosyncratic cities of the Union.
                    There are numerous mineral springs scattered over the State, which are much
                    resorted to by invalids.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Before the arrival of Europeans the country now
                    embraced in Georgia was inhabited by the Cherokee and Creek Indians. The
                    Cherokees possessed the north, the Creeks the south. Both were very powerful and
                    warlike, the Cherokees numbering 6000 warriors, and having 64 towns and
                    villages. To be more precise, the Cherokee country extended from the 34th
                    parallel north to the country of the Six Nations, and from the heads of the
                    rivers emptying upon the South Carolina coast westward to the Mississippi. The
                    whole course of the Tennessee was within this magnificent domain, now mostly
                    embraced in the four States of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. In
                    1729 this extensive territory was surrendered by treaty to the crown of Great
                    Britain. The follow’ing year the Cherokees made formal submission to Sir A.
                    Cuming, Bart.</p>
                <p>Georgia was the only one of the original thirteen colonies that received any aid
                    in its settlement from the Government of England. General James Oglethorpe
                    conceived and executed the plan of founding an English colony in that portion of
                    the Carolina proprietaries’ grant between the Savannah and Altamaha. His purpose
                    was to create an asylum in the New World where insolvent debtors, and persons
                    fleeing from religious persecution, might begin life anew or enjoy religious
                    freedom. By royal letters-patent issued in June 1732 the proposed colony was
                    called Georgia in honour of the reigning prince; and the House of Commons
                    granted £10,000, which was soon increased by private subscription to £36,000.
                    Under the charter the trustees had powers of legislation, but could receive no
                    reward for their services. Even grants of land to themselves were forbidden.</p>
                <p>With 116 emigrants Oglethorpe sailed from England in November 1732, arriving in
                    the Savannah in February. He landed at the present site of Savannah, where he
                    was soon after hospitably received by delegates from the Lower Creeks, who
                    consented that the English might peaceably inhabit among them. The next year a
                    small number of Bavarians came over, and were settled in what is now Effingham
                    county. Oglethorpe also established settlements at Darien, at Augusta, and on St
                    Simon’s island. In 1736 the colony received considerable accessions of
                    emigrants, with whom came John and Charles Wesley, the founders of Methodism. In
                    1738 the Rev. George Whitefield visited Georgia, founding the orphan-house at
                    Bethseda, near Savannah, from funds chiefly collected on his tour in the
                    northern colonies.</p>
                <p>Anticipating invasion by the Spaniards of Florida, who claimed Georgia,
                    Oglethorpe, on the renewal of war between England and Spain, led an expedition
                    to St Augustine, Florida, which he besieged without success at the head of 2000
                    men. The Spaniards retaliated by landing in 1742 a small force on St Simon’s
                    island, from which they were expelled by Oglethorpe. They then abandoned further
                    attempts. Slavery was introduced into Georgia about 1750. In 1752 the trustees
                    surrendered their privileges to the crown. A royal governor and council were
                    appointed to administer, in conjunction with delegates of the people, the
                    government of the province. During the French and Indian wars the remote
                    settlements suffered somewhat from incursions of the Cherokees. The treaties of
                    1763 with France and Spain extended the boundaries of Georgia to the Mississippi
                    on the W., and to St Mary’s on the S. After this the colony flourished greatly
                    until the breaking <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n453/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0453-0438"/> out of war with England, at which time the colony
                    was estimated to have a population of about 70,000 souls. In 1775 Sir James
                    Wright, the crown governor, left the province. Delegates were sent to represent
                    Georgia in the continental congress who signed the Declaration of Independence.
                    In 1778 a British land and naval force occupied Savannah and Augusta, but were
                    subsequently compelled to abandon the latter place. In September of the same
                    year a combined American and Frenclι force, under Lincoln and D’Estaing,
                    unsuccessfully attempted the recovery of Savannah, losing nearly 1000 men in an
                    assault. Augusta was reoccupied by the conquerors. Charleston being surrendered
                    by General Lincoln in 1780, the patriots of South Carolina and Georgia were only
                    able to maintain a partisan warfare, until the advance of General Greene from
                    the north, at the head of considerable forces, resulted in the expulsion of the
                    royal troops from those provinces. Georgia at the conclusion of peace ratified
                    the several Acts constituting her one of the United States of America. She
                    framed her first constitution in 1777, a second in 1789, and a third (which has
                    been several times amended) in 1798.</p>
                <p>In 1803 Georgia ceded to the general government all her territory west of the
                    Chattahoochee, amounting to nearly 100,000 square miles, out of which the States
                    of Alabama and Mississippi were subsequently formed. The cession of Louisiana to
                    the United States was of great benefit to Georgia in ending hostilities which
                    the Spaniards were continually inciting the Indians to commit upon the scattered
                    settlements. By a treaty with the Creeks, Georgia became possessed of a large
                    tract in the south-west of the State. The second war with England (1812-15)
                    involved Georgia in hostilities with the Indians on her western border, who were
                    finally subdued by General Andrew Jackson. In 1821 the cession of Florida to the
                    United States relieved Georgia from the long series of Spanish aggressions
                    beginning with her existence as a colony.</p>
                <p>In 1825 a serious difficulty arose between the State and national authorities in
                    consequence of proceedings by the Georgia executive to extinguish the title to
                    lands in the State held by the Creeks and Cherokees. The head chief of the
                    Creeks, M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Intosh, was assassinated by his people
                    foi signing away these lands to the whites. By an Act of Congress passed in
                    1830, these Indians were subsequently removed to the Indian territory west of
                    the Mississippi.</p>
                <p>Georgia formally seceded from the Union in January 1861. The Government forts and
                    arsenals were seized. The first military operations were on the coast. In April
                    1862 Fort Pulaski, one of the defences of Savannah, was recaptured by the
                    Federal forces under Com. Du Pont. St Mary’s, Brunswick, Darien, and St Simon’s
                    island were also occupied.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of 1863 the Federal forces were in possession of middle and west
                    Tennessee. In September they occupied Chattanooga in strong force, the
                    Confederates falling back by the Western and Atlantic Railway to Lafayette, Ga.
                    A further advance by General Rosecrans, the Federal commander, brought on the
                    severely contested battle of Chickamauga, on the creek of that name (September
                    20). The Fédérais retreated to Chattanooga, which was soon threatened by the
                    Confederates under Bragg. In November the Union army under General Grant drove
                    Bragg from all his positions. In the spring of 1864 the southern army was at
                    Dalton, Ga., on the railway to Atlanta, which it covered. In May General Sherman
                    moved forward against this force a numerous and well-appointed Union army.
                    Severe battles took place at Resaca, Kingston, and Allatoona Pass. A series of
                    strategical movements, signalized by frequent bloody conflicts between the rival
                    armies, resulted in the possession of Atlanta by the Union forces, September 2.
                    From this point Sherman began in November hit memorable march across Georgia to
                    the sea. On December 10th he arrived in the neighbourhood of Savannah, captured
                    Fort M ’ Allister by assault, and occupied the city on the 21st. A cavalry force
                    under General Wilson entered Georgia from Alabama in April 1865, capturing
                    Columbus, West Point, and Macon, and making Davis, the Confederate States
                    president, prisoner. In June 1865 a provisional governor was appointed for the
                    State by the president of the United States. A convention assembled in October
                    at Milledgeville, which repealed the ordinance of secession, abolished slavery,
                    and declared the war debt void. A new constitution was framed and ratified in
                    1868, and Rufus B. Bullock inaugurated as governor. The restoration of civil
                    government under the new forms was not effected in Georgia without complications
                    which retarded its re-establishment on a solid foundation, but the amendments to
                    the national constitution were at length adopted, and her senators and
                    representatives were admitted to seats in Congress in December 1870. During the
                    war Georgia furnished about 80,000 soldiers for the Confederate armies. She
                    emerged from it with her industries prostrated, her treasury empty, her social
                    and political system revolutionized, her most flourishing cities in ruins. Her
                    great natural resources are fast advancing her to a commanding position among
                    her sister States; and these resources are developing in the hands of a free
                    people with greater rapidity and advantage than when half the population was
                    enslaved. Texas possibly excepted, no southern State has a greater future than
                    Georgia.</p>
