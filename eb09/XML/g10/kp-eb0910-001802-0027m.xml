                    periods in the history of Galatia. The river Halys flowed in a northerly
                    direction through the centre of the province, the eastern half of which was
                    watered by tributaries of that stream, while the Sangarius and its affluents
                    traversed the western half.</p>
                <p>Galatia originally formed a part of the extensive province of Phrygia; after its
                    separation it was occupied by three Gallic tribes, who still continued distinct
                    in the time of Strabo—the Trocmi, who dwelt in the east, the Tectosages in the
                    centre, and the Tolistobogii in the west. Each of these tribes was subdivided
                    into four parts, and these were ruled over each by a tetrarch of its own. The
                    power of the tetrarchs was limited by a senate of 300, before which <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0028-0019"/> also all capital cases were tried. Minor offences
                    came under the cognizance of the tetrarchs and special judges appointed by them.
                    The three tribes all spoke the same tongue; and though in course of time they
                    became Hellenized, their original language was still in use among them as late
                    as the time of Jerome.</p>
                <p>The physical characters of Galatia are in great measure similar to those of the
                    adjoining provinces of Phrygia and Lycaonia, the whole region being an elevated
                    plateau or table-land, no part of which is less than 2000 feet above the sea,
                    while the greater part exceeds 3000 feet in elevation. The southern portion,
                    towards Lycaonia, is the most level, and is an alm03t perfect plain, passing
                    gradually into the expanse of salt desert which occupies the frontier lands of
                    the two provinces. The rest of the country consists for the most part of vast
                    undulating downs, affording excellent pasture for sheep and goats, and capable
                    of producing good crops of corn, though at present in great part uncultivated,
                    and almost wholly devoid of wood. Towards the frontiers of Bithynia it becomes
                    more broken, and is intersected by numerous valleys, as well as by several
                    detached ranges of hills, none of them, however, attaining to any considerable
                    height or importance. The lofty range of the Ala-dagh (6000-7000 feet), though
                    frequently termed the Galatian Olympus, is not properly included within the
                    limits of the province, but forms in part the natural boundary which separates
                    it from Bithynia, From its elevated position, the climate of Galatia is
                    naturally one of considerable extremes of heat and cold; and while the summers
                    are burning hot, the winters at Angora are more severe than at Paris, and the
                    snow often lies on the ground for a month together.</p>
                <p>The only towns of importance in Galatia were Tavium, the capital of the Trocmi, a
                    small town which speedily fell into decay; Ancyra, the capital of the
                    Tectosages, which under the Romans became the capital of the country, and has
                    ever since retained its importance as one of the principal citiee of Asia Minor
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Angora)</hi>; and Pessinus, the chief town of the
                    Tolistobogii, where a splendid temple was consecrated to Agdistis, the mother of
                    the gods, the divinity who was worshipped at Rome under the title of Rhea or
                    Cybele.</p>
                <p>Galatia took its name from a body of Gauls who invaded Asia Minor about the year
                    277 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> They had formed part of the army which
                    invaded Greece under Brennus, but having quarrelled with that commander, had
                    left his standard, and marching into Thrace under generals of their own choice,
                    advanced to Byzantium, whence they were invited by Nicomedes, king of Bithynia,
                    to cross into Asia, and help him in his struggle against his brother Zipøetes.
                    After performing the required services, they turned their arms against their
                    employer, and ravaged the western half of Asia Minor. Their success allured
                    other hordes of their countrymen, who readily took service with the Asiatic
                    kings in their ware against each other. No Oriental prince was found able to
                    check them, until Attalus, king of Pergamus, defeated them in a great battle,
                    239 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c., and compelled them to settle in that part
                    of the country which after them was called Galatia. They still remained
                    independent, however, and proved a formidable foe to the Romans in their ware
                    with Antiochus. It was found necessary to direct a special army against them,
                    under Cn. Manlius, and the result of the campaign (189 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> was their complete subjugation to the power of Rome. Galatia was not
                    at this time reduced to a Roman province, but the Gauls were still allowed to
                    retain their own government under their tetrarchs. This system, however,
                    gradually gave way, and the whole country passed under the authority of one
                    ruler. The first of these sole tetrarchs was Dciotarus, a contemporary of Cicero
                    and Caesar, who, in return for the assistance which he gave the Romans in their
                    wars against Mithridates, was rewarded with a part of Pontus and Armenia Minor,
                    and was styled king by the senate. It was afterwards united with Lycaonia,
                    Isauria, and several adjoining districts, under a king named Amyntas, at whose
                    death, in 25 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Galatia became a Roman province.
                    Theodosius the Great subdivided it for purposes of government into Galatia
                    Prima, of which Ancyra was the capital, and Galatia Secunda, with Pessinus for
                    its chief town.</p>
                <p>The antiquities of Galatia have in recent times been made the subject of special
                    investigation by a French commission composed of MM. Perrot, Guillaume, and
                    Delbet, and the result of their labours published in 2 vols, fol., Paris, 1872;
                    but with the exception of those of Angora, they are not of much general
                    interest.</p>
