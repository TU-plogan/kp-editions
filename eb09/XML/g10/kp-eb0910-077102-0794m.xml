                    canon law to the university of Salamanca, he soon took a prominent place among
                    his fellowstudents; but the great talent which he exhibited did not point in the
                    direction either of legal or of diplomatic employments. Leaving the university
                    some years afterwards (the exact date is unknown) without a degree, but already
                    with a considerable literary reputation, he returned to Cordova, where he had
                    succeeded to a moderate property, and where he was able to associate on terms of
                    intimacy and equality with the best society of the city and province. Lope de
                    Vega, writing about 1593, speaks of him as surrounded there by a literary
                    society, and acknowledged as its chief. In 1604, when past his fortieth year, he
                    took the tonsure, and accepted a prebendal stall in the cathedral of
                    Cordova,—steps which have usually been attributed to worldly or sordid motives,
                    but which really cannot be regarded as unnatural or unbecoming in a man
                    circumstanced as he was. From this time he began to spend a portion of each year
                    at the seat of the court, first at Valladolid and afterwards at Madrid, where as
                    Pellicer, his contemporary, remarks, he “noted everything and pecked at
                    everything with his satirical pen.” His circle of literary and other
                    distinguished admirers was now greatly enlarged; but the acknowledgment which
                    the court accorded to his singular genius was both slight and tardy. Ultimately
                    indeed, through the influence of the duke of Lerma and the marquis of Siete
                    Iglesias, he obtained an appointment as honorary chaplain to Philip III., but
                    even this slight honour he was not permitted long to wear. A severe illness,
                    which had seriously impaired his memory, compelled his retirement to Cordova,
                    where, after a period of deep seclusion, he peacefully breathed his last on the
                    23d of May 1627. An edition of his poems was published almost immediately after
                    his death by Juan Lopez de Vicuna; but the frequently reprinted edition by Hozes
                    did not appear till 1633. The collection consists of numerous sonnets, heroical,
                    amorous, satirical, humorous, elegiac, and “miscellaneous,” of various odes,
                    ballads, songs for the guitar, of a few uncompleted comedies, and of certain
                    larger poems, such as the <hi rend="italic">Soledades</hi> (“Solitary Musings”)
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Polifemo,</hi> which hardly admit of classi fication.
                    They all exhibit that learned and polished elaboration of style (estilo culto)
                    with which the name of Gôngora is inseparably associated; but if, since the days
                    of Lope de Vega, they have been justly censured for their affected Latinisms,
                    unnatural transpositions, strained metaphors, and frequent obscurity, it must
                    never be forgotten that their author was a man of genius,—a fact cordially
                    acknowledged by those of his contemporaries who were most capable of judging,
                    and indeed a fact capable of direct verification by any one who chooses to take
                    the trouble of reading him even in an imperfect translation. It was only in the
                    hands of those who served themselves heirs to Gôngora’s style, without
                    inheriting his genius, that “cul-tismo” became really laughable; but it is
                    manifestly unjust to charge the memory of the master with the follies of his
                    weaker disciples.</p>
