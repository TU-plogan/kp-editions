                    (gigant).</hi> The idea conveyed by the word in classic mythology is that of
                    beings more or less manlike, but monstrous in size and strength. Figures like
                    the Titans and the Giants whose birth from Heaven and Earth is sung by Hesiod in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Theogony,</hi> such as can heap up mountains to scale the
                    sky, and war beside or against the gods, must be treated, with other like
                    monstrous figures of the wonder-tales of the world, as belonging altogether to
                    the realms of mythology. But there also appear in the legends of giants some
                    with historic significance. The ancient and commonly-repeated explanation of the
                    Greek word γiγας, as connected with or derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >γηγενής,</hi> or “earth-born,” seems by no means sound as a matter of
                    etymology, but at any rate the idea conveyed by it was familiar to the ancient
                    Greeks, that the giants were earth-born or indigenous races (see Weicker, <hi
                    rend="italic">Griechische Götterlehre,</hi> vol. i. p. 787). The Bible (the
                    English reader must be cautioned that the word giant has been there used
                    ambiguously, from the Septuagint downwards) touches the present matter in so far
                    as it records the traditions of the Israelites of fighting in Palestine with
                    tall races of the land such as the Anakiιn (Numb. xiii. 33; Deut. ii. 10, iii.
                    11; 1 Sam. xvii. 4). When reading in Homer of “the Cyclopes and the wild tribes
                    of the Giants,” or of the adventures of Odysseus in the cave of Polyphemus
                    (Homer, <hi rend="italic">Odyss.,</hi> vii. 206; ix.), we seem to come into view
                    of dim traditions, exaggerated through the mist of ages, of pre-Hellenic
                    barbarians, godless, cannibal, skin-clothed, hurling huge stones in their rude
                    warfare. Giant-legends of this class are common in Europe and Asia, where the
                    big and stupid giants have often every token of uncouth native barbarians,
                    exaggerated into monsters in the legends of the later tribes who dispossessed
                    and slew them.</p>
                <p>Besides the conception of giants as special races distinct from mankind, it was a
                    common opinion of the ancients that the human race had itself degenerated, the
                    men of primeval ages having been of so far greater stature and strength as to be
                    in fact gigantic. This, for example, is received by Pliny <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hist. Nat.,</hi> vii, c. 16), and it becomes a common doctrine of theologians
                    such as Augustine <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Civitate</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Dei,</hi> XV. 9), lasting on into times so modern that it may be
                    found in Cruden’s <hi rend="italic">Concordance.</hi> Yet so far as can be
                    judged from actual remains, it does not appear that giants, in the sense of
                    tribes of altogether superhuman stature, ever existed, or that the men of
                    ancient time were on the whole taller than those now living. It is now usual to
                    apply the word giant to beings not superhuman in their height, but merely the
                    tallest men and women of our nations. In every race of mankind the great mass of
                    individuals do not depart far from a certain mean or average height, while the
                    very tall or very short men become less and less numerous as they depart from
                    the mean standard, till the utmost divergence is reached in a very few giants on
                    the one hand, and a very few dwarfs on the other. At both ends of the scale, the
                    body is markedly out of the ordinary proportions; thus a giant’s head is smaller
                    and a dwarf’s head larger than it would be if an average man had been magnified
                    or diminished. The principle of the distribution of individuals of different
                    sizes in a race or nation has been ably set forth by Quetelet <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Physique</hi><hi rend="italic">Sociale,</hi> vol. ii.; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anthropométrie,</hi> books iii. and iv.). Had this principle been understood
                    formerly, we might have been spared the pains of criticizing assertions as to
                    giants 20 feet high, or even more, appearing among mankind. The appearance of an
                    individual man 20 feet high involves the existence of the race he is an extreme
                    member of, whose mean stature would be at least 12 to 14 feet, which is a height
                    no human being has been proved on sufficient evidence to have approached <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anthropom.,</hi> p. 302). In fact, Quetelet considers the tallest
                    man whose stature has been authentically recorded to have been Frederick the
                    Great’s Scottish giant, who was not quite 8 feet 3 inches. Modern statisticians,
                    though admitting that this may not be the extreme limit of human stature, cannot
                    accept the loose conclusion in Buffon <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Nat..</hi> ed.
                    Sonnini, vol. iv. p. 134), that there is no doubt of giants having been 10, 12,
                    and perhaps 15 feet high. Confidence is not even to be placed in ancient
                    asserted measurements, as where Pliny gives to one Gabbaras, an Arabian, the
                    stature of 9 feet 9 inches (about 9 feet 5⅜ in. English), capping this with the
                    mention of Posio and Sec-undilla, who were half a foot higher. That two persons
                    should be described as both having this same extraordinary measure suggests to
                    the modern critic the notion of a note jotted down on the philosopher’s tablets,
                    and never tested afterwards.</p>
                <p>Under these circumstances, it is worth while to ask how it is that legend and
                    history so abound in mentions of giants outside all probable dimensions of the
                    human frame. Ore cause is that, when the story-teller is asked the actual
                    stature cf the huge men who figure in his tales, he is not sparing of his inches
                    and feet. What exaggeration can do in this way may be judged from the fact that
                    the Patagonians, whose average height (5 feet 11 inches) is really about that of
                    the Chirnside men in Berwickshire, are described in Pigafetta’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Voyage round the World</hi> as so monstrous that the Spaniards’
                    heads hardly reached their waists. It is reasonable to suppose, with Professor
                    Nilsson <hi rend="italic">(Primitive Inhabitants of Scandinavia,</hi> chap,
                    vi.), that in the traditions of early Europe tribes of savages may have thus, if
                    really tall, expanded into giants, or, if short, dwindled into dwarfs. Another
                    cause which is clearly proved to have given rise to giant-myths of yet more
                    monstrous type, has been the discovery of great fossil bones, as of mammoth or
                    mastodon, which have from early ages been supposed to be bones of giants, and
                    have given rise to a whole class of giant-myths (see Tylor, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Early History of Mankind,</hi> chap. xi.; <hi rend="italic">Primitive
                    Culture,</hi> chap. x.). Such anatomical inferences from the leg-bone or tooth
                    of some <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n589/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0589-0572"/> huge extinct animal are rather creditable to the
                    ingenuity of natives of America, or of barbarians of the Old World; but their
                    late continuance in the midst of European culture shows how recently the
                    principles of comparative anatomy obtained their present hold on the public
                    mind. A tooth weighing 4∣ ft&gt;, and a thigh-bone 17 feet long, having been
                    found in New England in 1712 (they were probably mastodon), Dr Increase Mather
                    thereupon communicated to the Royal Society of London his confirmation from them
                    of the existence of men of prodigious stature in the antediluvian world (see the
                    <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> vol. xxiv, p. 85; D. Wilson,
                    <hi rend="italic">Prehistoric Man,</hi> vol. i. p. 54). The giants in the
                    streets of Basel and supporting the arms of Lucerne appear to have originated
                    from certain fossil bones found in 1577, examined by the physician Felix Plater,
                    and pronounced to have belonged to a giant some 16 or 19 feet high. These bones
                    have since been referred to a very different geological genus, but within the
                    present century Plater’s giant skeleton was accepted as a genuine relic of the
                    giants who once inhabited the earth. See the dissertation of Le Cat, cited in
                    the 5th edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi> (1817).
