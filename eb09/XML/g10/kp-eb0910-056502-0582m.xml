                    (c. 1220-1289), count of Donoratico and head of the Gherardeschi, one of the
                    leading Ghibelline houses of Pisa, began to take part in public affairs about
                    the time when the dissensions which had arisen about the partition of Sardinia
                    had resulted in sending over the entire clan of the Pisan Visconti to the
                    Guelphs. For having given his sister in marriage to one. of these—Giovanni

                    return in terms of the peace of 1267. Notwithstanding the ambiguous character of
                    his politics, he soon succeeded in gaining a high place in the public service of
                    his native city; and in the battle of Meloria (6th August 1284), which
                    terminated the long war with Genoa, he was one of the three Pisan admirals. It
                    was by his cowardly or traitorous flight at a critical moment, it is said, that
                    the contest was decided in favour of the Genoese; but, be this as it may,
                    whether by means of his treachery, or in spite of it, he almost immediately
                    afterwards (October 1284) was nominated by the citizens who remained to the
                    twofold office of capitano and podestâ for one year; and some months afterwards
                    (February 1285) this term was extended to ten years. In this capacity of virtual
                    dictator lie, by the banishment of ten leading Ghibelline citizens of Pisa,
                    secured peace with the Florentines; he also endeavoured to propitiate the
                    Genoese by the offer cf Castro in Sardinia, and the Lucchese by the actual
                    surrender of Ripafratta and Viarreggio, but unsuccessfully. Meanwhile, though
                    thoroughly alienated from the Ghibellines, he had not succeeded in gaining the
                    confidence of the Guelphs; and in 1287 he was by them compelled to associate
                    with himself in the government Nino Visconti, a nephew by the marriage already
                    referred to, who had now reached manhood. But this arrangement was rendered
                    nugatory by the disagreements of the two colleagues, and Ugolino found it
                    necessary to resign his office in December of the same year. In his unscrupulous
                    ambition after personal ascendency he now turned for support to the party he had
                    so long deserted, and entered into an alliance with the Gualandi, Sismondi,
                    Lanfranchi, and other uncompromising Ghibellines, who looked upon the archbishop
                    Ruggiero degli Ubaldini as their head. But this unnatural combination soon
                    terminated in an open rupture, the immediate occasion of which was the violence
                    of Ugolino, who, on some sudden provocation, had killed a nephew of the
                    archbishop. In August 1288 he was beset in the Palazzo del Popolo by the
                    Ghibellines, and, after fire had been set to the building, taken prisoner, along
                    with his sons Gaddo and Ugoccione, and his grandsons Nino (surnamed Brigatto)
                    and Anselmuccio. (Some accounts mention a third grandson, named Henry.) After
                    having been confined for twenty days in the Palazzo del Comune, they were
                    removed to the Gualandi’s Tower, Alle Sette Vie, afterwards called the Torre
                    della Fame. Here they were kept till March 1289, when, by order of the
                    archbishop, the door was locked and the keys thrown into the Arno. Nine days
                    afterwards the tower was re-entered and the bodies removed to the church of San
                    Francisco.</p>
                <p>The story of Ugolino, though it is to be met with in other contemporary writers
                    (see Villani, vii. cc. 120, 127), owes all its fame to Dante, who has placed him
                    above Ruggiero on the inner margin of the second division (Antenora) of the
                    ninth and lowest circle of his Inferno. Dante’s powerful narrative, which
                    includes “thirty lines unequalled by any other thirty in the whole dominions of
                    poetry” (Landor), has been paraphrased, or rather almost translated, by Chaucer,
                    in the Monk's Tale, and has also been reproduced in modern times by Shelley. It
                    ought to be observed, however, with reference to Ugolino’s alleged treachery,
                    that the baser explanation of his conduct at Meloria is not to be met with in
                    any document earlier than the 16th century; while with regard to the accusation
                    of having sold the fortresses of Pisa to the Lucchese and Florentines, Dante,
                    though evidently himself believing it, does not say more than that he “was
                    alleged” (aveva voce) to have done so.</p>

                <p>Ruggiero’s share in the murder of Ghcrardesca has sometimes been doubted, but on
                    very inadequate grounds. Only in one respect can the poet be fairly accused of
                    having absolutely departed from strict historical accuracy, namely, with regard
                    to the age of the sons and grandsons, who, though represented by him as
                    children, appear to have been all of them grown up. The narrative of Villani has
                    already been referred to; references to other sources may be found in Sisιnondi
                    and in the annotated editions of Dante, particularly in that of “Philalethes”
                    (the late king of Saxony).</p>
