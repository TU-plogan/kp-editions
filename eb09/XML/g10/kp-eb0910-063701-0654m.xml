                    and soon afterwards ordained by that of Dundee as minister of the parish of
                    Tealing (1719). During his ministry there he gradually formed peculiar opinions,
                    which as early as 1725 found expression in the formation of a society “separate
                    from the multitude,” numbering nearly a hundred, and drawn from his own and
                    neighbouring parishes. The members of this <hi rend="italic">ecclesiola
                    in</hi><hi rend="italic">ecclesia</hi> pledged themselves “to join together in
                    the Christian profession, to follow Christ the Lord as the righteousness of His
                    people, to walk together in brotherly love and in the duties of it in subjection
                    to Mr Gias as their overseer in the Lord, to observe the ordinance of the Lord’s
                    Supper once every month, to submit themselves to the Lord’s law for removing
                    offences” (Matth, xviii.), and so on. From the scriptural doctrine of the
                    essentially spiritual and heavenly nature of the kingdom of Christ, Gias in his
                    public teaching drew the conclusions, not only that the church, as being
                    identical with that kingdom, ought to consist of none but truly spiritual
                    Christian men, but also that the civil establishment of the church was unlawful
                    and utterly inconsistent with the spirit of Christianity.<note anchored="true"

                    treatise entitled The Testimony of the King of Martyrs concerning His Kingdom
                    (John xviii. 36, 37) Explained and Illustrated (1729).</p></note> For the
                    promulgation of these views, which were confessedly at variance with the
                    doctrines of the standards of the national Church of Scotland, he was summoned
                    (1726) before his presbytery, where, in the course of the investigations which
                    followed, he affirmed with still more explicitness than formerly his belief that
                    “every national church established by the laws of earthly kingdoms is
                    antichristian in its constitution and persecuting in its spirit,” and further
                    declared opinions upon the subject of church government which amounted to an
                    entire repudiation of Presbyterianism and an acceptance of Independency. For
                    these opinions he was in 1728 suspended from the discharge of ministerial
                    functions, and finally in 1730 deposed; the members of the society already
                    referred to, however, for the most part continued to adhere to him, thus
                    constituting the first “Glassite” or “Glasite” church. The seat of this
                    congregation was shortly afterwards transferred to Dundee, whence Gias
                    subsequently removed to Edinburgh, where he officiated for some time as an
                    “elder.” He next laboured in Perth for a few years, but ultimately returned to
                    Dundee, where the remainder of his life was spent. In 1739 the General Assembly,
                    without any application either from him or from his friends, removed the
                    sentence of deposition which had been passed against him, and restored him to
                    the character and exercise of a minister of the gospel of Christ, though
                    declaring that he was not to be esteemed a minister of the Established Church of
                    Scotland, or eligible for a charge, until he should have renounced the
                    principles embraced and avowed by him that were inconsistent with the
                    constitution of the church. Besides the <hi rend="italic">Testimony</hi> Gias
                    wrote a number of papers, expository, polemical, or practical, which were
                    published in a collected edition at Edinburgh in 1761 (4 vols. 8vo), and again
                    at Perth in 1782 (5 vols. 8vo). He died in 1773.</p>
                <p>The Glassite denomination, which has never been a numerous one, is distinguished
                    by a number of peculiarities alike in doctrine, discipline, and worship, some of
                    which have already been indicated. One of the most characteristic of its tenets
                    is that which owes its elaboration to Robert Sandeman (1718-1771), the
                    son-in-law of Gias, from whom is derived the name of Sandemanians, by which the
                    sect is principally known in England and America. In a series of letters (1757)
                    to Hervey, the author of Theron and Aspasio, he maintained that justifying faith
                    is a simple assent to the divine testimony concerning Jesus Christ, differing in
                    no way in its character from belief in any ordinary human testimony. No
                    distinctive theological system, however, has as yet been elaborated from this
                    point of view. In their practice the Glassite churches aim at a strict
                    conformity with the primitive type of Christianity as that is understood by
                    them. Each congregation has a plurality of elders, pastors, or bishops, who are
                    chosen according to what are believed to be the instructions of Paul, without
                    regard to previous education or present occupation, and who enjoy a perfect
                    equality in office. To have been married a second time disqualifies for
                    ordination, or for continued tenure of the office of bishop. In all the action
                    of the church unanimity is considered to be necessaiy; and if any member differ
                    in opinion from the rest, he must either surrender his judgment to that of the
                    church or be shut out from its communiori. To join in prayer with any one who is
                    not a member of the denomination is regarded as unlawful, and even to eat or
                    drink with one who has been excommunicated is held to be a heinous sin. The
                    Lord’s Supper is observed weekly; and between forenoon and afternoon service
                    every Sunday a love feast, at which it is incumbent on every member to be
                    present, is held after the manner of the primitive Christians. Mutual
                    exhortation is practised at all the meetings for divine service, it being lawful
                    for any member who possesses the gift to speak. The practice of washing one
                    another's feet was at one time observed; and it is still customary for each
                    brother and sister to receive new members, on admission, with a holy kiss.
                    “Things strangled” and “blood” are rigorously abstained from; the lot is
                    regarded as sacred; the accumulation of wealth is regarded as unscriptural and
                    improper, and each member considers his property as liable to be called for at
                    any time to meet the wants of the poor and the necessities of the church. The
                    number of adherents at present belonging to the denomination is probably a
                    little under 2000.</p>
