                <p><label type="entry">GIBSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1790-1866),
                    sculptor, was born near Conway, in 1790, in very humble circumstances, his
                    father being a market gardener. He is a notable*example of one who, with no
                    so-called start in life, carved his way to distinction by the force of a steady
                    purpose and strong will. To his mother, whom he described as ruling his father
                    and all the family, he owed, like many other great men, the energy and
                    determination which carried him over every obstacle. He narrowly escaped
                    emigration to America, the first step towards which took the family to
                    Liverpool, where his mother’s will interposed to keep them. He was then nine
                    years of age, and was sent to school. The windows of the print shops of
                    Liverpool riveted his attention; and, having no means to purchase the commonest
                    print, he acquired the habit of committing to ocular memory the outline of one
                    figure after another, drawing it on his <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0604-0587"/> return home. Thus early did he form the system of
                    observing, remembering, and noting, sometimes even a month later, scenes and
                    momentary actions from nature—a habit peculiar in that degree to himself, but of
                    the utmost importance to all artists to practice. In this way he, by degrees,
                    transferred from the shop window to his paper at home the chief figures from
                    David’s picture of Napoleon crossing the Alps, which, by particular request, he
                    copied in bright colours as a frontispiece to a little schoolfellow’s new
                    prayer-book, for sixpence. At fourteen years of age Gibson was apprenticed to a
                    firm of cabinetmakers,—portrait and miniature painters in Liverpool requiring a
                    premium which his father could not give. This employment so disgusted him that
                    after a year (being interesting and engaging then apparently as in after life)
                    he persuaded his masters to change his indentures, and bind him to the
                    wood-carving with which their furniture was ornamented. This satisfied him for
                    another year, when an introduction to the foreman of some marble works, and the
                    sight of a small head of Bacchus, unsettled him again. He had here caught a
                    glimpse of his true vocation, and in his leisure hours began to model with such
                    success that his efforts found their way to the notice of Mr Francis, the
                    proprietor of the marble works. The woodcarving now, in turn, became his
                    aversion; and having in vain entreated his masters to set him free, he
                    instituted a strike. He was every day duly at his post, but did no work.
                    Threats, and even a blow, moved him not. At length the offer of £70 from Francis
                    for the rebellious apprentice was accepted, and Gibson found himself at last
                    bound to a master for the art of sculpture. Francis paid the lad 6s. a week, and
                    received good prices for his works,—sundry early works by the youthful sculptor,
                    which exist in Liverpool and the neighbourhood, going by the name of Francis to
                    this day. It was while thus apprenticed that Gibson attracted the notice of Mr
                    Roscoe, whose taste in Greek art seems to have been superior to his judgment in
                    Italian history. For him Gibson executed a basso rilievo in terra cotta, now in
                    the Liverpool Museum. Roscoe opened to the sculptor the treasures of his library
                    at Allerton, by which he became acquainted with the designs of the great Italian
                    masters. A cartoon of the Fall of the Angels marked this period,—now also in the
                    Liverpool Museum. We must pass over his studies in anatomy, pursued gratuitously
                    by the kindness of a medical man, and his introductions to families of
                    refinement and culture in Liverpool. Roscoe was an excellent guide to the young
                    aspirant, pointing to the Greeks as the only examples for a sculptor. Gibson
                    here found his true vocation. A basso rilievo of Psyche carried by the Zephyrs
                    was the result. He sent it to the Royal Academy, where Flaxman, recognizing its
                    merits, gave it an excellent place. Again he became unsettled. The ardent young
                    breast panted for “the great university of Art ”—Rome <hi rend="italic">;
                    and</hi> the first step to the desired goal was to London. Here he stood between
                    the opposite advice and influence of Flaxman and Chantrey—the one urging him to
                    Rome as the highest school of sculpture in the world, the other maintaining that
                    London could do as much for him. It is not difficult to guess which was Gibson’s
                    choice. He arrived in Rome in October 1817, at a comparatively late age for a
                    first visit. There he immediately experienced the charm and goodness of the true
                    Italian character in the person of Canova, to whom he had introductions,—the
                    Venetian putting not only his experience in art but his purse at the English
                    student’s service. Up to this time, though his designs show a fire and power of
                    imagination in which no teaching is missed, Gibson had had no instruction, and
                    had st udied at no Academy. In Rome he first became acquainted with rules and
                    technicalities, in which the merest tyro was before him. Canova introduced him
                    into the Academy supported by Austria, and, as is natural with a mind like
                    Gibson’s, the first sense of his deficiencies in common matters of practice was
                    depressing to him. He saw Italian youths already excelling, as they all do, in
                    the drawing of the figure. But the tables were soon turned. His first work in
                    marble—a Sleeping Shepherd modelled from a beautiful Italian boy—has qualities
                    of the highest order. Gibson was soon launched, and distinguished patrons, first
                    sent by Canova, made their way to his studio in the Via Fontanella. His aim,
                    from the first day that he felt the power of the antique, was purity of
                    character and beauty of form. He very seldom declined into the prettiness of
                    Canova, and if he did not often approach the masculine strength which redeems
                    the faults of Thorwaldsen, he more than once surpassed him even in that quality.
                    We allude specially to his Hunter and Dog, and to the grand promise of hi3
                    Theseus and Robber, which take rank as the highest productions of modern
                    sculpture. He was essentially classic in feeling and aim, but here the habit of
                    observation we have mentioned enabled him to snatch a grace beyond the reach of
                    a mere imitator. His subjects were gleaned from the free actions of the splendid
                    Italian people noticed in his walks, and afterwards baptized with such
                    mythological names as best fitted them. Thus a girl kissing a child, with a
                    sudden wring of the figure, over her shoulder, became a Nymph and Cupid; a woman
                    helping her child with his foot on her hand on to her lap, a Bacchante and Faun;
                    his Amazon thrown from her Horse, one of his most original productions, was
                    taken from an accident he witnessed to a female rider in a circus; and the
                    Hunter holding in his Dog was also the result of a street scene. The prominence
                    he gave among his favourite subjects to the little god “of soft tribulations”
                    was no less owing to his facilities for observing the all but naked Italian
                    children, in the hot summers he spent in Rome.</p>
                <p>In monumental and portrait statues for public places, necessarily represented in
                    postures of dignity and repose, Gibson was very happy. His largest effort of
                    this class—the group of Queen Victoria supported by Justice and Clemency, in the
                    palace of Westminster—we agree with himself in pronouncing his finest work in
                    the round. Of noble character also in execution and expression of thought is the
                    statue of Mr Huskisson with the bared arm; and no less, in effect of
                    aristocratic ease and refinement, the seated figure of Dudley North. He lays
                    down the axiom in his journal that the Greeks represented “men thinking, and
                    women tranquil,” and to the departure from this rule we attribute the
                    unattractive colossal statue of Sir Robert Peel in Westminster Abbey. The very
                    animation he has given to the head is too individual to harmonize with the
                    classic drapery, or with the real character of the man. The great statesman is
                    here colloquial rather than eloquent in expression, while the position of the
                    right foot suggests the idea of a walking figure. Great as he was in the round,
                    Gibson’s chief excellence lay in basso rilievo, and in this less disputed sphere
                    he obtained his greatest triumphs. His thorough knowledge of the horse, and his
                    constant study of the Elgin marbles—casts of which are in Rome—resulted in the
                    two matchless bassi rilievi, the size of life, which belong to the earl of
                    Fitzwilliam—the Hours leading the Horses of the Sun, and Phaethon driving the
                    Chariot of the Sun. Most of his monumental works are also in basso rilievo. Some
                    of these are of a truly refined and pathetic character, such as the monument to
                    the countess of Leicester, that to his friend Mrs Huskisson in Chichester
                    Cathedral, and that of the Bonomi children. In reviewing the qualities most
                    characteristic of this great artist, that of passionate expression may be said
                    to stand foremost. Passion, either indulged or repressed, was the natural
                    impulse of his art :— repressed as in the Hours leading the Horses of the
                    Sun.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n605/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0605-0588"/>
                <p>and as in the Hunter and Dog; indulged, as scarcely before seen in the same
                    intensity in the whole range of sculpture, as in the meeting of Hero and
                    Leander, a drawing executed before he left England. Gibson’s power of drawing
                    may be pronounced to have been unsurpassed by any modern. He had an iron hand,
                    and used the pen in rapid action with as much certainty as if it had been the
                    graver. Nowhere is the fire of his genius so unmistakably seen as in these
                    first-hand productions. Nor can we wonder that marble, however highly wrought,
                    could never entirely compensate for what was necessarily lost in the
                    translation. Gibson was the first to introduce colour on his statues,—first, as
                    a mere border to the drapery of a portrait statue of the Queen, and by degrees
                    extended to the entire flesh, as in his Venus, and in the Cupid tormenting the
                    Soul, belonging to Mr Holford. In both of these it amounts to no more than the
                    slightest tint. Gibson’s individuality was too strongly marked to be affected by
                    any outward circumstances. In all worldly affairs and business of daily life he
                    was simple and guileless in the extreme; but he was resolute in matters of
                    principle, determined to walk straight at any cost of personal advantage. Unlike
                    most artists, he was neither nervous nor irritable in temperament. It was said
                    of him that he made the heathen mythology his religion; and indeed in serenity
                    of nature, feeling for the beautiful, and a certain philosophy of mind, he may
                    be accepted as a type of what a pure-minded Greek pagan, in the zenith of Greek
                    art, may have been. Gibson was elected R.A. in 1836, and bequeathed all his
                    property and the contents of his studio to the Royal Academy, where his marbles
                    and casts are open to the public. He died at Rome in January 1866.</p>
                <p>The letters between Gibson and Mrs Henry Sandbach, granddaughter of Mr Rosc,oe,
                    and a sketch of his life that lady induced him to write, furnish the chief
                    materials for his biography. A volume of engravings from his finished works
                    renders them very indifferent justice. A volume of facsimiles from his drawings
                    is more worthy of him. (E. E.)</p>
