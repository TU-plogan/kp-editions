                    properly a secluded valleystate on a tributary of the Upper Indus, but also
                    applied to the tributary river and the whole of its basin, which is one of great
                    interest in many respects, though as yet but imperfectly known. Captain J.
                    Biddulph has for some time past been employed in Gilgit on the part of the
                    Government of India, but no part of the information communicated by him has yet
                    been made available. We shall describe the whole basin so far as materials
                    allow.</p>
                <p>About 10 miles below the elbow formed by the Indus (74° 42' long., 35° 50' lat.)
                    in suddenly changing its course from a general direction north-west to a general
                    direction south-west, in the vicinity of some of the highest mountains and
                    vastest glaciers in the world, the Gilgit river enters it on the right bank, and
                    with a general direction from the north-west. Thus the axis of the Gilgit valley
                    is in fact a prolongation of that of the Indus valley in the direction
                    maintained by the latter for some 300 miles above the elbow just mentioned. The
                    length of the basin, so far as we know, on a line nearly west to east, is 120
                    miles; and its greatest width from north to south is about 7 5. The south limit
                    of the basin is formed by the lofty watershed which divides the west-to-east
                    Gilgit basin from the meridional basins of the (Lower) Indus, the Swat, and the
                    Panjkora. At its intersection with the Indus-Swat watershed this limit rises to
                    a peak of 19,400 feet, and at its intersection with the Panjkora-Chitral
                    watershed to peaks of 18,490 and 19,440 feet. The western limit of the basin is
                    the lofty watershed dividing it from the Mastιij valley on the upper waters of
                    the Chitral river. This limit runs from the intersection last mentioned
                    north-north-east and then north-east, till it joins the great mountain node in
                    which the ranges of Hindu-Kush and the Muztagh (or Karakoram), according to our
                    usual nomenclature, coalesce on the margin of the Pamir plateau. The northern
                    limit of the basin is formed by the Muztagh itself, with peaks of 23,330 feet,
                    22,740 feet, 22,590 feet, 25,370 feet, 25,050 feet, and the basin is closed on
                    the east by an offshoot of the Muztagh which, over the Indus elbow, forms that
                    other great congeries of peaks and glaciers, of which the culminating point
                    (R&lt;-iki-pùshi) rises to 25,550 feet, whilst seven others exceed 19,000 feet.
                    South of the gorge through which the Gilgit waters force their way to the Indus
                    thia eastern barrier continues with summits rising to 14,000 and 15,000 feet,
                    and joins the southern limit already described. This last-mentioned <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n614/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0614-0597"/> part of the barrier is known as the Niludar
                    Hills, and has to be passed by the traveller who enters Gilgit from Kashmir, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> from India. The remotest source of the Gilgit waters is
                    in a lake called Shundar, close above Mastùj, and by which one of the chief
                    passes leads from Gilgit and Yassin to Mastùj and Chitral. The Ghizar river runs
                    out of this, and, after a course of 60 miles, is joined by the river of Yassin,
                    coming from the north. These two may be considered to form the Gilgit river. The
                    Yassin river itself is formed by two streams joining 6 or 8 miles above the
                    village of Yassin, by each of which leads a pass. From the north-west comes the
                    Tui or Moshabbar stream, by which lies the Moshabbar pass, probably at least
                    16,000 feet in height, and traversing a deep crevassed glacier for 8 miles. From
                    where the road reaches the upper stream of Mastùj one path leads down the latter
                    to Mastüj, and another up-stream, crossing by the Baroghil pass (12,000 feet),
                    over the prolongation of Hindu-Kush watershed, into Wakhân and the basin of the
                    Upper Oxus. By the other stream, called the War-chagam river, coming from the
                    north, a path leads over the Darkot pass to the very source of the Mastüj river,
                    and so also to the Baroghil pass. Another important stream, the Karambar, joins
                    the Gilgit river from the north, about 21 miles below the confluence of the
                    Ghizar and Yassin river. This flows through the Ishkaman valley, rising in a
                    lake called the Karambar Sar, said to have been formed in recent years by
                    glaciers damming up the stream, and by this runs the most easterly pass of those
                    that lead from the Gilgit basin direct to Wakhân. It is believed to be very
                    lofty and difficult, but it has not been explored. About 36 miles· below the
                    Ghizar-Yassin confluence, and 25 miles above the confluence with the Indus, on
                    the right bank, stand the fort and village of Gilgit. Five miles below this the
                    river is joined by the last important confluent, called the Nagar river. Recent
                    information suggests that this stream has a very lengthened course, flowing, in
                    fact, from the northern side of the Muztagh in the vicinity of the Karambar
                    lake; and, if this be so, a large addition must be made to the Gilgit basin as a
                    whole. But of this we have no defined knowledge.</p>
                <p>The states occupying the basin of Gilgit are, or till lately were, the following
                    :—</p>
                <p>1: Yassin. —This embraces all the upper or western part of the basin, including
                    the Ishkaman valley. For some generations, at least, the relations of this state
                    with Gilgit were hostile, whilst it was in intimate or dependent connexion with
                    the kings of Chitral, and held by a member of the same family. Indeed it was
                    regarded and named as a subdivision of Upper Chitral. We have no present
                    information as to the population or even the number of villages in this lofty
                    district; but the route surveys show about thirty. The height of the. chief
                    place, Yassin, is 7770 feet. The country was visited twice in 1870 by a very
                    gallant but not prudent traveller, Mr George Hayward, and on the second visit in
                    July of that year he was murdered by the agents of the chief Mir Wali, whilst on
                    his way to the Darkot pass, in hope of penetrating to Wakhân and the exploration
                    of Pamir. It is believed that Yassin has recently been annexed by the troops of
                    Kashmir.</p>
                <p>2. Next below Yassin is the small state of Punidl or Punyd, loDg held by separate
                    rajas, and held by them now in dependence on Kashmir. It occupies the narrow
                    valley of the river for a length of 25 miles, and contains nine villages,
                    varying in height from 7000 feet down to 5500 feet. The villages are all within
                    little forts, so that (as in Khorasan, and in Marco Polo’s narrative) villages
                    and forts are synonymous. At evening, the people who have been occupied in their
                    fields come within the wall, and the gates are closed. Sentries guard the towers
                    all night, and at dawn an armed patrol goes forth and makes the round of all
                    places that might harbour an enemy, before the people issue to their avocations.
                    In this part of the valley there are frequent mauvais pas on the road, where
                    passage is difficult, and where a few men might stop a host. These are called by
                    the old Persian name of darband (porta clausa), like the famous Iron Gate on the
                    Caspian. The upper village of Puniâl, called Gâkùj, was till recently the
                    furthest point to which the poweι∙ of Kashmir, and therefore the influence of
                    the British Government, extended. It stands 6940 feet above the sea. Between
                    Gâkûj and Yassin the road passes through a natural gate of rock. The ruler of
                    Puniâl is, or was in 1873, Raja ’Isa Bâgdur, an old man who, in his little
                    kingdom of nine villages, displayed some of the best characteristics of a king,—
                    feared by his enemies, liked and implicitly obeyed by his people. On meeting him
                    they go up and kiss his hand.</p>
                <p>Gilgit occupies the remainder of the main valley down to the Indus, but we shall
                    first speak of Hunza and Nagar, lying in the eastmost part of the basin, on the
                    Nagar river.</p>
                <p>3 and 4. Nagar lies on the left bank of the river, Hunza opposite, and the two ‘
                    ‘ capitals,” so to call them, lie just over against one another. They are
                    distinct states under distinct princes, and their people of distinct Mussulman
                    sects. Whilst Nagar sends a small complimentary tribute to the maharaja of
                    Kashmir, Hunza (also called Kanjιid), a more warlike country, has often been at
                    active enmity with him, coming down upon his villages in Gilgit, sweeping off
                    the inhabitants, and selling them into slavery. Though the people of both states
                    seem to speak the same language, Dr Leitner says the Nagar people are shorter,
                    stouter, and fairer than the Hunza folk, whom he calls “tall skeletons” and
                    desperate robbers. He says he met a man of Nagar whose yellow moustache and
                    general appearance made him believe almost that, he had seen a Russian. The
                    Kanjùdis are the terror of the Kirghiz on the upper waters of the Yarkand, and
                    of the traders from Ladâk to that territory.</p>
                <p>5. Gilgit occupies all the lower part of the main valley to the Indus. If we take
                    the whole length of the river, from the source in the Shundar lake to the Indus,
                    at 135 miles (which, like the other distances here, is taken with a 5-mile
                    opening of the compass, omitting minor windings), Yassin will occupy 75 miles of
                    this, Puniâl 25, and Gilgit 35. The lower part of Gilgit is a valley from 1 to 3
                    miles wide, bounded on each side by steep rocky mountains. The valley contains
                    stony alluvial plateaus of various forms and at various levels above the river,
                    which flows between cliffs worn in these. The greater part of this space is
                    barren, but as usual in those high regions there is in front of each lateral
                    ravine a cultivated space watered by the tributary stream, and on that a
                    collection of houses. The village of Gilgit is 4800 feet above the sea, and
                    stands on a flat plain of the river alluvium, forming a terrace 30 or 40 feet
                    above the water. The cultivation here covers a square mile or thereabouts,
                    irrigated from the nearest lateral stream. The houses are flat-roofed, scattered
                    over the plain in twos and threes, among groups of fruit-trees. The destruction
                    was great in the wars to which Gilgit has been subject in the last half-century,
                    and it will take long before the village recovers the former abundance of
                    fruit-trees. The fort of Gilgit is the chief stronghold of the maharaja of
                    Kashmir in Dardistân.</p>
                <p>There is very little snow-fall at Gilgit. The vegetable products are wheat,
                    barley, naked barley, rice (at Gilgit village only), maize, millet, buckwheat,
                    various pulses, rape, and cotton; and of fruits, mulberries, peaches, apricots,
                    grapes, apples, quinces, pears, greengages, figs (poor), walnuts, pomegranates,
                    and <hi rend="italic">elceagnus,</hi> besides musk and watermelons. Silk is
                    grown in very small quantity. There are three fabrics from it,—one half-wool,
                    much worn by those above the common peasant, one half-cotton, and the third all
                    silk, strong though loosely woven, and prized for girdles. Gold is washed from
                    the river-gravels as in many other <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n615/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0615-0598"/> parts of the Indus basin. The vine is much
                    cultivated in some parts of the valley. In Puniâl it is grown in small
                    vineyards, the vines being often old trees; the whole vineyard is covered with a
                    horizontal framework of sticks, 2 to 4 feet above the ground, and over this the
                    vines are trained.</p>
                <p>The people of the basin are all reckoned to be Dards, though there is this
                    perplexing fact, that (setting aside dialects) two languages are spoken among
                    them, which are entirely and radically different,—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Khajuna</hi> language, which is spoken in Hunza, Nagar, and Yassin, being one
                    of which no relation has yet been traced to any other tongue, whilst the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shina,</hi> spoken in the rest of the basin, is clearly Aryan, and
                    kindred to the Sanskritic languages of India. Now there seems to be no doubt
                    entertained that the Yassin people at least have all the characters of
                    undisputed Dards. It is worth while to exhibit the numerals from these two
                    languages.</p>

                <p>The Dards not only occupy the Gilgit basin, but also extend down the Indus basin,
                    in which they form a number of small republican communities (whilst the states
                    of the Gilgit basin are all, so to speak, monarchical), reaching to Batera,
                    where the Pushto-speaking tribes who are of Afghan blood, or at least
                    Afghanized, commence. The Dards are described as decidedly Aryan in features,
                    broad-shouldered, well-proportioned, active, and enduring. The hair is usually
                    black but sometimes brown, the eyes brown or hazel, the skin sometimes fair
                    enough to show a ruddy complexion; the voice and manner of speech are harsh. In
                    bearing they are cheerful, bold, and independent, not disobliging when rightly
                    handled, and as a race decidedly clever. They do not care much for human life,
                    but still are not blood-thirsty. They are, says Mr Drew, “a people who will meet
                    one on even terms, without sycophancy or fear, and without impertinent
                    self-assertion.” The women are not pretty in Gilgit, but those of Yassin have a
                    better repute, and indeed Hayward says: “The women have a more English cast of
                    countenance than any I have yet seen in Asia, light-brown locks prevailing.” The
                    dress is entirely woollen, trousers, choga (long robe like a dressing-gown), and
                    girdle. The cap is most characteristic; it is a long woollen bag rolled up at
                    the edge till it .fits close to the head. The feet are wrapt in scraps of
                    leather, with a long strip as a binder. There is a distinct separation into
                    castes, of which Drew counts five, others only four. The lowest caste is Dûm,
                    the name of a low caste found all over India to the extreme Deccan,—a notable
                    circumstance. The middle castes, Shin and Yashkun, form the body of the Dard
                    people. The pure Shin looks more like a European than any high-caste Brahman of
                    India. A Shin man may marry a Y ashkun woman, but a Yashkun man may not marry a
                    Shin woman. The Yashkuns predominate in Gilgit basin; the Shins in Haramosh (up
                    the Indus valley) and Astor (east of Gilgit), and in the states of the Indus
                    basin below Gilgit. It is a notable circumstance that the Dards abhor the cow,
                    much as the Mussulmans abhor swine. They will not drink cow’s milk, nor make or
                    eat butter. In this last point the Indo-Chinese nations generally and the
                    Chinese resemble them, but not in the dislike to the animal. The Dards will not
                    burn cow-dung nor touch the cow if they can help it.</p>
                <p>All the Dards of the Gilgit basin are Mahometans, and of three different sects,
                    Sunnis, Shiahs, and Molâis (Mullahis?), the last being a Shiah offshoot and
                    modification. The last two drink wine, the Sunnis do not. Gilgit proper is half
                    Sunni, half Shiah; Puniâl, Molâi;</p>
                <p>Hunza, Molâi—these are great wine drinkers, Nagar, Shiah; Ishkaman, Molâi;
                    Yassin, Molâi and Sunni, without any Shiahs. Till lately they were very loose
                    Mahometans. Some of the Moslem officers, in the Sikh and Dogra garrisons have
                    spread greater rigidity. The wine is put in large earthenware jars, which are
                    then buried for a time. The people do not understand clarifying the wine. Dr
                    Leitner tasted some which was very palatable, but looked more like mutton-broth
                    than wine. A kind of beer is also made. Polo is a favourite game throughout
                    Dardistân, as in Balti, which is its home, or one of its homes, and it extends
                    to the Chitral country. Wherever Baltis or Dards live, the polo-ground may be
                    looked for. Target archery with firearms is also a favourite amusement; they use
                    stones for bullets, with a thin coating of lead. They are excellent shots. The
                    Jew’s harp is played; and the invention is ascribed to King David.</p>
                <p>History.—The Dards are located by Ptolemy with surprising accuracy {Daradae) on
                    the west of the Upper Indus, beyond the head-waters of the Swat river {Soastua),
                    and. north of the Gandaras, i.e., the Gandhâras, who occupied Peshawar and the
                    country north of it. The Dardas and Chinas also appear in many of the old
                    Pauranic lists of peoples, the latter probably representing the Shin branch of
                    the Dards. This region was traversed by two of the Chinese pilgrims of the early
                    centuries of ouι∙ era, who have left records of their journeys, viz., Fahian,
                    coming from the north, c. 400, and Hwen-thsang, ascending from Swat, c. 631. The
                    latter says: “Perilous were the roads, and dark the gorges. Sometimes the
                    pilgrim had to pass by loose cords, sometimes by light stretched iron chains.
                    Here there were ledges hanging in mid-air; there flying bridges across abysses;
                    elsewhere paths cut with the chisel, or footings to climb by.” Yet even in these
                    inaccessible regions were found great convents, and miraculous images of Buddha.
                    How old the name of Gilgit is we do not know, but it occurs in the writings of
                    the great Mahometan savant Al-Binini, in his notices of Indian geography.
                    Speaking of Kashmir, he says: ‘ <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> When thou hast
                    passed the defile which forms the entrance and hast penetrated into the plain,
                    thou hast to thy left the mountains of Balaur and Shamilaιι. Two days’ journey
                    distant are the Turks called Bhatdwaridn, whose king takes the name of Bhatshdh.
                    The country which these Turks occupy is called Kilkit (or Gilgit), Λsora, and
                    Shaltds. Their tongue is Turk; the people of Kashmir have tft suffer much from
                    their raids ”—(Reinaud, “Extraits,” in Journal Asiatique, ser. iv. tom. iv. ).
                    There are difficult matters for discussion here. It is impossible to say what
                    ground the writer had for calling the people Turks. But it is curious that the
                    Shins say they are all of the same race as the Moghuls of India, whatever they
                    may mean by that. Gilgit, as far back as tradition goes, was ruled by rajas of a
                    family called Trakane. When this family became extinct the valley was desolated
                    by successive invasions of neighbouring rajas, and in the 20 or 30 years ending
                    with 1842 there had been five dynastic revolutions. The most prominent character
                    in the history was a certain Gaur Rahman or Gauhaι ’ Aman, chief of Yassin, a
                    cruel savage and man-seller, of whom many evil deeds are told. Being
                    remonstrated with for selling a mullah, he said, “Why not? the Koran, the word
                    of God, is sold; why not sell the expounder thereof?” The Sikhs entered Gilgit
                    about 1842, and kept a garrison there. When Kashmir was made over to Maharaja
                    Gulâb Singh of Jâmù in 1846, by Lord Hardinge, the Gilgit claims were
                    transferred with it. And when a commission was sent to lay down boundaries of
                    the tracts made over, Air Vans Agnew (afterwards murdered at Multan) and Lieut.
                    Ralph Young of the Engineers visited Gilgit, the first Englishmen who did so.
                    The Dogras (Gâlâb Singh’s race) had much ado to hold their ground, and in 1852 a
                    catastrophe occurred, parallel on a smaller scale to that of the English troops
                    at Cabul. Nearly 2000 men of theirs were exterminated by Gaur Rahman and a
                    combination of the Dards; only one person, a soldier’s wife, escaped, and the
                    Dogras were driven away for eight years. Gι'ιlab Singh would not again cross the
                    Indus, but after his death (in 1857) the present Maharaja Ranbir Singh longed to
                    recover lost prestige. In 1860 he sent a force into Gilgit. Gaur Rahman just
                    then died, and there was little resistance. The Dogras have twice since then
                    taken Yassin, but did not hold it. Now, recently, it is believed, they have not
                    only occupied Yassin, but have invaded Chitral also. They also, in 1866, invaded
                    Darel, one of the most secluded Dard states, to the south of the Gilgit basin,
                    but withdrew again.</p>
                <p>The chief source of the information in this article is an excellent work by Mr
                    Frederick Drew, who was long in the employment of the maharaja, The Jummoo and
                    Kashmir Territories, a Geographical Account, 1875. Use has also been made of Dr
                    Leitner’s uncompleted work, Results of Tour in Dardistan, &lt;fcr.; of Mr
                    Hayward’s letters (Proc. Roy. Geog. Soc., vol. xv., and Journ. Roy. Geog. Soc..

                    withheld from publication by the Indian Government, but the map corrected by his

                    publication of Captain Biddulph’s observations, which will doubtless throw much
                    new light on this secluded and interesting region. (H. Y.)</p>
