                    measuring from 2 to -3 feet in length, exclusive of the thick bushy tail, which
                    is about 8 inches long. Its head is broad, its eyes small, with defective
                    vision, and its back arched. Its fur consists of an undergrowth of short woolly
                    hair, mixed with long straight hairs, to the abundance and length of which on
                    the sides •and tail the creature owes its shaggy appearance. The colour of its
                    fur is blackish-brown, with a broad band of chestnut colour stretching from the
                    shoulders along each side of the body, the two meeting near the root of the
                    tail; while, unlike the majority of arctic animals, the fur of the glutton in
                    winter-time grows darker in colour. Like other weasels it is provided with anal
                    glands, which secrete a yellowish fluid possessing a highly foetid odour. The
                    glutton is a boreal animal, inhabiting the northern regions of both hemispheres,
                    but most abundant in the circumpolar area of the New World, where it occurs
                    throughout the British provinces and Alaska, being specially numerous in the
                    neighbourhood of the Mackenzie River, and extending southwards as far as New
                    York and the Rocky Mountains. Many erroneous statements have been made regarding
                    the glutton by early writers on natural history, from Olaus Magnus to Buffon,
                    one of which has perpetuated itself in the animal’s common name,—the fact being
                    that the wolverene is not more gluttonous than are the majority of carnivorous
                    animals. It feeds on grouse and the smaller rodents, and on foxes, which it digs
                    from their burrows during the breeding season. Its want of activity, however,
                    renders it dependent for most of its food on the dead carcases of animals. These
                    it frequently obtains by methods which have made it peculiarly obnoxious to the
                    hunter and trapper. Should the hunter, after succeeding in killing his game,
                    leave the carcase insufficiently protected for more than a single night, the
                    glutton, whose fear of snares is sufficient to prevent him from touching it
                    during the first night, will, if possible, get at and devour what he can of it
                    on the second, hiding the remainder beneath the snow. He annoys the trapper by
                    following up his lines of marten traps, which often extend to a length of 40 or
                    50 miles, each of which he enters from behind, extracting the bait, pulling up
                    the traps, and devouring or concealing the entrapped martens. So persistent is
                    the glutton in this practice, when once it discovers a line of traps, that its
                    extermination along the trapper’s route is a necessary preliminary to the
                    successful prosecution of his business. This is, however, no easy task, as the
                    glutton is too cunning to be caught by the methods successfully employed on the
                    other members of the weasel family. The trap generally used for this purpose is
                    one made to resemble a cache, or hidden store of food, such as the Indians and
                    hunters are in the habit of forming, the discovery and rifling of which is one
                    of the glutton’s most congenial occupations,—the bait, instead of being paraded
                    as in most traps, being in this case carefully concealed, to lull the knowing
                    beast’s suspicions. One of the most prominent characteristics of the wolverene
                    is its propensity, akin to that of certain members of the crow family, to steal
                    and hide things, not merely food which it might afterwards need, or traps which
                    it regards as personal enemies, but articles which cannot possibly have any
                    interest for it except that of curiosity. An amusing instance of this is quoted
                    by Cowes in his valuable work, recently published, on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fur-bearing Animals of North America,</hi> in which he says— “A hunter and his
                    family, having left their lodge unguarded during their absence, on their return
                    found it completely gutted—the walls were there, but nothing else. Blankets,
                    guns, kettles, axes, cans, knives, and all the other paraphernalia of a
                    trapper’s tent had vanished, and the tracks left by the beast showed who had
                    been the thief. The family set to work, and, by carefully following up all his
                    paths, recovered, with some trifling exceptions, the whole of the lost
                    property.” The cunning it displays in unravelling the oftentimes complicated
                    snares set for it forms at once the admiration and the despair of every trapper,
                    while its great strength and ferocity render it a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n720/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0720-0697"/> dangerous antagonist to animals much larger than
                    itself, and occasionally even to man. The rutting season occurs in March, and
                    the female, secure in her burrow, produces her young—four or five at a birth—in
                    June or July. In defence of these she is exceedingly bold, and the Indians,
                    according to Cowes, “have been heard to say that they would sooner encounter a
                    she-bear with her cubs than a carcajou (the Indian name of the glutton) under
                    the same circumstances.” The wolverene has a curious habit which has not
                    hitherto been observed in any other of the lower animals. On catching sight of
                    its relentless human enemy, it may be observed, before finally determining on
                    flight, sitting on its haunches, and, in order to get a clearer view of the
                    danger, shading its eyes with one of its forepaws. When pressed for food it
                    becomes fearless, and has then been known to come on board an ice-bound vessel,
                    and in presence of the crew to seize on a canister of meat. The flesh of the
                    glutton is uneatable; it is therefore only valuable for its fur, which, when
                    several skins are sewn together, forms elegant hearth and carriage rugs.</p>
