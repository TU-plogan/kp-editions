                    Channel, and on the E. by Monmouth, the boundary line of which is the Rhymney.
                    Its greatest length from E. to W. is about 53 miles, its greatest breadth from
                    N. to S. about 29; its coast-line is about 60 miles, and its area 547,070
                    acres.</p>
                <p>Glamorgan, with the exception of some flat tracts on the borders of the Bristol
                    Channel, consists of a succession of hills and valleys, the country inland
                    growing more and more mountainous, after a broad tract of plain on the south
                    coast, until on the borders of Brecknock its surface is a sea of hills. None of
                    the mountains rise to a great height, the most lofty, Mynydd LIangeinor, being
                    but 1859 feet, and the escarpment of Craig y Llyn about the same height or a
                    little higher. Yet their bold forms add grandeur to the scenery of the county,
                    and their lower slopes are clothed with picturesque though not large timber.</p>
                <p>The valleys of Glamorgan have been long famous for great beauty of scenery. The
                    vale of Glamorgan, some 8 miles in breadth, has been truly called the “Garden of
                    Wales,” and its climate is so mild that myrtles and other tender plants flourish
                    in the open air. The vale of Neath is known to tourists as the waterfall
                    district of South Wales, the finest falls being betwixt Hirwain and Neath, near
                    the Vale of Neath Railway, viz. Cilhepstè fall, the three Clwngwyns, the falls
                    of the Pyrddin, Scwd-Einon Gam, Scwd-GIadys, and Scwd Hen Rhydd on the Llech,
                    with Melincourt and Abergarwedd still nearer Neath. The highest of these falls
                    are above 80 feet. Swansea valley has also fine scenery. Other valleys are those
                    of the Rhymney, the Taff, the Rhondda, and the Llwchwr, the first two giving
                    their names to important railways.</p>
                <p>The rivers of Glamorgan are not large. The chief are the Rhymney, forming the
                    county’s eastern boundary; the Ogwr or Ogmore, which flows into the Bristol
                    Channel near Porth-Cawl harbour; the Taff, which rises in the Brecon Beacon,
                    flows southward through the county, and forms the important harbour of Cardiff;
                    the Neath and Tawe, flowing south into Swansea Bay; and the Llwchwr, which is
                    the boundary of the county on the west, and, falling into Car marthen Bay, forms
                    the estuary of the Burry river.</p>
                <p>The chief geological feature of Glamorgan is the Coal-measures, which are of the
                    greatest thickness near Neath, but extend nearly over the whole county, and are
                    bounded by a narrow band of Millstone Grit and Mountain Limestone, nearly
                    coincident with the county boundary on the north. In the extreme south and
                    south-west the Devonian, Magnesian Limestone, and the Lias show themselves.</p>
                <p>The climate is mild, and the plains on the coast as well as inland are very
                    fertile. The soil is a deep rich loam, improved by lime. Agriculture is as yet
                    not so forward as it might be with such a soil and climate; but the farms are
                    seldom large, and the buildings are not suited to high farming. The crops
                    chiefly raised are wheat, beans, pease oats, barley, vetches, turnips, and
                    potatoes. The cattle are of good useful breeds; and good sheep and ponies are
                    reared in the hill-country. According to the agricultural statistics for 1878,
                    the extent under the different crops (the total area being 547,070 acres), and
                    the numbers of live-stock, were as follows :—</p>

                <p>According to the Owners and Heritages Return 1872- 73, the county was divided
                    among 8426 proprietors, holding 428,386 acres, with a gross estimated annual
                    rental of £1,609,379. The estimated amount of commons and waste lands was 47,018
                    acres. Of the owners, 78 ’ 8 per cent, possessed less than one acre, and the
                    average value per acre was £3, Is. 8⅛d. There were 16 proprietors owning 5000
                    acres and upwards, viz., C. R. Μ. Talbot 33,920; Earl of Dunraven, 23,706;

                <p>The industry of Glamorgan is chiefly applied to its coal and iron mines, which
                    practically underlie the whole superficies of the county, and give it its
                    pre-eminence among Welsh counties. In 1872 there were no less than 420 coalpits
                    in Monmouthshire and South Wales, and the yield of some 15 million tons a year
                    came in very large proportion from the Glamorganshire vales of Neath, Taff,
                    Rhondda, Ely, »fee. Within the last twenty years the iron works were carried on
                    at an enormous scale of labour and enterprise, there being near Merthyr-Tydvil
                    alone upwards of 60 blast furnaces; but in 1873 it appeared that of 57 furnaces
                    in Glamorganshire 27 were out of blast, and at present (1879) the industry is,
                    from various causes, in a backward state. Excellent means of export for coal and
                    iron are afforded by the unrivalled docks at Cardiff, the enterprise of the late
                    and present marquis of Bute, and by those also at Penarth at the mouth of the
                    Ely. These have within considerably less than a century transformed an
                    insignificant Welsh town into a leading port and emporium with a first rate
                    harbour and anchorage; whilst another dock at Swansea serves a like purpose for
                    the export of the copper ore smelted at Swansea, Neath, Aberavon, and Treforest,
                    and chiefly sold at public ticketings in the first-named town. Cardiff and
                    Swansea, especially the latter, also have a very large export trade in patent
                    compressed fuel prepared from culm and tar.</p>
                <p>Glamorgan can boast historic ruins, such as Caerphilly, and Castle Coch near
                    Llandaff, the former a Norman fortress held for Edward II. by the younger De
                    Spencer, the latter an early English fortress on an escarpment of mountain
                    limestone. Other ruined castles are Oystermouth and Pennard in Gower, and Coity
                    near Bridgend; while as restored castles, resided in by their present owners,
                    are Cardiff, the residence of the marquis of Bute, St Fagan’s, near Ely station,
                    and St Donat’s and Dun raven, both on the verge of the Bristol Channel. The
                    county has some fine cromlechs at St Nicholas and St Lythan’s on the Dyffrin
                    estate, at Cotterell near Peterston, and at Arthur’s Stone in Gower. The Sam
                    Helen, an ancient road, traverses the county. At Llantwit Major, near Cowbridge,
                    was the once famous divinity school founded by St Germanus, and presided over
                    for an incredible term of years by St Iltyd. Every stone in this old-world town
                    is “of old memorial.” Coity, Coychurch, and Ewenny, near Bridgend, present a
                    fine trio of cross churches, with fortified or embattled towers, characteristic
                    of the county.</p>
                <p>South of Swansea lie3 the promontory of Gower, famed for the beauty of its coast
                    scenery, its people of Flemish descent, planted here by Henry L, and its
                    bone-caves. The last, in the limestone cliffs, accessible only at low water, are
                    at Bacon Hole, Paviland, and Rhosilly Bay.</p>
                <p>Besides its ports, Glamorgan has abundant means of transit in four railways and a
                    canal, beside numerous tramways. It contains 128 parishes and 10 hundreds, and
                    is in the dioceses of Llandaff and St David’s. Llandaff cathedral, 2 miles from
                    the county town of Cardiff, having fallen into decay through the neglect of ages
                    previous to 1844, owed, its restoration to a beauty befitting the prestige of
                    the earliest Christian see to the energetic endeavours of Dean Thomas Williams.
                    It was completed in 1869.</p>
                <p>The great changes of recent years in elementary education have curiously affected
                    the statistics of schools in Glamorgan. Whereas in 1847 there were 327 day
                    schools in all, with 15,674 scholars, in 1877 the parliamentary return shows a
                    great reduction in the number of schools, though these have probably a much
                    larger aggregate of scholars. This return exhibits 226 public elementary schools
                    in Glamorgan, of which 56 were board-schools, 30 British and foreign, 12 Roman
                    Catholic, 1 Wesleyan, and the remainder national, parochial, and Church of
                    England schools. Of these schools, 41 had each in average attendance upwards of
                    300 scholars, and 2 had upwards of 1000. Fourteen only had night schools in
                    operation. As in other southwest counties, the Welsh language is losing ground,
                    except in remote agricultural districts.</p>
                <p>In 1851 the population of the county was 231,849, 120,748 males and 111,101
                    females; and in 1871 it was 397,859, 205,660 males and 192,199 females. The
                    population has increased since the first census in 1801 by 326,980 persons, or
                    451 per cent. The county returns two members to parliament, the borough of
                    Merthyr two, and the Cardiff and Swansea districts of boroughs one each, a total
                    of xis in all. In the year ending April 1871 the amount of real property
                    assessed to income and property tax was £1,219,922. The principal towns with the
                    populations in 1871 were—</p>
