                    European land, over the greater part of Asia and North America, and along the
                    northern coast of Africa. Bell of Antermony speaks in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Travels</hi> (1763) of meeting at Tobolsk a band of sixty Tziggany on their way
                    to China; Koster describes the Brazilian Ciganos <hi rend="italic">(Travels in
                    Brazil,</hi> 1816); and at the present day cases of Gipsy emigration to
                    Australia are not unknown. No general estimate can be formed of their numbers
                    outside Europe, but travellers agree that they are very numerous in Persia (3000
                    families in 1856), Armenia, Asiatic Turkey (67,000 in 1877), and Egypt (one
                    alone of the three chief tribes, the Ghagars, being reckoned at 16,000); whilst
                    in America, besides a multitude of British Gipsies, Gipsies from Spain, France,
                    Germany, and Hungary are not unfrequent. The total, 700,000, at which Miklosich
                    placed (1878) the European Gipsies, fairly agrees with the following fragmentary
                    statistics. Turkey, before its late dismemberment, contained 104,750 (9537 in
                    Bosnia and the Herzegovina in 1874); Servia had 24,691 in 1874, Montenegro 500
                    in 1873; and in Roumania there are from 200,000 to 300,000, according to the
                    varying estimates of Cretzulesco (1876) and the <hi rend="italic"

                    Roumanie</hi> (1874). Iu 1876 Austria counted about 1000 (13,500 in Bohemia in
                    18461), and Hungary 159,000 (78,923 in Transylvania in 1850, and 36,842 in
                    Hungary proper in 1864); while Spain is credited with 40,000, France with from
                    2000 to 6000 (700 in the Basque country), Germany and Italy together with
                    34,000(1), and Scandinavia with 1500. In Russia their number in 1834 was stated
                    at 48,247, exclusive of Polish Gipsies, in 1844 at 1,427,539, and in 1877 at

                    which was possibly due to the Gipsies’ skill in serpent-charming. The

                    with the Mongolian hordes, the terror of Europe in the 13th century; and their
                    French name <hi rend="italic">Bohémiens</hi> was probably due either to a
                    confusion of some such form as <hi rend="italic">Secani</hi> with <hi

                    occurs in a charter of William the Lion (1165-1214), is commonly held to be a

                    >Cigaηy,</hi> is a form of the most widespread of all the Gipsies’
                    appellations—Bulgarian <hi rend="italic">Atzigan,</hi> modern Greek *Aτσiγ-καvoς
                    or ’Αθίγγανος. The last was also the title of a separatist sect in Asia Minor,
                    so called, it is supposed, because its members kept themselves from contact with
                    unbelievers (α privative, and ^ιγγαμω, “to touch”). Miklosich, finding in it the
                    source of all the preceding forms, believes it to have been transferred by the
                    Greeks to Gipsies, either because the latter entered the western parts of the
                    Byzantine empire from Phrygia and Lycaonia, or because they were suspected of
                    being adherents of the sect or simply as a nickname (Mikl., vi. pp. 57-66).
                    Bataillard, on the other hand, identifying the heretic Α0ryγαvoc with Gipsy
                    Άτσίγκανοι, and these with the Siγwι∕αι of Herodotus (v. 9), derives the name
                    from <hi rend="italic">σιγvvg,</hi> “a javelin;” while others among the
                    countless etymologies proposed are Goeje’s from Persian <hi rend="italic"
                    >chang,</hi> “a kind of harp or cither;” Burton’s from Persian <hi rend="italic"
                    >zαng,</hi> “Ethiopia;” and Newbold’s from Persian <hi rend="italic">zrn,</hi>
                    “a saddle.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First Appearance in European History.—</hi> From whatever
                    cause, it is certain that a confusion did exist between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >’Aτσiγκαvοι</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Αθίγγανοι,</hi> which renders it
                    extremely difficult to determine whether the Byzantine historians are speaking
                    of Gipsies or heretics in seven passages collected by Miklosich. It appears from
                    these that <hi rend="italic">Αθίγγανοι,</hi> described as magicians,
                    soothsayers, and serpent-charmers, first emerge in Byzantine history under
                    Nicephorus I. (802-11), were banished by Michael I. (811-13), and were restored
                    to favour by Michael II. (820-29); but Miklosich’s reasons for absolutely
                    identifying them with Gipsies, and positively asserting the latter to have
                    appeared at Byzantium in 810 under Nicephorus, are hard to recognize. Less
                    dubious seems an extract from the Georgian <hi rend="italic">Life of Giorgi
                    Mtharsmindel</hi> (1 lth century), which describes how at Constantinople certain
                    descendants of the race of Simon Magus, <hi rend="italic">Atsinkan</hi> by name,
                    sorcerers and famous rogues, slew wild beasts by their magic arts in the
                    presence of Bagrat IV. Such passages are open to some doubt; hardly so the
                    following from the <hi rend="italic">Itinerarium</hi><hi rend="italic">Symoηis
                    Simeonis</hi> (ed. by J. Nasmith, Camb. 1778), where-Fitz Simeon, a Franciscan
                    friar of Dublin, describing his stay in Crete in 1322, says “We there saw a
                    people living outside the city (of Candia), who worship according to the Greek
                    rite, and declare themselves of the race of Ham. They rarely or never stop in
                    one place more than thirty days, but, as though accursed of heaven, wander from
                    field to field with little, oblong, black, low tents, like those of the Arabs,
                    or from cave to cave.” The empress Catherine de Valois, again, who died in 1346,
                    granted to the suzerains of Corfu authority to reduce to vassalage certain <hi
                    rend="italic">homines vageniti</hi> coming from the mainland, who under the
                    Venetians formed in 1386 the nucleus of a <hi rend="italic">feudum
                    Acinganorum</hi> that lasted down to the present century. About 1378 the
                    Venetian governor of Nauplion confirmed the <hi rend="italic">Acingani</hi> of
                    that Greek colony in privileges granted by his predecessors; and in 1387 Mircea
                    I., waiwode of Wallachia, renewed a grant made by his uncle Ladislaus to the
                    monastery of St Anthony at Voditza of forty <hi rend="italic">salaschi</hi>
                    (tents) of <hi rend="italic">Acigani.</hi> Other documents might be cited, but
                    these are enough to show that in the 14th century Gipsies existed in the Balkan
                    peninsula and islands of the Levant; that in Wallachia they were reduced to a
                    state of bondage (from which they were only freed in 1856); and that nowhere
                    were they regarded as new-comers, so that by these documents it is impossible to
                    fix the date of the first Gipsy immigration. More than this, a metrical German
                    paraphrase of Genesis, made by an Austrian monk about 1122, preserved at Vienna,
                    and edited by Hoffmann in his <hi rend="italic">Fundgruben für Geschichte
                    deutscher Sprache</hi> (Breslau, 1837), goes far to prove that Gipsies were
                    known in Austria three centuries before the commonly-accepted date of their
                    appearance in that country. A passage relating to Hagar’s descendants (Gen. xvi.
                    15) runs :—“So she (Hagar) had this son; they named him Ishmael. It is from him
                    the Ishmaelites descend. They journey far through the world; we call them <hi
                    rend="italic">chaltsmide</hi> (lit. cold-smiths). . . . They have no house nor
                    country; everywhere they are found alike; they wander over the country, abusing
                    people by their knaveries. Thus they deceive men,—robbing no one openly.” That
                    here by <hi rend="italic">chaltsmide, Ishmaelites,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >descendants of Hagar</hi> Gipsies are meant, scarcely admits of doubt, seeing
                    that the smith’s is still the Gipsies’ leading handicraft; that Lusignan in 1573
                    speaks of the Gipsies of Cyprus as “Cinquanes, otherwise called <hi
                    rend="italic">Ag</hi><hi rend="italic">ariens</hi><hi rend="italic">f</hi> and

                    Byzantine writers were possibly Gipsies, being defined by Ducange as
                    “circulatores atque adeo <hi rend="italic">Fabri</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    next came a motley crew afoot; and women and children brought up the rear in
                    waggons. They bore among other letters of safe-conduct one granted by the
                    emperor Sigismund, and professed themselves engaged on a seven years’
                    pilgrimage, imposed by their bishops in expiation of apostacy from the Christian
                    faith. From Lüneburg they passed to Hamburg, Lübeck, Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund,
                    and Greifswald, camping by night outside the walls, thieving by day, “wherefore
                    several were taken and slain” <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> the contemporary

                    Bern, and Solothurn, according to Conrad Justinger (died 1426), who speaks of
                    them as “more than 200 baptized heathens from Egypt.” They now split up into two

                    terrified citizens bestowed on the “Saracens” a hundred loaves. Next comes a

                    but Bologna in fifteen days became too hot forthem, so by way of Forli—where
                    “certain said they were from India”—the pilgrims travelled on to Rome. Their
                    object was to procure fresh letters from the pope; and such they afterwards
                    produced, though of their sojourn in the imperial city no record has yet been
                    published. To the burghers of Ratisbon Gipsies presented themselves in 1424;
                    they pitched their tents again before its walls in 1426; and at Paris in 1427
                    the fair of Landit was attended by a duke, a count, and ten other mounted
                    pilgrims, late renegades of “Lower Egypt,” whose women practised palmistry and
                    cleared everybody’s pockets. Later we hear of Gipsies at Arnheim (1429), at Metz
                    (1430), at Erfurt (1432), and in Bavaria (1433),—these and all notices of the
                    seventeen years preceding referring probably to the movements of a single
                    ubiquitous band, sent forward to spy out the lands of promise, and composed of
                    from 600 to 1400 persons. For not until 1438 did the great tide of westward
                    immigration begin to flow; then, not in hundreds but thousands, headed no longer
                    by paltry “dukes” and “counts,” but by a “king,” King Zindl,<note

                    the date of their landing; and in Scotland the earliest certain record of their
                    presence is an entry in the books of the Lord High Treasurer: “Apr. 22, 1505.

                    Gipsies perhaps the Saracens may be identified, whom a tradition represents as
                    making depredations in Scotland prior to 1460 (Simson, p. 98). In no other
                    country were Gipsies better received than in this, where they “dansit before the
                    king in Halyrudhous” (1530); where James IV. gave (July 5, 1505) Anthonius
                    Gagino, count of Little Egypt, a letter of commendation to the king of Denmark;
                    and where James V. subscribed a writ (February 15, 1540) in favour of “oure

                    Act was passed, commanding the “Egyptians to pass forth of the realm” under pain
                    of death, and similar edicts were issued before and afterwards in most of the
                    European states —Germany (1497), Spain (1499), France (1504), England (1531),

                    however, noteworthy as one of the causes of the dispersion of the tribes. Under
                    Henry VIII. Gipsies were shipped from England to Norway (Wright’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Ludlow,</hi> pp. 389-92) or France; whilst by the
                    latter power, so lately as 1802, the bands infesting Bayonne and Mauléon were
                    caught by night as in a net, huddled on shipboard, and landed on the coast of
                    Africa (Michel, <hi rend="italic">Pays Basque,</hi> p. 137). In Scotland four
                    Faas were hanged at Edinburgh in 1611 “for abyding within the kingdome, they
                    being Egiptianis;” and in 1636 doom was pronounced on other “Egyptians” at
                    Haddington, the “men to be hangit, and the weomen to be drowned; and suche of
                    the weomen as hes children to be scourgit throw the burgh and brunt in the
                    cheeke.” Under the English statute of 1562 (repealed 1783) making· it felony
                    without benefit of clergy to be merely seen for a month in the fellowship of
                    Gipsies, five men were hanged at Durham “for being Egyptians,” 8th August 1592.
                    Still greater were the cruelties and injustice suffered by Gipsies on the
                    Continent, since there, to the charge of kidnapping, were added the weightier
                    imputations of being cannibals and emissaries of the Turk. Quinones recounts how
                    in 1629 four Estremaduran Gitanos owned under torture to having eaten a friar, a
                    pilgrim, and a woman of their tribe; and in 1782 forty-five Hungarian Gipsies
                    were· beheaded, quartered, or hanged on a like monstrous charge. First racked
                    till they confessed the crime of murder, they were brought to the spot where
                    their victims were said to be buried, and when no bodies appeared they were
                    racked again. “We ate them” was their despairing cry; and forthwith the journals
                    teemed with accounts of “eighty-five persons roasted by Gipsy cannibals”;
                    straightway the “cannibals” were hurried to the scaffold. Then Joseph ∙∏. sent a
                    commission down, whose inquiries showed that no one had been murdered—except the
                    victims of the false accusation. The full, impartial annals of the race have
                    still to be compiled, from edicts and law-books, from local histories and a few
                    monographs like Dirk’s- <hi rend="italic">Geschiedkuηdige onderzoekingen

                    language to be gathered from books was meagre in the extreme. The thirteen works
                    published prior to 1840 which furnish specimens of the Anglo-Romani dialect—
                    Boorde (1547), Bryant (1785), Bright (1818), Copsey (1818), Harriot (1830),
                    Roberts (1836), &lt;fcc.—together contain but 396 genuine stems, besides 69
                    doubtful words, and furnish scarcely any examples of the grammar. Nor are the
                    Continental works cited by Pott, from Vulcanius (1589) downwards, much more
                    copious. Even to-day there are still great gaps in our knowledge, especially of
                    the dialects outside of Europe; but enough has been done to show that from the
                    Nile to the Arctic Ocean, from the Euphrates to the Atlantic, the Gipsies speak,
                    with dialectal variations, one and the selfsame speech. The Romani names for
                    “water,” “fire,” “hair,” and “eye,’* are in Persia <hi rend="italic">pdni, aik,

                    multiplied indefinitely, serve further to show, by their resemblance to the

                    tongue. Rüdiger first compared Romani, so long regarded as a thieves’ jargon,
                    withone of the New Indian dialects, and in 1782 published the result of the
                    comparison in his <hi rend="italic">Neuester Zuwachs der Sprachkunde.</hi> In

                    discovery. The conclusion that the Gipsies wandered forth from India is now
                    almost universally accepted, but when, or from what part of India, are questions
                    on which few have done more than idly speculate. Whether Romani is derived from
                    Hindi, Marathi, &amp;c., can only be determined by minute investigations, which,
                    long neglected, arc now being carried on by various Orientalists. They have at
                    least established that Romani stands in the relation of a sister, not a
                    daughter, to the seven principal New Indian dialects. Its forms are often more
                    primitive than theirs, sometimes than those of Pali or the Prakrits, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., vast,</hi> “hand” (Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">hasta,</hi>
                    Pali <hi rend="italic">hattha}, kasht,</hi> “wood” (Sanskrit <hi rend="italic"
                    >köshlha,</hi> Pali <hi rend="italic">kattha),vusht,</hi> “lip” (Sanskrit <hi
                    rend="italic">oshtha,</hi> Pali <hi rend="italic">ottha), trash,</hi> “fear”
                    (Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">trasa,</hi> Pali <hi rend="italic">tas), trin,</hi>
                    “three” (Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">tri,trvηi∙,</hi> Pali <hi rend="italic">ti,

                    archaisms of Romani forbid us to derive it from Hindi or Marathi, some of its
                    seemingly modern forms are the result of independent development. On the other
                    hand, our knowledge of Romani itself, and of the multitudinous spoken dialects
                    of India, is not at present sufficient to warrant our pronouncing the former
                    more primitive than any of them; and as a fact many of its archaisms may be
                    paralleled in the languages of Dardistan and Kafiristan <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi> Miklosich, <hi rend="italic">Beiträge,</hi> iv. 45-54). Thus there
                    are difficulties on both sides in the way of adjudicating between the opinions
                    of Ascoli and Miklosich. The former maintains <hi rend="italic">(Saggi
                    Iηdiani,</hi> vol. ii., 1875) that Romani, preserving certain consonantal <hi
                    rend="italic">nexus</hi> which had almost entirely disappeared at the epoch of
                    the most ancient Prakrit texts, approaches Sanskrit more nearly even than
                    Pali—conclusions, he observes, that harmonize well with Bataillard’s
                    pre-historic theory. Miklosich, on the other hand, opposes that theory in
                    Meyer’s <hi rend="italic">Konversations-Lexikon</hi> (3d ed. 1878), where he
                    infers from the agreement of Romani in its phonetic laws and system of
                    case-endings with the modern Aryan languages of India that the emigration cannot
                    have taken place till these were formed, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> until
                    after the Prakrit period.</p>
                <p>In Europe Miklosich distinguishes thirteen Romani dialects—the Greek or Turkish,
                    Roumanian, Hungarian, Moravo-Bohemian, German, Polo-Lithuanian, Russian,
                    Finnish, Scandinavian, Anglo-Scottish, Italian, Basque, and Spanish. To these
                    should be added the Welsh, which, generally unintelligible to the English Gipsy,
                    is one of the most perfect, as it has also been the least studied, of all the
                    dialects. As a general rule, the further these dialects remove from Turkey, the
                    more corrupt have they become, so that the Gipsies of Spain, of Scandinavia, and
                    in great measure of England, know no case or verb endings other than those of
                    the lands of their adoption. From Turkish Romani, therefore, and Welsh the
                    following examples will be drawn. The Turkish (marked T.) are taken from
                    Paspati; the Welsh (W.) are derived from letters and stories written by John
                    Roberts, the oldest living harper, whose thorough knowledge of his language is
                    probably unique.</p>
                <p>The definite article, wanting in Asia, is supplied in every European dialect by
                    the Greek &lt;5 and ή — ό for the masculine, ή for the feminine and the oblique
                    cases, c.g., W. Botchdαs ow bearcηgaro e vaver tringcngey, “the sailor asked the
                    other three,” E colley pendas, “the Gipsy woman said.” The indefinite article,
                    in some dialects supplied by yek, “one,” is still omitted by the Welsh and the
                    “deeper” English Gipsies, e.g., Yckerporro gougco ta porrey gougeyjiυenes undra
                    borrow veshestay, “once (an) old man and (an) old woman were living in (a) great
                    wood.” Romani has no trace of either a dual number or a neuter gender. Excepting
                    monosyllables, most of its nouns terminate in ∙o (masc.) and -i (fem.), as
                    raklo, “lad,” rakli, “girl.” Masculine nouns ending in a consonant form their
                    feminines in -ni, as rom, “husband,” romni, “wife.” Inanimate objects are
                    indifferently masculine or feminine: to the former belonging gav, “town,” and
                    gad, “shirt;” to the latter nok, “nose,” and bok, <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>
                    hunger.” Rom, “a husband,” and rakli, <hi rend="superscript"> i,</hi> a girl,”
                    are thus declined in Turkish Romani</p>

                <p>Here the so-called genitive is in reality an adjective. It precedes and agrees in
                    gender with its noun, c.g., T. c derviséskeri rakli, “the dervish’s daughter;”
                    W. sonekaicsko mochto, “a golden box,” and dakey pen, “mother’s sister." Welsh
                    Gipsies often use the dative where we should look for the genitive, as in Te
                    pogcrcl yeck e herrenday ow υodrestay, “to break one of the legs of the bed.”
                    Datives and instrumentals are formed by suffixing to accusatives the separable
                    post-positions te or ke, “to,” and sar, “with;” and the -tar of the ablative
                    (also occurring in kΛ-tar, “whence,” lit. “where from”) Pott (i. 188) compares
                    with the Γali adverbial ending -ta = Sansk. tas = Lat. ∙t us in eoelitus. In
                    most European Romani dialects considerable confusion has arisen in the use of
                    the oblique cases, but Welsh Gipsies employ the following rightly enough: Sing.
                    acc. te dickel ow kralliscs, “to see the king;” dat. masc. te dickel pcsko
                    jivamaskay, “to look for his living;” dat. fem. pendas e gougeackey, “she said
                    to the woman;” inst. rokkerdas ow krallisesa, “he spoke with the king;” voc.
                    Ria, “Sir!”—Plur. acc. te patsell e callcn, “to believe the Gipsies;’’ dat. te
                    kerrav les undra chichaw grengey, <hi rend="superscript"> li</hi> to make it
                    into shoes for horses;” voc. Ghoνollay, “mates!” Nouns ending in -o form their
                    plural in Welsh,as in Turkish Romani, in accented -é, e.g., chavay, “children”
                    (sing, chdvo), and chiriklay, “birds” (sing, chiriklo)^, other nouns form it in
                    -a or ∙ia, as chaia, ‘ ‘ girls” (sing, chai), tcma, “lands” (sing, tem), penya,
                    “sisters” (sing, pen), &amp;c. Of adjectives it need only be remarked that, with
                    rare exceptions, they end in -o (masc.) and -i (fem.), and form the plural in
                    -é, e.g., W. Java te kerra esa te rigeren tomen tatay, “I go to make clothes to
                    keep you (plur.) warm.” The termination of the comparative is -der, e.g., W.
                    porro, “old,” poradare, “older;” and the want of a true superlative is
                    frequently supplied, as in French, by prefixing the definite article to the
                    comparative, e.g., W. con see ow poradare, “who is the eldest.” Romani pronouns
                    present an interesting study, since everywhere they have been better preserved
                    than any other parts of speech. Turkish Romani gives me, “I,” man, “me,” amén,
                    “we,” &amp;c., and tu, “thou, tut, “thee,” i∙uwι&lt;⅛ι, “ye” (lit. thou-we),
                    &amp;c., all of which forms are employed by English and Welsh Gipsies. How
                    strikingly indeed the Turkish and Welsh dialects agree may be seen from the
                    instances following these paradigms, taken from Paspati, of or, “he,” 6i, “she,”
                    and ol (Bohemian Romani, jon) “they”:—</p>

                    That nineteen out of the twenty-one forms of the Turkish dialect should be
                    preserved in the Welsh after a separation of four centuries, Romani, moreover,
                    being an unwritten language, is singular; hardly less striking is the similarity
                    in the use of the reflexive pronoun pcs, “himself” or “herself,” c.g., W. dickel
                    pcsko drom glan pestay, “he sees his way before him;” ow Jack rivdaspes, “Jack
                    dressed himself;” te denpengo lovo, “to give their money;” c trin marsh gillay
                    pengay, “the three men went away” (lit. “went to themselves,” a curious use).
                    The third pronoun, lo, “he,” li, “she,” and lé, “they,” commonly only used after
                    the auxiliary verb “to be,” is also noteworthy, as playing an important part in
                    the formation of the verb. Instances of its use are—W. postcy seslo kinno, “till
                    he was tired;” vasavee chibalengerey ses le, “she was a foul-tongued woman;”
                    trashaday seslay, “they were frightened.” The auxiliary verb runs in Turkish
                    Romani: <hi rend="smallcaps">Pres.</hi> sing, isém, isΛn, ist (asti in Asiatic
                    R.); plur. isdrn, isdn, ist·. <hi rend="smallcaps">Imperf.</hi></p>

                <p>sing, isômas, isdnas, isds; plur. isdmas, isdnas, isds. And in Welsh Romani occur
                    the forms, shorn, “I am;” sham, “thou art;” se, “he is” or “they are;” sham, “we
                    are” {e.g., sham betcherda ta las a kai filashvn, “we are sent to get this
                    mansion”); shen, “ye are;” shornas, “I was;” shenncs, “thou wert” or “ye were;”
                    ses, “he was” or “they were.” The terminations of the present indicative in
                    Turkish Romani are: <hi rend="smallcaps">Sing,</hi>-va, -sa, •la; <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Plur.</hi>-sa, -na, -na, which are joined immediately to the
                    verbal stem (identical with the imperative) if it is monosyllabic and ends in a
                    vowel, but otherwise are connected with it by a vowel. For example, ld-va, “I
                    take;” là-sa {lésa), ld-la (léla), ld-sa, lé-na, lé-nu·, and ker-d-va, “I make;”
                    ker-é-sa, &amp;c. Welsh Romani retains all these forms, e.g., bitchcrava, “I
                    send;” shonesa, “thou hearest;” penela, “lie says;” bitcherasa, “we send;” vena,
                    “ye come;” bitcherena, “they send.” In -va {-mi in Asiatic R.), -sa, and -la
                    {ef. lo above) may be recognized the first, second, and third personal pronouns;
                    the n of the second and third persons plural may be compared with the n in
                    romén, “husbands.” The imperfect is formed from the present by the suffix of -s,
                    or, in the Hungarian dialect, -hi, e.g., T. kerdva-s, “I was making;” Hung.
                    kamesa-hi, “thou wast loving;” Vi. salles, “he was laughing,” jiνenes, “they
                    were living.” This -s or -hi is the third person singular of the auxiliary verb,
                    ιsl, “it is,” so that literally kcrdνas means “1 make + it is” (?sorne time
                    ago). Perfects are compounded of participles—ending in -do (rarely -to), -lo,
                    and -no— and the auxiliary verb. Thus from T. pirdva, “I walk,” part. pirdô,
                    comes pird-ém, “I walked,” pird-dn, “thou walkedst,” ρird-ds, “he walked,”
                    &amp;c.; and from dâva, “I give," part, din6, din6rn, “I gave.” Here too the
                    Welsh agrees generally with the Turkish dialect, c.g., kerdom, “I made,” keddan,
                    “thou madest,” kerdas, “he made;” but kedan, “we made,” should properly be
                    kerddm∙, and for the third person plural Welsh R., like the German and other
                    dialects, simply employs the plural participle, as dicktta, “they saw.” In
                    Continental dialects a pluperfect is formed from the perfect by adding to it
                    -a∙s or -a-hi, just as the imperfect from the present; and for a future karna-
                    {kamava, “I love, wish, or will”) is prefixed to the present, e.g., kama-kcrdva,
                    “I will do,” Jcarna-kerésa, “thou wilt do,” &amp;c. The sign of the subjunctive,
                    which supplies the place of an infinitive, is the conjunction te, “that,”
                    prefixed to the indicative, which usually drops its vowelending, e.g., T. teréla
                    düi lav te pénal ttike, “he has two words to tell (lit. that he tells) you;” W.
                    trashaday scslay te dicken man, “they were frightened to see (lit. that they
                    see) me.” Enough has been said to show that Romani is not so utterly “degraded
                    in its grammar” as Max Müller has declared it to be; and the following short
                    Welsh Gipsy story (printed literatim from Roberts) will illustrate some of the
                    foregoing remarks :—</p>
                <p>Yeker a doi ses bearengaro ta va ver store rnorsh; yek ses Once there were (a)
                    sailor and other four men; one was peltanengero, ta ow vaver ses koramangaro, ta

                    sailor asked the peltanengaro te vel apra ow doreav. Ow peltanengaro pendas,
                    blacksmith to come on the sea. The blacksmith said,</p>
                <p>“Nau, shorn te ja te kerra boottee.” “So se tero bootee?” “Te</p>
                <p>“No, (1) am to go to do work." “What is thy work?” “To tasarra sastarn,” chotchy
                    ow pelttenengaro, “ta te kerravles undra heat iron," quoth the blacksmith, “and

                    koramangaro pendas ta jalla te kel come in the ship. The soldier said that he
                    goes to make moyaben ta javaben; to sivamangaro pendas, “Shorn te ja te facings
                    and marching; and the tailor said, “(I)am to go to kerra esa te rigeren tomen
                    tatay.” A ow kirchimackaro pendas, make clothes to keep you warm." And the
                    innkeeper said,</p>
                <p>“Java ma te kerra lovina te kel tomen matay, te jan saw</p>
                <p>“Go I to make beer to make you drunk, that may go all to menday kai ow Beng.”
                    Okke saw dolestay.</p>
                <p>you to the Devil." Here (is) all to that (i.e., of that).</p>
                <p>The Romani vocabulary reveals positively and negatively the route by which the
                    Gipsies must have entered Europe, and the various ways by which they have since
                    dispersed to their present quarters. The absence, for instance, of Arabic
                    elements from every European dialect disproves a common belief that the earliest
                    immigrants may have landed in the Balkan peninsula from Egypt. On the other
                    hand, the presence of Persian and Armenian words shows that they must have
                    traversed and halted in the lands where those languages are spoken. Among the
                    Persian are <hi rend="italic">devruâl,</hi> “sea,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >poshôm,</hi> “wool,” <hi rend="italic">vesh,</hi> “forest,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >ambrol,</hi> “pear,” and <hi rend="italic">aυgin,</hi> “honey;” whilst the
                    Armenian words number twenty-six, according to Miklosich— <hi rend="italic"
                    >grast,</hi> “horse,” <hi rend="italic">chor,</hi> “deep,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >kotor,</hi> “apiece,” <hi rend="italic">morti,</hi> “skin,” Ac. Again,every
                    dialect presents a large number of Greek words, testifying to the long residence
                    of the Gipsies in a Greekspeaking land. In the German Romani dialect Miklosich
                    reckons forty-two, besides the article, in the English thirty, which latter
                    number might be certainly augmented. Alike in Russia and Spain, England and
                    Hungary, Gipsies call a road <hi rend="italic">drom</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(δρόμος),</hi> time <hi rend="italic">charros</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(καιρός),</hi> a horseshoe <hi rend="italic">petul (irirahov),</hi> a hat <hi
                    rend="italic">stadi</hi> (σκιάδι), &amp;c.; in every land of Europe <hi
                    rend="italic">eφτα,</hi> “seven,” οχτώ, “eight,” and <hi rend="italic"
                    >έννέα,</hi> “nine,” have superseded the <hi rend="italic">haut,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">asch,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nau</hi> of Asiatic Gipsies. This
                    identity of their borrowed words disproves the view that the Gipsies of
                    different European countries are the result of successive immigrations. Next to
                    the Greek, and almost more numerous than they, come the Slavonic elements.
                    Miklosich cites 70 from the German dialect, 30 from the English, and from the
                    Spanish 46, among them being <hi rend="italic">kralis,</hi> “king,” <hi
                    rend="italic">kitchima,</hi> “inn,” <hi rend="italic">mdtchka,</hi> “cat,” <hi
                    rend="italic">lovina,</hi> “ale,” and <hi rend="italic">plashta,</hi> “cloak.”
                    Similarly English Romani contains Wallachian, Magyar, German, and French words,
                    showing that the Gipsies reached England after wandering among Greeks, Slavs,
                    Magyars, Germans, and French. It must not, however, be inferred from the
                    foregoing that Romani is essentially other than an Indian speech. The Gipsies’
                    linguistic pilferings form but a small percentage in the 2332 articles gathered
                    together by Pott. And though some of these articles, founded on error, must be
                    struck out, their place might be more than filled up by omissions; and the sum
                    total is largely multiplied when one considers how many derivatives are grouped
                    under a single head. Altogether, the entire stock of Romani words probably
                    exceeds 5000, though the number known to any individual Gipsy is often
                    small.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Elements of Literature.—</hi> The Gipsies have no literature
                    worthy of the name—nothing but some rude ballads, some love and dance songs, and
                    a considerable mass of folk-tales. Valuable from a linguistic point of view, the
                    songs have little merit of their own, and seem to be mainly echoes of Gentile
                    strains. The folk-tales, however, would possibly repay a keener investigation
                    than they have yet received. Alike in Wales and Turkey they may be identified
                    with those of other Aryan races; scarce one has yet been published but its
                    counterpart maybe found in Grimm’s, Ralston’s, or other collections of European
                    folk-lore. For instance Paspati’s third story, taken down at Constantinople from
                    a Gipsy professional <hi rend="italic">raconteur,</hi> is unquestionably the
                    same as Grimm’s <hi rend="italic">Treuer</hi><hi rend="italic">Johannes.</hi>
                    Similarly in the Bukowina we meet with Romani versions of <hi rend="italic">Das
                    tapfere Schneiderlein,</hi><hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">zwei
                    Brüder,</hi> Ac., whilst <hi rend="italic">Nazdrivaηu</hi> may be matched from
                    Ralston’s <hi rend="italic">Bussian Folktales,</hi> p. 73, and frequent mention
                    is made of the waters of life and death, of hills that butt together like rams
                    (c∕ ’. Ralston, p. 236), and of other features common in Slavonic folk-lore.
                    This resemblance of Romani to Gentile storie3 may be explained (1) by the common
                    origin of the Aryan races, (2) by the Gipsies having borrowed from the nations
                    among whom they wander, or (3) by these nations having received their stories
                    from the Gipsies. Probably all three explanations are true by turns, but the
                    first is sometimes excluded by an identity of details too close to have been
                    preserved through untold ages, and as to the second it is hard to see how a
                    story current at Paderborn should have travelled eastward to Constantinople,
                    especially as Paspati’s tales, enshrining words and phrases otherwise obsolete,
                    are plainly of some antiquity. Accordingly the third explanation, that the
                    Gipsies may have carried <hi rend="italic">Treuer</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Johannes</hi> and other stories westward with them, deserves consideration.
                    Some of the Gaelic stories collected by Campbell were, it should be remarked,
                    taken <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n633/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0633-0616"/> down fromTinklers; and from a London Gipsy he
                    obtained a version of <hi rend="italic">The Master Thief</hi> which is current
                    also among Roumanian Gipsies. At present our information is far too scanty to
                    warrant a definite conclusion; but could it once be shown that the Asiatic
                    possess the same stories as the European Gipsies, it might be necessary to admit
                    that Europe owes α portion of its folk-lore to the Gipsies.<note anchored="true"

                    >Religious Beliefs and Observances.—“</hi> The Gipsies,” says Grellmann,
                    “brought no particular religion with them, but regulate themselves in religious
                    matters according to the country where they live, . . . wherefore most writers
                    place them below the heathens.” This author notwithstanding, the Gipsies mix
                    with their beginnings of Christianity or Mahometanism the relics of an older
                    faith. <hi rend="italic">Devel,</hi> their name for God or sky, is akin to the
                    Sanskrit “God” <hi rend="italic">(cf. dyaus,</hi> “sky ”), and the German Romani
                    <hi rend="italic">Miro baro deνel dela berschindo,</hi> “my great God gives
                    rain,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> “it rains,” preserves the original
                    signification. <hi rend="italic">Gviriben,</hi> “thunder” (lit. “bellowing of
                    cattle”), is another reminiscence of nature worship; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >trushul,</hi> “cross” (Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">trisulα,</hi> “the trident of
                    Siva ”), presents a curious instance of the transference of religious ideas. <hi
                    rend="italic">Beng,</hi> “devil,” compared by Miklosich with the Sanskrit <hi
                    rend="italic">bheka,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ii</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >iιogf</hi> is possibly a survival of serpent-worship, traces of which may be
                    also found in various phrases, stories, emblems, and customs. Survivals also of
                    phallic worship may probably be seen in the honour paid by the three great
                    German Gipsy clans to the fir-tree, the birch, and the hawthorn (Liebich, p.
                    38); and in the veneration in which Welsh Gipsies hold the fasciated vegetable
                    growth known as the <hi rend="italic">broado koro.</hi> There are besides a
                    number of other Gipsy superstitions interesting enough in themselves, but which
                    lose their full significance by being at present isolated or insufficiently
                    authenticated, such as, for instance, the alleged devotion of Norwegian Gipsies
                    to a moon-god, Alako (Sundt, 105-10). In the <hi rend="italic">People of
                    Turkey</hi> (1878) the Tchinghianés are said to keep a fire continually burning
                    in their camp; on the first of May to go all in a body to the sea-coast or banks
                    of a river, where they thrice throw water on their temples, invoking the
                    invisible <hi rend="italic">genii loci</hi> to grant their special wishes; and
                    annually to drink some potion, prepared in a way known only to the oldest and
                    wisest of the tribe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Modes of Life.—</hi> In Turkey, according to Paspati, the nomad
                    Tchinghianés far outnumber the sedentary; but how far the same statement is true
                    of Gipsies of other lands is hard to determine. Certain at least it is that in
                    England few house-dwelling Gipsies are to be met with who do not remember that
                    their forefathers followed a wandering life, or who do not themselves go
                    temporarily under canvas as hoppicking or the great race-meetings come round.
                    But though for centuries the tent has been the Gipsy’s normal habitation, it
                    would not seem to have been so always, if we look to the evidence of the Gipsy
                    tongue. For had it been, assuredly the Romani name for “tent” would be
                    everywhere the same, whereas the Persian Gipsy calls it <hi rend="italic"
                    >gnri,</hi> the nomad Tchinghiané <hi rend="italic">katana</hi> (modern Greek
                    κατo⅛), the sedentary <hi rend="italic">tcherga</hi> (Turkish <hi rend="italic"
                    >cherkeh),</hi> the Polish Gipsy <hi rend="italic">czater,</hi> the German <hi
                    rend="italic">tattin</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">tatto,</hi> “hot”), the
                    English <hi rend="italic">tan,</hi> &amp;c. On the other hand, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ker,</hi> “a house,” occurs in every dialect. From the time, however, of
                    Fitz-Simeon onwards Gipsies have everywhere been found dwelling in tents, and
                    his description of these tents as “like those of the Arabs, low, black, and
                    oblong,” tallies with Mr Boswell’s:—</p>
                <p>“The tents are made of rough blankets. They are nearlv always brown ones, because
                    the white blankets are not so good for the rain. First of all they measure the
                    ground with a ridge-pole, then they take the kettle-prop and make the holes
                    exactly opposite each other. Then they take up the ridge-pole and stick all the
                    rods into it. Then there is a blanket that goes behind, and is pinned on with
                    pin-thorns; next to that come the large ones over the top of all, also pinned
                    with the same pins.”</p>
                <p>In the matter of dress, Mr Crofton, in <hi rend="italic">Papers of the Manchester
                    Literary Club</hi> (1876), infers that “Gipsies formerly had a distinctive
                    costume, consisting of a turbanlike headdress of many colours, together with a
                    large cloak, worn after the fashion of a toga, over a long loos© under-skirt.”
                    The Gipsies, however, of to-day can hardly be said to have a distinctive garb,
                    though certain minutiae of dress still render them easily recognizable. In
                    Transylvania, for instance, their women’s ear-rings differ in pattern from those
                    of the natives; the Hungarian Gipsy chief wears silver buttons, bearing a
                    serpent crest; and his old-fashioned English brother decks his Newmarket coat
                    with spade-guineas or crown-pieces. The English Gipsy woman may be known by her
                    bright silk handkerchief, her curiously-plaited hair, her massy rings, her coral
                    or bead necklace, and by the <hi rend="italic">monging-guno,</hi> a tablecloth
                    arranged bag wise over her back. In August 1878 Queen Victoria was welcomed to
                    Dunbar by a Gipsy “queen,” one of the Reynolds family, who w as “dressed in a
                    black robe with white silk trimmings, and over her shoulders wore a yellow
                    handkerchief. Behind her stood two other women, one of them noticeable from her
                    rich gown of purple velvet, and two stalwart men, conspicuous by their scarlet
                    coats.” On the other hand, the dress of the children upon the Continent is
                    simple, not to say scanty.</p>
                <p>Everywhere Gipsies ply an endless variety of trades. In Egypt they monopolize the
                    art of serpent-charming; in France and Spain they sit as professional models; in
                    England we meet Gipsy Methodist preachers, actors, quack doctors,
                    chimney-sweeps, carpenters, factory hands, &lt;fcc. But everywhere the men have
                    three principal callings— workers in metals, musicians, and horse-dealers;
                    everywhere the women are “pleasaunt dauncers” as in the days of Andrew Boorde,
                    and by peddling and fortune-telling contribute their share—often more than their
                    share—to the family purse. Gipsies have long been famous as copper and iron
                    smiths in south-eastern Europe, where their horseshoes are reckoned unrivalled.
                    The <hi rend="italic">cαlderari</hi> (coppersmiths) of Hungary and Transylvania,
                    at certain intervals make trading tours to Germany, France, England, Norway, and
                    even Spain and Algeria. The workers in iron, on the other hand, seldom or never
                    quit the land of their adoption, as neither naturally do the few remaining
                    awwi', or Gipsy gold-washers of Transylvania. Simson describes a primitive
                    Tinkler method of smelting iron, and the caves of Granada still echo to the
                    clink of Gipsy anvils; but in England the surname <hi rend="italic"
                    >Petulengro,</hi> “smith” (from <hi rend="italic">ρetul,</hi> “horseshoe”),
                    alone recalls the days when Gipsies surpassed the Gentile in the farrier’s
                    craft. Liszt, in his work <hi rend="italic">Des Bohémiens et de leur Musique en
                    Hongrie</hi> (Paris, 1859), ascribes to the Gipsies the creation of Hungary’s
                    national music. Bartalus (1868) contests the theory, but few would hesitate to
                    admit its plausibility who at the Paris Exhibition (1878) or elsewhere have
                    listened to the Gipsies’ thrilling performance of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >czardas,</hi> or are familiar with the undoubted compositions of Bihary,
                    Csermak, and other Gipsy <hi rend="italic">maestri.</hi> The Gipsy’s favourite
                    instrument is the violin, but few are the instruments he has not successfully
                    essayed. The Eisteddfods of Wales have witnessed the triumphs of Gipsy harpists;
                    and hundreds have been charmed by the concerts of the Roberts family, not
                    knowing they were hearing a Gipsy band. “The Egyptians,” as Krantzius drily
                    remarked in 1520, “frequently change their horses;” horse-dealing and
                    horse-stealing are too often synonymous terms with them. Fortune-telling is on
                    the wane with Gentiles’ waning belief in the fortune-teller<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0634-0617"/>’s powers. The Gipsy crone can no longer persuade
                    the yeoman’s wife to bury her treasure in the earth, and return in a fortnight’s
                    time to find it—gone. Those halcyon days of <hi rend="italic">maanzin</hi> are
                    passed by; the servants’ hall is now the only El Dorado left. Enclosure Acts
                    have struck a deadly blow at English Gipsydom, driving the wanderers from breezy
                    common and turf-edged lane to the smoky suburbs of great towns, or at best the
                    outskirts of some watering place. Here, surrounded by Gentiles, the younger
                    generation forget the wisdom of the Egyptians, relinquish time-honoured customs,
                    and, wedding with the sons and daughters of the land, widen the stream of Romani
                    blood, and so diminish its “depth.” Several accounts have been furnished of
                    Romani marriages, but they rarely tally, and some (Bright’s, Borrow’s, and Si m3
                    on’s) do not bear quotation. On the Continent one common feature is the breaking
                    by the chief of a flower-crowned pitcher, from whose fragments, as they are many
                    or few, he argues the fortunes of the bridal -pair. There are many curious Gipsy
                    practices relating to death and burial, such as waking the corpse, burning the
                    deceased’s effects, the fasting of his kinsfolk, and a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">tabu.</hi> The earliest record of Gipsies burning the property of
                    their dead occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Annual Register</hi> for 1773, p.
                    142: “The clothes of the late Diana Boswell, queen of the Gipsies, value .£50,
                    were burnt in the Mint, Southwark, by her principal courtiers, according to
                    ancient custom” <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Liebich, p. 55). Abstention from
                    flesh or some other delicacy is not always a sign of mourning for the dead <hi
                    rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Crofton in <hi rend="italic">Papers of the Man. Lit.
                    Chib,</hi> 1877); but its most interesting form is where a Gipsy wife or child
                    for ever renounces the favourite delicacy of the dead husband or parent. Like
                    motives prompt the dropping of the dead Gipsy’s name entirely out of use, any
                    survivors who happen to bear the same changing it to another. Much might be
                    written of a kind of ceremonial purity prescribed by Gipsy law, and indicated in
                    the language by the distinction between <hi rend="italic">chiklo,</hi> “dirty,”
                    and <hi rend="italic">mokadο,</hi> “unclean.” To wash a tablecloth with clothes
                    is <hi rend="italic">mοkado,</hi> since it is connected with food; and a German
                    Gipsy woman may not cook for four months after childbirth, while a vessel
                    touched by the skirt of a woman’s dress is held to be defiled. But with one
                    other widespread practice we must take our leave of Gipsy customs, that, namely,
                    of leaving at a cross-road a handful of grass or leaves, a heap of stones, a
                    stick or some such mark <hi rend="italic">(f)atrin,</hi> “leaf ”) to guide the
                    stragglers of the band. See Liebich, p. 96, and Smart and Crofton, p. 199; and
                    compare “Pola,” in Sleeman’s <hi rend="italic">Ramaseeaηa, or a Vocabulary of
                    the Thugs</hi> (Calcutta, 1836).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Character.—</hi> The Gipsy character, strange medley of evil
                    and of good, presents itself as black and hateful to the outside world, whilst
                    to the Romani race it is all that is fair and lovable. “There ’s nothing worse
                    than mumply Gentiles” is a saying often in Gipsy mouths, which affords a clue to
                    much that is puzzling in the Gipsy’s nature. He is at war with mankind, for
                    centuries his oppressors, and, all being fair in war, may plunder and beguile at
                    will, so that he be not caught. Gipsies’ light-heartedness and courtesy are
                    patent to all men; but only to true or adopted members of the tribe are their
                    inmost hearts revealed. Their principal faults are childish vanity, professional
                    cunning, indolence (caused by the absence of ambition), and a hot passionate
                    temper. But they are a≡ ready to forgive as they are quick to resent a wrong;
                    and before implicit confidence their cunning gives place to inviolate honour, a
                    fact borne strongly out by an incident in the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of the
                    actor Charles Mayne Young (p. 186, ed. 1871). Their family affection is
                    intensely strong, prompting a parent never to chastise a younger child, a
                    grown-up son meekly to take a thrashing from his father; and they are lavishly
                    generous to such as are poorer than themselves, even though Gentiles. Their love
                    of nature reveals itself in a hundred quaint, poetic phrases, in a familiarity
                    with beasts and herbs; their love of dumb creatures in the number of their pets.
                    Quick and versatile, all Gipsies readily adapt themselves to any state of life;
                    they have so wonderful a gift of tongues that formerly it was reckoned against
                    them for a proof of sorcery. That hitherto the race has produced, outside the
                    realm of music, none but mute geniuses, is rather due tσ lack of education than
                    of ability; but “Zingaro” seems to have only been a nickname of the Quentin
                    Matsys of the. South, Antonio Solario(1382-1455),and John Bunyan from parish
                    registers does not appear to have had one drop of Gipsy blood <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Physique.—</hi> Outwardly as within Gipsies present strong
                    contrasts, some being strangely hideous, others very beautiful, though not with
                    a regular, conventional beauty. Finely proportioned, they are as a race of
                    middle stature, but lithe and sinewy, insensible to cold or wet, capable of
                    supporting great fatigue. They pride themselves on their small hands and feet;
                    corpulence rarely occurs, and only with the older women. The hair, black or dark
                    brown,, inclines to coarseness, is often frizzled, and does not soon turn grey;
                    the complexion, a tawny olive, was compared by the Plymouth Pilgrims (1622) to
                    that of the Indians of North America. The teeth are of dazzling whiteness and
                    perfect regularity, the cheekbones high; and the aquiline nose is overhung by a
                    strongly-marked brow, knit often in deep lines of thought. But the most striking
                    feature is the full, dark eye, now lustreless, then changing to an expression of
                    mysterious, childlike sorrow, presently blazing forth with sudden passion. As is
                    the case in other Oriental races, the Gipsies early develop and early fade. See,
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Archivfür Anthropologie</hi> (1872), M. Isidor
                    Kopernicki’s learned and exhaustive treatise on Gipsy craniology.</p>
                <p>Theories as to Origin.—Several attempts have been made to· identify Gipsies with
                    nomad Indian tribes: Grellmann, for example, discovers them in the Südras,
                    Richardson in the Nats (Asiatic Researches, vol. vii. 1784), Leland in the Doms,
                    and B. R. Mitra in the Bediyâs (Memoirs of London Anthrop. Soc., vol. iii.,
                    1870). These theories, however, need not detain us long; they rest merely on
                    analogies, real or imagined, between the manners of Gipsies andsuch Indian
                    vagrants, and not on the evidence of language. Nor, were it even shown that any
                    or all of these pariahs speak Roman? among themselves, would such a discovery
                    throw of necessity much light on the origin of our European Gipsies; it might
                    simply prove that India has its Gipsy tι ’ ibes. It is otherwise with the
                    identification of Gipsies with the Jats, who in the Punjab alone numbered (1871)
                    1,309,399,—a theory started by Pott, elaborated by Bataillard, and supported by
                    Newbold, Sir H. Rawlinson (Proceedings of the Geogr. Soc., vol. i., 1857),
                    Professor de Goeje (Bijdrage tot de-Geschiedcnis der Zigeuners, Amst., 1875),
                    Captain Burton (Academy* March 27, 1875), and a writer in the Edinburgh Review
                    (July 1878). About 420 A.D., says Firdousi (circa 1000), the Persian monarch
                    Behram Gur imported 10,000 minstrels from India, assigning them lands and
                    cattle. But they, wasting their substance, angered the king, who bade them take
                    their instruments, and roaming through the land procure by their songs a
                    livelihood, “wherefore the Lûri now wander about the world.” Hamza, the Arab
                    historian of Ispahan (c. 940), had already told how Behram dispersed through the
                    cities of his realm 12,000 Indian musicians, “whose descendants are known as
                    Zuth;” and of three writers who repeat the tale Mirkhond (15th century) calls
                    the musicians Djatt. Thus Lûri (mod. Pers. “Gipsy”) appears to be synonymous
                    with· Zuth or Jat, the name on the one hand of Damascus Gipsies (?), on the
                    other of an agricultural and cattle-breeding race inhabiting the valley of the
                    Indus. Neither are records lacking of westward migrations of Jats from the
                    Indus, as in 714 to Mopsuestia and Antioch, while in 810 we hear of them in the
                    Tigris valley, in 834 in the marshes of Khuzistan, in 855 in the territory of
                    the Byzantine empire (Goeje). Jat theorists differ as to the date of the great
                    migration that gave Europe its Gipsies, the Edinburgh Review writer placing it
                    at 1025, while Sir Henry Rawlinson regards our Gipsies as lineal descendants of
                    Firdousi’s Lûri. These writers, however, all agree in making the Gipsies Jats;
                    but none have essayed the necessary comparison of Romani and Jataki (the idiom
                    of the living Indian Jats), though Captain Burton himself has published a
                    grammar of the latter in the Journal of the Bombay Asiatic Society'</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n635/mode/1up"

                <p>(Bombay, 1849). We have seen that the dialect of the Turkish Gipsies has
                    remained, unchanged for near five centuries, and the Jats are said to “preserve
                    their vernacular toDgue wherever they go.” Supposing Gipsies then to have broken
                    off from the main Jat stem so late as the eleventh, or even as early as the
                    fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.i&gt;.,</hi> we should look for a striking
                    resemblance between Jâtaki and Romani. Compare, however, with the foregoing
                    paradigms the following from Burton’s grammar:— <hi rend="smallcaps">Sing.</hi>
                    nom. ghorà, “a horse;” gen. ghore-dd∙, dat. ghore∙ndn∖ acc. ghord∙, abl.
                    ghore-te or -Ion, “from a horse;” <hi rend="smallcaps">Plvr.</hi> nom. ghore∙,
                    gen. ghoridn or ghorcn∙ dd; dat. ghoridn nun, &amp;c. The Jâtaki third personal
                    pronoun, again, runs:— <hi rend="smallcaps">Sing.</hi> nom. uha, “he;” gen.
                    usadd∖ dat. and ac.c. usnun∖ abl. ustc∙, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plur.</hi> nom.
                    uhc∙, gen. uhindd, kc.: its verbal formation is almost equally unlike the
                    Romani. In the face of the great unlikeness of Romani and Jâtaki one may well
                    concur with Bataillard in the rejection of this theory, and proceed to consider
                    the later views of that writer as advanced <hi rend="subscript"> A</hi> in Les
                    Origines des Tsiganes (Par., 1875), Les Tsiganes de l'Age du Bronze (Par.,
                    1876), and État de la question de l'ancienneté des Tsiganes en Europe (Par.,
                    1877). He now believes the Gipsies to have existed in Europe from immemorial
                    times,—a conclusion to which he is led by the absence of any record of their
                    passage across the Bosphorus, by their enslaved condition in Wallachia in the
                    14th century, by the casual notices cited above of their presence at a still
                    earlier date, and by their present monopoly of metallurgical arts in
                    South-Eastern Europe. These mainly negative proofs lose some of their force when
                    we remark that neither is any record known to exist of the passage of Gipsies to
                    England, Scotland, or America; and that at Corfu in 1346 (i.c., in historic
                    times) we read of Gipsies being reduced to vassalage. Assuredly it is a mighty
                    leap from the Athingani of the 9th century A.n. to the Sigynnae of Herodotus (v.
                    9), whom Bataillard claims for the ancestors of the Gipsy race. The strength,
                    however, of the theory lies less in attempted identifications than in its
                    explanation of the unsolved problem, What was the race that carried bronze to
                    Northern and Western Europe l Referring for a general survey of the question to
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Archaeology,</hi> to E. Chantre’s Λge de Bronze
                    (4 vols., Paris, 1877), and to Lubbock’s Prehistoric Times (2d ed., London,
                    1869), we extract from the last-named work the following passages:—“The absence
                    of implements made either of copper or tin seems to indicate that the art of
                    making bronze was introduced into Europe, [a view confirmed by the fact that]
                    wherever we find the bronze swords or celts they are the same, not similar in
                    character, but identical. . . . The discovery of moulds proves that the art of
                    casting in bronze was known and practised in many countries. Hence it appears
                    most probable that the knowledge of metal is one of those great discoveries
                    which Europe owes to the East. . . . The implements of bronze appear to have
                    belonged to a race with smaller hands than those of the present European nation.
                    . . . As regards the smallness of the hands, we must remember that Hindus •share
                    this peculiarity with Egyptians. . . . The Phoenicians were well acquainted with
                    the use of iron. . . . We have still very much to learn in regard to the race by
                    whom the knowledge of metal was introduced into our continent.” Each passage
                    suggests or is explained by the supposition that this was no other than the
                    small-handed and eastern Gipsy race. The Calderari work exclusively in copper,
                    never in iron; no Gipsy bronze-smith would have spoilt his trade by introducing
                    iron. Traces might perhaps yet be found in Norway of the workings of a band of
                    Calderari, who visited that country in 1874; and certainly the utensils they
                    wrought in France were exactly similar to those that they wrought in Norway.
                    Bataillard’s theory is strengthened by the fact that so high au authority as Μ.
                    de Mortillct—who is followed by Chantre and Burnouf—had been independently led
                    to a like conclusion in 1874. Its strongest confirmation, however, is the
                    important discovery of Dr Kopernicki that in Eastern Galicia there survive to
                    the present day certain Zlotars (Ruth. ‘ ‘ goldsmiths”), Gipsy workers in
                    bronze, whose processes Bataillard minutely describes in Les Zlotars (Paris,
                    1878). Difficulties there are in accepting the theory:—the unsettled question of
                    the antiquity of the Romani tongue; the yawning chasm of a thousand years; above
                    all, the unnoticed fact that nearly all the metallurgical terms of Romaui seem
                    to be borrowed from Greek— kaldi, “tin” (καλαίον); khârkoma, “copper”
                    (χάλκωμα)·, moliv, “lead” (μολύβιον); kakkaνi, “kettle” (κακκάβτη); amuni,
                    “anvil" (iμ6vι}; rin, “file” (fnvi); sivri, “hammer” (σφυρί); ksildvi, “pincers”
                    (ξυλάδων); karfin, “nail” (καρφί); klidi, “key” (κλίΐδί); gampdna, “bell”
                    (καμπάνα)·, and petalo, “horseshoe” (ιreταλox). This looks like an insuperable
                    objection, since certainly no Calderari of to-day would borrow from French or
                    German the names for these the most familiar objects of his long-practised
                    calling; and unless Bataillard be prepared to maintain that Greek took the terms
                    from Romani, not vice versa, his theory falls.</p>
                <p>Bibliography.—The literature on the Gipsies is richer in appearance thanin
                    reality. Miklosich(i. 54-59)and Bataillard(Les derniers Travaux relatifs aux
                    Bohémiens, Paris, 1872) give the titles of 118 works, a number which might be
                    largely increased. But many of these “works” are articles hidden away in
                    periodicals, as “The</p>
                <p>English Gipsies,” by the Rev. S. James, in The Church of England Magazine, 1875;
                    many are mere rechauffés of earlier publications. Imperfect though it be,
                    Grellmann’s Historischer Versuch über die Zigeuner (1783; 2d and enlarged ed.,
                    Gött., 1787; Eng. translation by Μ. Raper, 1787) remains the only attempt at a
                    full history of the Gipsy race; its grave deficiencies are best supplied by
                    Sprengler’s Dissertatio historica-jιιridica de Cinganis sive Zigeunis Leyden,
                    1839), by Hopf's Einwanderung der Zigeuner in Europa (Gotha, 1870), by the
                    historical portions of Miklosich’s work, and above all by Bataillard’s De
                    l'Apparition ct de la Dispersion des Bohémiens en Europe (Paris,1844), Nouvelles
                    Recherches (Paris,1849), and État de la Question, &amp;c. (Paris, 1877). On the
                    language viewed as a whole the chief authorities are—Die Zigeuner in Europa und
                    Asien (2 vois,, Halle, 1844-45), by A. F. Pott; Zigeunerisches (Halle, 1865), by
                    G. H. Ascoli; and Ucbcr die Mundarten und dic Wanderungen der Zigeuner Europa's
                    (8 parts, Vienna, 1872-78), and Beiträge zur Kenntniss der Zigeunermundarten (4
                    parts, Vienna, 1874-78), by F. von Miklosich. From works on the Gipsies of
                    different European lands the following may be given as a selection (the more
                    important being marked with an asterisk) :—for Turkey, *Études sur les
                    Tchinghianés (Constan., 1870), by A. G. Γaspati; for Roumania, the

                    1830), by T. Narbutt; for Russia, Ucbcr die Sprache der Zigeuner in Russland (St
                    Pct. 1853), by 0. Bohtlingk; for Norway, Bcrctning am Fante-ellcr

                    Borrow, and *The Dialect of the English Gipsies (1875), by B. Smart and H. T.

                    Borrow. From works on non-European Gipsies selection is unnecessary, since their
                    sum total is as follows:—“Lieber die Sprache der Zigeuner in Syrien,” by Pott,
                    in Zeitschrift für die Wissenschaft der Sprache (Berlin, 1846); Reisen durch
                    Syrien, Palästina, kc. (Berlin, 1854), by U. J. Seetzen, containing a
                    Syro-Romani vocabulary; * “The Gipsies of Egypt,” in the Joum. of the Roy.

                    gives a Karachi vocabulary. To these may be added the specimens of the Gipsy
                    dialects of Asia Minor, furnished by Paspati, and vocabularies from Armenia and
                    Siberia in Miklosich’s Beiträge (iv. pp. 38-41). (F. H. G.)</p>
