                    number of undoubtedly genuine examples, extending from the mists of Babylonian
                    antiquity to the decline of Roman civilization, and again starting with a new
                    but unnatural impulse on the revival of art. Apart from workmanship they possess
                    the charm3 of colour deep, rich, and varied, of material unequalled for its
                    endurance, and of scarcity which in many instances has been enhanced by the
                    strangeness of the lands whence they came, or the fortuity of their occurrence.
                    These qualities united within the small compass of a gem were precisely such as
                    were required in a seal as a thing of constant use, so inalienable in its
                    possession as to become naturally a personal ornament and an attractive medium
                    of artistic skill, no less than the centre of traditions or of religious and
                    legeudary associations. As regards the nations of classical antiquity all seals
                    are classed as gems, though in many cases the material is not such as would
                    strictly come under that heading. On the other hand, gems properly so called
                    were not always seals. Many of the Babylonian cylinders could not have been so
                    employed without great difficulty, and when Herodotus (i. 195) speaks of every
                    Babylonian wearing a seal <hi rend="italic">(σφpηγi&lt;s),</hi> it may have been
                    in most cases no other than a talisman having an inherent power derived from the
                    subject of its design, consisting perhaps mostly of figures of protecting
                    deities. He adds that every Babylonian carried also a staff on which it was
                    unlawful for him not to have the figure of an apple, a rose, a lily, an eagle,
                    or something else, as his badge or <hi rend="italic">ςπίσηρον,</hi> from which
                    it may perhaps be inferred that having selected some such badge for his staff he
                    would necessarily have the same for the seal with which he attested his name.
                    But if that had been the case, then the great mass of existing cylinders could
                    not have been seals in the ordinary sense. In Greece and Rome within historic
                    times, gems were worn engraved with designs to show that the bearer was an
                    adherent of a particular worship, the follower of a certain philosopher, or the
                    attached subject of an emperor. It cannot be said that these gems may not have
                    been used systematically as seals, but it is clear that they primarily served a
                    different purpose. Again, when the sense of personal ornament naturally
                    attaching to a seal increased, and the resources both of material and skill were
                    enlarged, the process of engraving gems in cameo, that is, with the design in
                    relief mostly in such stones as by their differently coloured layers could be
                    made to present a variety of surfaces, came largely into fashion (see article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cameo,</hi> and figs. 18,19 in Plate L). As a rule these
                    cameos are of a date subsequent to that of Alexander the Great; but there are
                    exceptions in an Egyptian cameo in the Louvre, said to belong to the 12th
                    dynasty, about 3000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and in some few Etruscan
                    scarabs, which havingdesigns in intaglio on the face have also reliefs engraved
                    on the back, apparently in the same archaic manner of art as the intaglios. Such
                    a scarab in carnelian was found at Orvieto in 1874 in a tomb along with vases
                    dating from the beginning of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and
                    it will be seen from the engraving of this gem <hi rend="italic">(Archäol.

                    evidently the same subject which occurs on a scaraboid found in the treasury of
                    Curium in Cyprus by General Cesnola (see his <hi rend="italic">Cyprus,</hi> pl.

                    be the same in subject and treatment as a carnelian fragment, apparently cut
                    from the back of a scaraboid, now in the British Museum. As further examples of
                    the same rare form of cameo, the following scaraboids in the British Museum may

                <p>In gem engraving the principal modern implement is a wheel or minute copper disc,
                    driven in the manner of a lathe, and moistened with olive oil mixed with emery
                    or diamond dust. There is no proof of its use among the ancients, but M. Soldi,
                    a practical authority on the subject, believes <hi rend="italic">{Revue
                    Arch.,</hi> 1874, xxviii. p. 147) that it was known before the time of Pliny,
                    whose expression <hi rend="italic">fervor</hi><hi rend="italic">terebrarum,</hi>
                    as applied to the cutting of very hard stones, would fittingly characterize the
                    rapid movement of the wheel. At the same time these words, apparently the only
                    ancient statement on the question, may equally refer to the motion of the drill,
                    an instrument of constant use in antiquity, which in this case was employed to
                    drive an iron tool fitted with a diamond point or splinter. In intaglios, when
                    the larger spaces had been sunk with the drill, the design was worked out in
                    detail by a tool with a diamond point, and finally polished, but not, it would
                    appear, to the extent to which polishing is carried in modern work, for this
                    reason, no doubt, that their finer tools left less of roughness to be smoothed
                    away. Still a gem highly polished in the interior of the design need not be
                    taken to be modern on that account, since it is known that many genuine ancient
                    gems have been repolished in modern times, and since it is not known whether
                    ancient engravers may not sometimes have resorted to excess of this process;
                    while on the other hand an intaglio dim in the surface of its design is not
                    necessarily antique, since modern engravers have observed this peculiarity, and
                    have imitated it with a success which, were there no other suspicions, might
                    escape detection. Except in the hardest stones, much of the ancient gem
                    engraving seems to have been done by a simple copper tool duly moistened and
                    supplied with emery <hi rend="italic">{σpdpυs</hi> or σ7z√pιs, naxium). The
                    Ethiopians in the time of Xerxes employed a flint instrument, if that is what
                    Herodotus means (vii. 69) when he says that their arrows were tipped “not with
                    iron but with a sharp stone, with which they also engrave their seals.” With
                    such a tool steatite could be easily engraved, and it should be remembered that
                    among very early gems this material is of frequent occurrence, while in the
                    later art of Greece and Rome it can scarcely be said to exist; aud the inference
                    is that, when processes had been invented to cut harder stones, the softer
                    substances were discarded. Still it would not be correct to found more than a
                    general argument as to the comparative ages of gems on the different degrees of
                    resistance in the stones them3elves, even when dealing with the works of one
                    nationality, much less so in a review of ancient gems as a whole, for this
                    reason, among others, that the decline of art is in technical matters often very
                    like its infancy. It would be easy to show from published criticisms how certain
                    classes of rude intaglios have been regarded now as the very earliest efforts of
                    the art, now as debased; and at times it is difficult to choose between these
                    judgments. In the present state of knowledge it may seem idle to inquire where
                    the infancy of the art was passed. One thinks in Egypt, which otherwise is known
                    for its intimate skill in working hard stones. Another says Assyria, which
                    doubtless had a civilization as remote as that of Egypt, but has left no similar
                    evidence of the mastery of obdurate substances. The architectural and the
                    artistic remains of the two nations present this broad distinction, that they
                    are of much harder material in the one case than in the other, whence it would
                    be reasonable to expect that at least the invention of the pointed tools had
                    proceeded from Egypt, though of course if the idea of engraving gems originated
                    with soft stones and simple implements such as flints, that origin may well have
                    been in Assyria. Possibly the marked difference in the shape of the gems
                    peculiar to these two nations bespeaks little contact between them in this
                    matter. The favourite shapes in Assyria were the cylinder pierced lengthways,
                    and sometimes fitted with a swivel so as to be used as a seal, and the cone also
                    pierced but not requiring a swivel, since the design was cut on its base. When
                    inscribed, a cylinder generally states three things,—the name of the owner, his
                    father’s name, and the name of his protecting deity. But there are exceptions,
                    as for example, a cylinder in the Bibliothèque at Paris inscribed, “Alchaloum,
                    servant of Jehastukur,” which from the Semitic form of name “Alchaloum” has been
                    thought to have belonged to a Jewish captive in Babylon. A cylinder supposed to
                    be the seal of Sennacherib, in the British Museum, is not inscribed. Another,
                    purporting to be the seal of Igli, son of Uruck, the oldest king of Assyria, is
                    rejected by Μ. Oppert as not having any such antiquity. An agate seal from
                    Khorsabad reads, “Nipishi, of King Tiglath Pileser, king of Assyria, son of Haou
                    Liklikhus, king of Assyria.” But, as has already been said, many of the
                    cylinders could not have been employed as seals without difficulty, and it
                    appears to result from the most recent study of the designs on them that
                    frequently their main function was to act as talismans in the system of magic
                    generated among the Chaldaeans. In what seems to be the oldest examples the
                    design is sunk by a pointed tool pushed backward and forward in long straight
                    lines. In the next stage round cavities are sunk here and there in the design by
                    means of a drill, when greater depth is required, while the shallow parts are
                    worked out with the pointed instrument. By practice in utilizing both methods
                    the Assyrians reached whatever skill they could boast in this branch of art. The
                    materials are haematite, jasper, calcedony, sard, basalt, agate, lapis lazuli,
                    rock crystal, alabaster, porcelain, quartz, glazed clay. Mr King classes them
                    under four periods, beginning as early as 2234 B.c.</p>
                <p>In Egypt the favourite form of gem was a scarab (beetle), having a flat surface
                    underneath, on which was engraved a hieroglyphic design. The common materials
                    are green jasper and porcelain. From the soft nature of the porcelain, and from
                    the strict adherence to the scarab shape, it may be inferred that they were used
                    much less as seals than as a sort of badges or ornaments, and this is confirmed
                    by the finding of large numbers of them in foreign countries, as at Camirus in
                    Rhodes and in Etruria, where the hieroglyphics could not have been understood.
                    No doubt it may be true that these specimens had been manufactured by
                    Phoenicians for export to these countries merely as articles of ornament, but
                    had the originals been strictly held by the Egyptians to be seals, it would have
                    been the height of dishonesty in the Phoenicians to reproduce them in this way.
                    In Egypt, however, the art of gem engraving was not confined altogether to
                    scarabs, as may be seen among other interesting exceptions in the oblong
                    intaglio of green jasper in the Louvre <hi rend="italic">{Gazette</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Archéoh,</hi> 1878, p. 41) with a design on both sides,
                    representing on the obverse, as known from the cartouche, Thothmes II. (1800 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) slaying a lion, and on the reverse the same king
                    drawing his bow against his enemies from a war chariot. In the Louvre also is an
                    Egyptian gem, said to belong to the 12th dynasty, 3000 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> But uninteresting in themselves as are the scarabs of Egypt, they
                    have this accidental importance in the history of gem engraving that they
                    furnished the Phoenicians with a model which they first improved as regards the
                    intaglio by a freer spirit of design, gathered partly from Egypt and partly from
                    Assyria (see the Phoenician scarabs from Tharras in Sardinia and from Cyprus).
                    The scarab thus improved <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n147/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0147-0138"/> they communicated to the Etruscans, under whose
                    skilful hands it received often a degree of delicacy in the workmanship which
                    has not been equalled in the gems of any other country. The best specimens are
                    due to the influence of Greek art in the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> or somewhat later. The subjects engraved are Greek in origin, and the
                    habit of inscribing the names of the subjects is an early Greek habit, but with
                    this difference, that the Greeks would be correct in the naming, while the
                    Etruscan artists are perhaps as often wrong as right. The name of Tydeus, for
                    instance (TYTE), is assigned in one case to a figure scraping himself with a
                    strigil, and in another to a fallen warrior, who otherwise would be identified
                    as Capaneus. Again a figure washing his hair is called Peleus, and Achilles
                    sulking becomes Theseus, to the exercise of much ingenuity in times past. With
                    these and other examples it should no longer be necessary to cast about for an
                    unusual form of the legend of the Seven against Thebes, when five only of their
                    names are found beside five figures on what is the most celebrated of existing
                    scarabs—a carnelian in the Berlin Museum (Winckelmann, <hi rend="italic">Alte
                    Denkmäler,</hi> No. 105). Another scarab of first importance is a banded onyx in

                <p>While the Phoenicians have left actual specimens to show with what skill they
                    could adopt the systems of gem engraving prevailing at their time in Egypt and
                    Assyria, the Israelites, on the other hand, have left records to prove, if not
                    their skill, at least the estimation in which they held engraved gems. “The sin
                    of Judah is written with a pen of iron and with the point of a diamond” (Jerem.
                    xvii. 1). To pledge his word Judah gave Tamar his signet, bracelets, and staff
                    (Gen. xxviii. 18); whence, if this passage be compared with the frequent use of
                    “seal” in a metaphorical sense in the Bible, and with the usage of the
                    Babylonians already cited from Herodotus, it may be concluded that among the
                    Israelites also every man of mark at least wore a signet. Their acquaintance
                    with the use of seals in Egypt and Assyria is seen in the statement that Pharaoh
                    gave Joseph his seal as a badge of investiture (Gen. xli. 42), and that the
                    stone which closed the den of lions was sealed by Darius with his own signet and
                    with the signet of his lords (Daniel vi. 17). Then as to the stones which were
                    most prized, Ezekiel (xxviii. 13), speaking of the prince of Tyre, mentions the
                    sardius, topaz, and diamond, the beryl, onyx, and jasper, the sapphire, emerald,
                    and carbuncle, stones which again occur in that most memorable of records, the
                    description of the breastplate of the high priest (Exodus xxviii. 16-21, and
                    xxxix. 8). Twelve stones grouped in four rows, each with three specimens, may be
                    arranged on a square, measuring a palm, not a span, so as to have the rows
                    placed either vertically or horizontally. If they are to cover the whole square,
                    then they must be cut in an oblong form, and if the names engraved on them are
                    to run lengthwise, as is the manner of Assyrian cylinders, then the stone3, to
                    be legible, must be grouped in four horizontal rows of three each. There is in
                    fact no reason to suppose that the gems of the breastplate were in any other
                    form than that of cylinders such a3 abounded to the knowledge of the Israelites,
                    with this possibility, however, that they may have been cut lengthways into
                    half-cylinders like a fragmentary one of sard in the British Museum, which has
                    been mounted in bronze, and, as a remarkable exception, has been set with three
                    small precious stones now missing. It could not have been a seal, because of
                    this setting, and because the inscription is not reversed. It reads: “Nabu ....
                    [son of] Iddina-Nergal (Î). . . . son of Nabu-zira-iddin .... Khi (l)-su-ba
                    ....,” according to Mr Pinches. The names of the twelve tribes, not their
                    standards, as has been thought, may have been engraved in this fashion, just as
                    on the two onyx stones in the preceding verses (Exodus xxviii. 9-11), where
                    there can be no question but that actual names were incised. On these two stones
                    the order of the namee was according to primogeniture, and this, it is likely,
                    would apply to the breastplate also. The accompanying diagram will show how the
                    stones, supposing them to have been cylinders or half cylinders may have been
                    arranged consistently with the descriptions of the Septuagint. In the
                    arrangement of Josephus the jasper is made to change places with the sapphire,
                    and the amethyst with the agate, while our version differs partly in the order
                    and partly iu the names of the stones, but probably in all these accounts the
                    names had in some cases other meanings than those which they now carry. From the
                    fact that to each tribe was assigned a stone of different colour, it may be
                    taken that in each case the colour was one which belonged prescriptively to the
                    tribe and was symbolic, as in Assyria, where the seven planets appropriated each
                    a special colour (see Brandis in the Berlin <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> 1867,
                    p. 259 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> and De Sacy, <hi rend="italic">Revue
                    Archéologique,</hi> 1869, and compare Revelation xxi. 13, where the twelve gates
                    are grouped in four threes, and 19, 20, where the twelve precious stones of the
                    walls are given). The precious stones which occur among the cylinders of the
                    British Museum are sard, emerald, lapis lazuli (sapphire of the ancients),
                    agate, onyx, jasper, and rock crystal. Both Aelian (Far. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist.,</hi> iv. 34) and Diodorus (i. 75) speak of an object known as an image
                    of truth worn round the neck of the judge, who of course was a priest, in
                    ancient Egypt; but how far this may have suggested or corresponded with the
                    Jewish breastplate is not to be made out.</p>
                <p>The records of gem engravers in Greece begin in the island of Samos, where
                    Mnesarchus, the father of the philosopher Pythagoras, earned by his art more of
                    praise than of wealth. Thence also came Theodorus, who made for Polycrates the
                    seal of emerald (Herodotus, iii. 41), which, according to the curious story, was
                    cast in vain into the deep sea on purpose to be lost. That the design on it was
                    a lyre, as is stated in one authority, is unlikely, now that Benndorfs ingenious
                    reading of Pliny <hi rend="italic">{Nat. Hist.,</hi> xxxiv. 83) has shown that
                    the portrait statue of Theodorus made by himself wa3 in all probability a figure
                    holding in one hand a graving tool, and in the other, not, as previously
                    supposed, a quadriga so diminutive that a fly could cover it with its wiugs, but
                    a scarab with the engraving of a <pb break="no"

                    Gymnasien,</hi> 1873, pp. 401-411), whence it is not unreasonable to conclude
                    that this scarab in fact represented the famous seal of Polycrates. Shortly
                    after 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> there was a law of Solon’s forbidding
                    engravers to retain impressions of the seals they made, and this date would fall
                    in roundly with that of Theodorus and Mnesarchus, as if there had in fact been
                    just about then a special activity and unusual skill. That the art had been
                    practised perhaps for several centuries before in Greece is probable from the
                    general usage of sealing implied in Solon’s law, from the extraordinary degree
                    to which it obtained soon after his time, and from the influence which was
                    exercised on the Greeks in such matters by the Phoenicians, Egyptians, and
                    Assyrians. Yet it is singular to find, as Pliny points out (xxxiii. 4), no
                    direct mention of seals in Homer, not even in tiιe passage <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Iliad,</hi> vi. 168) where Bellerophon himself carries the tablets on which
                    were written the orders against his life. Then as regards the rings or seals of
                    Prometheus, of Midas, of Minos (which like that of Polycrates was thrown into
                    the sea in vain), of Phocus, and of Orestes, the legends may not all have come
                    down from a very early period, but that of Phocus can at least be traced back to
                    the time of Polygnotus, while that of Prometheus may be taken to have inspired
                    the seal (engraved <hi rend="italic">Rev. Arch.,</hi> 1878, pl. XX.) on which
                    the Titan is seen bound and submitting to the vulture. Or, conversely, such a
                    gem may have suggested the legend of the ring which he bore as proof of his
                    former punishment. There is no need to put it much later than 600 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c,,</hi> and it is a specimen of a class of lentoid gems
                    which of late years have been found in small numbers chiefly in the Greek
                    islands. Two more of them from the British Museum collection are engraved in Pl.
                    I., figs. 2 and 3. Asa rule the materials are comparatively soft, most
                    frequently steatite and haematite, while the designs consist mainly of animals
                    so turned and twisted as to cover almost the entire surface of the gem. Certain
                    exceptional cases, where the design is taken from legend or mythology, may be
                    seen in the <hi rend="italic">Hernie Archéologique,</hi> 1878, pl. xx., Nos.

                    interesting article on early engraved gems by Count Gobineau. In most cases the
                    designs though heraldic rather than natural, with a prevalence of animal forms
                    perhaps due to notions of heraldry, are yet so singularly free from Egyptian or
                    Assyrian influence that they must be assigned as essentially Greek productions,
                    possibly from a period when Oriental examples had lost sway. “Not to carry the
                    image of a god on your seal” was a saying of Pythagoras; and, whatever his
                    reason for it may have been, it is interesting to observe him founding a maxim
                    on his father’s profession of gem engraving (Diogenes Laert., viii. 1, 17).</p>
                <p>From the time of Theodoras to that of Pyrgoteles in the 4th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> is a long blank as to names, but not altogether as to
                    gems, the production of which may be judged to have been carried on assiduously
                    from the constant necessity of seals for every variety of purpose. The
                    references to them in Aristophanes, for example, the lists of them in the
                    ancient inventories of treasures in Athens, and the number of them found by
                    General Cesnola in the treasure chambers of Curium in Cyprus confirm this
                    frequent usage during the period in question. To it belong in particular the
                    inscribed gems mentioned in <hi rend="smallcaps">Archaeology</hi> (vol. ii. p.
                    353), including the Woodhouse intaglio there figured (p. 358), which may be
                    referred to as perhaps the very finest example of Greek gem engraving that has
                    come down to us. It would stand early in the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> a date which would also suit the head of Eos from Ithome in Messenia
                    (Pl. I., fig. 14), the head (fig. 5), the citharist (fig. 9), while the scarabs
                    (figs. 6, 7), though apparently of Etruscan origin, obviously reflect the
                    character of archaic Greek art, as far as concerns the shallow cutting and the
                    delicate execution of minute details. The touch which isolates a design and
                    literally arrests the eye they do not possess, but by comparison they render it
                    more distinct as it exists in the Woodhouse gem already mentioned, and in figs.
                    8, 10-13, and 15 in Plate I., all of which may be assigned to the end of the 5th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Singularly beautiful in this class are
                    the two Cesnola gems <hi rend="italic">{Cyprus,</hi> pl. xxxix. figs. 1, 2), the
                    latter, simple and even awkward in parts, yet on the whole conceived by a Greek
                    mind imbued with the poetry of art, while the former is rather a triumph of
                    faultlessness, delicate as the colour of the stone on which it is engraved.</p>
                <p>By the beginning of the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> every element
                    of archaism had vanished; but gems of this period are scarce, except in the
                    collection of St Petersburg, which has obtained them exclusively from tombs in
                    the Crimea. Foremost among them are the two by Dexamenus of Chios, the one, a
                    calcedony with the figure of a stork flying, and inscribed in two lines, the
                    letters carefully disposed above each other, ΔESAMENOS EΠOIE XIOS <hi
                    rend="italic">{Compte-rendu</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Commiss. Arch. St
                    Petersburg,</hi> 1861, pl. vi. fig. 10), and the other, an agate with a stork
                    standing on one leg, inscribed ΔEHAMENO^ simply <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Compte-rendu,</hi> 1865, pl. iii. fig. 40). A third gem, apparently by the
                    same Dexamenus, is a carnelian belonging to Admiral Soteriades in Athens, and
                    has a portrait head, bearded and inscribed ΔESAMENOS EΠOIE <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Compte-rendu,</hi> 1868, pl. i. fig. 12). Apart from the splendour of their
                    workmanship, those three gems are interesting for the variety of their
                    inscriptions. Thus a name standing alone in the nominative case, when it does
                    not describe the subject of the design, will indicate the artist. Again, when
                    the nationality of the artist is added it should follow the verb as a rule,
                    which, however, is not without exceptions. EΠOIE for EΠOIEI is an archaism. The
                    design of a stork flying occurs on an agate scarab in the British Museum from
                    the old Cracherode collection, and therefore beyond all suspicion of having been
                    copied from the more recently discovered Kertch gem. The condition of the
                    surface and the skill of execution are both interesting. Reckoned among the best
                    of the Crimea gems, and that is equivalent to saying among the best of all gems,
                    are the following:—(1) a burnt scaraboid with an eagle carrying off a hare; (2)
                    a gem with scarab border and the figure of a youth seated playing on the
                    trigonon, very much resembling the Woodhouse intaglio (both engraved, <hi
                    rend="italic">Compterendu</hi> 1871, pl. vi. figs. 16, 17); (3) a scaraboid with
                    border and the design of a horse running at speed, with which may be compared a
                    carnelian scaraboid in the British Museum from the old Hamilton collection, and
                    again on this account above suspicion, if the great beauty of the work were not
                    alone convincing; the horse is here stung by a gadfly; (4) an ovoid calcedony,
                    mounted on a chain to be worn as a collar, with an intaglio of a Gorgon (3 and 4
                    engraved, <hi rend="italic">Compte-rendu,</hi> 1860, pl. iv. figs. 6 and 10). In
                    these, and in almost all Greek gems belonging to this period of excellence, the
                    material is of indifferent quality, consisting of agate, calcedony, or
                    carnelian, just as in the older specimens. Brilliant colour and translucency are
                    as yet not a necessary element, and accordingly the design is worked out solely
                    with a view to its own artistic merit.</p>
                <p>At this stage appears the name of Pyrgoteles, of whom it is said that he alone
                    was permitted to engrave the portrait head of Alexander the Great. The portrait
                    head of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n149/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0149-0140"/> Alexander given in Pl. I., fig. 16, is not likely
                    to represent the art of this time, but more probably belongs to the age of
                    Augustus who used this design as a seal. On the other hand the ancient pastes
                    (figs. 20-22) will couvey a notion of the gem engraving of the time of
                    Alexander. Still it should be observed that one of the special difficulties of
                    the subject is to account for the scarcity of gems from this period of wealth,
                    luxury, and artistic activity in all directions. Possibly not a few belong to it
                    which it is thought safer to class as Roman. This much at least is certain, that
                    Roman art altogether was a prolongation, hardly a development, of the Macedonian
                    art. Those Roman engravers may have been conscious of this who boldly placed on
                    their productions the names of celebrated Greek artists, as for instance on a
                    garnet in the British Museum, having a figure perhaps of Jason and inscribed
                    with the name of Phidias (ΦEIΔIAS EΠOEI); others elsewhere profess to be the
                    work of Polycletus or of Scopas. The same effrontery was seen in sculpture, and
                    unfortunately has revived again in the gem engraving of comparatively recent
                    times, as may be seen in a calcedouy intaglio of the head of Alexander the Great
                    in the British Museum, which, though clearly modern, claims to be the work of
                    Pyrgoteles.</p>
                <p>From literary sources are known the engravers Apollonides, Chronius, Tryphon,
                    Satyreius, and Dioscurides, but the date of the last-mentioned only is certain.
                    He lived in the time of Augustus, whose portrait he executed, and did not, it
                    may be supposed, inscribe his own name on it in full. On the other hand, if, as
                    Pliny states, it became a custom afterwards to seal with this portrait of
                    Augustus, it would be natural enough to place on the copies of it made for that
                    purpose the name of Dioscurides. With this view of the case may be reconciled
                    two gems bearing his signature in the British Museum—the one a jacinth, the
                    other a sard—and both obviously portraits which, though more resembling Julius
                    Caesar than Augustus, might yet be regarded as unsuccessful portraits of the
                    latter. Of the two the jacinth, which is from the Blacas collection, is doubted
                    by Brunn; the other is a higher class of work, and yet even it presents some
                    difficulties that require the theory of an imitator, most probably a Roman one.
                    The obtrusive display of the wreath and the fringe of drapery round the bust are
                    details which, apart from the style of workmanship, are objectionable. That the
                    name of this engraver has been often added to modern gems is true enough, and in
                    some cases also it may have been in modern times inscribed on perfectly ancient
                    gems. Even among those which appear to be in all respects antique there are
                    differences in the spelling and form of the letters not to be accounted for if
                    they had come from his hand, but intelligible if they had been made by ancient
                    copyists. Abbreviations such as. ΔIOSK for Dioscurides, or EΠIT for
                    Epitynchanus, are always suspicious. EΠITYΓXA, on a beautiful cameo of the young
                    Marcellus, might seem to have been abbreviated by the accident which broke off
                    the lower part of the gem, but the inscription does not bear examination except
                    as the work of a modern hand. Not necessarily modern is the inscription
                    ΔIO2KOYPIΔ, on a fragmentary amethyst, with a head which may perhaps have been
                    meant for Alexander the Great, whose portrait, as has been said, was used as a
                    seal by Augustus, and may have been executed for him by Dioscurides. It is
                    possibly an ancient copy of this seal, with the addition of the name of the
                    original artist to show that it is so. With regard to the question whether a
                    name standing in the genitive case may indicate the engraver, the evidence is
                    affirmative, if for no other reason than that the names are most frequently
                    Greek, while the owners or collectors of gems in Italy were Romans. Collecting
                    was a passion with wealthy Romane, but their names have not survived on gems.
                    Names like Aulus or Gnaeus, written in Greek letters, cannot indicate a Roman of
                    position, but on the contrary show that it was to the naturalized Greeks that
                    the Romans looked for their engravers. When, for instance, one gem reads SOΛΩNOS
                    and another SOΛΩN E1IOIEI, it is fair to conclude that we have to do in both
                    with an engraver named Solon, if the inscriptions are genuine. The former occurs
                    on a gem found with jewellery at Pompeii <hi rend="italic">(Bullet. d</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Inst Arch.,</hi> 1863, p.
                    91), so that if the other examples of it, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> on the
                    Strozzi Medusa in the British Museum, and on the so-called head of Maecenas, be
                    inventions of the 16th or 17th centuries, they are at least correct in
                    reproducing a name which is now seen on one undoubtedly ancient intaglio.
                    Obviously one or more gems so inscribed must have existed in the 16th or 17th
                    centuries, and this fact alone of the existence of several gems with the same
                    name would suggest if not actually prove that it was the name of an engraver.
                    The other inscription, ≤OΛΩN EΠOIEI, on an intaglio of Diomedes carrying off the
                    Palladium, though known since the year 1660, has not always passed unchallenged.
                    The Medusa just mentioned is a gem of extraordinary pretensions, but very
                    unsatisfactory when compared with good Greek work. In the matter of names the
                    evidence as to the Greek usage, though very slight, is not at variance with what
                    may be gathered from the coins where the names of the die-sinkers appear either
                    in the nominative or genitive case.</p>
                <p>In the discussions as to what is or is not proper in the way of engravers’
                    signatures, frequent reference is made to the inscription EYTYXH≤ ΔIO2KOYPIΔOY
                    AIΓEAIOS EΠ, which occurs twice—on a pale amethyst said last century to belong
                    to the prince of Avella, and on an amethyst in the Marlborough collection. The
                    design on the two is identical, consisting of a helmeted bust of Minerva in full
                    face. Unless what was formerly the Avella gem is now the gem belonging to the
                    Marchese Strozzi of Florence, then this again must be a third example. Professor
                    Maskelyne in his <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> quotes Mr King as agreeing
                    with him that the Marlborough gem (No. 81) is not a copy as Brunn supposed, but
                    may be regarded as an original work of Eutyches till the Avella gem be proved to
                    exist elsewhere. But Stephani insists on the inscription being a modern
                    production, especially on account of the contraction EΠ for EΠOIEI, which he
                    says had arisen through the last letters OIEI being hidden from the modern
                    copyist, either owing to the setting, or from some other cause. The gem which
                    Cyriacus of Ancona and a contemporary of his saw and described in the early part
                    of the 15 th century had the full inscription, and possibly it was from an
                    inexact impression of it that the Marlborough gem was made <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Compte-rendu,</hi> 1861, p. 157). Another celebrated Marlborough gem with the
                    head of the dog-star Sirius, inscribed ΓAIOS EΠOIEI, is condemned by Professor
                    Maskelyne in his <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> (No. 270), as it deserves to
                    be. Apparently meant for the same engraver, though written differently, is the
                    ΓNAIO2 on the beryl in the British Museum with the head of Hercules, as to which
                    Kohler’s adverse judgment appears to be entirely just. 2KYΛAS, which is found on
                    an amethyst head of I ’ an in the British Museum executed with wonderful
                    exactness of detail, is not disputed, except as to whether it is the name of the
                    engraver or the, owner. Among the other names which have been more or less the
                    subject of discussion are those of Hyllus, who also claims to be a son of
                    Dioscurides, Epitynchanus, Agathopus, Euodus, Felix, Mycon, Allion, Ad mon,
                    Onesas, Protarcbus, and Alexas.</p>
                <p>The habit of gem collecting is recorded first in the instance of Ismenias, a
                    musician of Cyprus, who appears to have lived in the 4th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But though individual collectors are not again
                    mentioned till the time of Mithradates, whose cabinet was carried oil to Rome by
                    Pompey, still it is to be inferred that they existed, if not pretty generally,
                    yet in such places as Cyrene, where the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n152/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0152-0141"/> passion for gems was so great that the poorest
                    person owned one worth 10 minas, and where, according to'Aelian <hi
                    rend="italic">(Var.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi><hi rend="italic">fù.</hi>
                    c. 30), the skill in engraving was astonishing. The first cabinet
                    (dactyliotheca) in Rome was that of Scaurus, a step-son of Sulla. Caesar is said
                    to have formed six cabinets for public exhibition, and from the time of Augustus
                    all men of refinement were supposed to be judges both of the art and the quality
                    of the stones. To this pretension is doubtless due most of the existing gems
                    engraved on large beautiful jacinths, garnets, sards, beryls, and amethysts,
                    leaving, as regards purely technical skill, nothing to be desired. Except in
                    portraiture, and in grylli or conceits, in which various things are combined
                    into one, often with much skill, the subjects were as a rule only variations or
                    adaptations of old types handed down from the Greeks. When new and distinctly
                    Roman subjects occur, such as the finding of the head on the Capitol, or
                    Faustulus, or the she-wolf with the twins, both the stones and the workmanship
                    are poor. In such cases, where the design stirs a genuine national interest, it
                    may happen that very little of artistic rendering will be acceptable rather than
                    otherwise, and much more is this true when the design is a symbol of some
                    article of faith, as in the early Christian gems. There both the art and the
                    material are at what may be called the zero of engraving; that is to say, it has
                    reached the point beyond which barbarousness or folly sets in. The usual
                    subjects on the early Christian gems are the fish, anchor, ship, dove, the good
                    shepherd, and, according to Clemens, the lyre. Under the Gnostics, however, with
                    whom there was more of speculation than of faith, symbolism was developed to an
                    extent which no art could realize without the aid of writing. A gem was to them
                    a talisman more or less elaborate, and the difficulty is to make out how they
                    carried them. Many specimens exist, but none show signs of mounting. The
                    materials are usually haematite or jaspar. As regards the designs, it is clear
                    that Egyptian sources have been most drawn upon. But the symbolism is also
                    largely associated with Mithraic worship. The name Abraxas or Abrasax, which,
                    from its frequency on these gems, has led to their being called also “Abraxas
                    gems,” is, when the Greek letters of which it is composed are treated as Greek
                    numerals, equal to 365, the number of days in a year, and the same is the case
                    with MEIΘPA2.</p>
                <p>More interesting, from the occasionally forcible portraiture and the splendour of
                    some of the jacinths employed, are the Sassanian gems, which as a class may be
                    said to represent the last stage of true gem engraving in ancient times. In the
                    middle ages and onwards metal stamps were found more serviceable for the purpose
                    of sealing, and though engraved gems still continued to be a luxury of the
                    great, the old traditions were broken through, as may be seen, for example, in
                    the large crystal in the British Museum representing Susanna and the Elders,
                    made by order of the French king Lothair, 954-986. With the revival of classical
                    tastes under the patronage of popes and princes in the Cinquecento period, it
                    was natural that this branch of art should have a new career of activity, which,
                    after a lapse during the 17th century, again during the last century revived
                    under an even greater amount of encouragement from men of wealth and rank. In
                    this last period the names of engravers who succeeded best in imitating
                    classical designs were Pichler (Pl. I., fig. 28), Natter, and the Englishmen
                    Marchant(fig. 29) and Burch. Compared with the Greek gems on the same plate, it
                    will be seen that what at first sight is attractive as refined and delicate is
                    after all mere pretence of refinement, and entirely devoid of the ancient
                    spirit. The success with which modern engravers imposed on collectors is
                    recorded in many instances, of which one may be taken as an instructive type. In
                    the Bibliothèque in Faris (Chabouillet’s catalogue, No. 2337) is a gem
                    familiarly known as the signet of Michelangelo, the subject being a Bacchanalian
                    scene. So much did he admire it, the story says, that he copied from it one of
                    the groups in his paintings in the Sistine chapel. The gem, however, is
                    evidently in this part of it a mere copy from Michelangelo's group, and
                    altogether is a later production.</p>
                <p>The gems engraved in Plate I. show a progressive development of the art from the
                    earliest times down to last century. They are all in the British Museum, and are
                    enlarged to about a half more than their real size. No. 1, Porcelain scarab,
