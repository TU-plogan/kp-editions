                <p><label type="entry">GIDEON</label>, liberator, reformer, and “judge” of Israel,
                    was the youngest son of Joash, of the “house” of Abiezer, and tribe of Manasseh,
                    and had his home at Ophrah, the site of which is probably to be sought westward
                    of Jordan, somewhat to the south of the plain of Jezreel. Gideon lived at a time
                    when Israel, grown idolatrous, had been brought very low by periodic incursions
                    of the “Midianites” and “Amalekites,” nomad tribes from the east of Jordan, who
                    in great numbers were wont to overrun the country, destroying all that they
                    could not carry away. In the beginning of the narrative of his public life he is
                    represented as an unambitious man, quietly engaged in agricultural pursuits, who
                    yet had already distinguished himself as a “mighty man of valour,” probably in
                    guerilla warfare against the common foe. According to that narrative, his first
                    exploit worthy of special commemoration was the destruction, by divine command,
                    of the altar of Baal belonging to his father, and of the Ashera beside it, and
                    the substitution of an altar to Jehovah. But immediately before this he had also
                    been summoned by “the angel of the Lord” to undertake, in dependence on
                    supernatural direction and help, the work of liberating his country from its
                    long oppression, and, in token that he accepted the mission, had already erected
                    in Ophrah an altar which he called “Jahveh-Shalom” (Jehovah is prosperity). The
                    great gathering of the Midianites and their allies on the north side of the
                    plain of Jezreel “stretching from the hill of Moreh”; the general muster first
                    of Abiezer, then of all Manasseh, and lastly of the neighbouring tribes of
                    Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali; the signs by which the wavering faith of Gideon
                    was steadied; the methods by which an unwieldy mob was reduced to a small but
                    trusty band of energetic and determined men; and the stratagem by which the vast
                    army of Midian was surprised and routed by the handful of Israelites descending
                    from “above Endor,” are indicated with sufficient clearness in the Scripture
                    narrative, and need not be detailed minutely here. There is some difficulty in
                    following the account of the subsequent flight of the Midianites, which seems to
                    have taken place in two directions,—Oreb and Zeeb making for the lower fords of
                    Jordan towards the south-east, while Zebah and Zalmunna took the upper passage,
                    a little below the place where the river flows out of the Sea of Galilee.
                    Leaving the Ephraimites (who had now risen in force) to deal with the former,
                    Gideon with his 300 appears to have kept up the pursuit of the latter to Nobah
                    and Jogbehah, points beyond Succoth and Penuel, where a bloody contest resulted
                    in the destruction of that portion of the Midianite army, and in the ultimate
                    capture and execution of Zebah and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0606-0589"/> Zalmunna. Almost simultaneously with these
                    occurrences eastward of Jordan, messengers from Ephraim bearing the heads of
                    Oreb (“raven”) and Zeeb (“wolf”), who with their followers had been crushed at
                    “theraven’s rock” and “the wolf’s den” respectively, announced the completeness
                    of Israel’s victory. Having taken unrelenting vengeance on the men of Penuel and
                    Succoth, who had shown a timid neutrality when the patriotic struggle was at its
                    crisis, Gideon returned to his native Ophrah, where he further distinguished
                    himself by his pious magnanimity in refusing the kingship which had been put
                    within his reach—an act of self-denial, however, which, according to the sacred
                    historian, was somewhat neutralized by his subsequent folly in establishing a
                    shrine which proved a snare to all Israel, not excluding his family or even
                    himself. For forty years after the great victory he lived at his own house in
                    Ophrah in considerable wealth and magnificence, yet always in a private
                    station—there being no direct scriptural evidence at least that his judgeship
                    lasted during all that period, or that it ever gave him any position of legally
                    recognized authority. The name of Gideon occurs in Heb. xi. 32, in the list
                    there given of those who became heroes by faith; but, except in Judges
                    vi.-viii,, it is not to be met with anywhere in the Old Testament. In 1 Sam.
                    xii. 11 and 2 Sam. xi. 21 (LXX.) he is called Jerubbaal (the reading
                    Jerubbesheth having been introduced into the latter passage in accordance with
                    the usage explained in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Baal).</hi> The fact
                    that in Judges ix., which appears to be the oldest part of the narrative, he is
                    invariably called Jerubbaal, has suggested to Kuenen and others that this ought
                    to be regarded as his original and proper name, that of Gideon (l⅛∏2, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.</hi> “hewer” or “warrior,” <hi rend="italic">cf</hi> Isa. x,
                    33) having been a later designation. In confirmation of this it is pointed out
                    that the derivation of Sy31' as equivalent to ∕ ’ y3∏ 13 3Ύ (“Let Baal contend
                    against him,” v. 32, or “Let Baal contend for himself,” v. 31) is much less
                    probable than that which interprets it as precisely analogous with such names as
                    Merib-baal, Jehoiarib or Joarib, Seraiah, Israel, and perhaps also Josadec, all
                    meaning “God fights” or “contends.” The nature of the grounds on which it is
                    conjectured that Gideon’s conquest of the Midianites was somewhat slower than
                    the narrative on a first reading would lead one to suppose, and that his
                    religious reforms, far from being confined to a solitary act of his early
                    manhood, were rather the principal employment of his later life, is indicated in
                    the histories of Israel by Ewald, Hitzig, and Kuenen. See also especially
