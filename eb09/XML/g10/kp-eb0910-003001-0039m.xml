                    Florentine house, which had exchanged the surname of Bonajuti for that of
                    Galilei, on the election, in 1343, of one of its members, Galileo de’ Bonajuti,
                    to the college of the twelve Buonuomini. The family, which was fifteen times
                    represented in the signoria, and in 1445 gave a gonfalonier to Florence,
                    flourished with the republic and declined with its fall. Vincenzo Galilei was a
                    man of better parts than fortune. He was a competent mathematician, wrote with
                    considerable ability on the theory and practice of music, and was especially
                    distinguished amongst his contemporaries for the grace and skill of his
                    performance upon the lute. By his wife, Giulia de’ Ammannati of Pistoja, he had
                    two sons, Galileo and Michelangiolo, and two daughters, Virginia and Livia. From
                    his earliest childhood Galileo was remarkable for intellectual aptitude, as well
                    as for mechanical invention. His favourite pastime was the construction of
                    toy-machines, not the less original and ingenious that their successful working
                    was usually much hindered by the scarcity of suitable materials. His application
                    to literary studies was equally conspicuous. In the monastery of Vallombrosa,
                    near Florence, where his education was principally conducted, he not only made
                    himself acquainted with the best Latin authors, but acquired a fair command of
                    the Greek tongue, thus laying the foundation of the brilliant and elegant style
                    for which his writings were afterwards distinguished. From one of the monks he
                    also received instruction in logic, according to the system then in vogue; but
                    the futilities of the science revolted, while its subtleties <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n40/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0040-0031"/> failed to interest his understanding, and he was
                    soon permitted to abandon a study so distasteful to him. A document published by
                    Μ. Selmi in 1864 proves that he was at this time so far attracted towards a
                    religious life as to have joined the novitiate of the order; but his father, who
                    had other designs for him, seized the opportunity of an attack of ophthalmia to
                    withdraw him permanently from the care of the monks. Having had personal
                    experience of the" unremunerative character both of music and of mathematics, he
                    desired that his son should apply himself to the more profitable study of
                    medicine, and, not without some straining of his slender resources, placed him,
                    before he had completed his eighteenth year, at the university of Pisa. He
                    accordingly matriculated, November 5, 1581, and immediately entered upon
                    attendance at the lectures of the celebrated physician and botanist, Andrea
                    Cesalpino.</p>
                <p>The natural gifts of the young student, not less multifarious than those of an
                    earlier Tuscan prodigy, Leonardo da Vi⅛ci, seemed at this time equally ready to
                    develop in any direction towards which choice or hazard might incline them. In
                    musical skill and invention he already vied with the best professors of the art
                    in Italy; his personal taste would have led him to choose painting as hi3
                    profession, and one of the most eminent artists of his day, Lodovico Cigoli,
                    owned that to his judgment and counsel he was mainly indebted for the success of
                    his works; his wit and eloquence gave promise that he. would one day add to the
                    literary glories of his country; while his mathematical and mechanical genius
                    only awaited a suitable opportunity for full display and development. In 1583,
                    while watching the vibrations of the great bronze lamp still to be seen swinging
                    from the roof of the cathedral of Pisa, he observed that, whatever the range of
                    its oscillations, they were invariably executed in equal times. The experimental
                    verification of this fact led him to the important discovery of the isochronism
                    of the pendulum. He at first applied the new principle to pulse-measurement, and
                    more than fifty years later turned it to account in the construction of an
                    astronomical clock. Up to this time he was entirely ignorant of mathematics, his
                    father having carefully held him aloof from a study which he rightly apprehended
                    would lead to his total alienation from that of medicine. Accident, however,
                    frustrated this purpose. A lesson in geometry, given by Ostilio Ricci to the
                    pages of the grand-ducal court, then temporarily resident at Pisa, chanced to
                    have Galileo for an unseen listener; his attention was riveted, his dormant
                    genius was roused, and he threw all his energies into the new pursuit thus
                    unexpectedly presented to him. With Ricci’s assistance, he rapidly mastered the
                    elements of the science, and eventually extorted his father’s reluctant
                    permission to exchange Hippocrates and Galen for Euclid and Archimedes. In 1586
                    he was withdrawn from the university, through lack of means, before he had taken
                    a degree, and returned to Florence, where his family habitually resided. We next
                    hear of him as lecturing before the Florentine Academy on the site and
                    dimensions of Dante’s <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi>; and he shortly afterwards
                    published an essay descriptive of his invention of the hydrostatical balance,
                    which rapidly made his name known throughout Italy. His first patron was the
                    Marchese Guidubaldo del Monte of Pesaro, a man eminent for his scientific
                    attainments, as well as influential by his family connexions. At his request he
                    wrote, in 1588, a treatise on the centre of gravity in solids, which obtained
                    for him, together with the title of “the Archimedes of his time,” the honourable
                    though not lucrative post of mathematical lecturer at the Pisan university.
                    During the ensuing two years (1589-91) he carried on that remarkable series of
                    experiments, by which he established the first principles of dynamical science,
                    and by which he earned for himself the undying hostility of the bigoted
                    Aristotelians of that day. From the leaning tower of Pisa he afforded to all the
                    professors and students of the university ocular demonstration of the falsehood
                    of the Peripatetic dictum that heavy bodies fall with velocities proportional to
                    their weights, and with unanswerable logic demolished all the time-honoured
                    maxims of the schools regarding the motion of projectiles, and elemental weight
                    or levity. But while he convinced, he failed to conciliate his adversaries. The
                    keen sarcasm of his polished rhetoric was not calculated to soothe the
                    susceptibilities of men already smarting under the deprivation of their most
                    cherished illusions. He seems, in addition, to have compromised his position
                    with the grand-ducal family by the imprudent candour with which he condemned a
                    machine for clearing the port of Leghorn, invented by Giovanni de’ Medici, an
                    illegitimate son of Cosmo I. Princely favour being withdrawn, private rancour
                    was free to show itself. He was publicly hissed at his lecture, and found it
                    prudent to resign his professorship and withdraw to Florence in 1591. Through
                    the death of his father in July of that year family cares and responsibilities
                    devolved upon him as eldest son, and thus his nomination to the chair of
                    mathematics at the university of Padua, secured by the influence of the Marchese
                    Guidubaldo with the Venetian senate, was welcome, as affording a relief from
                    pecuniary embarrassment, no less than as opening a field for scientific
                    distinction.</p>
                <p>His residence at Padua, which extended over a period of eighteen years, from 1592
                    to 1610, was a course of uninterrupted prosperity. His appointment was three
                    times renewed, on each occasion with expressions of the highest esteem on the
                    part of the governing body, and his yearly salary was progressively raised from
                    180 to 1000 florins. His lectures were attended by persons of the highest
                    distinction from all parts of Europe, and such was the charm of his
                    demonstrations that a hall capable of containing 2000 people had eventually to
                    be assigned for the accommodation of the overflowing audiences which they
                    attracted. His ingenious invention of the proportional compasses—an instrument
                    still used in geometrical drawing—dates from 1597; and about the same time he
                    constructed the first thermometer, consisting of a bulb and tube filled with air
                    and water, and terminating in a vessel of water. In this instrument, the results
                    of varying atmospheric pressure were not distinguishable from the expansive and
                    contractive effects of heat and cold, and it became an efficient measure of
                    temperature only when Rinieri, in 1646, introduced the improvement of
                    hermetically sealing the liquid in glass. The substitution, in 1670, of mercury
                    for water completed the modern thermometer.</p>
                <p>Galileo seems, at an early period of his life, to have adopted the Copernican
                    theory of the solar system, and was deterred from avowing his opinions—as is
                    proved by his letter to Kepler of August 4, 1597—by the fear of ridicule rather
                    than of persecution. The appearance, in September 1604, of a new star in the
                    constellation Serpentarius, afforded him indeed an opportunity, of which he
                    eagerly availed himself, for making an onslaught upon the Aristotelian axiom of
                    the incorruptibility of the heavens; but he continued to conform his public
                    teachings in the main to Ptolemaic principles, until the discovery of a novel
                    and potent implement of research placed at his command startling and hitherto
                    unsuspected evidence as to the constitution and mutual relations of the heavenly
                    bodies. Galileo was not the original inventor of the telescope.<note

                    obscure optician of Middleburg, who, on the 21st of October 1608, offered to the
                    states of Holland three instruments by which the apparent size of remote objects
                    was increased. But here his glory ends, and that of Galileo begins. The rumour
                    of the new invention, which reached Venice in April or May 1609, was sufficient
                    to set the Italian philosopher on the track; and after one night’s profound
                    meditation on the principles of refraction, he succeeded in producing a
                    telescope of threefold magnifying power. Upon this first attempt he rapidly
                    improved, until lie attained to a power of thirty-two, and his instruments, of
                    which he manufactured hundreds with his own hands, were soon in request in every
                    part of Europe. Two lenses only—a planoconvex and a plano-concave—were needed
                    for the composition of each, and this simple principle is that still employed in
                    the construction of opera-glasses. Galileo’s direction of his new instrument to
                    the heavens formed an era in the history of astronomy. Discoveries followed upon
                    it with astounding rapidity and in bewildering variety. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sidereus</hi><hi rend="italic">Nuncius,</hi> published at Venice in the early
                    part of 1610, contained the first-fruits of the new mode of investigation, which
                    were sufficient to startle and surprise the learned on both sides of the Alps.
                    The mountainous configuration of the moon’s surface was there first described,
                    and the so-called “phosphorescence” of the dark portion of our satellite
                    attributed to its true cause—namely, illumination by sun-light reflected from
                    the earth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Leonardo da
                    Vinci, more than a hundred years earlier, had come to the same
                    conclusion.</p></note> All the time-worn fables and conjectures regarding the
                    composition of the Milky Way were at once dissipated by the simple statement
                    that to the eye, reinforced by the telescope, it appeared as a congeries of
                    lesser stars, while the great nebulae were equally declared to be resolvable
                    into similar elements. But the discovery which was at once perceived to be most
                    important in itself, and most revolutionary in its effects, was that of
                    Jupiter’s satellites, first seen by Galileo January 7, 1610, and by him named
                    <hi rend="italic">Sidera</hi><hi rend="italic">Medicea,</hi> in honour of the
                    grand-duke of Tuscany, Cosmo II., who had been his pupil, and was about to
                    become his employer. An illustration is, with the general run of mankind, more
                    powerful to convince than an argument; and the cogency of the visible plea for
                    the Copernican theory offered by the miniature system, then for the first time
                    disclosed to view, was recognizable in the triumph of its advocates, as well as
                    in the increased acrimony of its opponents.</p>
                <p>In September 1610 Galileo finally abandoned Padua for Florence. His researches
                    with the telescope had been rewarded by the Venetian senate with the appointment
                    for life to his professorship, at an unprecedentedly high salary. His discovery
                    of the “Medicean Stars” was acknowledged by his nomination (July 12, 1610) as
                    philosopher and mathematician extraordinary to the grand-duke of Tuscany. The
                    emoluments of this office, which involved no duties save that of continuing his
                    scientific labours, were fixed at 1000 scudi; and it was the desire of increased
                    leisure, rather than the promptings of local patriotism, which induced him to
                    accept an offer, the first suggestion of which had indeed come from himself.
                    Before the close of 1610 the memorable cycle of discoveries begun in the
                    previous year wa3 completed by the observation of the ansated or, as it appeared
                    to Galileo, triple form of Saturn (the ring-formation was first recognized by
                    Huygens in 1655), of the phases of Venus, and of the spots upon the sun.
                    Although his priority in several of these discoveries has been contested,
                    inquiry has in each case proved favourable to his claims. In the spring of 1611
                    he visited Rome, and exhibited in the gardens of the</p>
                <p>Quirinal Palace the telescopic wonders of the heavens to the most eminent
                    personages at the pontifical court. Encouraged by the flattering reception
                    accorded to him, he ventured, in his <hi rend="italic">Letters on the Solar
                    Spots,</hi> printed at Rome in 1613, to take up a more decided position towards
                    that doctrine on the establishment of which, as he avowed in a letter to
                    Belisario Vinta, secretary to the grand-duke, “all his life and being
                    henceforward depended.” Even in the time of Copernicus some well-meaning persons
                    had suspected a discrepancy between the new view of the solar system and certain
                    passages of Scripture—a suspicion strengthened by the anti-Christian inferences
                    drawn from it by Giordano Bruno; but the question was never formally debated
                    until Galileo’s brilliant discoveries, enhanced by his formidable dialectic and
                    enthusiastic zeal, irresistibly challenged for it the attention of the
                    authorities. Although he earnestly deprecated the raising of the theological
                    issue, and desired nothing better than permission to pursue unmolested his
                    physical demonstrations, it must be admitted that, the discussion once set on
                    foot, he threw himself into it with characteristic impetuosity, and thus helped
                    to precipitate a decision which it was his ardent wish to avert. In December
                    1613 a Benedictine monk named Benedetto Castelli, at that time professor of
                    mathematics at the university of Pisa, wrote to inform Galileo of a recent
                    discussion at the grand-ducal table, in which he had been called upon to defend
                    the Copernican doctrine against theological objections. This task Castelli, who
                    was a steady friend and disciple of the Tuscan astronomer, seems to have
                    discharged with moderation and success. Galileo’s answer, written, as. he said
                    himself, <hi rend="italic">currente calamo,</hi> was an exposition of a formal
                    theory as to the relations of physical science to Holy Writ, still further
                    developed in an elaborate apology addressed by him in the following year (1614)
                    to Christina of Lorraine, dowager grand-duchess of Tuscany. Not satisfied with
                    explaining adverse texts, he met his opponents with unwise audacity on their own
                    ground, and endeavoured to produce scriptural confirmation of a system which to
                    the ignorant many seemed an incredible paradox, and to the scientific few was a
                    beautiful but daring innovation. The rising agitation on the subject which,
                    originating probably with the sincere upholders of the integrity of Scripture,
                    was fomented for their own purposes by the rabid Aristotelians of the schools,
                    was heightened rather than allayed by these manifestoes, and on the fourth
                    Sunday of the following Advent found a voice in the pulpit of Santa Maria
                    Novella. Padre Caccini’s denunciation of the new astronomy was indeed disavowed
                    and strongly condemned by his superiors; nevertheless, on the 5th of February
                    1615, another Dominican monk named Lorini laid Galileo’s letter to Castelli
                    before the Inquisition.</p>
                <p>Cardinal Robert Bellarmine was at that time by far the most influential member of
                    the Sacred College. He was a man of vast learning and upright piety, but,
                    although personally friendly to Galileo, there is no doubt that he saw in his
                    scientific teachings a danger to religion. The year 1615 seems, however, to have
                    been a period of suspense. Galileo received, as the result of a conference
                    between Cardinals Bellarmine and Del Monte, a semi-official warning to avoid
                    theology, and limit himself to physical reasoning. “Write freely,” he was told
                    by Monsignor Dini, “but keep outside the sacristy.” Unfortunately, he had
                    already committed himself to dangerous .ground. In December he repaired
                    personally to Rome, full of confidence that the weight of his arguments and the
                    vivacity of his eloquence could not fail to convert the entire pontifical court
                    to his views. He was cordially received, and eagerly listened to, but his
                    imprudent ardour served but to injure his cause. On the 2 4 th, of February 1616
                    the consulting theologians of the Holy Office characterized the two
                    propositions—that the sun <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n42/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0042-0033"/> is immovable in the centre of the world, and that
                    the earth has a diurnal motion of rotation—the first as “absurd in philosophy,
                    and formally heretical, because expressly contrary to Holy Scripture,” and the
                    second as “open to the same censure in philosophy, and at least erroneous as to
                    faith.” Two days later Galileo was, by command of the pope (Paul V.), summoned
                    to the palace of Cardinal Bellarmine, and there officially admonished not
                    thenceforward to “hold, teac⅛, or defend” the condemned doctrine. This
                    injunction he promised to obey. On the 5th of March the Congregation of the
                    Index issued a decree reiterating, with the omission of the word “heretical,”
                    the censure of the theologians, suspending, <hi rend="italic">usque</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">corrigatur,</hi> the great work of Copernicus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Revolutionibus orbium coelestium,</hi> and absolutely
                    prohibiting a treatise by a Carmelite monk named Foscarini, which treated the
                    same subject from a theological point of view. At the same time it was given to
                    be understood that the new theory of the solar system might be held <hi
                    rend="italic">ex hypqfhesi,</hi> and the trivial verbal alterations introduced
                    into the Polish astronomer’s book in 1620, when the work of revision was
                    completed by Cardinal Gaetani, confirmed this interpretation. This edict, it is
                    essential to observe, of which the responsibility rests with a disciplinary
                    congregation in no sense representing the church, was never confirmed by the
                    pope, and was virtually repealed in 1757 under Benedict XIV.</p>
                <p>Galileo returned to Florence three months later, not ill-pleased, as his letters
                    testify, with the result of his visit to Rome. He brought with him, for the
                    refutation of calumnious reports circulated by his enemies, a written
                    certificate from Cardinal Bellarmine, to the effect that no abjuration had been
                    required of or penance imposed upon him. During a prolonged audience, he had
                    received from the pope assurances of private esteem and personal protection; and
                    he trusted to his dialectical ingenuity to find the means of presenting his
                    scientific convictions under the transparent veil of an hypothesis. Although a
                    sincere Catholic, he seems to have laid but little stress on the secret
                    admonition of the Holy Office, which his sanguine temperament encouraged him
                    gradually to dismiss from his mind. He preserved no written memorandum of its
                    terms, and it was represented to him, according to his own deposition in 1633,
                    solely by Cardinal Bellarmine’s certificate, in which, for obvious reasons, it
                    was glossed over rather than expressly recorded. F or seven years, however,
                    during which he led a life of studious retirement in the Villa Segni at
                    Bellosguardo, near Florence, he maintained an almost unbroken silence. At the
                    end of that time he appeared in public with his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saggiatore,</hi> a polemical treatise written in reply to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Libra</hi><hi rend="italic">Astronomica</hi> of Padre Grassi (under the
                    pseudonym of Lotario Sarsi), the Jesuit astronomer of the Collegio Romano. The
                    subject in debate was the nature of comets, the conspicuous appearance of three
                    of which bodies in the year 1618 furnished the occasion of the controversy.
                    Galileo’s views, although erroneous, since he held comets to be mere atmospheric
                    emanations reflecting sunlight after the evanescent fashion of a halo or a
                    rainbow, were expressed with such triumphant vigour, and embellished with such
                    telling sarcasms, that his opponent did not venture upon a reply. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Saggiatore</hi> was printed at Rome in October 1623, by the
                    Academy of the Lincei, of which Galileo was a member, with a dedication to the
                    new pope, Urban VIII., and notwithstanding some passages containing a covert
                    defence of Copernican opinions, was received with acclamation by the
                    ecclesiastical, no less than by the scientific authorities. Everything seemed
                    now to promise a close of unbroken prosperity to Galileo’s career. Maffeo
                    Barberini, his warmest friend and admirer in the Sacred College, was, by the
                    election of August 8, 1623, seated on the pontifical throne; and the marked,
                    distinction with which he was received on his visit of congratulation to Rome in
                    1624 encouraged him to hope for the realization of his utmost wishes. He
                    received every mark of private favour. The pope admitted him to six long
                    audiences in the course of two months, wrote an enthusiastic letter to the
                    grand-duke praising the great astronomer, not only for his distinguished
                    learning, but also for his exemplary piety, and granted a pension to his son
                    Vincenzo, which was afterwards transferred to himself, and paid, with some
                    irregu-, larities, to the end of his life. But on the subject of the decree of
                    1616, the revocation of which Galileo had hoped to obtain through his personal
                    influence, he found him inexorable. Nevertheless, the sanguine philosopher
                    trusted, not without reason, that it would at least be interpreted in a liberal
                    spirit, and his friends encouraged his imprudent confidence by eagerly retailing
                    to him every papal utterance •which it was possible to construe in a favourable
                    sense. To Cardinal Hohenzollern Urban was reported to have said that the theory
                    of the earth’s motion had not been and could not be condemned as heretical, but
                    only as rash; and in 1630 the learned Dominican monk Campanella wrote to Galileo
                    that the pope had expressed to him in conversation his disapproval of the
                    prohibitory decree. Thus, in the full anticipation of added renown, and without
                    any misgiving as to ulterior consequences, Galileo set himself, on his return to
                    Florence, to complete his famous but ill-starred work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dialogo dei</hi><hi rend="italic">due Massimi Sistemi del Hondo.</hi> Finished
                    in 1630, it was not until January 1632 that it emerged from the presses of
                    Landini at Florence. The book was orginally intended to appear in Rome, but
                    unexpected obstacles interposed. The Lyncean Academy collapsed with the death of
                    Prince Federigo Cesi, its founder and president; an outbreak of plague impeded
                    communication between the various Italian cities; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >imprimatur</hi> was finally extorted, rather than accorded, under the pressure
                    of private friendship and powerful interest. A tumult of applause from every
                    part of Europe followed its publication; and it would be difficult to find in
                    any language a book in which animation and elegance of style are so happily
                    combined with strength and clearness of scientific exposition. Three
                    interlocutors, named respectively Salviati, Sagredo, and Simplicio, take part in
                    the four dialogues of which the work is composed. The first-named expounds the
                    views of the author; the second is an eager and intelligent listener; the third
                    represents a well-meaning but obtuse Peripatetic, whom the others treat at times
                    with undisguised contempt. Salviati and Sagredo took their names from twoof
                    Galileo’s early friends, the former a learned Florentine, the latter a
                    distinguished Venetian gentleman; Simplicio ostensibly derived his from the
                    Cilician commentator of Aristotle, but the choice was doubtless instigated by a
                    sarcastic regard to the double meaning of the word. There were not wanting those
                    who insinuated that Galileo intended to depict the pope himself in the guise of
                    the simpleton of the party; this charge, however, was not only preposterous in
                    itself, but wholly unsupported by intrinsic evidence, and Urban was far too
                    sagacious to give any permanent credit to it.</p>
                <p>It was at once evident that the whole tenor of this remarkable work was in
                    flagrant contradiction with the edict passed sixteen years before its
                    publication, as well as with the author’s personal pledge of conformity to it.
                    The ironical submission with which it opened, and the assumed indetermination
                    with which it closed, were hardly intended to mask the vigorous assertion of
                    Copernican principles which formed its substance. It is a singular circumstance,
                    however, that the argument upon which Galileo mainly relied as furnishing a
                    physical demonstration of the truth of the new theory rested on a misconception.
                    The ebb and flow of the tides, he asserted, were a visible effect of the
                    terrestrial<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n43/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0043-0034"/> double movement, since they resulted from the
                    inequality of the absolute velocities through space of the various parts of the
                    earth’s surface, produced by the motion of rotation. To this notion, which took
                    its rise in a confusion of thought, he attached capital importance, and he
                    treated with scorn Kepler’s suggestion that a certain occult attraction of the
                    moon was in some way concerned in the phenomenon. The theological censures which
                    the book did •not fail to incur were not slow in makiug themselves felt. Towards
                    the end of August the sale was prohibited; on the 1st of October the author was
                    cited to Rome by the Inquisition. He pleaded his age, now close upon seventy
                    years, his infirm health, and the obstacles to travel caused by quarantine
                    regulations; but the pope was sternly indignant at what he held to be his
                    ingratitude and insubordination, and no excuse was admitted. At length, on the
                    13th of February 1633, he arrived at the residence of Niccolini, the Tuscan
                    ambassador to the pontifical court, and there abode in deep dejection for two
                    months. From the 12th to the 30th of April he was detained in the palace of the
                    Inquisition, where he occupied the apartments of the fiscal, and was treated
                    with unexampled indulgence. On the 30th he was restored to the hospitality of
                    Niccolini, his wann and generous partisan. The accusation against him was that
                    he had written in contravention of the decree of 1616, and in defiance of the
                    command of the Holy Office communicated to him by Cardinal Bellarmine; and his
                    defence consisted mainly in a disavowal of his opinions, and an appeal to his
                    good intentions. On the 21st of June he was finally examined under menace of
                    torture; but he continued to maintain his assertion that, after its condemnation
                    by the Congregation of the Index, he had never held the Copernican theory. Since
                    the publication of the documents relating to this memorable trial, there can no
                    longer be any doubt, not only that the threat of torture was not carried into
                    execution, but that it was never intended that it should be. On the 22d of June,
                    in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Galileo read his recantation, and
                    received his sentence. He was condemned, as “vehemently suspected of heresy,” to
                    incarceration at the pleasure of the tribunal, and by way of penance was
                    enjoined to recite once a week for three years the seven penitential psalms.
                    This sentence was signed by seven cardinals, but did not receive the customary
                    papal ratification. The legend according to which Galileo, rising from his knees
                    after repeating the formula of abjuration, stamped on the ground, and exclaimed,
                    “<hi rend="italic">E pur si muove!”</hi> is, as may readily be supposed,
                    entirely apocryphal. The earliest ascertained authority for it is the seventh
                    edition of an <hi rend="italic">Historical Dictionary,</hi> published at Caen in
                    1789. It seems probable that Galileo remained in the custody of the Inquisition
                    from the 21st to the 24th of June, on which day he was relegated to the Villa
                    Medici on the Trinità de’ Monti. Thence, on the 6th of July, he was permitted to
                    depart for Siena, where he spent several months in the house of the archbishop,
                    Ascanio Piccolomini, one of his numerous and trusty friends. It was not until
                    December that his earnest desire of returning to Florence was realized, and
                    there, in the Villa Martellini at Arcetri, he spent the remaining eight years of
                    his life in the strict retirement which was the prescribed condition of his
                    comparative freedom.</p>
                <p>Domestic afflictions combined with numerous and painful infirmities to embitter
                    his old age. His sieter-in-law and her whole family, who came to live with him
                    on his return from Rome, perished shortly afterwards of the plague; and on the
                    1st of April 1634 died, to the inexpressible grief of her father, his eldest and
                    best-beloved daughter, a nun in the convent of San Matteo at Arcetri. Galileo
                    was never married; but by a Venetian woman named Marina Gamba he had three
                    children—a son who married and left descendants, and two daughters who took the
                    veil at an early age. Notwithstanding this stain on the morality of his early
                    life, which was in some degree compensated by the regularity of his subsequent
                    conduct, Galileo’s general character was one which commanded the respect of all
                    who approached him. His prodigious mental activity continued undiminished to the
                    last, nor were his latter years the least profitable to science of his long and
                    eventful career. In 1636 he completed his <hi rend="italic">Diαloghi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">delle</hi><hi rend="italic">Nuoνe Scicηze,</hi> in which he
                    recapitulated the results of his early experiments and mature meditations on the
                    principles of mechanics. This, in many respects his most valuable work, was
                    printed by the Elzevirs at Leyden in 1638, and excited admiration equally
                    universal and more lasting than that accorded to his astronomical treatises. His
                    last telescopic discovery— that of the moon’s diurnal and monthly librations—was
                    made in 1637, only a few months before his eyes were for ever closed in hopeless
                    blindness. It was in this condition that Milton found him when he visited him at
                    Arcetri in 1638. But the fire of his genius was not even yet extinct. He
                    continued his scientific correspondence with unbroken interest and undiminished
                    logical acumen; he thought out the application of the pendulum to the regulation
                    of clockwork, which Huygens successfully realized seventeen years later; and he
                    was engaged in dictating to his disciples, Viviani and-Torricelli, his latest
                    ideas on the theory of impact when he was seized with the slow fever which in
                    two months brought him to the grave. On the 8th January 1642 he closed his long
                    life of triumph and humiliation, and the coincidence of the day of his birth
                    with that of Michelangelo’s death was paralleled by the coincidence of the year
                    of his death with that of the birth of Isaac Newton.</p>
                <p>The direct services which Galileo rendered to astronomy are virtually summed up
                    in his telescopic discoveries. To the theoretical perfection of the science he
                    contributed little or nothing. He pointed out indeed that the so-called “third
                    motion,” introduced by Copernicus to account for the constant parallelism of the
                    earth’s axis, was a superfluous complication. But he substituted the equally
                    unnecessary hypothesis of a magnetic attraction, and failed to perceive that the
                    phenomenon to be explained was, in relation to absolute space, not a movement,
                    but the absence of movement. The circumstance, however, which most seriously
                    detracts from his scientific reputation is his neglect of the discoveries made
                    during his life-time by the greatest of his contemporaries. Kepler’s first and
                    second laws were published in 1609, and his third ten years later. By these
                    momentous inductions the geometrical theory cf the solar system was perfected,
                    and a hitherto unimagined symmetry was perceived to regulate the mutual
                    relations of its members. But by Galileo they were passed over in silence. In
                    his <hi rend="italic">Dialogo dei</hi><hi rend="italic">Massimi Sistemi,</hi>
                    printed not less than thirteen years after the last of the three laws had been
                    given to the world, the epicycles by which Copernicus, adhering to the ancient
                    postulate of uniform circular motion, had endeavoured to reduce to theory the
                    irregularities of the planetary movements were neither expressly adopted nor
                    expressly rejected; and, after exhausting all the apologies offered, the
                    conclusion seems inevitable that this grave defection from the cause of progress
                    had no other motive than the reluctance of the Florentine astronomer to accept
                    discoveries which he had not originated,—this not through vulgar jealousy, of
                    which he was incapable, but through a certain unconscious intellectual egotism,
                    not always unknown to the greatest minds. His name, however, is justly
                    associated with that vast extension of the bounds of the visible universe which
                    has rendered modern astronomy the most sublime of sciences, and his telescopic

                    directed, than for the inspiration which prompted them. With the sure instinct
                    of genius, he seized the characteristic features of the phenomena presented to
                    his attention, and his inferences, except when distorted by polemical
                    exigencies, have been strikingly confirmed by modern investigations. Of his two
                    capital errors, regarding respectively the theory of the tides and the nature of
                    comets, the first was insidiously recommended to him by his passionate desire to
                    find a physical confirmation of the earth’s double motion; the second was
                    adopted for the purpose of rebutting an anti-Copernican argument founded on the
                    planetary analogies of those erratic subjects of the sun. Within two years of
                    their first discovery, he had constructed approximately accurate tables of the
                    revolutions of Jupiter’s satellites, and he proposed their frequent eclipses as
                    a means of determining longitudes, not only on land, but at sea. This method, on
                    which he laid great stress, and for the facilitation of which* he invented a
                    binocular glass, and devised some skilful mechanical contrivances, was offered
                    by him in 1616 to the Spanish Government, and afterwards to that of Tuscany, but
                    in each case unsuccessfully; and the close of his life was occupied with
                    prolonged but fruitless negotiations on the same subject with the states-general
                    of Holland. The idea, though ingenious, has been found of little practical
                    utility at sea, where the method founded on the observed distance of the moon
                    from a known star is that usually employed.</p>
                <p>A series of careful observations made him acquainted with the principal
                    appearances revealed by modern instruments in the solar spots. He pointed out
                    that they were limited to a certain defined zone on the sun’s surface; he noted
                    the <hi rend="italic">faculoe</hi> with which they are associated, the penumbra
                    by which they are bordered, their slight proper motions, and their rapid changes
                    of form. He inferred from the regularity of their general movements the rotation
                    of the sun on its axis in a period of little less than a month (the actual
                    period is 25d. 7h. 48m.); and he grounded on the varying nature of the paths
                    apparently traversed by them a plausible, though inconclusive, argument in
                    favour of the earth’s annual revolution. Twice in the year, he observed, they
                    seem to travel across the solar disk in straight lines; at other times, in
                    curves. These appearances he referred with great acuteness to the slight
                    inclination of the sun’s axis of rotation to the plane of the ecliptic. Thus,
                    when the earth finds herself in the plane of the sun’s equator, which occurs at
                    two opposite points of her orbit, the spots, travelling in circles parallel with
                    that plane, necessarily appear to describe right lines; but when the earth is
                    above or below the equatorial level, the paths &lt;f the spots open out into
                    curves turned downwards or up wards, according to the direction in which they
                    are seen. The explanation, however, of this phenomenon is equally consistent
                    with the geocentric as with the heliocentric theory of the solar system. The
                    idea of a universal force of gravitation seems to have hovered around the
                    borders of this great man’s mind, without ever fully entering it. He perceived
                    the analogy between the power which holds the moon in the neighbourhood of the
                    earth, and compels Jupiter’s satellites to circulate round their primary, and
                    the attraction exercised by the earth on bodies at its surface j<note

                    central force with initial velocity, and was disposed to connect the revolu
                    tions of the planets with the axial rotation of the sun. This notion, it is
                    plain, tended rather towards Descartes’s theory of vortices than towards
                    Newton’s theory of gravitation. More valid instances of the anticipation of
                    modern discoveries may be found in his prevision that a small annual parallax
                    would eventually be found for some of the fixed stars, and that· extra-Saturnian
                    planets would at some future time be ascertained to exist, and in his conviction

                    distances, infinite velocity.</p>
                <p>The invention of the miscroscope, attributed to Galileo by his first biographer,
                    Vincenzo Viviani, does not in truth belong to him. Such an instrument was made
                    as early as 1590 by Zacharias Jansen of Middleburg; and although Galileo
                    discovered, in 1610, a means of adapting his telescope to the examination of
                    minute objects, he did not become acquainted with the compound microscope until
                    1624, when he saw one of DrebbeΓs instruments in Rome, and, with characteristic
                    ingenuity, immediately introduced some material improvements into its
                    construction.</p>
                <p>The most substantial, if not the most brilliant part of his work consisted
                    undoubtedly in his contributions towards the establishment of mechanics as a
                    science. Some valuable but isolated facts and theorems were previously
                    discovered and proved, but it was he who first clearly grasped the idea of force
                    as a mechanical agent, and extended to the external world the conception of the
                    invariability of the relation between cause and effect. From the time of
                    Archimedes there had existed a science of equilibrium, but the science of motion
                    began to exist with Galileo. It is not too much to say that the final triumph of
                    the Copernican system was due in larger measure to his labours in this
                    department than to his direct arguments in its favour. The problem of the
                    heavens is essentially a mechanical one; and without the mechanical conceptions
                    of the dependence of motion upon force which Galileo familiarized to men’s
                    minds, that problem might have remained a sealed book even to the intelligence
                    of Newton. The interdependence of motion and force was not indeed formulated
                    into definite laws by Galileo, but his writings on dynamics are everywhere
                    suggestive of those laws, and his solutions of dynamical problems involve their
                    recognition. The extraordinary advances made by him in this branch of knowledge
                    were owing to his happy method of applying mathematical analysis to physical
                    problems. As a pure mathematician he was, it is true, surpassed in profundity by
                    more than one among his pupils and contemporaries; and in the wider imaginative
                    grasp of abstract geometrical principles he cannot be compared with Fermat,
                    Descartes, or Pascal, to say nothing of Newton or Leibnitz. Still, even in the
                    region of pure mathematics, his powerful and original mind left notable traces
                    of <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> its working. He studied the properties of the
                    cycloid, and attempted the problem of its quadrature earlier than Mersenne; and
                    in the “infinitesimals,” which he was one of the first to introduce into
                    geometrical demonstrations, was contained the fruitful germ of the differential
                    calculus. But the method which was peculiarly his, and which still forms the
                    open road to discoveries in natural science, consisted in the combination of
                    experiment with calculation—in the transformation of the concrete into the
                    abstract, and the assiduous comparison of results. The first fruits of the new
                    system of investigation was his determination of the laws of falling bodies.
                    Conceiving that the simplest principle is the most likely to be true, he assumed
                    as a postulate that bodies falling freely towards the earth descend with a
                    uniformly accelerated motion, and deduced thence the principal mathematical
                    consequences, a⅛ that the velocities acquired are in the direct, and the spaces
                    traversed in the duplicate ratio of the times, counted from the beginning of
                    motion; finally, he proved, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n45/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0045-0036"/> by observing the times of descent of bodies
                    falling down long inclined planes, that the postulated law was the true law.
                    Even here, he was obliged to take for granted that the velocities acquired in
                    descending from the same height along planes of every inclination are equal; and
                    it was not until shortly before his death that he found the mathematical
                    demonstration of this not very obvious principle.</p>
                <p>The first law of motion—that which expresses the principle of inertia—is
                    virtually contained in the idea of uniformly accelerated velocity. The
                    recognition of the second—that of the independence of different motions— must be
                    added to form the true theory of projectiles. This was done by Galileo. Up to
                    his time it was universally held in the schools that the motion of a body must
                    cease with the impulse communicated to it, but for the “reaction of the medium”
                    which helps it forward. Galileo showed, on the contrary, that the nature of
                    motion once impressed is to continue indefinitely in a uniform direction, and
                    that the effect of the medium is a retarding, not an impelling one. Another
                    commonly received axiom was that no body could be affected by more than one
                    movement at one time, and it was thus supposed that a cannon ball, or other
                    projectile, moves forward in a right line until its first impulse is exhausted,
                    when it falls vertically to the ground. In the fourth of Galileo’s dialogues on
                    mechanics, he demonstrated that the path described by a projectile, being the
                    result of the combination of a uniform transverse motion with a uniformly
                    accelerated vertical motion, must, apart from the resistance of the air, be a
                    parabola. The establishment of the principle of the composition of motions
                    formed a conclusive answer to the most formidable of the arguments used against
                    the rotation of the earth, and we find it accordingly triumphantly brought
                    forward by Galileo in the second of his dialogues on the systems of the world.
                    It was urged by anti-Copernicans that a body flung upwards or cast downwards
                    would, if the earth were in motion, be left behind by the rapid translation of
                    the point from which it started; Galileo, however, proved that the reception of
                    a fresh impulse in no way interfered with the movement already impressed, and
                    that the rotation of the earth was insensible, because shared equally by all
                    bodies at its surface. His theory of the inclined plane, combined with his
                    satisfactory definition of “momentum,” led him towards the third law of motion.
                    We find Newton’s theorem, that “action and reaction are equal and opposite,”
                    stated with approximate precision in his treatise <hi rend="italic">Della
                    Scienza</hi><hi rend="italic">Meccanica,</hi> which contains the substance of
                    lectures delivered during his professorship at Padua; and the same principle is
                    involved in the axiom enunciated in the third of his mechanical dialogues, that
                    “the propensity to fail of a body is equal to the least resistance which
                    suffices to support it.” The problems of percussion, however, did not receive a
                    definitive solution until after his death.</p>
                <p>His services were no less conspicuous in the statical than in the kinetical
                    division of mechanics. He gave the first direct and entirely satisfactory
                    demonstration of equilibrium on an inclined plane, reducing it to the lever by a
                    sound and ingenious train of reasoning; while, by establishing the theory of
                    “virtual velocities,” he laid down the fundamental principle which, in the
                    opinion of Lagrange, contains the general expression of the laws of equilibrium.
                    He studied with attention the still obscure subject of molecular cohesion, and
                    little has been added to what he ascertained on the question of transverse
                    strains and the strength of beams, brought by him for the first time within the
                    scope of mechanical theory. In his <hi rend="italic">Discorso intorno</hi><hi

                    velocities to demonstrate the more important theorems of hydrostatics, deducing
                    from it the equilibrium of fluid in a siphon, and proved against the
                    Aristotelians that the floating of solid bodies in a liquid depends not upon
                    their form, but upon their specific gravities, relative to such liquid.</p>
                <p>In order to form an adequate estimate of the stride made by Galileo in natural
                    philosophy, it would be necessary to enumerate the confused and erroneous
                    opinions prevailing on all such subjects in his time. His best eulogium, it has
                    been truly said, consists in the fallacies which he exposed. The scholastic
                    distinctions between corruptible and incorruptible substances, between absolute
                    gravity and absolute levity, between natural and violent motions, if they did
                    not wholly disappear from scientific phraseology, ceased thenceforward to hold
                    the place of honour in the controversies of the learned. Discarding these
                    obscure and misleading notions, Galileo taught that gravity and levity are
                    relative terms, and that all bodies are heavy, even those which, like the air,
                    are invisible; that motion is the result of force, instantaneous or continuous;
                    that weight is a continuous force, attracting towards the centre of the earth;
                    that, in a vacuum, all bodies would fall with equal velocities; that the
                    “inertia of matter” implies the continuance of motion, as well as the permanence
                    of rest; and that the substance of the heavenly bodies is equally “corruptible”
                    with that of the earth. These simple elementary ideas were eminently capable of
                    development and investigation, and were not only true, but the prelude to
                    further truth; while those they superseded defied inquiry by their vagueness,
                    and baffled it with their obscurity. Galileo was a man born in due time. He was
                    superior to his contemporaries, but not isolated amongst them. He represented
                    and intensified a growing tendency of the age in which he lived. It was
                    beginning to be suspected that from Aristotle an appeal lay to nature, and some
                    were found who no longer treated .the <hi rend="italic">ipse dixit</hi> of the
                    Stagirite as the final authority in matters of science. A vigorous but
                    ineffectual warfare had already been waged against the blind traditions of the
                    schools by Ramus and Telesius, by Patricius and Campanella, and the revolution
                    which Galileo completed had been prepared by his predecessors. Nevertheless, the
                    task which he so effectually accomplished demanded the highest and rarest
                    quality of genius. He struck out for himself the happy middle path between the
                    <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> and the empirical systems, and exemplified with
                    brilliant success the method by which experimental science has wrested from
                    nature so many of her secrets. His mind was an eminently practical one. He
                    cor.cerned himself above all with what fell within the range of exact inquiry,
                    and left to others the larger but less fruitful speculations which can never be
                    brought to the direct test of experiment. Thus, while far-reaching but hasty
                    generalizations have had their day and been forgotten, his work has proved
                    permanent, because he made sure of its foundations. His keen intuition of truth,
                    his vigour and yet sobriety of argument, his fertility of illustration and
                    acuteness of sarcasm, made him irresistible to his antagonists; and the
                    evanescent triumphs of successful controversy have been succeeded by the lasting
                    applause of posterity.</p>
                <p>The first complete edition of Galileo’s writings was published at Florence
                    (1842-1856), in 15 8vo vols., by the Società Editrice Fiorentina, under the able
                    supervision of Signor Eugenio Albèri. Besides the works already enumerated, it

                    and 1633, recovered from Paris in 1846 by the efforts of Count Rossi, and now in
                    the Vatican Library, were to a limited extent made public by Monsignor
