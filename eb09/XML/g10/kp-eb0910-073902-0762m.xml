                    throat; synonyms, Bronchocèle, Derbyshire Neck), a term in medicine applied to a
                    swelling in the front of the neck caused by an enlargement of the thyroid gland.
                    This structure, which lies between the skin and anterior surface of the
                    windpipe, and in health is not large enough to give rise to any external
                    prominence, is liable to occasional variations in size, more especially in
                    females, a temporary enlargement of the gland being not uncommon at the
                    catamenial periods, as well as during pregnancy. In the disease now* under
                    consideration, however, the swelling is well marked, and is not only unsightly,
                    but may by its growth occasion much discomfort, and even give rise to serious
                    symptoms from its encroachment on the windpipe and other important parts in the
                    neck. The size to which goitrous growths may attain is extraordinary, Alibert
                    recording cases of goitre where the tumour not only enormously enlarged the neck
                    but hung down over the breast, or even reached as low as the middle of the
                    thigh.</p>
                <p>In districts where the disease prevails the goitre usually appears in early life,
                    often from the eighth to the twelfth year. Its growth is at first slow, but
                    after several years of comparative quiescence a somewhat sudden increase is a
                    not unfrequent occurrence. In the earlier stages of the disease the condition of
                    the gland is simply an enlargement of its constituent parts, which retain their
                    normal soft consistence; but in the course of time other changes supervene, and
                    it may become the seat of cystic formations, or acquire hardness from increase
                    of connective tissue or calcareous deposits. Occasionally the enlargement of the
                    gland is uniform, but more commonly one of the lobes, generally the right, is
                    the larger. In some rare instances the disease has been noticed to be limited
                    almost entirely to the isthmus which connects the two lobes of the gland. The
                    growth is unattended with pain, and is not inconsistent with a fair measure of
                    health.</p>
                <p>Goitre is a marked example of an endemic disease. There are few parts of the
                    world where it is not found prevailing in certain localities, these being for
                    the most part valleys and elevated plains in mountainous districts. The wide
                    distribution of this disease has naturally led to extensive inquiry and to
                    abundant speculation as to its origin. It is unnecessary to mention the numerous
                    theories which have been advanced on the subject. Many of these have already
                    been referred to under <hi rend="smallcaps">Cretinism</hi> (&lt;∕.ι∖). The most
                    generally accepted view among physicians is that which ascribes the malady to
                    the use of drinking water impregnated with the salts of lime and magnesia, in
                    which ingredients the water of goitrous districts would appear always to abound.
                    This theory alone, however, is inadequate, as is evident from the often-observed
                    fact that in localities not far removed from those in which goitre prevails, and
                    where the water is of the same chemical composition, the disease may be entirely
                    unknown. Hence among the best authorities the tendency now is to regard goitre
                    as the result of a combination of causes, among which local telluric or malarial
                    influences concur in an important manner with those of the drinking water in
                    developing the disease. It is noteworthy that goitre can often be cured by
                    removal from the district where it prevails, as also that it is apt to be
                    acquired by previously healthy persons who settle in goitrous localities; and it
                    is only in such places that the disease exhibits any hereditary tendencies.</p>
                <p>In the treatment of goitre the first step is the removal, if possible, of the
                    patient from the affected locality, and attention to general hygienic rules. The
                    employment of burnt sponge as a cure for goitre was in general use until Dr
                    Coindetof Geneva showed that its acknowledged virtues were in all probability
                    due to the iodine which it contained, and proposed as a substitute this latter
                    agent in a pure state. Dr Coindet’s views were amply borne out, and iodine and
                    its preparations have been universally adopted as the most potent remedy in this
                    disease, and have superseded all other medicines. Small and gradually increased
                    doses of the drug, either in/the form of iodide of potassium or what is known as
                    Lugol’s solution appear to be the best methods of administration. The external
                    application of iodine to the goitre, in the form of liniment or ointment, is of
                    scarcely less value than its internal employment, and would seem to be sometimes
                    capable of effecting a cure alone, as is evident from the method of treatment
                    adopted with singular success in India and originally proposed by the late Major
                    Holmes. This consists in applying to the goitre, by means of a spatula, an
                    ointment of biniodide of mercury for about ten minutes soon after sunrise, and
                    placing the patient with his goitre exposed to rays of the sun for six or seven
                    hours. Blistering<pb break="no"

                    application of the ointment is made, and the patient sent home. This is often
                    found sufficient to effect the cure, but the treatment can, if necessary, be
                    repeated.</p>
                <p>The name “Exophthalmic Goitre” is applied to another form of enlargement of the
                    thyroid gland, differing entirely in its pathological connexions from that above
                    described. In this affection the bronchocele is but one of three phenomena,
                    which together constitute the typical characteristics of the disease, viz.,
                    palpitation of the heart and great vessels, enlargement of the thyroid gland,
                    and protrusion of the eyeballs. This group of symptoms is generally known by the
                    names of Graves’s disease or Von Basedow’s disease, in reference to the
                    physicians by whom the malady was originally recognized and described. Although
                    occasionally observed in men, this affection occurs much more commonly in
                    females and in comparatively early life. It is generally preceded by ill health
                    in some form, more particularly impoverishment of blood, and nervous or
                    hysterical disorders, and is occasionally seen in cases of organic heartdisease.
                    It has sometimes been suddenly developed as the effect of fright or violent
                    mental emotion. The first of the symptoms to appear is usually the palpitation
                    of the heart, which is aggravated by the slightest exertion, and may be so
                    severe as not only to shake the whole frame but even to be audible at some
                    distance from the patient. Au uncomfortable sensation of throbbing is felt
                    throughout the body, and many of the larger blood-vessels are seen to pulsate
                    strongly like the heart. The enlargement of the thyroid glaud generally comes on
                    gradually, and rarely increases to any great size, thus differing from true
                    goitre, as originally noticed by Dr Graves. The enlarged gland is of soft
                    consistence, and communicates a thrill to touch from its dilated and pulsating
                    blood-vessels.</p>
                <p>Accompanying the goitre a remarkable change is observed in the appearance of the
                    eyes, which attact attention by their prominence and the startled expression
                    thus given to the countenance. In extreme cases the eyes protrude from their
                    sockets to such a degree that the eyelids cannot be closed, and injury may thus
                    arise to the constantly exposed eyeballs. Apart from such risk, however, the
                    vision is rarely affected in this disease. Much difference of opinion prevails
                    as to the immediate cause of the protrusion of the eyes, but it is generally
                    ascribed to the increase of the fatty tissue and distension of the blood-vessels
                    of the orbits. It occasionally happens that in undoubted cases of the disease
                    one or other of the three above-named phenomena is absent, generally either the
                    goitre or the exophthalmos. The palpitation of the heart is the most constant
                    symptom. Sleeplessness, irritability, disorders of digestion, diarrhoea, and
                    uterine derangements are common accompaniments.</p>
                <p>The pathology of exophthalmic goitre is still somewhat uncertain, but there are
                    strong reasons to believe that it is essentially a nervous ailment, and that the
                    symptom*» depend on a morbid state of the sympathetic nerve in the neck, which
                    is well known to play an important part in the vaso-motor functions—that is, in
                    controlling the action of the heart and regulating the calibre of the
                    blood-vessels. Iu numerous instances of exophthalmic goitre a diseased state of
                    this nerve has been found <hi rend="italic">post mortem,</hi> although it must
                    be admitted that in some cases no morbid change could be detected. The
                    experiments of Bernard, Brown-Sequard, Schiff, and others upon the functions of
                    the sympathetic nerve lend strong support to this view of the pathology of the
                    disease. Exophthalmic goitre is not directly a fatal malady, but, on the other
                    hand, complete recovery is a less frequent result than partial improvement, the
                    patient continuing to suffer from chronic ill-health. The disturbed condition of
                    the heart’s action leads in some instances to permanent disease of that organ in
                    the form of dilatation of its cavities. In the treatment of exophthalmic goitre
                    the most successful results have been attained by the use of digitalis, which
                    has the effect of giving tone to the heart and contracting the dilated
                    blood-vessels. The tincture of digitalis, in doses of 5 to 10 drops twice or
                    thrice daily, is perhaps the best form of administration. Where anaemia is
                    present iron is indicated, and may be combined with the digitalis, although in
                    some cases it is found to be unsuitable. In allaying the palpitation benefit is
                    said to have frequently followed the application of ice to the cardiac region as
                    well as to the thyroid gland. Iodine, which is so valuable in cases of true
                    goitre, is generally admitted to be of no service in this disease, and is rather
                    held to be injurious. (j. o. <hi rend="smallcaps">a.)</hi></p>
