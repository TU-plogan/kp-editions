                    had settled in England on the revocation of the edict of Nantes. His father,
                    Captain Peter Garrick, was on a recruiting expedition when his celebrated son
                    was born at Hereford on February 19, 1716-17. The captain usually resided at
                    Lichfield on half pay, but, in order to benefit his large family, he accepted an
                    offer to proceed on service to Gibraltar, in place of a brother officer who was
                    desirous of returning to England. This kept him many years absent from home, and
                    the letters written to him by “little Davy,” acquainting him with the doings at
                    Lichfield, are highly interesting memorials of the future Roscius. In his
                    nineteenth year, after receiving a good education at the grammar school of
                    Lichfield, David was sent to the establishment at Edial, opened in June or July
                    1736 by Samuel Johnson, his senior by seven years. The Edial academy was shut in
                    about six months, and on the 2d of March 1736-7 master and pupil, Johnson and
                    Garrick, left Lichfield for London, the one to commence the study of the law,
                    and the other to try his tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Irene—</hi> Johnson, as he
                    afterwards said, “with twopence halfpenny in his pocket,” and Garrick “with
                    three-halfpence in his.” Seven days afterwards, however, Garrick was entered of
                    Lincoln’s Inn, but after remaining for a few months in London, he resided for
                    some time with Mr Colson, a distinguished teacher at Rochester (afterwards
                    Lucasian professor at Cambridge). Captain Garrick, who had returned from
                    Gibraltar, died about a month after his son’s arrival in London. Soon afterwards
                    a rich uncle, a wine merchant at Lisbon, in his will left David a sum of £1000,
                    and he and his brother entered into partnership as wine merchants in <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0093-0084"/> Loudon and Lichfield. The concern was not
                    prosperous— though Foote’s assertion that he had known Garrick with three quarts
                    of vinegar in the cellar calling himself a wine merchant need not be taken
                    literally—and before the end of 1741 he had spent nearly half of his £1000. His
                    passion for the stage completely engrossed him; he tried his hand both at
                    dramatic criticism and at dramatic authorship, and made his first appearance on
                    the stage late in 1740-1, <hi rend="italic">incognito,</hi> as harlequin at
                    Goodman’s Fields, where Woodward, being ill, allowed him to take his place
                    during a few scenes. When the manager of the same theatre, Giffard, took a party
                    of players to Ipswich, Garrick accompanied them, and there made his first essay
                    as an actor under the name of Lyddal, in the part of the black Aboan (in
                    Southerne’s <hi rend="italic">Oroonokd).</hi> His success on the provincial
                    boards determined his future career. On the 19th of October 1741 he made his
                    appearance at Goodman’s Fields in the character of Richard III., and gained the
                    most enthusiastic applause. His staid and sedate brother, and his sisters at
                    Lichfield, were scandalized at this derogation from the provincial dignity of
                    the family; and Garrick, greatly distressed at the shock they had received by
                    the intelligence (which, however, he expected), hastened to give np his interest
                    in the wine company. Each night added to his popularity on the stage. He was
                    received by the best company in town. While his Richard was still calling forth
                    general admiration, he won new applause in Lear and Pierre, as well as in
                    several comic characters (including that of Bayes). Glover (“Leonidas”) attended
                    every performance; Lyttelton, Pitt, and several other members of parliament had
                    shown him the greatest civility. From December 2d he appeared in his own name.
                    Pope went to see him thrice during his first performances, and pronounced that
                    “that young man never had his equal as an actor, and he will never have a
                    rival.” Before next spring he had supped with “the great Mr Murray, counsellor,”
                    and hoped to do so with Mr Pope through Murray’s introduction, while he was
                    dining with Halifax, Sandwich, and Chesterfield. “There are a dozen dukes of a
                    night at Goodman’s Fields,” writes Horace Walpole. <hi rend="italic">The Lying
                    Valet</hi> being at this time brought out with success, the honours of dramatic
                    author were added to those of the stage. His fortune was now made, and while the
                    managers of Covent Garden and Drury Lane resorted to the law to make Giffard
                    close his little theatre, Garrick was engaged by Fleetwood for Drury Lane for
                    the season of 1742. In the meantime, having very advantageous terms offered him
                    for performing in Dublin during part of the summer, he went over to that city,
                    where he found the same homage paid to his merit which he had received from his
                    own countrymen. From September 1742 to April 1745 he continued at Drury Lane,
                    after which he again went over to Ireland, and remained there the whole season,
                    as joint-manager with Sheridan, in the direction and profits of the
                    theatre-royal in Smock Alley. From Dublin he returned to England, and fulfilled
                    a short engagement in 1746-7 with Rich at Covent Garden. This was his last
                    series of performances as a hired actor; for in the close of that season
                    Fleetwood’s patent for the management of Drury Lane expired, and Garrick, in
                    conjunction with Lacy, purchased the property of the theatre, together with the
                    renovation of the patent, and in the winter of 1747 opened it with a strong
                    company of actors, the prologue for the occasion being written by his old
                    preceptor Johnson.</p>
                <p>For a time, at least, “the drama’s patrons” were content with the higher
                    entertainment furnished them; in the end Garrick had to “please” them, like most
                    other managers, by gratifying their love of show. Garrick was surrounded by many
                    players of eminence; and he had the art, as he was told by Miss Clive, “of
                    contradicting the proverb that one cannot make bricks without straw, by doing
                    what is infinitely more difficult, making actors and actresses without genius.”
                    The naturalness of his own acting was its great charm. As Churchill says in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rosciad,</hi> which remains the chief literary monument of
                    Garrick’s pre-eminence among his fellows, he who is “pleased with Nature, must
                    be pleased with thee.” Booth, Quin, and the old tragedians were remarkable for a
                    style of stately declamation, sonorous, and often graceful and impressive, but
                    wanting the versatility and rapid changes of passion that, when exhibited by
                    Garrick, at once captivated the audience. “It seemed,” said Richard Cumberland,
                    “as if a whole century had been stepped over in the passage of a single scene;
                    old things were done away, and a new order at once brought forward, bright and
                    luminous, and clearly destined to dispel the barbarisms of a tasteless age, too
                    long superstitiously devoted to th e illusions of im posing declamation.”
                    Garrick’s French descent and his education may have contributed to give him the
                    vivacity of manner and versatility of conception which distinguished him as an
                    actor; and nature had given him an eye, if not a stature, to command, and a
                    mimic power of wonderful variety. The list of his characters in tragedy, comedy,
                    and farce is large, and would be extraordinary for a modern actor of high rank;
                    it includes not less than seventeen Shakespearean parts. As a manager, though he
                    committed some grievous blunders, he did good service to the theatre and
                    signally advanced the popularity of Shakespeare’s plays, of which not less than
                    twenty-four were produced at Drury Lane under his management. Many of these were
                    not pure Shakespeare; but not every generation has the same notions of the way
                    in which he is best honoured. He purified the stage of much of its grossness,
                    and introduced a relative correctness of costume and decoration unknown
                    before.</p>
                <p>After, about the year 1745, escaping from the chains of an unreturned passion for
                    the beautiful but reckless actress “Peg” Woffington, Garrick had, in 1749,
                    married Mademoiselle Violette (Eva Maria Veigal), a German lady who had
                    attracted the admiration of the court of Vienna as a dancer, and was patronized
                    in England by the countess of Burlington. This lady Garrick called “the best of
                    women and wives,” and he lived most happily with her in his villa at Hampton
                    (acquired by him in 1754, and adorned by the famous Shakespeare temple), whither
                    he was glad to escape from his house in Southampton Street. Their union was
                    childless, and Mrs Garrick survived her husband, living in great respect until
                    1822. Having sold the moiety of his theatre for £35,000, Garrick took leave of
                    the stage by playing a round of his favourite characters—Hamlet, Lear, Richard,
                    Lusignan, and Kitely, as the graver; Archer, Abel Drugger, Sir John Brute,
                    Benedick, Leon, and Don Felix, as those of a lighter cast. He ended the series
                    with Don Felix (in <hi rend="italic">The Wonder)</hi> on June 10, 1776. But he
                    was not long to enjoy his opulent and well-earned repose, for he died in London
                    on the 20th of January 1779. He was buried in Westminister Abbey with imposing
                    solemnities, and amidst an unexampled concourse of people of all ranks. Johnson,
                    whose various and not always consistent criticisms on Garrick are scattered
                    through the pages of Boswell, spoke warmly of the elegance and sprightliness of
                    his friend’s conversation, as well as of his liberality and kindness of heart;
                    and his death, which came upon him unexpectedly, “eclipsed,” Johnson said, “the
                    gaiety of nations, and impoverished the public stock of harmless pleasure.” But
                    the most accurate and discriminating character of Garrick, slightly tinged with
                    satire, is that drawn by Goldsmith in his poem of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Retaliation.</hi> As a literary man Garrick was very happy in his epigrams and
                    slight occasional poems. He had the good taste to recognize, and the spirit to
                    make public his recognition of, the excellence of Gray’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odes</hi> at a time when they were either ridiculed or neglected. His <pb

                    Valet, Lethe, The Guardian, Miss in her Teens, Irish Widow,</hi> &amp;c.), and
                    his alterations and adaptation of old plays, which together fill four volumes,
                    evinced his knowledge of stage effect and his appreciation of lively dialogue
                    and action; but he cannot be said to have added one new or original character to
                    the drama. He was joint author with Colman of <hi rend="italic">The Clandestine
                    Marriage,</hi> irt-which he is said to have written his famous part of Lord
                    Ogleby. The excellent farce, <hi rend="italic">High Life below Stairs,</hi>
                    appears to have been wrongly attributed to Garrick, and to be by Townley, a
                    clergyman. As a .matter of course he wrote many prologues and epilogues.</p>
                <p>Garrick’s correspondence (published, with a short memoir by B∩aden, in 2 vols.
                    4to), and the notices of him in the memoirs of Hannah More and Madame D’Arblay,
                    and above all in Boswell’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson,</hi> bear
                    testimony to his general worth, and to his many fascinating qualities as a
                    friend and companion. The earlier biographies of Garrick are by Arthur Murphy (2
                    vols. 1801) and by thg bookseller Tom Davies (2 vols., 4th ed., 1805), the
                    latter a-Work of some merit, but occasionally inaccurate and confused as to
                    dates. Mr Percy Fitzgerald’s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> (2 vols. 1868) is full
                    and spirited. A charming essay on Garrick appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly Review,</hi> July 1868. (R. CA.—A. W. W.)</p>
