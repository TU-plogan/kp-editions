                    Maubeuge towards the close of the 15th century, is better known to Englishmen by
                    the name of Mabuse than by that of Jenni Gossart, with which he signed some of
                    his pictures, or that of Jennyn van Hennegouwe (Hainault), under which he
                    matriculated in the guild of St Luke, at Antwerp, in 1503. We know nothing of
                    his life before he attained to manhood; but his works at least tell us that he
                    stood in his first period under the influence of artists to whom plastic models
                    were familiar; and this leads to the belief that he spent his youth on the
                    French border rather than on the banks of the Scheldt. In no seat of artistic
                    culture is this feature more conspicuous than at Tournai, Douai, or
                    Valenciennes, and it may be that in one of these cities Mabuse learnt to
                    commingle the study of architecture with the gaudy system of colouring familiar
                    to tinters of stone. Without the subtlety or power of Van der Weyden, he had
                    this much in common with the great master of Tournai and Brussels, that his
                    compositions were usually framed in architectural backgrounds; and this marked
                    characteristic is strongly displayed in the pictures which he executed in the
                    first years of the 16th century. But whilst Mabuse thus early betrays his
                    dependence on the masters of the French frontier, he also confesses admiration
                    foι∙ the great painters who first gave lustre to Antwerp; and in the large
                    altar-pieces of Castle Howard and Scawby, he combines in a quaint and not
                    unskilful medley the sentiment of Memling, the bright and decided contrasts of
                    pigment peculiar to coloured reliefs, the cornered and packed drapery familiar
                    to Van der Weyden, and the bold but Socratic cast of face remarkable in the
                    works of Quentin Matsys. At Scawby he illustrates the legend of the count of
                    Toulouse, who parted with his worldly goods to assume the frock of a hermit. At
                    Castle Howard he represents the Adoration of the Kings, and throws together some
                    thirty figures on an architectural background, varied in detail, massive in
                    shape, and fanciful in ornament. He surprises us by pompous costume and flaring
                    contrasts of tone. His figures, like pieces on a chess-board, are often rigid
                    and conventional. The landscape which shows through the colonnades is adorned
                    with towers and steeples in the minute fashion of Van der Weyden. After a
                    residence of a few years at Antwerp, Mabuse took service with Philip, bastard of
                    Philip the Good, at that time Lord of Somerdyk and admiral of Zeeland. One of
                    his pictures had already become celebrated—a Descent from the Cross (50 figures)
                    on the high altar of the monastery of St Michael of Tongerloo. Philip of
                    Burgundy ordered Mabuse to execute a replica for the church of Middleburg; and
                    the value which was then set on the picture is apparent from the fact that Dürer
                    came expressly to Middleburg (1521) to see it. In 1568 the altar-piece perished
                    by fire. But its principal features were preserved in a large arras hanging,
                    recently exhibited at the Archaeological Museum of Brussels. In 1508 Margaret of
                    Austria sent Philip of Burgundy to Italy to negotiate for the treaty of Cambrai.
                    On this mission he was accompanied by Mabuse; and by this accident an important
                    revolution was effected in the art of the Netherlands. Mabuse appears to have
                    chiefly studied in Italy the cold and polished works of the Leonardesques. He
                    not only brought home a new style, but he also introduced the fashion of
                    travelling to Italy; and from that time till the age of Rubens and Van Dyck it
                    was considered proper that all Flemish painters should visit the peninsula. The
                    Flemings grafted Italian mannerisms <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0867-0844"/> on their own stock; and the cross turned out so
                    unfortunately that for a century Flemish art lost all trace of originality.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1509 Philip returned to the Netherlands, and, retiring to his
                    seat of Suytburg in Zeeland, surrendered himself to the pleasures of planning
                    decorations for his castle and ordering pictures of Mabuse and Jacob of Barbari.
                    Being in constant communication with the court of Margaret of Austria at
                    Malines, he gave the artists in his employ fair chances of promotion. Barbari
                    was made court painter to the regent, whilst Mabuse received less important
                    commissions. Records prove that Mabuse painted a portrait of Leonora of
                    Portugal, and other small pieces, for Charles V. in 1516. But the only signed
                    pictures of this period are the Neptune and Amphitrite of 1516 at Berlin, and
                    the Madonna, with a portrait of Jean Carondelet, of 1517, at the Louvre, in both
                    of which we clearly discern that Vasari only spoke by hearsay of the progress
                    made by Mabuse in “the true method of producing pictures full of nude figures
                    and poesie3.' ’ It is difficult to find anything more coarse or misshapeu than
                    the Amphitrite, unless we except the grotesque and ungainly drayman who figures
                    for Neptune. In later forms of the same subject—the Adam and Eve at Hampton
                    Court, or its feebler replica at Berlin—we observe more nudity, combined with
                    realism of the commonest type. Happily Mabuse was capable of higher efforts. His
                    St Luke painting the portrait of the Virgin in Sanct Veit at Prague, a variety
                    of the same subject in the Belvedere at Vienna, the Madonna of the Baring
                    collection in London, or the numerous repetitions of Christ and the Scoffers
                    (Ghent and Antwerp), all prove that travel had left many of Gossart’s
                    fundamental peculiarities unaltered. His figures still retain the character of
                    stone; his architecture is as rich and varied, his tone3 are as strong as ever.
                    But bright contrasts of gaudy tints are replaced by soberer greys; and a cold
                    haze, the “sfumato” of the Milanese, pervades the surfaces. It is but seldom
                    that these featurβ3 fail to obtrude. When they least show, the master displays a
                    brilliant palette combined with smooth surface and incisive outlines. In this
                    form the Madonnas of Munich and Vienna (1527), the likeness of a girl weighing
                    gold pieces (Berlin), and the portraits of the children of the king of Denmark
                    at Hampton Court, are fair specimens of his skill.</p>
                <p>Philip of Burgundy had been deputed in Italy (1515) to escort Charles V.’s
                    sister, Isabella, to Denmark. She was the affianced bride of Christian II.,
                    whose subsequent attempt to unite Denmark and Sweden ended so fatally. Here a
                    favourable opportunity was afforded for introducing Mabuse to the Danish court;
                    and it is possible that the opportunity was not neglected. Yet Mabuse may have
                    become acquainted with the Danish king at a later period. As early as 1523, when
                    Christian came to Belgium, he asked Mabuse to paint the likenesses of his
                    dwarfs. In 1528 he requested the artist to furnish to Jean de Hare the design
                    for Isabella’s tomb <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> in the abbey of St Pierre near
                    Ghent. It was no doubt at this time that Mabuse completed the portraits of John,
                    Dorothy, and Christine, children of Christian II., which came into the
                    collection of Henry VIII. No doubt, also, these portraits are identical with
                    those of three children at Hampton Court, which were long known and often copied
                    as likenesse3 of Prince Arthur, Prince Henry, and Princess Margaret of England.
                    One of the copies at Wilton, inscribed with the forged name of “Hans Holbein, ye
                    father,” and the false date of 1495, has often been cited as a proof that Mabuse
                    came to England in the reign of Henry VII.; but the statement, it is clear,
                    rests on no foundation whatever. At the period when these portraits were
                    executed Mabuse lived at Middleburg. But he dwelt at intervals elsewhere. When
                    Philip of Burgundy became bishop of Utrecht, and settled at Duerstede, near
                    Wyck, in 1517, he was accompanied by Mabuse, who helped to decorate the new
                    palace of his master. At Philip’s death, in 1524, Mabuse designed and erected
                    his tomb in the church of Wyck. He finally retired to Middleburg, where he took
                    service with Philip’s brother, Adolph, lord of Veeren. Van Mander’s biography
                    accuses Gossart of habitual drunkenness; yet it describes the splendid
                    appearance of the artist as, dressed in gold brocade, he accompanied Lucas of
                    Leyden on a pleasure trip to Ghent, Malines, and Antwerp in 1527. The works of
                    Mabuse are those of a hardworking and patient artist; the number of his still
                    extant pictures practically demonstrates that he was not a debauchee. The
                    marriage of his daughter with the painter Henry Van der Heyden of Louvain proves
                    that he had a home, and did not live habitually in taverns, as Van Mander
                    suggests. His death at Antwerp, on the 1st of October 1532, is recorded in the
                    portrait engraved by Jerome Cock. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">a. c.)</hi></p>
