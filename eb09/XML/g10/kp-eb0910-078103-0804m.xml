                    name of three Roman emperors. The first, Marcus Antonius Africanus Gordianus,
                    the wealthiest of the Romans, was descended on the father’s side from the
                    Gracchi, on the mother’s from Trajan, while his wife was the granddaughter of
                    Antoninus Pius. While he gained unbounded popularity by his magnificent games
                    and shows, his prudent and retired life did not alarm the tyranny of Caracalla.
                    Alexander Severus called him to the dangerous honours of government in Africa,
                    and during his proconsulship there occurred the usurpation of Maximin. The
                    universal discontent roused by the oppressive rule of Maximin culminated in a
                    revolt in Africa in 238, and Gordian reluctantly yielded to the popular clamour
                    and assumed the purple. His son was associated with him in the dignity. The
                    senate confirmed the choice of the Africans, and most of the provinces gladly
                    sided with the new emperors; but, even while their cause was so successful
                    abroad, they had fallen before the sudden inroad of Capel! ianus, who commanded
                    Mauretania in the interest of Maximin. They had reigned only 36 days. Both the
                    Gordians had deserved by their amiable character their high reputation; they
                    were men of great accomplishments, fond of literature, and voluminous authors;
                    but they were rather intellectual voluptuaries than able statesmen or powerful
                    rulers. Having embraced the cause of Gordian, the senate was obliged to continue
                    the revolt against Maximin, and appointed Maximus and Balbinus, two of its
                    noblest and most esteemed members, as joint emperors. At their inauguration a
                    sedition arose, and the popular outcry for a Gordian was appeased by the
                    association of M. Antonius Gordianus Pius, nephew of the younger and grandson of
                    the elder Gordian, a boy of thirteen. Maximin forthwith invaded Italy, but was
                    murdered by his own troops while besieging Aquileia; and a revolt of the
                    praetorian guards, to which Maximus and Balbinus fell victims, left Gordian sole
                    emperor. For some years he was under the control of his mother’s eunuchs, till
                    happily Misitheus, his teacher of rhetoric, whose daughter he married, roused
                    him to free himself from the ignoble tyranny. Misitheus was appointed prefect of
                    the praetorian guards, and wielded ably the supreme power that now belonged to
                    him. When the Persians invaded Mesopotamia, the young emperor at his persuasion
                    opened, for the last time recorded in history, the temple of Janus, and marched
                    in person to the East. Misitheus proved a skilful and prudent general; but his
                    sudden death under strong suspicions of poisoning was the end of Gordian’s
                    prosperity. Discontent and seditions, fostered by Philip, who had succeeded
                    Misitheus, arose in the camp, and Gordian was slain by the mutinous soldiers
                    (244). A monument near the confluence of the Euphrates and Aboras marked the
                    scene.</p>
