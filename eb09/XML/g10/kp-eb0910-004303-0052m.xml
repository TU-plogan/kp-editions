                    a horny excrescence, nearly 8 inches in length, from the back of the human hand,
                    which was caused by <hi rend="italic">Acarus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >domesticus.</hi> What are commonly known as galls are vegetable deformities or
                    excrescences, due to parenchymatous hypertrophy, and, according to the
                    definition of Lacaze-Duthiers, comprise “all abnormal vegetable productions
                    developed on plants by the action of animals, more particularly by insects, what
                    ever maybe their form, bulk, or situation.” For the larvae of their makers the
                    galls provide shelter and sustenance. The exciting cause of the hypertrophy, in
                    the case of the typical galls, appears to be a minute quantity of some
                    irritating fluid, or virus, secreted by the female insect, and deposited with
                    her egg in the puncture made by her ovipositor in the cortical or foliaceous
                    parts of plants. This virus causes the rapid enlargement and subdivision of the
                    cells affected by it, so as to form the tissues of the gall. Oval or larval
                    irritation also, without doubt, plays an important part in the formation of many
                    galls. Though, as Lacaze-Duthiers remarks, a certain relation is necessary
                    between the “stimulus” and the “supporter of the stimulus,” as evidenced by the
                    limitation in the majority of cases of each species of gall-insect to some one
                    vegetable structure, still it must be the quality of the irritant of the
                    tissues, rather than the specific peculiarities or the part of the plant
                    affected, that principally determines the nature of the gall. Thus the
                    characteristics of the currant-gall of <hi rend="italic">Spathegaster</hi><hi

                    to the functions of the parts producing it; the bright red galls of the saw-fly

                    held the view that many oak-galls are pseudobalani, or false acorns: “to produce
                    an acorn has been the intention of the oak, but the gall-fly has frustrated the
                    attempt.” Their formation from buds which normally would have yielded leaves and
                    shoots is explained by Parfitt as the outcome of an effort at fructification
                    induced by oviposition, such as has been found to result in several plants from
                    injury by insect-agency or otherwise.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    or barely a line, in length. Many galls are brightly coloured, as, for instance,
                    the oak-leaf hairy galls of <hi rend="italic">Spathegaster tricolor,</hi> which
                    are of a crimson hue, more or less diffused according to exposure to light. The
                    variety of forms of galls is very great. Some are like urns or cups, others
                    lenticular. The “knoppern” galls of <hi rend="italic">Cynipspolycera,</hi> Gir.,
                    are cones having the broad, slightly convex, upper surface surrounded with a
                    toothed ridge. Of the Ceylonese galls “some are as symmetrical as a composite
                    flower when in bud, others smooth and spherical like a berry; some protected by
                    long spines, others clothed with yellow wool formed of long cellular hairs,
                    others with regularly tufted hairs.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    constant, and as a rule exceedingly diagnostic, even when, as in the case of ten
                    different gall-gnats of an American willow, <hi rend="italic">Salix</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">humilis,</hi> it is difficult or impossible to tell the full-grown
                    insects that produce them from one another. In degree of complexity of internal
                    structure galls differ considerably. Some are monothalamous, and contain but one
                    larva of the gall-maker, whilst others are many-celled, and numerously
                    inhabited. The largest class are the unilocular, or simple, external galls,
                    divided by Lacaze-Duthiers into those with and those without a superficial
                    protective layer or rind, and composed of hard, or spongy, or cellular tissue.
                    In a common gall-nut that authority distinguished seven constituent portions :—
                    an epidermis; a subdermic cellular tissue; a spongy and a hard layer, composing
                    the parenchyma proper; vessels which, without forming a complete investment,
                    underlie the parenchyma; a hard protective layer; and lastly, within that, an
                    alimentary central mass inhabited by the growing larva.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Galls are formed by insects of several orders. Among the Hymenoptera are the
                    gall-wasps <hi rend="italic">(Cynips</hi> and its allies), which infect the
                    various species of oak. They are small insects, having straight antennae, and a
                    compressed, usually very short abdomen, with the second, or second and third
                    segments greatly developed, and the rest imbricated, and concealing the
                    partially coiled ovipositor. The transforma tions from the larval state are
                    completed within the gall, out of which the imago, or perfect insect, tunnels
                    its way,— usually in autumn, though sometimes, as has been observed of some
                    individuals of <hi rend="italic">Cynips Kollari,</hi> after hibernation.</p>
                <p>The phenomena of development in <hi rend="italic">Cynips</hi> and associated
                    genera present many features of interest. Not fewer than 12,000 living specimens

                    Museum, and proved to be all females, as also were the flies obtained in two
                    successive years from some of these by breeding on isolated oak trees in the
                    neighbourhood of London. The same observer detected among about 1200 flies of
                    the gregarious species <hi rend="italic">Aphilothrix (Cynips) radicis</hi> not a
                    single male. In many thousands of Cynipids, representing 28 species, Hartig
                    failed to discover any male. Von Schlectendal, on the other hand, between 24th
                    April and 1st May 1871, from three galls of <hi rend="italic">Rhodites</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rosoe,</hi> L., obtained in the previous year, bred only 2 females
                    and 32 males. These males were of the normal coloration and shape; but some
                    which appeared in the latter part of May, when the females were in larger
                    numerical proportion, were varieties of three kinds, partly resembling the

                    brown to dark greyish-yellow within. What are termed “blue,” black,” or “green”
                    galls contain the insect; the inferior “white” galls, which are lighter
                    coloured, and not so compact, heavy, or astringent, are gathered after its
                    escape (see fig. 1). Less valued are the galls of Tripoli (Taraplus or
                    Tarabulus, whence the name “Tarablous galls”). The most esteemed Syrian galls,
                    according to Pereira, are those of Mosul on the Tigris. Other varieties of
                    nut-galls, besides the above mentioned, are employed in Europe for various
                    purposes. Commercial gall-nuts have yielded on analysis from 26 (H. Davy) to 77

                    shelly chamber, calcium oxalate. Oak-galls are mentioned by Theophrastus,
                    Dioscorides (i. 146), and other ancient writers, including Pliny (A <hi

                    5), according to whom they may be produced “in a single night.” Their insect
                    origin appears to have been entirely unsuspected until within comparatively
                    recent times, though Pliny, indeed, makes the observation that a kind of gnat is
                    produced in certain excrescences on oak leaves. Bacon describes oak-apples as

                <p>Mite-galls, or <hi rend="italic">acarocecidia,</hi> are abnormal growths of the
                    leaves of plants, produced by microscopic Acaridea of the genu3 <hi
                    rend="italic">Phytoptιιs</hi> (gall-mites), and consist of little tufts of
                    hairs, or of thickened portions of the leaves, usually most hypertrophied on the
                    upper surface, so that the lower is drawn up into the interior, producing a
                    bursiform cavity. Mite-galls occur on the sycamore, pear, plum, ash, alder,
                    vine, mulberry, and many other plants; and formerly, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Besides the larva of the gall-maker, or the householder, galls usually contain
                    inquilines or lodgers, the larvae of what are termed guest-flies or
                    cuckoo-flies. Thus the galls of <hi rend="italic">Cynips</hi> and its allies are
                    inhabited by members of other cynipideous genera, <hi rend="italic"

                    large species of <hi rend="italic">Cecidomyia,</hi> which inhabits the heart of
                    the mass, the numerous smaller cecidomyidous larvae in its outer part being mere
                    inquilines. In many instances the lodgers are not of the same order of insects
                    as the gall-makers. Some saw-flies, for example, are inquilinous in the galls of
                    gall-gnats, and some gall-gnats in the galls of saw-flies. Again, galls may
                    afford harbour to insects which are not essentially gall-feeders, as in the case
                    of the Curculio beetle <hi rend="italic">Conotrachelius nenuphar,</hi> Hbst., of
                    which one brood eats the fleshy part of the plum and peach, and another lives in
                    the “black knot” of the plum-tree, regarded by Walsh as probably a true
                    cecidomyidous gall. The same authority <hi rend="italic">(loc. cit.,</hi> p.
                    550) mentions a willow-gall which provides no less than sixteen insects with
                    food and protection; these are preyed upon by about eight others, so that
                    altogether some twenty-four insects, representing eight orders, are dependent
                    for their existence on what to the common observer appears to be nothing but “an
                    unmeaning mass of leaves.” Among the numerous insects parasitic on the
                    inhabitants of galls are hymenopterous flies of the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proctotrypidee,</hi> and of the family <hi rend="italic">Chalcididoe,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., Callimome</hi><hi rend="italic">regius,</hi> the larva of

                    >glutinosa</hi> and its lodger <hi rend="italic">Synergus facialis.</hi> The
                    oak-apple often contains the larvae of <hi rend="italic">Draconidae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ichneumonidas,</hi> which Von Schlechtendal <hi rend="italic"
                    >{loc. sup. cit.,</hi> p. 33) considers to be parasites not on the owner of the
                    gall, <hi rend="italic">Aηdricus</hi><hi rend="italic">terminalis,</hi> but on
                    inquilinous <hi rend="italic">Tortricidoe.</hi> Birds are to be included among
                    the enemies of gall-insects. Oak-galls, for example, are broken open by the
                    titmouse in order to obtain the grub within, and the “button-galls” of <hi
                    rend="italic">Neuroterus</hi><hi rend="italic">numismatis,</hi> Oliv., are eaten
