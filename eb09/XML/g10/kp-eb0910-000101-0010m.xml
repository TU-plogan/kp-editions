                <p>G represents the sound of Gamma, the third letter of the</p>
                <p>Greek alphabet; but in the Latin alphabet, and in the alphabets derived from the
                    Latin (including our own), it holds the place which Z held in the different
                    Greek alphabets. The history of this remarkable change is well known. It has
                    been already stated (see letter C) that in the 5th century before our era, the
                    distinction between the ½-sound and the &lt;7-s0und became lost at Rome:
                    apparently the surviving sound was <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but, at all events, the symbol K went out of use, being retained only in
                    a few familiar abbreviations, and C (which was the Latinized form of the Greek
                    Γ) remained. Thus in the column of Duillius we find C representing the original
                    surd in <hi rend="italic">castreis, cepet, &amp;c.,</hi> but the sonant in <hi
                    rend="italic">macistratos, leciones, ceset (i.e.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gessit),</hi> &lt;tc. When, in the 3d century, the two sounds were again
                    distinguished, two symbols were again required; but the K was not taken again to
                    represent the surd; C, the old symbol for the sonant, was put to that use. A new
                    symbol was therefore necessary for the sonant 5r-s0und, and it was found by
                    modifying C into G. This G should then have replaced C as the third letter of
                    the alphabet, where it would have stood, as before, between B and D, the sonants
                    of the labial and dental classes respectively. But this was not done. The symbol
                    C was left in its old place with its new value of <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> The
                    new symbol G was set in the seventh place of the alphabet, which had been
                    vacated by Z, the representative of a sound not used by the Romans of that day.
                    G is found for the first time in the inscription on the tomb of Scipio Barbatus.
                    Its invention is attributed to Spurius Carvilius.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the sound of G in Latin, as of Γ in Greek, was always
                    the sonant guttural—which we hear in <hi rend="italic">gate,</hi> &amp;c. It was
                    not the sonant palatal, which it represents in <hi rend="italic">gem</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">gin.</hi> This sound began to supplant it about the 6th century of
                    our era, but only when it preceded <hi rend="italic">e</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >i—</hi> the two vowels which require a position of the tongue nearer to the
                    palatal than to the guttural consonants. We find this change of sound in French
                    and in Italian. In the Latin part of our vocabulary there is naturally the same
                    weakening; whereas, in words of English origin, the original guttural is
                    generally preserved, even before <hi rend="italic">e</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">get</hi> and <hi rend="italic">give.</hi>
                    Sometimes it has been weakened at the end of a word, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >bridge</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ridge,</hi> which were originally <hi
                    rend="italic">brigg</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rigg,</hi> and are still so in
                    the north of England.</p>
                <p>It is noteworthy how a &lt;7-s0und made it≡ appearance in <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> French at the beginning of words which originally began with the w-sound.
                    An example is <hi rend="italic">guerre,</hi> a borrowed word from the Teutonic;
                    we see it in Old High German as <hi rend="italic">werra,</hi> a quarrel. The
                    Gauls apparently found a difficulty in producing the initial German sound, and
                    (there being no difference in the position of the back of the mouth for <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> except that the passage
                    between the back-palate and the tongue is entirely closed for <hi rend="italic"
                    >g,</hi> but left slightly open for <hi rend="italic">w)</hi> they did not keep
                    the <hi rend="italic">w</hi> pure, but sounded a <hi rend="italic">g</hi> before
                    it by unintentionally elosing the oral passage for a moment. The same thing is
                    seen in <hi rend="italic">guerir,</hi> which corresponds to Gothic <hi
                    rend="italic">varjan',</hi> in <hi rend="italic">garant,</hi> which we have in
                    English <hi rend="italic">zνar-rant;</hi><hi rend="italic">garnir</hi>
                    corresponds to Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">warniaη.</hi> In a few instances
                    the word so modified seems to have been originally Latin, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >gaine,</hi> a sheath, the Latin <hi rend="italic">vagina.</hi></p>
                <p>This French change has led to a curious result in England. Many words were
                    introduced by the Normans into England in their French form, which were already
                    existent there in their Teutonic form. Thus we have such pairs as <hi
                    rend="italic">wile</hi> and <hi rend="italic">guile, wise</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">guise, warranty</hi> and <hi rend="italic">guarantee, wager</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">gage,</hi> and many others. It is strange that in so many
                    cases each of the pair of words should have remained in use, and with so little
                    change of meaning.</p>
