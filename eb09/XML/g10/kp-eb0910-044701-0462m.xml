                <p>PART I.—GEOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS.</p>
                <p><hi> GERMANY</hi> occupies the greater portion of central Europe, and has but few
                    lines of natural boundary.</p>
                <p>If by the designation Germany is meant the territory inhabited by Germans, this
                    is considerably larger than the German empire constituted in 1871, the former
                    having an area of about 340,000, and the latter of 208,000 English square miles.
                    The present German empire extends from 47° 16' to 55° 53' N. lat., and from 5°
                    52' to 22° 52' E. long. The eastern provinces project so far that the extent of
                    the German territory is much greater from S.W. to N.E. than in any other
                    direction. Tilsit is 815 miles from Metz, whereas Hadersleben, in Schleswig, is
                    only 540 miles from the Lake of Constance. The difference in time between the
                    eastern and western points is 1 hour and 8 minutes. The empire is bounded on the
                    S.W. and S. by Austria and Switzerland (for 1170 miles), on the S.W. by France
                    (275 miles), on the W. by Luxembourg, Belgium, and Holland (together 512 miles).
                    The length of German coast on the North Sea or German Ocean is 300 miles, and on
                    the Baltic 830 miles, the intervening land boundary on the north of Schleswig
                    being only 53 miles. The eastern boundary is Russia (725 miles).</p>
                <p>The total area of the empire, including rivers and lakes but not the “haffs” or
                    lagoons on the Baltic, is 208,427 English square miles,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>English square mile = 2.5898945 square

                    whole dry land, and the 853d part of the whole surface of the globe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Physical Features.</hi><hi rend="italic">Coast and
                    Islands.—</hi> The length of the coast-line is scarcely the third part of the
                    whole frontier, so that the Germans must be regarded as less a maritime than an
                    inland people. Unlike the eastern states of Europe, the German empire has not
                    only an inland sea-shore, but is also in direct communication with the great
                    oceans by means of the North Sea. The coasts of Germany are shallow, and
                    deficient in natural ports, except on the east of Schleswig-Holstein, where wide
                    bays encroach upon the land, giving access to the largest vessels, so that a
                    great harbour for men-of-war has been constructed at Kiel. With the exception of
                    those on the east coast of Schleswig-Holstein, all the important trading ports
                    of Germany are river ports, such as Emden, Bremen, Hamburg, Lübeck, Stettin,
                    Dantzic, Königsberg, Memel. A great difference, however, is to be remarked
                    between the coasts of the North Sea and those of the Baltic. On the former,
                    where the sea has broken up the ranges of dunes formed in bygone times, and
                    divided them into separate islands, the mainland has to be protected by massive
                    dikes, while the Frisian Islands are being gradually washed away by the waters.
                    On the coast of East Friesland there are now only seven of these islands, of
                    which Norderney, a bathing-place, is best known, while of the North Frisian
                    Islands, on the western coast of Schleswig, Sylt is the most considerable.
                    Besides the ordinary waste of the shores, there have been extensive inundations
                    by the sea within the historic period, the gulf of the Dollart having been so
                    caused in the year 1276. Sands surround the whole coast of the North Sea to such
                    an extent that the entrance to the ports is not practicable without the aid of
                    pilots. Heligoland, which has belonged to England since 1814, is a rocky island,
                    but it also has been considerably reduced by the sea. The tides rise to the
                    height of 12 or 13 feet in the Jahde Bay and at Bremerhafen, and 6 or 7 feet at
                    Hamburg. The coast of the Baltic on the other hand possesses few islands, the
                    chief being Alsen and Fehmern off the coast of Schleswig-Holstein, and Rügen off
                    Pomerania. It has no extensive sands, though on the whole very flat. The Baltic
                    has no perceptible tides; and a great part of its coast-line is in winter
                    covered with ice, which also so blocks up the harbours that navigation is
                    interrupted for several months every year. Its three haffs fronting the mouths
                    of the large rivers must be regarded as lagoons or extensions of the river beds,
                    not as bays. The Oder Haff is separated from the sea by two islands, so that the
                    river flows out by three mouths, the middle one (Swine) being the most
                    considerable. The Frische Haff is formed by the Nogat, a branch of the Vistula,
                    and by the Pregel, and communicates with the sea by means of the Pillau Tief.
                    The Kurische Haff receives the Memel, called Niemen in Russia, and has its
                    outlet in the extreme north at MemeL Long narrow alluvial strips called <hi
                    rend="italic">Nehrungen,</hi> lie between the last two haffs and the Baltic. The
                    Baltic coast is further marked by large indentations, the Gulf of Lübeck, that
                    of Pomerania, cast of Rügen, and the semicircular Bay of Dantzic between the
                    promontories of Rixhöft and Brüsterort. The German coasts are now well provided
                    with lighthouses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface and Geology.—</hi> In respect of physical structure
                    Germany is divided into two entirely distinct portions, which bear to one
                    another a ratio of about 3 to 4. The northern and larger part may be described
                    as a uniform plain, covered generally by very recent deposits, but with small
                    areas of Tertiary and Secondary formations protruding here and there. South and
                    Central Germany, on the other hand, is very much diversified in scenery and in
                    geological structure. It possesses large plateaus, such, as that of Bavaria,
                    which stretches away from the foot of the Alps, fertile low plains like that
                    intersected by the Rhine, mountain chains, and isolated groups of mountains,
                    comparatively low in height, and so situated as not seriously to interfere with
                    communication either by road or by railway. Its geological structure corresponds
                    to this diversity of surface. The most ancient rocks of Germany are the
                    gneisses, schists, and granites which form the Bohemian and Bavarian plateau,
                    and extend into Saxony. Another isolated mass of similar rocks rising into the
                    heights of the Vosges and Black Forest has been cut through by the valley of the
                    Rhine. Silurian rocks are but scantily developed in Germany. The Devonian
                    system, however, occupies an extensive area, since it forms the high tableland
                    of the Taunus, Hundsruck, and Eifel, which ranges westw ard into Belgium.
                    Carboniferous rocks with productive coal-fields cover isolated areas, chiefly in
                    north-western Germany, particularly in Westphalia, at Saarbrück, in Saxony, and
                    in Upper and Lower Silesia (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Coal).</hi> Between the
                    Devonian uplands of the Taunus and the crystalline rocks of Bavaria a vast area
                    of western Germany is occupied by the Triassic system, which ranges from Hanover
                    to Basel and from near Metz to Baireuth. The southern half of this vast Triassic
                    basin is bordered by a belt of overlying Jurassic rocks which skirt the Danubian
                    plain in Würtemburg and Bavaria. Cretaceous rocks occur chiefly in north Germany
                    in scattered patches flanking older formations. They evidently underlie the
                    great plain, since they are found rising up here and there to the surface
                    between Westphalia and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n463/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0463-0448"/> Denmark. Older Tertiary formations are absent
                    from Germany, save the portion of the Eocene Alps included within the territory
                    of Bavaria. But Miocene deposits extend into numerous detached basins, including
                    those of the Rhine below Bonn, and at Mainz, the country round Magdeburg, and
                    the plains of Bavaria. These strata contain valuable seams of lignite. The vast
                    plains of northern Germany are covered with glacial drift, which rises to
                    heights of 1400 feet above the sea along the edges of the flanking hills.
                    Igneous rocks of different ages have been erupted in many districts, and further
                    diversify the geology. The best known are the Tertiary and post-Tertiary lavas
                    and cones of the Eifel and Siebengebirge; others of more ancient date occur
                    along the southern slopes of the Harz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mountains and Plateaus.—</hi> Bavaria is the only division of
                    the country that includes within it any part of the Alps, the Austro-Bavarian
                    frontier running along the ridge of the Northern Tyrolese or Bavarian Alps. The
                    loftiest peak of this group, the Zugspitze (57 miles south of Munich), is 9702
                    feet in height, being the highest summit in the empire. The Upper German plain
                    sloping northwards from the Bavarian Alps is watered by the Lech, the Isar, and
                    the Inn, tributaries of the Danube, all three rising beyond the limits of German
                    territory. This plain is separated on the west from the Swiss plain by the Lake
                    of Constance (Bodensee, 1306 feet above sea-level), and on the east from the
                    undulating grounds of Austria by the Inn. The average height of the plain may be
                    estimated at about 1800 feet, the valley of the Danube on its north border being
                    from 1540 feet (at Ulm) to 920 feet (at Passau). The plain is not very fertile.
                    In the upper part of the plain, towards the Alps, there are several lakes, the
                    largest being the Ammersee, the Würmsee or Starnberg Lake, and the Chiemsee.
                    Many portions of the plain are covered by moors and swamps of large extent,
                    there called <hi rend="italic">Moose.</hi> The left or northern bank of the
                    Danube, from Regensburg (Ratisbon) downwards presents a series of granitic rocks
                    called the Bavarian Forest (Bayerischer Wald), which must be regarded as a
                    branch of the Bohemian Forest (Böhmischer Wald). The latter is a range of wooded
                    heights on the frontier of Bavaria and Bohemia, occupying the least known and
                    least frequented regions of Germany. The summits of the Bayerischer Wald rise to
                    the height of about 4000 feet, and those of the Bohemian Forest to 4800 feet,
                    Hoher Arber, about 49° N. lat., being 4842 feet. The valley of the Danube above
                    Ratisbon is flanked by Jurassic plateaus sloping gently to the Danube, but
                    precipitous towards the valley of the Neckar. The centre of this elevated tract
                    is the Rauhe Alp, so named on account of the harshness of the climate. The
                    plateau continuing to the north-east and then to the north, under the name of
                    the Franconian Jura, is crossed by the valley of the winding Altmühl, and
                    extends to the Main. To the west extensive undulating grounds or low plateaus
                    occupy the area between the Main and the Neckar.</p>
                <p>The south western corner of the empire contains a series of better defined
                    hill-ranges. Beginning with the Schwarzwald (Black Forest), we find its southern
                    heights decline to the valley of the Rhine, above Basel, and to the Jura The
                    summits are rounded and covered with wood, the highest being the Feldberg (10
                    miles S.E. of Freiburg, 4902 feet). Northwards the Black Forest passes into the
                    plateau of the Neckarbergland (average height, 1000 feet). The heights between
                    the lower Neckar and the Main form the Odenwald (about 1700 feet); and the
                    Spessart, which is watered by the Main on three sides, is nothing but a
                    continuation of the Odenwald. West of this range of hills lies the valley of the
                    upper Rhine, extending about 180 miles from south to north, and with a width of
                    only 20 to 25 miles. In the upper parts the Rhine is rapid, and therefore
                    navigable with difficulty; this explains why the towns there are not along the
                    banks of the river, but some 5 to 10 miles off. But from Speyer (Spires) town
                    succeeds town as far down as Düsseldorf. The western boundary of this valley is
                    formed in the first instance by the Vosges, where granite summits rise from
                    under the surrounding red Triassic rocks (Sulzer Belchen, 4700 feet). To the
                    south the range is not continuous with the Swiss Jura, the valley of the Rhine
                    being connected here with the Rhone system by low ground known as the Gate of
                    Mülhausen. The crest of the Vosges is pretty high and unbroken, the first
                    convenient pass being near Zabern, which has been taken advantage of for the
                    railway from Strasburg to Paris. On the northern side the Vosges are connected
                    with the Haardt sandstone plateau (Kalmit, 2230 feet), which rises abruptly from
                    the plain of the Rhine. The mountains south of Mainz (Mayence), which are mostly
                    covered by vineyards, are lower, the Donnersberg, however, raising its head to
                    2262 feet. These hills are bordered on the west by the high plain of Lorraine
                    and the coal-fields of Saarbrücken, the former being traversed by the river
                    Moselle. The larger half of Lorraine belongs to France, but the German part
                    possesses great mineral wealth in its rich layers of ironstone (siderite), and
                    in the coal-fields of the Saar. The Devonian tract of the Hundsruck, Taunus, and
                    Eifel is an extended plateau, divided into separate sections by the river
                    valleys. Among these the Rhine valley from Bingen to Bonn, and that of the
                    Moselle from Treves to Coblentz, are winding gorges excavated by the rivers. The
                    Eifel presents a sterile, thinly-peopled plateau, covered by extensive moors in
                    several places. It passes westwards imperceptibly into the Ardennes. The hills
                    on the right bank of the Rhine also are in part of a like barren character,
                    without wood; the Westerwald (about 2000 feet), which separates the valleys of
                    the Sieg and Lahn, is particularly so. The northern and southern limits of the
                    Niederrheinisches Gebirge present a striking contrast to the central region. In
                    the south the declivities of the Taunus (2890 feet) are marked by the occurrence
                    of mineral springs, as at Ems on the Lahn, Nauheim, Homburg, Soden, Wiesbaden,
                    &amp;c., and by the vineyards which produce the best Rhine wines. To the north
                    of this Gebirge, on the other hand, lies the great coal basin of Westphalia (the
                    largest in Germany). In the south of the hilly duchy of Hesse rise the isolated
                    mountain groups of the Vogelsberg (2530 feet) and the Rhön (3117 feet),
                    separated by the valley of the Fulda, which uniting further north with the Werra
                    forms the Weser. To the east of Hesse lies Thuringia, a province consisting of
                    the far-stretching wooded ridge of the Thüringer Wald (with three peaks of
                    upwards of 3000 feet high), and an extensive elevated plain to the north. Its
                    rivers are the Saale and Unstrut. This plateau is bounded on the north by the
                    Harz, an isolated group of mountains, rich in minerals, with its highest
                    elevation in the bare summit of the Brocken (3743 feet). To the west of the Harz
                    a series of hilly tracts is comprised under the name of the Weser Mountains, out
                    of which above Minden the river Weser bursts by the Porta Westphalica. A narrow
                    ridge, the Teutoburger Wald (1300 feet), extends between the Weser and the Ems
                    as far as the neighbourhood of Osnabrück.</p>
                <p>To the east theThüringerWald is connected by the plateau of the Frankenwald with
                    the Fichtelgebirge. This group of mountains, occupying what may be regarded as
                    ethnologically the centre of Germany, forms a hydrographical centre, whence the
                    Nab flows southward to the Danube, the Main westward to the Rhine, the Eger
                    eastward to the Elbe, and the Saale northward, also into the Elbe. In the
                    north-east the Fichtelgebirge connects itself directly with the Erzgebirge,
                    which forms the northern boundary of Bohemia.</p>

                <p>The southern sides of this range are comparatively steep; on the north it slopes
                    gently down to the plains of Leipsic, but is intersected by the deep valleys of
                    the Elster and Mulde. Although by no means fertile, the Erzgebirge is very
                    thickly peopled, as various branches of industry have taken root there in
                    numerous small places. Around Zwickau there is a productive coal-field, and
                    mining for metals is carried on near Freiberg. In the east a tableland of
                    sandstone, called Saxon Switzerland, from the picturesque outlines into which it
                    has been eroded, adjoins the Erzgebirge; one of its most notable features is the
                    deep ravine by which the Elbe escapes from it. Numerous quarries, which supply
                    the North German cities with stone for buildings and monuments, have been opened
                    along the valley. The sandstone range of the Elbe unites in the east with the
                    low Lusatian group, along the east of which runs the best road from northern
                    Germany to Bohemia. Then comes a range of lesser hills clustering together to
                    form the frontier between Silesia and Bohemia. The most western group is the
                    Isergebirge, and the next the Riesengebirge, a narrow ridge of about 20 miles’
                    length, with bare summits. Excluding the Alps, the Schneekoppe (5266 feet) is
                    the highest peak in Germany; and the southern declivities of this range contain
                    the sources of the Elbe. The hills north and north east of itare termed the
                    Silesian Mountains. Here one of the minor coal-fields gives employment to a
                    population grouped round a number of comparatively small centres. One of the
                    main roads into Bohemia (the pass of Landshut) runs along the eastern base of
                    the Riesengebirge. Still farther to the east the mountains are grouped around
                    the hollow of Glatz, whence the Neisse forces its way towards the north. This
                    hollow is shut in on the east by the Sudetic group, in which the Altvater rises
                    to almost 4900 feet. The eastern portion of the group, called, the Gesenke,
                    slopes gently away to the valley of the Oder, which affords an open route for
                    the international traffic, like that through the Mülhausen Gate in Alsace,
                    Geographers style this the Moravian Gate.</p>
                <p>The North-German plain presents little variety, yet is not absolutely uniform, A
                    row of low hills runs generally parallel to the mountain ranges already noticed,
                    at a distance of 20 to 30 miles to the north. To these belongs the Upper
                    Silesian coal-basin, which occupies a considerable area in south-eastern
                    Silesia. North of the middle districts of the Elbe country the heights are
                    called the Flaming hills. Westward lies as the last link of this series the
                    Lüneburger Haide or Heath, between the Weser and Elbe, north of Hanover. A
                    second tract, of moderate elevation, sweeps round the Baltic, without, however,
                    approaching its shores. This plateau contains a considerable number of lakes,
                    and is divided into three portions by the Vistula and the Oder. The most
                    eastward is the so-called Prussian Seenplatte. Spirdingsee (430 feet above
                    sea-level, and 46 square miles in area) and Mauersee are the largest lakes; they
                    are situated in the centre of the plateau, and give rise to the Pregel. Some
                    peaks near the Russian frontier attain to 1000 feet. The Pomeranian Seenplatte,
                    between the Vistulι and the Oder, extends from S.W. to N.E., its greatest
                    elevation being in the neighbourhood of Dantzic (Thurmberg, 1096 feet). The
                    Seenplatte of Mecklenburg, on the other hand, stretches from S.E. to N.W., and
                    most of its lakes, of which the Müritzsee is the largest, send their waters
                    towards the Elbe. The finely wooded heights which surround the bays of the east
                    coast of Holstein and Schleswig may be regarded as a continuation of these
                    Baltic elevations. The lowest parts, therefore, of the North-German plain,
                    excluding the sea-coasts, are the central districts from about 52° to 53° N.
                    lat,, where the Vistula, Netze, Warthe, Oder, Spree, and Havel form vast swampy
                    lowlands (in German called <hi rend="italic">Brüche),</hi> which, during the
                    last hundred years, have been considerably reduced by the construction of canals
                    and by cultivation,—improvements due in large measure to Frederick the Great.
                    The Spreewald, to the S.E. of Berlin, is one of the most remarkable districts of
                    Germany. As the Spree divides itself there into innumerable branches, enclosing
                    thickly wooded islands, boats form the only means of communication. West of
                    Berlin the Have] widens into what are called the Havel lakes, to which the
                    environs of Potsdam owe their charms. In general the soil of the North-German
                    plain cannot be termed fertile, the cultivation nearly everywhere requiring
                    severe and constant labour. Long stretches of ground are covered by moors, and
                    there turf-cutting forms the principal occupation of the inhabitants. The
                    greatest extent of moorland is found in the westernmost parts of the plain, in
                    Oldenburg and East Frisia. The plain contains, however, a few districts of the
                    utmost fertility, particularly the tracts on the central Elbe, and the marsh
                    lands on the west coast of Holstein and the north coast of Hanover, Oldenburg,
                    and East Frisia, which, within the last two centuries, the inhabitants have
                    reclaimed from the sea by means of immense dikes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.—</hi> Nine independent river-systems may be
                    distinguished: those of the Memel, Pregel, Vistula (Weichsel), Oder, Elbe,
                    Weser, Ems, Rhine, and Danube. Of these the Pregel, Weser, and Ems belong
                    entirely, and the Oder mostly, to the German empire. The Danube has its sources
                    on German soil; but only the fifth part of its course is German. Its total
                    length is 1730 miles, and the Bavarian frontier at Passau, where the Inn joins
                    it, is only 350 miles distant from its sources. It is navigable as far as Ulm,
                    220 miles above Passau; and its tributaries the Lech, Isar, Inn, and Altmühl are
                    also navigable. The Rhine is the most important river of Germany, although
                    neither its sources nor its mouths are within the limits of the empire. From the
                    Lake of Constance to Basel (122 miles) the Rhine forms the boundary between the
                    German empire and Switzerland; the canton of Schaffhausen, however, is situated
                    on the northern bank of the river. From Basel to below Emmerich the Rhine
                    belongs to the German empire—about 470 miles, or four-sevenths of its whole
                    course. It is navigable all this distance, as are also the Neckar from
                    Esslingen, the Main from Bamberg, the Lahn, the Lippe, the Ruhr, the Moselle
                    from Metz, with its affluents the Saar and Sauer. Vessels sail up the Ems as far
                    as Papenburg, and river craft as far as Greven, and the river is connected with
                    a widely branching system of canals for turf-boats. The Fulda, navigable for 63
                    miles, and the Werra 38 miles, above the point where they unite, form by their
                    junction the Weser, which has a course of 271 miles, and receives as navigable
                    tributaries the Aller, the Leine from Hanover, and some smaller streams. Large
                    steamers cannot, however, get as far as Bremen, and that commercial emporium
                    has, in consequence, been obliged to form a seaport at Bremenhafen. The Elbe,
                    after a course of 250 miles, enters German territory near Aussig, 482 miles from
                    its mouth. It is navigable above this point to its junction with the Moldau.
                    Hamburg may be reached by vessels of 10 to 11 feet draught. The navigable
                    tributaries of the Elbe are the Saale (below Naumburg), the Havel, Spree, Elde,
                    Sude, and some others. The Oder begins to be navigable almost on the frontier at
                    Ratibor, 480 miles from its mouth, receiving as navigable tributaries the Glatz
                    Neisse and the Warthe. Only the lower course of the Vistula belongs to the
                    German empire, within which it is a broad, navigable stream of considerable
                    volume. On the Pregel ships of 2500 tons reach Königsberg, and river barges
                    reach Insterburg; the Alle, its tributary, may also be navigated. The Memel is
                    navigable in its course of 113 miles from the Russian frontier. Germany is thus
                    a country <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n467/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0467-0450"/> abounding in natural waterways, the total length
                    of them being estimated at 7000 miles. But it is only the Rhine, in its middle
                    course, that has at all times sufficient volume of water to meet the
                    requirements of a good navigable river.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lakes.—</hi> The regions which abound in lakes have already
                    been pointed out. The Bodensee or Lake of Constance (186 square miles) is on the
                    frontier of the empire,— portions of the northern banks belonging severally to
                    Bavaria, Wiirtemberg, and Baden. The largest lake entirely on German territory
                    is the Chiemsee (75 square miles); the Ammersee and the Würmsee are, however,
                    but little less. A good many smaller lakes are to be found in the Bavarian Alps.
                    The North-German plain is dotted with upwards of 500 lakes, covering an area of
                    about 2500 square miles. The largest of these are the three Haffs,— the Oderhaff
                    covering 370 square miles, the Frische Haff 332, and the Kurische Haff 626. The
                    lakes in the Prussian and Pomeranian provinces, in Mecklenburg, and in Holstein,
                    and those of the Havel, have already been mentioned. In the west the only lakes
                    of importance are the Steinhuder Meer, 14 miles north-west of Hanover, and the
                    Diimersee on the southern frontier of Oldenburg.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate of Germany is to be regarded as
                    intermediate between the oceanic and continental climates of western and eastern
                    Europe respectively. It has nothing in common with the Mediterranean climate of
                    southern Europe, Germany being separated from that region by the lofty barrier
                    of the Alps. Although there are very considerable differences in the range of
                    temperature and the amount of rainfall throughout Germany, these are not so
                    great as they would be were it not that the elevated plateaus and mountain
                    chains are in the south, while the north is occupied by low-lying plains. In the
                    west no chain of hills intercepts the warmer and moister winds which blow from
                    the Atlantic, and these accordingly influence at times even the eastern regions
                    of Germany. The mean annual temperature of south-western Germany, or the Rhine
                    and Danube basins, has in recent years been about 52 <hi rend="superscript">
                    3</hi> to 54°, that of central Germany 48° to 50°, and that of the northern
                    plain 46° to 48°. In Pomerania and West Prussia it is only 44° to 45°, and in
                    East Prussia 42° to 44°. The warmest districts of the German empire are the
                    northern parts of the Rhine plain, from Carlsruhe downwards, especially the
                    Rheinthal; these are scarcely 300 feet above the sea-level, and are protected by
                    mountainous tracts of land. The same holds true of the valleys of the Neckar,
                    Main, and Moselle. Hence the vine is everywhere cultivated in these districts.
                    The mean summer temperature there is 66° and upwards, while the average
                    temperature of January does not descend to the freezing point (32°). The climate
                    of north-western Germany (west of the Elbe) shows a predominating oceanic
                    character, the summers not being too hot (mean summer temperature 60° to 62°),
                    and snow in winter remaining but a short time on the ground. West of the Weser
                    the average temperature of January exceeds 32°; to the east it sinks to 30°, and
                    therefore the Elbe is generally covered with ice for some months of the year, as
                    are also its tributaries. The further one proceeds to the east the greater are
                    the contrasts of summer and winter. While the average summer warmth of Germany
                    is 60° to 62°, the January temperature falls as low as 26° to 28° in West
                    Prussia, Posen, and Silesia, and 22° to 26° in East Prussia and Upper Silesia.
                    The navigation of the rivers is regularly interrupted by frost. Similarly the
                    upper basin of the Danube, or the Bavarian plain, has a rather inclement climate
                    in winter, the average for January being 25° to 26°.</p>
                <p>As regards rainfall, Germany belongs to those regions where atmospheric
                    precipitation takes place at all seasons, but chiefly in the form of summer
                    rains. In respect to the quantity of rain the empire takes a middle position
                    between the humidity of north-western Europe and the aridity of the east. There
                    are considerable differences between particular places. The rainfall is greatest
                    in the Bavarian table-land and the hilly regions of western Germany. For the
                    Eifel, Sauerland, Harz, Thüringer Wald, Rhön, Vogelsberg, Spessart, the Black
                    Forest, the Vosges, &amp;c., the annual average may be stated at 34 inches or
                    more, while in the lower terraces of south-western Germany, as in the Erzgebirge
                    and the Sudetic range, it is estimated at 30 to 32 inches only. The same average
                    obtains also on the humid north-west coast of Germany as far as Bremen and
                    Hamburg. In the remaining parts of western Germany, on the shores of Further
                    Pomerania, and in East Prussia, it amounts to upwards of 24 inches. In western
                    Germany there is a district famous for the scarcity of rain, and for producing
                    the best kind of wine: in the valley of the Rhine below Strasburg, in the
                    Palatinate, and also in the valley of the Main, no more than from 16 to 20
                    inches fall. Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, and Lusatia, Saxony and the plateau of
                    Thuringia, West Prussia, Posen, and Lower Silesia are also to be classed among
                    the more arid regions of Germany, the annual rainfall being 16 to 20 inches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Vegetation, Animals, and Agriculture.</hi></p>
                <p>The flora of Germany comprises about 3000 species of phanerogamic and about 4000
                    cryptogamie plants. The country does not, however, form a single natural region,
                    and cannot be characterized distinctively by any of the principal botanical
                    types.</p>
                <p>No uniform returns for the whole empire have been published, furnishing details

                    provided with timber. A narrow strip along the shores of the Baltic is covered
                    with oaks and beeches; further inland coniferous trees are the most prevalent,
                    particularly the Scotch fir; birches are also abundant. The mountain forests
                    consist chiefly of firs, pines, and larches, but contain also silver firs,
                    beeches, and oaks. Chestnuts appear on the terraces of the Rhine valley, and in
                    Swabia and Franconia. The whole north-west of Germany is destitute of wood, but
                    to compensate for this the people have ample supplies of fuel in the extensive
                    stretches of turf, <hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The same kinds of cereal
                    crops are cultivated in all parts of the empire, but in the south and west wheat
                    is predominant, and in the north and east rye, oats, and barley. To these in
                    some districts are added spelt, buckwheat, millet, rice-wheat <hi rend="italic"

                    is remarkably well cultivated. The three years’ rotation formerly in use, where
                    autumn and spring-sown grain and fallow succeeded each other, has now been
                    abandoned, ex cept in some districts, where the system has been modified and
                    improved. In South Germany the so-called <hi rend="italic">Fruchtwechsel</hi> is
                    practised, the fields being sown with grain crops every second year, and with
                    pease or beans, grasses, potatoes, turnips, &amp;c., in the intermediate years.

                    crops have as yet been published, but, according to private estimates, a fair
                    average season will yield 325 million quarters of rye,<note anchored="true"

                    100. In good seasons the production has been found sufficient to meet the native
                    demand. Formerly the exports of the produce of the wheat and pulse crops
                    exceeded the imports, but the importation of cereals has now for a number of
                    years been constantly increasing. The potato is largely cultivated, not merely
                    for food, but for distillation into spirits. This manufacture is prosecuted
                    especially in eastern Germany. The Prussian provinces east of the Elbe,
                    including Mecklenburg and Saxony, with a population of about 19 millions,

                    for the production of sugar, which has greatly increased during the last thirty
                    years. There are two centres of the beetroot sugar production: 231 factories, or
                    more than two-thirds of the whole, are in Prussian Saxony, Hanover, Brunswick,
                    Anhalt, and Thuringia, and there are 71 in Silesia, Brandenburg, and Pomerania,
                    the principal centre of the latter group being Frankfort-on-the-Oder. Flax and
                    hemp are cultivated, though not so much as formerly, for manufacture into linen
                    and canvas, and also for the production of oil. The home supply no longer
                    suffices for the native demand. The cultivation of hops is in a very thriving
                    condition in the southern states of Germany. The soil occupied by hops was

                <p>Tobacco forms the most productive and most profitable object of culture in many
                    districts. The total extent under this crop in 1876 was 53,720 acres, no less
                    than 32 per cent, of this being in Baden, 22 in Bavaria, 16 in Alsace-Lorraine,
                    and only 30 per cent, in the rest of Germany. In the north the plant is
                    cultivated principally in Pomerania, Brandenburg, and East and West Prussia. Of
                    late years the production has on the whole diminished, the average amount having
                    been 800,000 cwts. from 1872 to 1876.</p>
                <p>The culture of the vine is almost confined to southern and western Germany, and
                    especially to the Rhine district. The northern limits of its growth extend from
                    Bonn in a northeasterly direction through Cassel to the southern foot of the
                    Harz, crossing 52° N. lat. on the Elbe, running then east some miles to the
                    north of that parallel, and finally turning sharply towards the south-west on
                    the Warthe. In the valley of the Saale and Elbe (near Dresden), and in Lower
                    Silesia (between Guben and Grünberg), the number of vineyards is small, and the
                    wines of inferior quality; but along the Rhine from Basel to Coblentz,in Alsace,
                    Baden, the Palatinate, and Hesse, and above all in the province of Nassau, the
                    lower slopes of the hills are literally covered with vines. Here are produced
                    the celebrated Rüdesheimer, Hochheimer, and Johannisberger. The vines of the
                    lower Main, particularly those of Würzburg, are the best kinds; those of the
                    upper Main and the valley of the Neckar are rather inferior. The Moselle wines
                    are lighter and more acid than those of the Rhine. The total amount produced in
                    Germany is estimated at 1000 million gallons,—Alsace-Lorraine turning out 400
                    millions, Baden 175, Bavaria, Würtemberg, and Hesse together 300, while the
                    remainder, which though small in quantity is in quality the best, is produced by
                    Prussia.</p>

                <p>The breeding of domestic animals is prosecuted most extensively in Bavaria, and
                    in the maritime provinces. There we find 1000 to 1500 head of the larger kinds
                    (horses, cattle, sheep, goats, swine) for every 1000 inhabitants; in the rest of
                    eastern Germany 600 to 800; and in central and southern Germany only 400 to
                    600.. In the number of horses Germany ranks with Great Britain (about 80 for
                    every 1000 inhabitants); and, although the production cannot satisfy the home
                    demand, the imports being nearly 30,000 in excess of the exports annually, the
                    breeding of horses has attained great perfection. The main centre is in East and
                    West Prussia, where there are more than half a million of horses,—about 30 per
                    English square mile; then follow the marsh districts on the Elbe and Weser, some
                    parts of Westphalia, Saxony, and Upper Silesia, Lower Bavaria, Lower Alsace, and
                    Lorraine. Cattle abound in most South-German states, especially Bavaria and
                    Würtemberg, where there are 180 to 200 head for every square mile. In the
                    northern and north eastern districts, on the other hand, the numbers are small
                    (in some districts on!y 30 to 50 head to the square mile), except
                    Schleswig-Holstein and the marsh lands along the shores of the North Sea, whence
                    there is a considerable exportation to England. The aggregate number of sheep in
                    Germany is only exceeded in Europe by that in Great Britain and Russia. The
                    principal sheep districts are Pomerania and Mecklenburg (300 per square mile).
                    As a rule, sheepfarming is resorted to where the soil is of inferior quality and
                    unsuitable for tillage and the breeding of cattle. Far more attention is
                    accordingly given to the rearing of sheep in northern and north-eastern Germany
                    than in Schleswig-Holstein, East Frisia, Westphalia, Rhineland, and South
                    Germany. The exportation of sheep is considerable, amounting in 1871 to
                    1,460,000 head; in 1875, however, the number was only 1,000,000. At the same
                    time the native demand for wool is not covered by the home production. The
                    largest stock of swine is in central Germany and Saxony, in Westphalia, on the
                    lower Rhine, in Lorraine, Hesse, &lt;fcc. Central Germany (especially Gotha and
                    Brunswick) exports sausages and hams largely, as well as Westphalia; but the
                    excess of swine imported over the •exports for the whole of Germany ranges from
                    600,000 to 800,000 annually.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agricultural Population.—</hi> In the census returns of 1871
                    the number of persons entered as agriculturists (including persons engaged in
                    rearing stock, in forestry, and the fisheries) was about 12,210,000, comprising
                    1,844,202 proprietors (1,690,931 males and 153,271 females), 2,101,005
                    agricultural labourers, &amp;c., with 6,764,747 members of their families
                    (2,338,174 males and 4,426,573 females), and about 1,500,000 (660,000 males and
                    840,000 females) engaged in household duties. Agriculture thus supports
                    three-tenths of the population.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wild Animals.—</hi> The number of wild animals in Germany is
                    not very great. Foxes, martens, weasels, badgers, and otters are to be found
                    everywhere; wolves are rare, but they find their way sometimes from French
                    territory to the western provinces, or from Poland to Prussia and Posen. Among
                    the rodents the hamster and the field-mouse are a scourge to agriculture. Of
                    game there are the roe, stag, boar, and hare; the fallow deer and the wild
                    rabbit are less common. The elk is to be found in the forests of East Prussia.
                    The feathered tribes are everywhere abundant in the fields, woods, and marshes.
                    Wild geese and ducks, grouse, partridges, snipes, woodcocks, quails, widgeons,
                    and teal are plentiful all over the country. Geese and ducks are found mostly in
                    the flat districts, where the great abundance of standing water affords ample
                    scope for their increase. Tame geese are bred in large flocks, particularly in
                    Pomerania. The length of time that birds of passage remain in Germany differs
                    considerably with the different species. The stork is seen for about 170 days,
                    the houseswallow 160, the snow-goose 260, the snipe 220. In northern Germany
                    these birds arrive from twenty to thirty days later than in the south.</p>
                <p>The waters of Germany abound with fish; but the genera and species are few. Carp
                    and salmon tribes are the most abundant; after them rank the pike, the eel, the
                    shad, the roach, the perch, and the lamprey. In addition to frogs, Germany has
                    few varieties of Amphibia. Of serpents there are only two kinds, one of them
                    being poisonous.</p>
                <p>The rearing of bees is particularly attended to in the heathy districts of
                    Hanover. The number of bee-hives may be estimated at 2 millions, and the produce
                    of wax and honey at 100,000 cwts. The cultivation of silk-worms has been
                    attempted, but has either entirely failed or had very indifferent success. In
                    1852-62 an attempt was made to extend the cultivation of the mulberry in the
                    province of Brandenburg; but disease among the silk-worms, which it was found
                    impossible to repress, rendered it unsuccessful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mines and Minerals.</hi></p>
                <p>Germany abounds in useful minerals, and in consequence takes a high place among
                    industrial states. The production falls short, indeed, of that of England, but
                    bears comparison with that of France and of the United States. The last annual
                    report of the imperial statistical office (for the year 1876) classified the
                    mineral produce of Germany under the following heads :—</p>

                    the 14th century, at Zwickau (Saxony), and on the Ruhr. The production, which

                <p>There are six large coal fields, occupying an area of about 3600 square miles, of
                    which the most important occupies the basin of the Ruhr, its extent being
                    estimated at 2800 square miles. Here there are more than 60 beds, of a total
                    thickness of 150 to 200 feet of coal; and the amount in the pits has been
                    estimated at 45,000 millions of tons, so that the basin, at the present rate of
                    17,500,000 tons raised per annum, would not be exhausted in 2000 years. Smaller
                    fields are found near Osnabrück, Ibbenbüren, and Minden, and a larger one near
                    Aix-la-Chapelle. The Saar coal-field, within the area enclosed by the rivers
                    Saar, Nahe, and Blies (460 square miles), is one of great importance. The
                    thickness of 80 beds amounts to 250 feet, and Von Dechen estimates the total
                    mass of coal at 45,400 million tons. The greater part of the basin belongs to
                    Prussia, the rest to Lorraine. A still larger field exists in the Upper Silesian
                    basin, on the border-land between Austria and Poland, containing about 50,000
                    million tons. Beuthen is the chief centre. The Silesian coal-fields have a
                    second centre in Waldenburg, east of the Riesengebirge. The Saxon coalfields
                    stretch eastwards for some miles from Zwickau. Deposits of less consequence are
                    found in Upper Bavaria, Upper Franconia, Baden, in the Harz, Ac.</p>

                <p>The above tables do not include lignite, of which numerous beds are scattered
                    over Germany. Extensive strata follow the course of the Oder, and a second group
                    is spread over Lusatia, but the largest and most important deposit is in the
                    Saale districts from Altenburg to the Harz. Smaller fields are situated round
                    Cassel, northward of Frankfort, near Cologne and Aix-la-Chapelle, in the west of
                    Hanover, and in the Upper Palatinate. The total production is stated in the
                    official returns at 11,100,000 tons, representing a value of £1,922,000. Of this
                    8,780,000 tons are supplied by the fields in the Saale districts (province of
                    Saxony, Anhalt, Brunswick, Saxe-Altenburg, and kingdom of Saxony). In North
                    Germany turf also is of importance as a fuel; the area of the turf moors in
                    Prussia is estimated at 8000 square miles, of which more than 2000 are in the
                    north of Hanover. The coal produced supplies the home demand, although a
                    considerable trade is carried on across the frontier. Through the ports of the
                    North Sea and the Baltic more than 2 million tons of coals are imported annually
                    from England, and nearly 2⅛ million tons of lignite come from Bohemia, On the
                    other hand, the Ruhr and the Saar basins export nearly 3 million tons of coal to
                    the Netherlands, France, and Switzerland, and the Upper Silesian basin lj
                    millions to Austria and Russia. The following table gives a comparative view of
                    the quantity supplied by the more important coal-producing countries in 1876

                <p>The greatest advance has been made in the production of steel. In 1863 the
                    quantity was only 1,400,000 cwts., but in 1872 it was about 6,500,000. The
                    greater part of this is produced at the celebrated works of Krupp in Essen and
                    the cast-steel works in Bochum. Many European states have for a considerable
                    time been supplied by Krupp with cast-steel guns. The production of rails not
                    only covers the home demand, but has allowed an annual exportation of 3,000,000
                    cwts. since 1877. Hardware also, the production of which is centred in Solingen,
                    Heilbronn, Esslingen, &amp;c., is largely exported. Germany stands second to
                    Great Britain in the manufacture of machines and engines. There are in many
                    large cities of North Germany extensive establishments for this purpose, but the
                    industry is not limited to the large cities. It must be admitted that in
                    agricultural machinery Germany cannot as yet compete with England. The
                    locomotives and waggons for the German railways, however, are almost exclusively
                    built in Germany; and Russia, as well as Austria, receives large supplies of
                    railway plant from German works. In shipbuilding likewise Germany is becoming
                    independent of England; and dockyards have been erected on the coast for the
                    construction of large ironclads.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Silver and Gold.—</hi> Germany produces more silver than any
                    other European state, and the quantity is annually increasing. Silver and gold
                    are extracted from the ores in the mines of Freiberg (Saxony)and near the Harz;
                    but silver is also refined from lead and copper ores in Upper Silesia,
                    Merseburg, Aix-la-Chapelle, Wiesbaden, and Arnsberg. The gold-mining is of far
                    less importance. The value of silver produced was, in 1867, £791,370; 1873,
                    £1,539,590; 1876, £1,098,470; and that of gold, 1867, £11,750; 1876,
                    £39,234.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lead.—</hi> The quantity of the lead produced allows Germany to
                    export from 300,000 to 400,000 cwts. annually. Nearly half the produce is
                    obtained near Aix-la-Chapelle (651,273 cwts. in 1876); next come Upper Silesia
                    (265,000 cwts.), Harz (176,550 cwts.), Nassau (143,770 cwts.), Saxony, Arnsberg,
                    àc. The value in 1867 was only £898,140; but in 1876, £1,565,280; the quantity
                    was 987,090 cwts. in 1867, and 1,512,000 cwts. in 1876.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Copper.—</hi> Although Germany yields more copper than any
                    other European state, the native supply does not meet the demand. In recent
                    years more than 200,000 cwts. have been imported. The Harz mountains and their
                    environs (Mansfeld) alone produce five sixths of the whole amount, which has
                    been doubled during the ten years ending 1876:—1867, 77,440 cwts., value
                    £312,750; 1876, 168,430 cwts., value £641,750.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Zinc.—</hi> About 90 per cent, of the zinc produced in Europe
                    is yielded by Belgium and Germany. The exportation from the latter amounts to
                    more than half a million of cwts. per annum. The production doubled during the
                    period from 1850 (620,000 cwts.) to 1860, but has made only slow progress since
                    that time. In 1867 it was only 1,277,000 <pb break="no"

                    1,664,500, value &lt;£1,740,600. 70 per cent, is produced in Upper Silesia in
                    the neighbourhood of Beuthen, the rest in Westphalia and the Rhineland.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Salt.—</hi> Germany possesses abundant salt deposits. The
                    actual production not only covers the home consumption, but also allows a yearly
                    increasing exportation, especially to Russia, Austria, and Scandinavia. In
                    1877-78 there were 77 salt works in operation, 8 of which were mining works for
                    rock-salt. The provinces of Saxony and Hanover, with Thuringia and Anhalt, have
                    28 works, and produce half the whole amount. A large work is found at Strzalkowo
                    (Posen), and smaller ones near Dortmund, Lippstadt, and Minden (Westphalia). Tn
                    South Germany salt abounds most in Würtemberg (Hall, Heilbronn, Rottweil); the
                    principal Bavarian works are at the foot of the Alps near Freilassing and
                    Rosenheim. Hesse and Baden have 6 salt works; Lorraine and the Upper Palatinate,
                    6. The total yield now amounts to 8,318,000 cwts. boiled salt, 3,221,000 cwts.
                    rock salt, and 256,000 cwts. of other kinds. The production has made great
                    advance during the last thirty years, having in 1850 been only 5 million cwts,,
                    while in 1877 it was upwards of 11 million cwts.</p>

                    substance is turned out by 15 works in Anhalt, where only the potash ores are
                    found. The production there in 1876 was 846,000 cwts., value about

                <p>Till very recent times no estimate of the population of Germany was precise
                    enough to be of any value. At the beginning of the present century the country
                    was divided into some hundred states, but there was no central agency for
                    instituting an exact census on a uniform plan. Even the formation of the German
                    Confederation in 1815 effected but little change in this respect, and it was
                    left to the different states to arrange in what manner the census should be
                    taken. On the formation, however, of the German Customs Union or Zollverein
                    between certain German states, the necessity for accurate statistics became
                    apparent, since the amounts accruing from the common import duties were to be
                    distributed according to the number of inhabitants in the several states. The
                    Zollverein had its origin in a customs convention between Prussia and the
                    grand-duchy of Hesse in 1828; and other states, as they gradually became
                    convinced of the advantages afforded by a general customs frontier, joined it
                    from time to time during the succeeding forty years. The following table shows
                    the progressive territorial limits of the Zollverein—which maybe regarded as the
                    precursor of the present German empire;—</p>

                    only from 1867 that the returns gave the actual resident population. The

                <p>Comparing the census returns of 1871 and 1875,∙ it is found that only
                    Alsace-Lorraine (17,934), the two Mecklenburgs (together 5231), and Waldeck
                    (1481) are decreasing; all other states are increasing, though at very different
                    rates. A comparison cannot here be made, however, between the smaller and the
                    larger states. Hamburg and Bremen, for example, have considerably increased, but
                    these must be regarded as consisting of single large towns, and a similar
                    increase is found in all the great cities of Germany. Tn southern Germany
                    (Alsace-Lorraine not included), and also in Hanover, the growth of population
                    has been insignificant, whereas the population in the eight old provinces of
                    Prussia and in Saxony shows a marked increase.</p>
                <p>It appears from the following table that the inhabitants of Prussia and Saxony
                    have increased 60 to 70 per cent, in 40 to 44 years, and those of the other
                    states only 18 to 23 per cent. And it is to be observed that this increase is
                    not confined to the industrial districts, but that those provinces also which
                    have few large cities and the population of which live for the most part by
                    agriculture, such as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n473/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0473-0456"/> Pomerania, Prussia, Posen, have increased by 50
                    to 60 per cent. This is to be explained by the fact that there has been a very
                    extensive immigration into Prussia since 1815, whereas emigration has been
                    mostly from South Germany. But the surplus of births over deaths also has at all
                    times been greater in the North.</p>

                <p>In comparing this with similar tables for England, a great difference is obvious.
                    While the average annual rate of births (4Γ6) has been much higher than in
                    England (34'0) during recent years, the annual death-rate does not compare
                    favourably with that of England (22'3) or of other states. Only Russia, Finland,
                    Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Servia exhibit greater higher rates.</p>

                    Pomerania, Mecklenburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Hanover, Oldenburg, Bremen, and

                <p>in these districts by the surplus of births is neutralized by the steady
                    migration of the people into the cities. In the accompanying official statistics
                    all the inhabitants of communes with more than 2000 souls are designated “town
                    population,” and the term “rural population” is applied to those of the smaller
                    places. But it must be remarked that in several provinces, such as Westphalia,
                    Rhineland, and Oldenburg, there are many communes consisting of numerous small
                    villages and hamlets which have not the character of a town, and the inhabitants
                    of which are almost exclusively agriculturists. These rank as town population,
                    which accordingly appears in the returns to be a little larger than it really
                    is. The figures exhibit the extremely unequal increase of the different groups
                    from 1871 to 1875.</p>

                <p>The following is a list of the 35 towns which had upwards of 50,000 inhabitants
                    at the census of 1875. The first column exhibits the population within the
                    boundaries of the municipal boroughs (Stadtgemeinde). The numbers in the second
                    are not official, but include all suburbs of a really urban character. The
                    latter therefore afford a better indication of the actual size of the several
                    towns.</p>

                <p>The most thinly peopled territories are found, not as might be expected in the
                    mountain regions, but in some parts of the plains. There are not more than 50
                    persons to the square mile (about the same proportion as in the Scotch
                    Highlands) on the moors of the Isar north of Munich, on the East-Frisian moors,
                    and on the Lüneburg Heath. There are 50 to 100 inhabitants to the square mile on
                    the Seenplatten of Pomerania and Mecklenburg, on the middle ridges of
                    Schleswig-Holstein, in the horthern districts of Hanover, in the Spreewald,
                    &lt;fcc, Leaving out of account the small centres, Germany may be roughly
                    divided into two thinly and two densely peopled parts. In the former division
                    has to be classed all the North German plain; there it is only in the valleys of
                    the larger navigable rivers, and on the southern border of the plain, that the
                    density reaches 150 to 200 inhabitants per square mile. In some places indeed it
                    is far greater: at the mouths of the Elbe and the Weser, in East Holstein, in
                    the delta of the Memel, 250 to 300, and in the environs of Hamburg even 400,
                    inhabitants are found to the square mile. This region is bordered on the south
                    by a very densely inhabited district, the northern boundary of which may be
                    defined by a line from Breslau to Hanover, and its southern by a line from
                    Coburg <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Cassel to Münster. Here the density rises from
                    150 to 570 per square mile, for in this part of Germany there are not only very
                    fertile districts, such as the “Goldene Aue” in Thuringia, but also centres of
                    industry. The population is thickest in Upper Silesia around Beuthen
                    (coal-fields), round Ratibor, Neisse, and Waldenburg (coal-fields), round Zittau
                    (Saxony), in the Elbe valley around Dresden, in the districts of Zwickau and
                    Leipsic as far as the Saale, in the Goldene Aue, on the northern slopes of the
                    Hartz, and around Bielefeld in Westphalia. In all these places the density is
                    greater than 350 inhabitants to the square mile, and in Saxony it exceeds 500.
                    The third division of Germany comprises the basin of the Danube and Franconia
                    (the Upper Main system), and sweeps to the north-west between the valleys of the
                    Werra and the tributaries of the Rhine as far as Sauerland. The population of
                    Franconia rises a little above that of the rest of this region, the density in
                    the valley of the Regnîtz between Nuremberg and Bamberg, and in the Main valley
                    round Würzburg, reaching about 200 to 240 inhabitants per square mile. The
                    fourth division embraces the valleys of the Rhine and the Neckar. In the latter
                    and in the Upper Rhine plain agriculture has reached a high degree of
                    perfection, and the soil is so fertile as to support a population of 400 per
                    square mile. North of the Niederrlieinisches Schiefergebirge, again, are rich
                    coal-fields, —making this the most important industrial district in Germany.
                    Here indeed, in the governmental district of Düsseldorf, the population amounts
                    to 700 per square mile, —about the same proportion as in the West Riding of
                    Yorkshire; but no such density as exists in Lancashire (1500 to the square mile)
                    is found anywhere in Germany. West of the Rhine a thickly peopled district is
                    grouped round the coal-field of the Saar basin, but there is only a scattered
                    population in the surrounding country. On the Eifel there are scarcely 100
                    inhabitants to the square mile.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Houses.—</hi> The number of houses was estimated in 1871 at
                    5,330,000, so that the average number of inhabitants per house is from 7 to 8.
                    In England and Wales it is only 5 ’ 3 (1871). The greatest proportion of
                    dwelling-houses to the population is in Alsace (5 ’ 1 persons to one house) and
                    in Swabia (5 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4). All the larger cities of Germany
                    consist largely of houses in which a number of families live together. In Berlin
                    the proportion per house is 57 persons, while in London it is only 8. This marks
                    one important point of difference in the habits of the two countries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Occupations.—</hi> The census of 1871 distinguishes 8 principal
                    classes of occupation, but does not subdivide these. The official returns give
                    for each class the number of persons engaged in the several occupations
                    comprised in that class, with the number of attendants and other members of the
                    families of those so occupied. The following table presents an abstract of the
                    returns. In the case of Alsace-Lorraine the attendants are not given in the
                    separate classes, but are all returned under class D.</p>

                    fabrics in France exceeded that in Germany; but as the cotton manufacture is
                    pursued largely in Alsace, more than 2 million spindles being employed there,
                    the balance is now against the former country. In 1873 there were about 5
                    million spindles in Germany and 4,611,000 in France. From the subjoined table of

                    excess was only 117,000 cwts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Woollen and Worsted.—</hi> In this class of manufactures
                    Germany is far behind France. First of all, the home production of wool is not
                    sufficient. In 1873-75 the imports of wool exceeded the exports by 300,000 cwts.
                    per annum, and in 1876-78 the excess amounted to 800,000 cwts. In 1875 there
                    were about 1,200,000 spindles for carded woollen yarn,—about 700,000 of them in
                    Prussia, and 320,000 in Saxony. For worsted spinning there were 450,000
                    spindles,—Upper Alsace having 180,000, and Saxony 110,000; nevertheless the
                    production falls short of the demand, and from 150,000 to 250,000 cwts. must be
                    obtained from foreign countries. The manufacture of woollen cloth is well
                    developed, and is prosecuted for exportation. The cloth is valued as being well
                    woven, durable, and cheap. The centres of its manufacture are the Rhine
                    province, Brandenburg, Lower Silesia, Magdeburg, Thuringia, Saxony, Würtemberg,
                    and Alsace. In 1875 there were altogether 192,452 persons engaged in the woollen
                    industry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Linen, Hemp, and Jute.—</hi> Germany, although linen was
                    formerly one of her most important articles of manufacture, is now left far
                    behind in this industry, not only by Great Britain and France, but also by
                    Austria-Hungary. In 1874 there were 326,538 spindles at work in Germany for
                    flax, hemp, and jute spinning, while there were 415,000 in Austria, 663,000 in
                    France, and 1,670,000 in Great Britain. About 300,000 cwts. of linen yarn are
                    imported into Germany annually, whereas Austria exports about 100,000 cwts,
                    Hand-loom weaving is practised all over Germany, but centres principally in
                    Saxony, Silesia, and Westphalia. In recent times also power-loom weaving has
                    been extending. In 1873 there were 68 establishments in Germany, principally at
                    Elberfeld and Barmen, with 3473 power-looms, including 7 factories, with 546
                    power-looms, for jute. The linen industry employed 187,793 persons in 1875. The
                    demand for linen is nearly covered by the home production.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bilk.—</hi> Raw silk can scarcely be ranked among the products
                    of the empire, and the annual demand has thus to be provided for by importation.
                    It amounts to about 50,000 cwts., there being some superior silk-weaving
                    establishments. The main centre of the silk industry is Crefeld and its
                    neighbourhood; then come Elberfeld and Barmen, Aix-la-Chapelle, as well as
                    Berlin, Potsdam, Chemnitz and Annaberg, Munich, Stuttgart, Saargemünd, &amp;c.
                    The exports of silk stuffs always exceed the imports.</p>

                    >Roads.</hi> —The construction of good highways has been welt attended to in
                    Germany only since the Napoleonic wars. The separation of the empire into small
                    states was favourable to road-making, inasmuch as it was principally the smaller
                    Governments that expended large sums for their network of roads. Thirty years
                    ago the best roads were found in Hanover and Thuringia: the Thüringer Wald has
                    been almost transformed into a park by its splendid roads. But some districts
                    suffer even still from the want of good highways. The introduction of railways
                    for a time diverted attention from road-making, but this neglect has of late
                    been to some extent remedied. In Prussia the circles <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Kreise)</hi> have now themselves undertaken the charge of the construction of
                    the roads; but they receive a subsidy from the public funds of the several
                    provinces. The total length of the public roads is now estimated at 72,000
                    miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> The period of railway construction was
                    inaugurated in Germany by the opening of the line from Nuremberg to Fürth in
                    1835, but the development of the system was slow. The want of a central
                    government operated injuriously here, for it frequently happened that intricate
                    negotiations and solemn treaties between several sovereign states were required
                    before a line could be constructed; and moreover the course it was to take was
                    often determined less by the general exigencies of commerce than by many
                    trifling interests or desires of neighbouring states. The state which was most
                    self-seeking in its railway politics was Hanover, which separated the eastern
                    and western parts of the kingdom of Prussia. The difficulties arising to Prussia
                    from this source were experienced in a still greater degree by the seaports of
                    Bremen and Hamburg. Until 1866 there was no railway from Bremen into the
                    interior of Germany, while now there are four. Prior to 1865 the construction of
                    railways advanced pretty uniformly, the average construction during the years
                    from 1840 to 1865 having been from 340 to 370 miles per annum. Germany was at
                    that time far outstripped in the extent of its railway system by England,
                    Belgium, and Switzerland, and even by France. A new period of railway
                    construction begins <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n477/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0477-0460"/> with the year 1866, and is closely connected with
                    the economical and political progress of Germany. Numerous great undertakings
                    were then set on foot, partly to remedy the defects of the existing system.
                    Everywhere it became a primary object to establish the most direct lines of
                    communication between important places of industry and commerce. As a
                    consequence the German railway system was immensely enlarged, and from 1865-75
                    it has nearly been doubled. In 1872, 2000 miles were opened, the average from
                    1869 to 1877 being 1080 miles annually, so that Germany now owns a greater
                    length of railways than any other state in Europe. On the 31st December 1877
                    Germany had 18,830 miles, Great Britain and Ireland 17,092, France 14,785. As
                    regards proportion to the area and population, however, Belgium, Great Britain,
                    and Switzerland are still in advance. In 1877 Belgium had 320 miles of railways
                    to every 1000 square miles, Great Britain 273, Switzerland 155, and Germany 147.

                <p>In recent years the multiplication of competing railways has greatly reduced the
                    receipts of the older lines. The total amount of capital sunk in railway
                    construction is estimated for the year 1876 at £373,558,000, or just about half
                    the capital invested for the same purpose in Great Britain (£741,800,000). From
                    the subjoined table it will be seen that the working expenses have considerably
                    advanced during late years, and dividends accordingly have experienced a great
                    decline. Railways formerly paying 15 to 18 per cent, have gone down to 5 to 6;
                    the average dividend, which in 1870 was still 6 per cent., in 1876 had fallen to
                    4 ’ 4 per cent.</p>

                <p>The making of railways has from the outset been regarded by some German states as
                    exclusively a function of the Government. The South German states, for example,
                    possess only state railways. In Prussia numerous companies have in the first
                    instance constructed their systems, and the state has contented itself for the
                    most part with laying lines in such districts only as were not likely to attract
                    private capital. Yet, in order to establish a preponderating influence over the
                    administration of all German railways, the Government has for some time been
                    buying up private lines. Saxony not long ago purchased all the Saxon railways
                    belonging to private companies. The following table gives the proportion of
                    state and private railways at 31st December 1877, the minor North German states
                    being classed along with Prussia. Of these Oldenburg alone possesses a greater
                    length of railways belonging to the state than of those in the hands of private
                    companies. The railways of Alsace-Lorraine are the property of the empire. The
                    number of independent managements in 1878 was 67.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Canals.—</hi> Germany cannot be said to be rich in canals. In
                    South Germany the Ludwigs-canal was until the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine the
                    only one of importance. It was constructed by King Ludwig of Bavaria in order to
                    unite the German Ocean and the Black Sea, and extends from the Main at Bamberg
                    to Kelheim on the Danube. Alsace-Lorraine had canals for connecting the Rhine
                    with the Rhone and the Marne; the coals of the Saar valley were conveyed by
                    canals to Lorraine. The North German plain has several canals, of which only the
                    more important need be named. In the east a canal by which Russian grain is
                    conveyed to Königsberg joins the Pregel to the Memel. The Netze canal unites the
                    Vistula and Oder. The Upper Silesian coal-field is in communication with the
                    Oder by means of a canal. The greatest number of canals is found around Berlin;
                    they serve to join the Spree to the Oder and Elbe. Smaller canals are found also
                    in the north-west. The Meuse and the Rhine are also connected by a canal. The 70
                    canals in Germany have a total length of only 1250 miles, a very small extent
                    when the other canal systems of western Europe are compared with it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Posts and Telegraphs.</hi></p>
                <p>With the exception of Bavaria and Würtemberg, which have administrations of their
                    own, all the German states belong to the system of the reichspost. Since 1874
                    the postal and telegraphic departments have been combined. Both branches of
                    administration have undergone a surprising development during the last 10 years,
                    especially since the reduction of the postal rates. Germany, including Bavaria
                    and Würtemberg, constitutes with Austria-Hungary a special postal union
                    (Deutsch-Oesterreichischer Postverband), besides forming part of the
                    international postal union. There are no statistics of posts and telegraphs
                    before 1867, for it was only when the North German union was formed that the
                    lesser states resigned their right of carrying mails in favour of the central
                    authority. Formerly the prince of Thurn-and-Taxis was postmaster-general of
                    Germany, but only some of the central states belonged to his postal territory.
                    The seat of management was Frankfort. Of late years the number of post-offices
                    has increased considerably, as will be seen from the following figures, in which
                    the statistics of the Bavarian and Würtemberg post-offices are included, as well
                    as those of the reichspost. In 1872 there were 7400 post-offices; in 1877, 8600.
                    In the latter year therefore there was one post-office for every 23 square
                    miles. In 1877 there were 3194 imperial post-and-telegraph offices, and 3746
                    imperial post-offices, while the Bavarian post-offices numbered 1243, and those
                    of Würtemberg 499. The following table shows the increase of letter circulation

                    departments Germany has been saved a large number of officials; but great sums
                    are still spent annually on the extension of the telegraph system. Since 1876
                    important localities have been brought into communication with Berlin by
                    subterranean wires. This plan is expensive, but under it a considerable saving
                    is anticipated in repairs. The number of telegraph offices in 1877 was 7251, of
                    which about 4600 belonged to the state, and the rest to private railways. The

                <p>The increase of messages is insignificant, a circumstance which must be
                    attributed to the recent dulness of trade. On the whole the telegraph is not as
                    yet used to a very great extent in Germany. The number of messages for every 100
                    inhabitants in 1877 was 33, as compared with 47 in Norway, 49 in Denmark, 54 in
                    Belgium, 58 in the Netherlands, 64 in Great Britain, and 100 in Switzerland.</p>

                <p>The German mercantile marine has always been distinguished by the excellence of
                    its personnel. The seamen of Frisia are acknowledged to be among the best in the
                    world, and the shipping of Bremen and Hamburg had won an everywhere respected
                    name long before a German mercantile marine, properly so-called, was heard of.
                    Many Hamburg vessels sailed under charter of English and other houses in foreign
                    waters, especially in the Chinese. Since 1868 all German ships have carried a
                    common flag—black, white, red—but formerly Oldenburg, Hanover, Bremen, Hamburg,
                    Lübeck, Mecklenburg, and Prussia had each its own flag, and Schleswig-Holstein
                    vessels sailed under the Danish flag. It is but lately that a uniform mode of
                    measuring the hold tonnage of German ships has been introduced, and accordingly
                    it is only since 1871 that it has been possible to give an exact statement of
                    the position of German shipping. The official returns show that the marine is on
                    the increase. The following table gives its position on the 1st of January in
                    the years 1872-78. The tonnage is reckoned according to the English register
                    ton.</p>

                <p>The lowest tonnage of vessels included in this return is 16 tons for sailing
                    vessels and 11 tons for steamers. On comparing the state of the German marine
                    with that of other cóuntries we find that Germany ranks fourth in the list of
                    maritime nations. Great Britain and the United States have considerably larger
                    fleets. That of Norway also was even in 1871 greater than that of Germany, and
                    it has increased much more rapidly than the other since that time; but on the
                    other hand the mercantile marines of France and Italy, which in 1871 were larger
                    than the German, are both now less. The following table shows the proportion of
                    the mercantile shipping of Germany belonging to each of the maritime states on
                    the 1st of January 1878. It must be borne in mind that Bremen and Hamburg
                    properly consist only of one port each, whereas Prussia has hundreds of miles of
                    coast-line both on the North Sea and on. the Baltic.</p>

                <p>The number and the tonnage of steamers have, as in other countries, increased
                    greatly, while those of sailing vessels have remained almost stationary. The
                    aggregate horsepower of the steamers in 1871 was 23,287; in 1877 it was 50,603.
                    The number of seamen employed in 1878 was 40,832, and of those 8173 served on
                    board steamers.</p>
                <p>In 1876 165 sailing vessels of 35,439 tons, and 14 steamers of 6200 tons, were
                    built in Germany; and 8 sailing vessels of 3862 tons, and 1 steamer of 1910
                    tons, were built abroad. There were besides 50 ships with a total tonnage of
                    21,755 which had been bought in America, Holland, and Great Britain.</p>

                <p>Only 44 per cent, of the ships that trade with German porta sail under the German
                    flag. British ships have a very considerable trade in German ports. They
                    constitute 32 per cent, of the total tonnage, and as much as 47 per cent, of the
                    tonnage of steam vessels. Denmark follows next with 7 ’ 2 per cent., Sweden 4 ’

                    1876 was 45,492, of which 12,963 were made between German ports. Much more
                    considerable, however, is the trade of German ships between the home ports and
                    foreign countries, as the subjoined table will show, while no fewer than 9777
                    voyages were made in 1876 by German vessels without calling at any home port

                <p>Statistics relating to the foreign trade of the empire are necessarily confined
                    to very recent times. The quantities of such imported articles as are liable to
                    duty have indeed been known for many years; and some years ago an attempt was
                    also made to compile official tables showing the value both of imports and of
                    exports. But when the results of these tables proved the importation to be very
                    much greater than the exportation, the conviction arose that the valuation of
                    the exports was erroneous, and below the reality. There is no compulsory
                    declaration of such goods, and consequently the attempt to compute statistics of
                    this nature has been abandoned since 1875. It must at the outset be observed
                    that the customs frontier does not coincide with the political frontier of
                    Germany, for it does not take in the free-port territories of Hamburg and
                    Cuxhaven, Bremen, Bremerhafen and Geestemünde, Ac. (in all, 129 square miles
                    with 593,040 inhabitants, in 1875), besides some communes in Baden adjoining the
                    Lake of Constance (22 square miles, 5236 inhabitants). On the other hand the
                    grand-duchy of Luxembourg (998 square miles, with 205,158 inhabitants in 1875)
                    and the small Austrian commune of Jungholz 206 inhabitants), near Füssen, belong
                    to the German Zollverein. The collection of duties is a function of the empire.
                    The following table Shows the results of the official calculations of the
                    imports into Germany for 1872-76, and also the values of the exports, but in the
                    case of these it is only the figures for the years 1872-74 that are official.
                    The numbers for 1875 and 1876 are those published by Professor Laspeyres in the

                <p>The extremely slight variation which this table shows in the exports of the
                    several years from 1872 to 1876 appears so improbable that we can hardly venture
                    to make it a basis of calculation, or to draw a conclusion so unfavourable to
                    the trading balance of Germany as the figures would suggest. The proportion per
                    head of population is, as regards imports and exports respectively, about <hi

                    1876 amounted in the one case to £11, 10s. and in the other to £6, thus showing
                    the German trade to be less than half that of England. The statistical tables do
                    not specify the several foreign markets for imports and exports; they only give
                    the value of imports on the different frontiers.</p>

                <p>According to the official trade returns of Great Britain, France, and other
                    countries, the trade between Germany and these countries is very considerable.
                    By the English tables the importation from Germany to British ports was in
                    1875-76 between £21,000,000 and £22,000,000; the exportation to Germany in 1875
                    was £23,300,000, and in 1876, £20,100,000. The movement of trade is shown in the
                    following tables, of the principal articles imported and exported. We begin with
                    articles of consumption :—</p>

                    considerable quantities of grain from abroad. The value of the importation,
                    estimated at £14,000,000 in 1872, was nearly £36,000,000 in 1877. Similarly the

                <p>With regard to the proper products of industry, the exports, with few exceptions,
                    such as yarn, exceed the imports in every case, as is shown in the table below.
                    The total value of all fabrics imported is estimated at about £30,000,000, that
                    of those exported at from £42,000,000 to £45,000,000. But, even supposing the
                    last figures to be too low, the difference between the German and the British
                    trade is still very great, since the value of all the industrial products
                    exported by Great Britain may be stated at £170,000,000 for the year 1875 (see
                    <hi rend="italic">Almanach</hi><hi rend="italic">de Gotha,</hi> 1877). The
                    difference is greatest in the textile industries, —the value of tissues exported
                    from England in 1875 being estimated at £100,000,000, while that of Germany did
                    not rank higher than from £20,000,000 to £25,000,000. Articles of hardware are
                    showing a great decrease of imports and a considerable increase of exports.</p>

                <p>The German empire is a union of 25 sovereign states, —4 kingdoms, 6
                    grand-duchies, 5 duchies, 7 principalities, 3 free towns. Alsace-Lorraine, ceded
                    by France at the peace concluded 10th May 1871, forms a twenty-sixth constituent
                    of the confederation, but it is administered by the central authority. The
                    supreme direction of the military and political affairs of the empire has, by
                    the vote of the reichstag or diet of the North German confederation, been vested
                    in the king of Prussia, who accordingly bears the title of German Emperor
                    (Deutscher Kaiser).</p>
                <p>The imperial dignity is hereditary in the line of Hohenzollern, and follows the
                    law of primogeniture. The emperor exercises the imperial power in the name of
                    the confederated states. In his office he is assisted by a federal council or
                    bundesrath, which represents the Governments of the individual states of
                    Germany. The members of this council, 59 in number, are appointed for each
                    session by the Governments of the individual states. The legislative functions
                    of the empire are vested in the emperor, the bundesrath, and the reichstag or
                    diet. The members of the latter, 397 in number, are elected for a space of three
                    years by universal suffrage. Vote is by ballot, and one member is elected by
                    (approximately) every 100,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>As regards its legislative functions, the empire has supreme and independent
                    control in matters relating to military affairs and the navy, to the imperial
                    finances, to German commerce, to posts and telegraphs, and also to railways, in
                    so far as these affect the common defence of the country. Bavaria and
                    Würtemberg, however, have preserved their own postal and telegraphic
                    administration. The legislative power of the empire also takes precedence of
                    that of the separate states in the regulation of matters affecting freedom of
                    migration (Freizügigkeit), domicile, settlement, and the rights of German
                    subjects generally, as well as in all that relates to banking, patents,
                    protection of intellectual property, navigation of rivers and canals, civil and
                    criminal legislation, judicial procedure, sanitary police, and control of the
                    press and of associations.</p>
                <p>The executive power is in the emperor’s hands. He represents the empire
                    internationally, and can declare war if defensive, and make peace as well as
                    enter into treaties with other nations; he also appoints and receives
                    ambassadors. For declaring offensive war the consent of the federal council must
                    be obtained. The separate states have the privilege of sending ambassadors to
                    the other courts; but all consuls abroad are officials of the empire, and are
                    named by the emperor.</p>
                <p>Both the federal council and the reichstag meet in annual sessions convoked by
                    the emperor who has the right, of proroguing and dissolving the diet; but the
                    prorogation <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n481/mode/1up"

                    dissolution new elections must be ordered within 60 days, and the new session
                    opened within 90 days. All laws for the regulation of the empire must, in order
                    to pass, receive the votes of an absolute majority of the federal council and
                    the reichstag. The subjoined table gives the number of votes which the separate
                    states have in the federal council. Each state may appoint as many members to
                    the federal council as it has votes. The table also gives the number of the
                    deputies in the reichstag. The official order of precedence of the 26 states is
                    given in a former table (see p. 455); here they are arranged in the order of the
                    number of their inhabitants.</p>

                <p>The federal council is presided over by the chancellor of the empire
                    (Reichskanzler). Imperial measures, after passing the federal council and the
                    reichstag, must obtain the sanction of the emperor in order to become law, and
                    must be countersigned, when promulgated, by the chancellor of the empire. All
                    members of the federal council are entitled to be present at the deliberations
                    of the reichstag. The federal council, acting under the direction of the
                    chancellor of the empire, is also a supreme administrative and consultative
                    board, and as such it has nine standing committees, viz.:—for army and
                    fortresses; for naval purposes; for tariffs, excise, and taxes; for trade and
                    commerce; for railways, posts, and telegraphs; for civil and criminal law; for
                    financial accounts; for foreign affairs: and for Alsace-Lorraine. Each committee
                    includes representatives of at least four states of the empire.</p>
                <p>For the several branches of administration a considerable number of imperial
                    offices have been gradually created. All of them, however, either are under the
                    immediate authority of the chancellor of the empire, or are separately managed
                    under his responsibility. The most important are the chancery office, the
                    foreign office, and the general post and telegraph office. But the heads of
                    these do not form a cabinet.</p>
                <p>By the electoral law of 31st May 1869 every German of twenty-one years of age is
                    entitled to be an elector, and every one who has completed his twenty-fifth
                    year, and has resided for a year in one of the federal states, is eligible for
                    election. The deputies are unsalaried, but during the session they have the
                    right of travelling free by rail. The following table shows the political
                    composition of the reichstag after the four elections from 1S71 to 1878 :—</p>

                <p>All the German states are constitutional, except Alsace-Lorraine and the two

                    (in Reuss) to 46 members (in Brunswick), and in most states the different
                    classes, as well as the cities and the rural districts, are separately
                    represented. The free towns have legislative assemblies, numbering from 120 to
                    200 members. In the so-called landtagen (diets) of Mecklenburg, which have but
                    few privileges, 684 rittergüter (allodial estates) are represented and only 40

                <p>The most important expenses which the budget of the German empire has annually to
                    meet are those of the central administration, the army and navy, posts and
                    telegraphs, the high court of justice, the foreign office, and some smaller
                    items. For defraying these, all customs receipts and the net amount of certain
                    excise duties are paid into <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n482/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0482-0465"/> the imperial treasury (reichskasse). Of the
                    excise duties those on beet-root sugar, salt, and tobacco are common to all the
                    states; but the imperial malt tax is not imposed in Bavaria, Würtemberg, Baden,
                    or Alsace-Lorraine. The three first-named states are likewise exempt from the
                    imperial excise on spirits. Additional receipts are derived from the duty on
                    bill stamps, from posts and telegraphs (excluding Bavaria and Würtemberg), from
                    the railways in Alsace-Lorraine, &amp;c. These receipts are, however,
                    insufficient to meet the expenses of the administration, and for that reason the
                    separate states have to make contributions to the revenues of the empire,
                    varying in proportion to their population. Bavaria, Baden, Würtemberg, and
                    Alsace-Lorraine pay proportionally higher direct contributions, because they
                    impose taxes on their own account on malt and spirits; so also do Bremen and
                    Hamburg, because they are situated outside the customs territory. For the last
                    few years the average contributions have ranged from £3,000,000 to £4,000,000;
                    but they are increasing with the diminution of the funds available from the
                    French war indemnity. These contributions press heavily upon the minor
                    states.</p>
                <p>The imperial budget is voted every year by the reichstag. The ordinary and
                    extraordinary expenses for the financial year ending March 31, 1879, were

                <p><hi rend="italic">Customs Revenue.—</hi> The revenue from the customs duties has
                    increased but little since 1872. In that year it was £5,534,000, and in 1873,
                    £G,131,000; but in 1877-78 it was only £5,768,000. No export duties have been
                    raised in Germany for many years. On the other hand, all imported goods were
                    taxed till 1865, with very few exceptions. Since then free trade has been more
                    in favour, and a considerable reduction has taken place in the number of taxed
                    articles. There are still, however, according to the official lists, about 148
                    articles on which custom duties are levied under 43 divisions. Raw materials are
                    duty free. Four-fifths of the receipts (£4,323,000) are derived from articles of
                    consumption, coffee being the principal item, after which come tobacco, wine,
                    spirits, &amp;c. The subjoined table shows the customs receipts, in round
                    numbers, from the following items in 1878 :—</p>

                <p>The preceding table shows great differences when compared with the corresponding
                    list for Britain. The consumption of coffee is considerably larger,—Germany
                    having imported 2,128,000 cwts. in 1876, Great Britain only 1,361,000. The duty
                    is at the same time much higher than in England, where the revenue from coffee
                    was only £200,000. On the other hand, tea yields only £36,000 duty in Germany,
                    but in England £3,700,000; wine and spirits in Germany £517,000, in England
                    £7,500,000; tobacco, in Germany £821,000, in England £7,800,000.</p>
                <p>The German customs tariff serves as a protective duty for several industrial
                    products, although in general a free-trade policy has prevailed in Germany
                    during the last ten years. In 1873 the duties on iron were abolished; still its
                    importation, owing to the stagnation of trade, has not increased. The following
                    is a statement of the produce of the duties on specific manufactured articles in

                    The present import duties are much increased, and duties are imposed on many

                    war. Part of the indemnity was invested for fixed purposes. The largest of these
                    investments served for paying the pensions of the invalided, and amounted
                    originally to £28,000,000. Every year not only the interest, but also part of
                    the capital of this fund is expended in paying these pensions. Another fund, of

                    Confederation for the war with France have long since been paid off. The
                    extraordinary expenditure of the empire was for several years paid out of the
                    French indemnity, but that resource is now exhausted. Accordingly, for defraying
                    the expenses of the army and navy, the extension of the subterranean telegraphs,
                    &amp;c., two new loans had to be raised in 1877 and 1878, amounting to
                    £8,760,800. There exists, besides, an unfunded debt. The law allows the imperial
                    chancellor to effect an issue of bills of exchequer for short terms to the
                    extent of £7,500,000, and these are destined partly for the expenses of
                    administration, and partly for the completion of the monetary reform. Since 1874
                    also a debt bearing no interest has been created in imperial treasury bills
                    (Reichscassenscheine), which are to be substituted for the paper currency issued
                    by the separate states. At that date only four states—Lippe, Lübeck, Hamburg,
                    and Bremen —had no paper currency. Prussia had in 1872 only £3,000,000 of paper
                    currency, or 2s. 6d. a head, but in the minor states the proportion was
                    higher,—reaching in Saxe-Coburg-Gotha 10'3s. a head, in Anhalt 14s., in
                    Mecklenburg-Strelitz 24'7s., and in Schaumburg-Lippe the very high figure of
                    34'8s. This inconvenience was remedied by an imperial law, ordering the states,
                    to call in their paper currency, and replacing it by the issue of imperial
                    treasury bi∏s, amounting to £6,000,000. For many, of the smaller states this
                    sudden withdrawal of their paper currency was too severe an ordeal. Accordingly,
                    to these a further sum was advanced for a term of years in treasury bills; £8,
                    338,000 was thus in circulation on the 30th September 1878.</p>

                    currency by the law of the 4th December 1871. Subsequently the old local
                    coinages <hi rend="italic">(Landesmünzen)</hi> began to be called in and
                    replaced by new gold and silver coins. The old gold coins, amounting to
                    £4,550,000, had been called in as early as 1873; and the old silver coins have
                    also been successively put out of circulation, so that none actually now remain
                    as legal tenders but the thaler (3s. ). Silver currency to the amount of
                    £52,000,000 had been withdrawn up to the 30th September 1878, and copper coins
                    to £157,600. To replace these there were coined up till the 30th September
                    1878—gold pieces, £81,900,000; silver coins, £21,330,000; nickel and copper,
                    £2,237,800. The currency reform was at first facilitated by the French
                    indemnity, a great part of which was paid in gold. But later on that metal
                    became scarcer; the London gold prices ran higher and higher, while silver
                    declined. The average rate per ounce of standard silver in 1866-70 was 60∣d., in
                    January 1875 only 57⅛d., in July 1876 as low as 49d. It rose in January 1877 to
                    57⅜d., but again declined, and in September 1878 it was 50∣d. While, therefore,
                    the proportion of like weights of fine gold and fine silver in 1866-70 averaged
                    1 to 15'55, it was 1 to 17'79 in 1876, and 1 to 17'18 in 1877, and the
                    difference again increased in 1878.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Banking.—</hi> A new banking law was promulgated for the whole
                    empire· on the 14th March 1875. Before that date there existed 32 banks with the
                    privilege of issuing notes, and on the 31st December 1872 £67,100,000 in all was
                    in circulation, £25,100,000 of that sum being uncovered. The banking law was
                    designed to reduce this circulation of notes; £19,250,000 was fixed as an
                    aggregate maximum of uncovered notes of the banks. The private banks were at the
                    same time obliged to erect branch offices in Berlin or Frankfort for the payment
                    of their notes. In consequence of this regulation 13 banks resigned the
                    privilege of issuing notes, so that at present there are in Germany but 19
                    note-issuing banks of which 5 belong to South Germany (Frankfort included). The
                    Imperial Bank (Reichsbank) ranks far above the others in importance. It took the
                    place of the Prussian Bank in 1876, and is under the superintendence and
                    management of the empire, which shares in the profits. Its head office is in
                    Berlin, and it is entitled to erect branch offices in any part of the empire. It
                    has a capital of £6,000,000 in shares of £150. The following table exhibits the
                    position of the German Reichsbank as compared with the other 18 banks at the
                    30th September 1878 :—</p>

                <p>In the absence of tnistworthy statistics the local taxes have not been taken into
                    consideration in the above table. These, however, are very considerable in many
                    cities in Germany, in consequence of recent expenditure on schoolhouses,
                    sewage-works, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>A comparison of the foregoing tables with the corresponding statistics tor the
                    United Kingdom (1874) gives the following result. The payments on account of the
                    national debt in Great Britain formed 42 ’ 2 per cent, of the total expenditure
                    after deducting the charges of collection; in Germany only 18'14 per cent. The
                    army and navy in England absorb 39'3 per cent, of the expenditure (or 68'0 per
                    cent, after deducting the charges of debt), in Germany 35'6 per cent, (or 43'7).
                    The expenses of the national debt in England are about 17s. a head, in Germany
                    about 5s. The expenses of the army and navy in England are about 16s. a head, in
                    Germany 9s. The public property in domains and forests is greater in Germany
                    than in any other state of Europe, the area of the state forests being no less
                    than 17,600 square miles. Many of the smaller states defray more than one-half
                    of their expenditure by the revenue from domains and forests. From this source
                    Germany is able to meet nearly one-fifth of her expenditure (17'3 per cent. ),
                    whereas in England only 0 '6 per cent, is thus obtained. On the other hand, the
                    expenses incurred by Germany for the civil lists and for annuities to the
                    princely families are very considerable. Germany pays 3 '6 per cent, of the
                    national income to her princes, Great Britain only 1 '04 per cent. In the minor
                    states the princely households.absorb 10 to 12 per cent, of the expenditure. The
                    proceeds of establishments managed by the state cover 17'5 per cent, of the
                    whole expenditure in Germany, but only 2'5 in England. The proportion of direct
                    to indirect taxes is in England as 17 to 83, in Germany as 31 to 69. But on the
                    whole the English are taxed twice as heavily as the Germans. The gross revenue
                    in England was, in 1874, 42s. a head, in Germany 16'2s.; of these sums 13'2s.
                    came, in England, from customs duties, and 13'3s. from excise on spirits and
                    malt (apart from the customs duties), while in Germany the corresponding figures
                    were only 3s. and 2 '4s.</p>
                <p>A considerable part of the public debt of the separate states was <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0484-0467"/> paid off by them after the war. In 1873 the total
                    amount of all debts of the German states was only about £171,000,000. In this
                    sum was included £9,500,000 of currency. The greater part of this liability has
                    been incurred for productive purposes, particularly for the construction of
                    railways. The railway debts (which are not directly charged on the population)
                    were in 1873 about £96,500,000. Since then some states have gone on reducing
                    their debts still further; Prussia, for example, has. done so by more than
                    £11,000,000. Others again, such as Bavaria, Saxony, Wurtemberg, and Baden have
                    contracted new loans for constructing railways, or, as Saxony, for purchasing
                    them. The entire debt of all the German states, including the imperial debt, at
                    31st December 1877, may be estimated at £220,000,000, of which sum, however,
                    more than £140,000,000 consists of railway debt. The average sum per head will
                    accordingly be £5, whereas in Great Britain it is £23 to £24. When the railway
                    debts are deducted the proportion is less than £2 a head in Germany.</p>

                <p>By the constitution of 16th April 1871 every German is liable to service
                    (wehrpflichtig), and no substitution is allowed (art. 57). Every German capable
                    of bearing arms (wehrfähig) has to serve in the standing army for seven years—as
                    a rule from the end of the twentieth till the commencement of the twenty-eighth
                    year of his age. Three of these seven years he must spend in active service, and
                    the remainder in the reserve; after quitting the latter he forms part of the
                    landwehr for five years more—the full time of military service thus being twelve
                    years. The strength of the army on a peace footing (friedensfuss) was fixed in
                    the army bill of 1874 at 401,659 (or say 1 per cent, of the population at the
                    census of 1871) for a term of seven years ending the 31st December 1881. The
                    number of recruits levied annually is 145,000 men. All young men who reach a
                    certain fixed standard of higher school training, however, are obliged to serve
                    only for one year in the active army, and these are not included in the
                    effective strength of the army on a peace footing. Collaterally with the army
                    there has existed since 1875 the landsturm, to which all men liable to service
                    and capable of bearing arms, between the ages of seventeen and forty-two,
                    belong, if they are neither in the line, the reserve, the landwehr, nor the
                    marine. The landsturm is only called to arms in the event of a hostile invasion
                    of the imperial territory being threatened or effected.</p>
                <p>By the articles of the constitution the whole of the land forces of the empire
                    form a united army in war and peace under the orders of the emperor. The
                    sovereigns of the chief states are entitled to nominate the lower grades of
                    officers, and the king of Bavaria has reserved to himself the special privilege
                    of superintending thegeneral administration of the two Bavarian corps d’armée;
                    but all appointments are made subject to the emperor’s approval. The 64th
                    article of the constitution enacts that all German troops are bound to obey
                    unconditionally the orders of the emperor, and to take the oath of allegiance
                    accordingly. The emperor is empowered to erect fortresses in any part of the
                    empire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Organization of the Army.—</hi> The imperial army consists of
                    18 army corps, viz., the Prussian garde-du-corps, 13 Prussian corps (including
                    the troops of the minor states in military convention with Prussia—Nos. 1 to 11
                    being Prussian, while Nos. 14 and 15 are the Baden and Alsace-Lorraine corps
                    respectively), the Saxon corps (No. 12), the Wurtemberg corps (No. 13), and the
                    2 Bavarian corps. One army “inspection” comprises from 3 to 4 corps. Generally 1
                    army corps consists of 2 divisions, each of which includes 1 horse and 2 foot
                    brigades. As a rule the infantry brigade consists of 2 infantry regiments and 2
                    landwehr regiments, the cavalry brigade of from 2 to 3 cavalry regiments. An
                    infantry regiment consists of 3 battalions of 4 companies each; a cavalry
                    regiment has 5 squadrons. There are many exceptions, however, to these rules,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the garde-du-corps. and the Saxon corps d’armée
                    consist each of 1 cavalry and 2 infantry divisions, the 11th contains 3
                    divisions, &amp;c. Some divisions also are stronger than others. Altogether the
                    German army numbers 40 divisions, of which 6 are infantry, 3 cavalry, and 31
                    both combined. There are in all 74 infantry and 38 cavalry brigades, and 148
                    infantry and 93 cavalry regiments.</p>
                <p>Besides the troops above named, each army corps generally includes <hi
                    rend="italic">(a)</hi> 1 jäger or light battalion (the Bavarian army has,
                    however, 10 of them); (δ) 1 field artillery brigade; (c) 1 foot artillery
                    regiment; <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> 1 engineer battalion; (e) 1 train
                    battalion. The garde-du-corps has, in addition, two railway battalions, 1
                    instruction infantry battalioiï (Lehrbataillon), &amp;c. The several field
                    artillery-brigades are not uniformly constituted, but in 12 of the 18 army corps
                    the brigade consists of 2 artillery regiments. One of these with 8 batteries is
                    attached to the division, while the other remains under the orders of the corps
                    commander. This latter consists of 2 sections (Abtheilungen) of 3 batteries
                    each, and a mounted division of 3 batteries. Each battery has as a rule 4 guns.
                    A foot artillery regiment has 2 battalions of 4 companies each. There are in all
                    36 field artillery regiments with 301 batteries and 1206 guns, and 13 foot
                    artillery regiments. In war time several corps are combined, as “armies,” the
                    entire military force consisting then of the field or battle army, the reserve
                    or supplementary troops (Ersatztruppen), and the garrison troops
                    (Besatzungstruppen).</p>
                <p>The following tables exhibit the strength of the German army on a peace footing
                    and on a war footing respectively.</p>
                <p>There are other 25,975 men who are not included in the latter sum-total but whose
                    cost is defrayed by army grants. They include 4653 physicians, 838 veterinary
                    surgeons, 1600 paymasters, &amp;c. Nor does the table take account of the troops
                    of the field reserve and of the landsturm, regarding the organization of which
                    no details have been published; the former, which is drawn from the landwehr, is
                    estimated at 250,000 men. It is calculated that Germany may put in arms at any
                    given time two millions and a half of armed men without having recourse to the
                    last reserves. The maximum strength of the army in the war with France was
                    1,350,787 men and 263,753 horses.</p>

                    system has been entirely remodelled. A number of old and useless fortresses have
                    been dismantled; several new ones have been erected along the sea-coast; and
                    most of those flanking the land frontiers have been enlarged. The <pb break="no"

                    each including a certain number of fortified places. The Baltic coast fortresses
                    are Memel, Pillau, Dantzic (first-class fortress), Colberg, Swinemünde,
                    Stralsund, Travemünde, Kiel, Friedrichsort, Sonderburg-Düppel. On the North Sea
                    are Wilhelmshaven and the fortresses by which the mouths of the Elbe, Weser, and
                    Ems are guarded. The eastern frontier is protected by the first-class fortresses
                    of Königsberg, Dantzic, Thorn, and Posen; and by the secondary ones of
                    Marienburg and Dirschau on the Vistula, and of Glogau on the Oder, which are
                    especially intended for the protection of the railways. For the southern
                    frontier there exist only the fortresses of Neisse, Glatz, and Königstein on the
                    Elbe. The old inland fortresses have been abolished, except the first-class ones
                    of Küstrin, Magdeburg, ►Spandau, and (for railway protection) Torgau on the
                    Elbe. Ulm and Ingolstadt on the Danube, both first-class fortresses, are also
                    maintained. On the western frontier Strasburg and Metz have been fortified by a
                    wide range of outer fortifications, and there is besides an outer line of
                    smaller fortified places, consisting of New Breisach, Bitsch, Saarlouis, and
                    Thionville. A second line runs along the Rhine, where there are large fortresses
                    serving as encampments at Rastadt, Mainz, Coblentz, and Cologne, and smaller
                    ones fur the protection of the Rhine bridges at Germersheim, Ehrenbreitstein
                    opposite Coblentz, Düsseldorf, and λVesel. The empire thus possesses 16
                    fortified places of the first class serving as camps, and 27 other
                    fortresses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Navy.—</hi> The German navy is but of recen; origin. In 1843
                    the German people urged the construction of a fleet. Money was collected, and a
                    few men-of-war were fitted out; but these were subsequently sold, the German
                    Bundestag (federal council) not being in sympathy with the aspirations of the
                    nation. Prussia, however, began laying the foundations of a small navy. To meet
                    the difficulty arising from the want of good harbours in the Baltic, a small
                    extent of territory near Jahde Bay was bought from Oldenburg in 1854, for the
                    purpose of establishing a war-port there. Its construction is now practically
                    completed, although at enormous expense, and it was opened for ships by the
                    emperor in June 1869 under the name of Wilhelmshaven. In 1864 Prussia, by
                    annexing Holstein, obtained possession of the excellent port of Kiel, which has
                    since been strongly fortified. From the time of the formation of the North
                    German confederation the navy has belonged to the common federal interest. Since
                    1st October 1867 all its ships have carried the same flag,—black, white, red,
                    with the Prussian eigle and the iron cross.</p>
                <p>From 1848 to 1868 the increase of the navy was slow. In 1851 it consisted of 51
                    ships with 188 guns (among which there were, however, 36 small gunboats of 2
                    guns each), and with 1180 hands in all. Tn 1868 it consisted of 89 vessels of
                    563 guns, among which number there were 2 ironclads, and 43 other steamers,
                    Since then a definite plan for the development of the navy has been set on foot,
                    and great activity has been displayed in fitting out ships and in augmenting the
                    personnel.</p>

                    marines are levied by conscription from among the seafaring population, which is
                    on this account exempt from service in the army. The total sea-going population

                    at home, and about 6000 in foreign service. Great inducements to enter the navy

                <p>In the official census it has been usual to ιeturn the religious creed of the
                    inhabitants, though a few states, such as Prussia and Hamburg, omitted this
                    particular in 1875. Official estimates indeed have been macle of the religious
                    profession of the people in these states for 1875 also, but only the census of
                    1867 and that of 1871 can be accurately compared. The number of persons styling
                    themselves of no religion, or refusing to state their religion, is very small.

                <p>The Protestants have increased in number by 0 ’ 4 per cent, of the population
                    since 1867. This increase, however, must not be attributed to conversions, but
                    rather to the greater increase of population in the Protestant provinces of
                    Germany as compared with the Catholic ones; though at the same time the official
                    returns of Prussia prove that conversion to the rival communion is much more
                    frequent with Catholics than with Protestants. Three states in Germany have a

                <p>From the above figures little can be inferred as to the geographical distribution
                    of the two confessions. On this point it must be borne in mind that the
                    population of the larger towns, on account of the greater mobility of the
                    population since the introduction of railways and the abolition of restrictions
                    upon free settlement, has become more mixed,—Berlin, Leipsic, Hamburg, &amp;c.,
                    showing proportionally more Catholics, and Cologne, Frankfort, Munich, &amp;c.,
                    more Protestants than formerly. Otherwise the geographical limits of the
                    confessions have been but little altered since the Thirty Years’ War. In the
                    mixed territories those places which formerly belonged to Catholic princes are
                    Catholic still, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Hence a religious map of
                    South Germany looks like an historical map of the 17th century. The number of
                    localities where the two confessions exist siſle by side is small. Generally
                    speaking, South Germany is predominantly Catholic. Some districts along the
                    Danube (province of Bavaria, lipper Palatinate, Swabia), in southern Würtemberg
                    and Baden, and in Alsace-Lorraine are entirely so. These territories are
                    bordered by a broad stretch of country on the north, where Protestantism has
                    maintained its hold since the time of the Reformation, including Baireuth or
                    eastern Upper Franconia, Middle Franconia, the northern half of Würtemberg and
                    Baden, with Hesse and the Palatinate. Here the average proportion of Protestants
                    to Catholics is two to one. The basin of the Main is again Catholic from Bamberg
                    to Aschaffenburg (western Upper Franconia and Lower Franconia). In Prussia the
                    western and south-eastern provinces are mostly Catholic, especially the Rhine
                    province, together with the government districts of Münster and Arnsberg. The
                    territories of the former principality of Cleves and of the countship of Mark
                    (comprising very nearly the basin of the Ruhr), which went to Brandenburg in
                    1609, must, however, be excepted. North of Münster, Catholicism is still
                    prevalent in the territory of the former bishopric of Osnabrück. In the east,
                    East Prussia (Ermland excepted) is purely Protestant. Catholicism was
                    predominant a hundred years ago in all the frontier provinces acquired by
                    Prussia in the days of Frederick the Great, but since then the German immigrants
                    have widely propagated the Protestant faith in these districts. A prevailingly
                    Catholic population is still found in the district of Oppeln (89 per cent.) and
                    the countship of Glatz, in the province of Posen (64 per cent.), in the
                    Polish-speaking “circles” of West Prussia, and in Ermland (East Prussia). In all
                    the remaining territory the Catholic creed is professed only in the Eichsfeld on
                    the southern border of the province of Hanover, and around Hildesheim.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Protestant Church.—</hi> The adherents of Protestantism are
                    divided by their confessions into Reformed and Lutheran. To unite these the
                    “church union” has been introduced in several Protestant states, as for example
                    in Prussia and Nassau in 1817, in the Palatinate in 1818, and in Baden in 1822.
                    Since 1817 the distinction has accordingly been ignored in Prussia, and
                    Christians are there enumerated only as Evangelical or Catholic. The union,
                    however, has not remained wholly unopposed,—a section of the more rigid
                    Lutherans who separated themselves from the state church being now known as Old
                    Lutherans. In 1866 Prussia annexed Hanover and Schleswig-Holstein, where the
                    Protestants were Lutherans, and Hesse, where the Reformed Church had the
                    preponderance. The inhabitants of these countries opposed the introduction of
                    the union, but could not prevent their being subordinated to the Prussian
                    oberkirchenrath (high church-council), the supreme court of the state church.
                    Subsequently the official returns have been thus classified :—</p>

                <p>The separatists are thus not numbered among dissenters. A synodal constitution
                    for the Evangelical State Church was introduced in Prussia in 1875. The
                    oberkirchenrath retains the right of supreme management. The ecclesistical
                    affairs of the separate provinces are directed by consistorial boards. The
                    parishes <hi rend="italic">(ypfarreierì)</hi> are grouped into dioceses <hi
                    rend="italic">(pprengel),</hi> presided over by superintendents, who are
                    subordinate to the superintendent-general of the province. Prussia has sixteen
                    superintendents-general. The ecclesiastical administration is similarly
                    regulated in the other countries of the Protestant creed. Regarding the number
                    of churches and chapels Germany has no exact statistics, but in 1867 it was
                    estimated that there were 12,959 places of worship in Prussia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roman Catholic Church.—</hi> There are six archbishoprics
                    within the German empire :—Breslau (where the archbishop has the title of
                    prince-bishop), Gnesen-Posen, Cologne, Freiburg (Baden), Munich-Freising, and
                    Bamberg. The eighteen bishoprics are—Ermland (see at Frauenburg, East Prussia),
                    Kulm (see at Pelplin, West Prussia), Fulda, Hildesheim, Osnabrück, Paderborn,
                    Münster, Limburg, Treves, Metz, Strasburg, Spires, Würzburg, Ratisbon, Passau,
                    Eichstädt, Augsburg, Rottenburg (Würtemberg). An apostolic vicariate exists in
                    Dresden. In recent years numerous convents, especially in Prussia, have been
                    suppressed. The order of the Jesuits is interdicted in Germany.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Old Catholics.—</hi> After the infallibility of the pope had
                    been proclaimed as a dogma by the Vatican council in 1871, several communities
                    as well as individuals declared their secession from the Roman Church. They are
                    called Old Catholics, and they have selected a bishop who has been acknowledged
                    by most of the states. At the 1st of January 1877 the denomination had 121
                    congregations with 56 clergymen and 16,557 adult male adherents, so that we may
                    fairly estimate the total number of Old Catholics at a little more than
                    50,000.</p>
                <p>The number of Greek Catholics was 2660 in 1871.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dissenters.—</hi> There is no uniformity in the state returns
                    of the several denominations, and detailed statements are wanting for
                    Würtemberg, Alsace-Lorraine, and eight of the lesser states. In the sixteen
                    remaining states there were in 1875 21,000 Mennonites (particularly in East and
                    West Prussia and the Palatinate), 10,451 Baptists, 3000 Irvingites, 4000
                    Herrnhuter (Moravian brethren), and 1600 members of the Church of England. The
                    Mennonites had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n487/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0487-0470"/> increased from 14,000 in 1871. Besides these
                    there were about 6800 German Catholics, 3600 Freethinkers, and more than
                    twenty-five sects represented by from 100 to Õ00 members.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Jews.—</hi> It is in the towns that the Jewish element is
                    chiefly to be found. They belong principally to the mercantile class, and are to
                    a very large extent dealers in money. Within J,he last thirty years their wealth
                    has grown to an extraordinary degree. They are increasingly numerous in Hamburg,
                    Berlin, Frankfort, Breslau, Königsberg, and Fürth. Though still, in fact at
                    least, if not also by law, excluded from many public offices, especially from
                    commands in the army, they nevertheless are very powerful in Germany, the press
                    being for the most part in their hands. Some towns of the Marienwerder and Posen
                    districts contain from 20 to 30 per cent, of Jews. By far the greater number are
                    found among the Slavs in the east; in the west they appear chiefly in Hesse,
                    Baden, and Alsace.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Languages.</hi></p>
                <p>The German-speaking nations in their various branches and dialects are found to
                    extend in a compact mass along the shores of the Baltic and of the North Sea,
                    from Memel in the east to a point between Gravelines and Calais near the Straits
                    of Dover. On this northern line the Germans come in contact with the Danes who
                    inhabit the northern parts of Schleswig within the limits of the German empire.
                    A line from opposite Sonderburg in the isle of Alsen to Tondern in the west will
                    nearly form the boundary between the two idioms. The German-French frontier
                    traverses Belgium from west to east, touching the towns of St Omer, Courtrai,
                    and Maastricht. Near Eupen, south of Aix-la-Chapelle, it turns southward, and
                    near Arlon south-east as far as the crest of the Vosges mountains, which it
                    follows up to Belfort, traversing there the watershed of the Rhine and the
                    Doubs. In the Swiss territory the line of demarcation passes through Biel,
                    Freiburg, Saanen, Leuk, and Monte Rosa. In the south the Germans come into
                    contact with Rhaeto-Romans and Italians, the former inhabiting the valley of the
                    Vorder-Rlιein and the Engadine, while the latter have settled on the southern
                    slopes of the Alps, and are continually advancing up the valley of the Adige.
                    Carinthia and Styria are inhabited by German people, except the valley of the
                    Drave towards Klagenfurt. Their eastern neighbours there are first the Magyars,
                    then the northern Slavs and the Poles. The whole eastern frontier is very much
                    broken, and cannot be described in a few words. Besides detached German colonies
                    in Hungary, the western parts of that country are held by Germans. The river
                    March is the frontier north of the Danube from Presburg as far as Brünn, to the
                    north of which the German regions begin near Olmütz,—the interior of Bohemia and
                    Moravia being occupied by Czechs and Moravians. In the Prussian provinces of
                    Silesia and Posen the eastern parts are mixed territories, the German language
                    progressing slowly among the Poles. In Bromberg and Thorn, in the valley of the
                    Vistula, German is prevalent. In West Prussia some parts of the interior, and in
                    East Prussia a small region along the Russian frontier, are occupied by Poles
                    (Kassubians in West Prussia, Masurians in East Prussia). The German tongue is
                    also fast invading the Lithuanian territory, and in a short time no people
                    speaking that idiom will be found to the left of the river Memel. The total
                    number of German-speaking people, within the boundaries wherein they constitute
                    the compact mass of the population, may be estimated, if the Dutch and the
                    Flemings be included, at 56 millions.</p>
                <p>The geographical limits of the German language thus do not quite coincide with
                    the German frontiers. The empire contains about 3∣ millions of persons who do
                    not make use of German iu everyday life, not counting the 290,000 resident
                    foreigners. The non-German languages have their representatives only in Prussia,
                    Saxony, and Alsace-Lorraine. No census since 1861 has given the statistics of
                    the different languages spoken in the first-mentioned country; and, in regard to
                    Alsace-Lorraine also, the figures are based upon estimates only. The following
                    table gives the results of semi-official estimates for 1875 :—</p>

                <p>From this it will be observed that the Poles form a considerable part of the
                    population,—about 60 ’ 1 percent, in the district of Oppeln, 59’3 in Posen, 49'6

                    number,—in the Saxon district there were 52,097 in 1871, and in 1875 only
                    50,737. The Lithuanians are likewise diminishing on the eastern border of East
                    Prussia. Czechs are found only in Silesia on the confines of Bohemia. The French
                    are represented in Lorraine and Upper Alsace, and on the Belgian frontier.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Education.</hi></p>
                <p>In point of intellectual culture Germany ranks high. Much is done by the
                    Government for the promotion both of primary and of secondary education; there
                    are no exact statistics, however, of the educational establishments, or of the
                    expenditure incurred in -connexion with them. In regard to the latter the sums
                    which figure in the Government budgets are not the only contributions which must
                    be considered; for in most of the states the several local communities provide
                    from their own resources for primary instruction and for many of the higher
                    schools, while many of the superior institutes have funds of their own not
                    included in the budget School instruction is obligatory on the whole people, but
                    in many districts there is still a scarcity of teachers and some want of
                    efficient controL The total number of primary schools is estimated at 60,000,
                    and that of pupils at 6,500,000, or 150 pupils to every 1000 inhabitants. Some
                    provinces exhibit a larger proportion; in Saxony, Thuringia, Brunswick,
                    Rhineland, and Westphalia there are from 165 to 175 pupils to every 1000
                    inhabitants. In Bavaria, Posen, East and West Prussia, Brandenburg, on the other
                    hand, there are only from 120 to 130. A good criterion of the school instruction
                    is to be found in the statistics of the annual levies of recruits. The following
                    table shows the number of recruits during the years 1876-78 who were unable to
                    read and write :—</p>

                <p>It will be seen from the above that the number of illiterate recruits has
                    considerably decreased during the last three years. The figures given compare
                    very favourably with those of other European countries. In 1872 the number <pb

                    and 2 ’ 3 in the navy, the corresponding numbers in France being 23 and 14 per
                    cent. In England 23 per cent, of the marines could neither read nor write in
                    1865, 4 per cent, could only read, and 37 per cent, could write but imperfectly.
                    In Austria only 28 per cent, of the recruits could write, and in Russia scarcely
                    10 per cent, had any school education. But the provinces of Germany differ much
                    from one another in this respect. Education is very inferior in the eastern
                    Polish districts. During the three years from 1875-78 in the districts of Posen,
                    Bromberg, and Oppeln there were in all 10 ’ 7, 9∙24, 8O2 per cent, of
                    illiterates among the recruits, in the provinces of West and East Prussia 8 ’
                    77, 8 ’ 66, 7 ’ 80. After these the rate takes a long leap to 3 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 18, 3 ’ 17, 1 ’ 9∙1 in Alsace-Lorraine and the
                    Palatinate. In 1877-78 there was no considerable district in Germany which sent
                    so many as 1 per cent, of illiterates. The most satisfactory state of matters is
                    to be found in Saxony, Thuringia, Baden, and Würtemberg, and especially in the
                    last two. Wurtemberg had only one recruit among 6000 that was unable to
                    read.</p>
                <p>The census in Prussia in 1871 proves primary school instruction to be much better

                <p>Unremitting attention is being paid to the improvement of primary schools <hi
                    rend="italic">(yolksschulen),</hi> although many of the eastern districts are
                    still destitute of these in the rural localities. Not long ago the position of
                    teachers of primary schools was very unsatisfactory; and the supply of masters
                    was unequal to the demand. In recent years much has been done in all the states
                    to effect a reform on this state of matters. In 1875 there were 170 seminaries
                    in Germany for the training of schoolmasters. But this number is insufficient,
                    for it may be estimated that 5000 to 6000 new appointments are required
                    annually, if one master is not to have charge of more than 60 children. Saxony
                    has the greatest number of institutions of this kind (15). Within the last few
                    years many municipalities have begun to found schools of a somewhat higher rank
                    for the lower classes of the town population, called middle schools.</p>
                <p>There are four different kinds of schools for the higher branches of education.
                    The gymnasia supply preparatory trainingfor the universities, the foremost place
                    in the course of instruction being assigned to the classical languages; but
                    French, English, and mathematics are also taught, and some attention is given to
                    natural science, history, and geography. Their constitution dates back to very
                    remote times, and but few and slight alterations have been made in their schemes
                    of study since the beginning of the present century. Officials, judges,
                    clergymen, teachers, and physicians for the most part receive their early
                    education at the gymnasia. In 1878 there were 360 gymnasia in Germany, or 1 for
                    every 600 square miles and every 117,000 in. habitants. Central Germany has the
                    largest proportion, 1 for every 75,000 inhabitants. To these must be added the
                    progymnasia, about 90 in number. The same studies are prosecuted in these, but
                    the highest classes of a gymnasium are wanting. Of more recent growth is the
                    system of <hi rend="italic">realschulen,</hi> where Latin is the only ancient
                    language taught, the other branches being modern languages, especially French
                    and English, mathematics and natural philosophy, geography, and modern history.
                    These schools have long enjoyed great popularity. They are classified as of the
                    first and of the second order. In the former a pupil remains generally for nine
                    or ten years, as in the gyιhnasia; and those who pass the highest examination
                    are allowed to enter the universities, but only to study the modern languages,
                    mathematics, and natural sciences. In 1878 there were 129 realschulen of the
                    first order, mainly in Saxony, Rhineland, Berlin, and Hanover. The realschulen
                    of the second order prepare pupils for those professions which do not require a
                    university course. On the average a pupil leaves school in the seventeenth year
                    of his age. Besides these institutions, which are increasing every year, there
                    is a considerable number of technical schools (gewerbeschulen). Their purpose is
                    purely industrial; drawing, mechanics, mathematics, physics, and chemistry are
                    among the subjects of instruction, languages being excluded. There are,
                    moreover, schools of commerce, navigation, and agriculture in different towns.
                    The military law relating to the one year’s volunteers has had an important
                    influence on the attendance at all these institutions. In 1879 there were 878
                    schools with the privilege of furnishing pass certificates to such volunteers;
                    of these 360 were gymnasia, 129 were realschulen, and about 40 were private
                    schools. Exact and uniform statistics of the higher schools do not as yet exist.
                    Many of the last-mentioned institutions are maintained partly or entirely at the
                    expense of the municipalities, and by far the greater number are denominational,
                    Protestant ones prevailing. The following table shows the number of Prussian
                    schools in 1875 maintained severally by the Government, by the municipalities,
                    and by other funds :—.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Universities and Higher Technical Schools.—</hi> Germany owes
                    its large number of universities, and its widely diffused higher education to
                    its former subdivision into many separate states. Only a few of the universities
                    date their existence from the present century; the majority of them are very
                    much older. Each of the larger provinces, except Posen, has at least one
                    university, the entire number at present being 21. All have four faculties
                    except Münster, which has no faculties of law and medicine. As regards theology,
                    Bonn, Breslau, and Tübingen have both a Protestant and a Catholic faculty;
                    Freiburg, Munich, Münster, and Würzburg are exclusively Catholic; and all the
                    rest are Protestant. The following table gives the names of the 21 universities,
                    the dates of their respective foundations, the number of their professors and

                <p>A number of technical high schools rank along with the universities; they all
                    took their rise in the course of the present century, and usually bear the name
                    of Polytechni-cum. To the number of these belong the academies of industry
                    (founded 1821) and of architecture (1798) in Berlin, and the polytechnica at
                    Hanover, Brunswick, Aix-la-Chapelle, Darmstadt, Carlsruhe, Stuttgart, Munich,
                    and Dresden.</p>
                <p>Among the remaining higher technical schools may be mentioned the mining
                    academies of Freiberg in Saxony, of Berlin, and of Clausthal in the Hara, and
                    the academies of forestry at Neustadt-Eberswalde, Münden on the Weser, Tharand
                    near Dresden, and Hohenheim near Stuttgart, and at Brunswick, Eisenach, Giessen,
                    and Carlsruhe. Schools of agriculture have also been attached to several
                    universities, the most important being at Berlin, Halle, Göttingen, Königsberg,
                    Jena, Poppelsdorf near Bonn, Munich, and Leipsic.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Libraries.—</hi> Mental culture and a general diffusion of
                    knowledge are extensively promoted by means of numerous public libraries
                    established in the capitals, the university towns, and other places. The most
                    celebrated public libraries are those of Berlin (800,000 volumes), Munich
                    (800,000 volumes and 22,000 manuscripts), Göttingen, Dresden, Stuttgart,
                    Hamburg, Strasburg, Frankfort-on-theMain, Breslau, Gotha, and Wolfenbüttel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Societies. —</hi> There are also numerous societies and unions,
                    some being of an exclusively scientific character, and others being designed for
                    the popular diffusion of useful knowledge. The academies of science in Berlin,
                    Munich, Göttingen, and Leipsic are Government institutions. Ample provision is
                    made for scientific collections of all kinds in almost all places of any
                    importance, either at the public expense or through private munificence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Observatories.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> These have in
                    recent years been considerably augmented. There are 22 observatories in the
                    empire, viz., at Altona, Berlin, Bonn, Bothkamp in Schleswig, Breslau, Dantzic,
                    Düsseldorf, Gotha, Göttingen, Hamburg, Kiel, Königsberg, Leipsic, Lübeck,
                    Mannheim, Marburg, Munich, Potsdam, Schwerin, Spires, Strasburg, and
                    Wilhelmshaven.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Book Trade.—</hi> This branch of industry, from the important
                    position it has gradually acquired since the time of the Reformation, is to be
                    regarded as at once a cause and a result of the mental culture of Germany.
                    Leipsic is the centre of the trade. The number of booksellers in Germany was not
                    less than 519θ in 1878, among whom were 1546 publishers. The following table
                    will show the recent progress of German literary production, and its proportion
                    to that of other European states :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Newspapers.—</hi> While in England a few important newspapers
                    have an immense circulation, the newspapers of Germany are much more numerous,
                    but individually command a far more limited sale. Leaving out of account
                    insignificant local papers, Germany in 1878 possessed 600 newspapers published
                    daily, or two to three times a week; of these only 90 were published in South
                    Germany. Berlin alone produces 44 newspapers. Most readers receive their
                    newspapers through the post-office or at their clubs, which may help to explain
                    the smaller number of copies sold. Only 50 of the 600 daily newspapers print
                    more than 10,000 copies, and only 20 more than 20,000.</p>

                    object the promotion of a taste for painting, sculpture, architecture, and
                    music, and the improvement of the technique of art. The largest academy is now
                    that of Berlin. The three schools of painting <hi rend="italic"
                    >(m,alerschulen)</hi> are represented by the academies of Berlin, Munich, and
                    Düsseldorf. Other academies for painting are to be found in Dresden, Carlsruhe,
                    Weimar, and Königsberg. The chief musical academy is at Leipsic. Numerous
                    museums of art and collections of pictures exist in the country, but there is no
                    concentration of these as in London or Paris. Although the collections in Berlin
                    have of late years been considerably enriched, they do not equal in their number
                    of celebrated originals the galleries of Dresden, Munich, and Cassel. An
                    archaeological institute is maintained by the imperial Government at Rome and at
                    Athens, and recently Germany has done much for the advancement of archaeology by
                    the part she has taken in the excavations at Olympia.</p>

                <p>The people whom we call “the Germans,” and who call themselves “die Deutschen,”
                    are a branch of the Teutonic race, which, again, belongs to the great Aryan
                    family. At what time the Teutons broke away from their Aryan kinsfolk we have no
                    means of knowing. In the 4th century B,c., when they are first mentioned, they
                    were settled along the shores of the Baltic Sea; but long before that time the
                    race must have scattered itself far and wide over the countries now known as
                    Scandinavia and Germany, and the Scandinavians and the Germans were gradually
                    marked off from each other by important differences in language, in customs, and
                    in institutions.</p>
                <p>At the time of Tacitus, whose <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi> is our chief
                    authority as to the condition of ancient Germany, central Europe was in the
                    possession of a large number of German tribes. These tribes did not call
                    themselves by a common name. The word “German” is of Celtic origin, meaning,
                    according to some philologers, “shouters,” according to others, “neighbours.” It
                    seems to have been applied by the Gauls in the first instance to a particular
                    German tribe with which they were in conflict, and afterwards to the whole
                    people. The word “Deutsch” (Goth., <hi rend="italic">Thiuda</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> the people) does not occur till the 9th century, and was not
                    used in the sense now given to it for some time later. Although without a common
                    name, the ancient Germans believed that they had a common origin, all of them
                    regarding as their forefather Mannus, the first man, the son of the god Tuisco.
                    Mannus was supposed to have had three sons, from whom had sprung the Istaevones,
                    the Ingaevones, and the Herminones. These groups were without political
                    significance, but they seem to have marked real distinctions. The Istaevones
                    were the tribes with whom the Romans were brought most into contact, occupying,
                    as they did, both banks of the Rhine. The lands held by those of them on the
                    left bank were divided by the Romans into “Germania Superior” and “Germania
                    Inferior,” the chief tribe of the latter being the CJbii, who had an important
                    settlement on the site of what is now Cologne. On the right bank, from the Lippe
                    to the Ruhr, were the Usipetes and Tencteri, and to the north of them the
                    Sicambri and the Bructeri; the land now called Hesse appears to have been
                    inhabited by the Chatti. On the island formed by the Meuse and an arm of the
                    Rhine were'the Batavi. The second great group, the Ingaevones, among whom were
                    the Frisii, the Chauci, and the Cherusci, were settled along the shores of the
                    North Sea, and inland along the banks of the Weser and the Ems. The Herminones
                    were much more numerous than either of the two other groups; they held the
                    greater part of central and eastern Germany, reaching as far as the Vistula and
                    the Carpathians. Most prominent among them were the Suevi, a great confederation
                    of tribes which included the Marcomanni, the dwellers in what is now Bohemia,
                    and the Semnones, who held what is now Lusatia and Brandenburg. Other Herminones
                    were the Hermunduri, in and around the Thuringian forest; the Lombards, at the
                    mouth of the Elbe; the Vandals, at the upper parts of the same river; the
                    Heruli, to the west of the Vistula; and the Quadi, in what is now Moravia.</p>
                <p>The ancient Germans were a tall and vigorous race, with long fair hair and what
                    Tacitus calls “fiercely blue eyes.” They wore mantles of fur or of coarse
                    woollen stuff, thrown over the shoulders and fastened by a thorn or a pin. Their
                    dwellings were wooden huts of slight construction, the inner walls of which they
                    roughly coloured, and in which cattle were sometimes accommodated with the
                    family.</p>
                <p>War and the chase were the favourite occupations of the men; and when engaged
                    neither in fighting nor in hunting they often lay idly by the hearth, leaving
                    peaceful work to women and to males incapable of bearing arms. They liked social
                    gatherings, but after a time conversation usually gave place to drunkenness,
                    quarrelling, or excessive gambling. Although violent and cruel in moments of
                    excitement, they were rarely treacherous, and in the ordinary intercourse of
                    life they appear to have been kindly and considerate. They cherished the memory
                    of illustrious ancestors, and listened often and with delight to songs
                    celebrating their famous deeds.</p>
                <p>The bulk of the people were freemen, who alone exercised political rights. They
                    inherited their position, and the sign of their dignity was that they always
                    carried arms. A limited class of freemen were nobles, whose sole privilege seems
                    to have been that they were more respected on account of their birth than their
                    neighbours, and more easily acquired a leading place in public life. Each
                    freeman had slaves, who were chiefly prisoners of war and their offspring, and
                    persons condemned to slavery for crime. They had no legal rights as against
                    their owners, but in practice they were well treated. The Liti, composed mostly
                    of freedmen, stood between freemen and slaves. A freeman necessarily either
                    possessed land or was a member of a family that did; the Liti could only hold
                    land of a superior with whom they shared the produce. If any one killed a noble,
                    a freeman, or one of the Liti, he had to pay to the relatives a fine called
                    afterwards the wergeld, and the amount was determined by the class to which the
                    murdered man belonged.</p>
                <p>Great importance was attributed to family relations. Instead of the bridegroom
                    looking for a dowry, he was expected to present his bride with a valuable gift
                    which should remain her property throughout life. The wife was completely
                    subject to her husband, and if she proved unfaithful, custom allowed him to cut
                    off her hair and to whip her through the village in which she lived; but this
                    punishment had seldom to be inflicted, the German women being famous for their
                    chastity. They were treated as friends by their husbands, who had a high respect
                    for their judgment, and whom they often accompanied in distant expeditions. The
                    children, over whom the father had absolute control, were hardily trained, boys
                    being early taught the use of weapons, and girls devoting themselves to domestic
                    duties. Relatives were held in great esteem, and, when the head of a household
                    died, it was considered their duty to guard the interests of his family.</p>
                <p>Many freemen lived apart from all others with their families and dependants, but
                    the majority w ere grouped in villages. The land around a village—its “mark”—
                    originally belonged to the community, and was periodically divided among the
                    inhabitants. About the beginning of the Christian era, however, the arable land
                    was mostly in the possession of individual freemen, the forests and waste places
                    being almost the only common property. A number of villages made a hundred, and
                    the “gau,” if the word existed so early, may have been a higher division,
                    although it was more probably the name for the whole land of the tribe. Each
                    village had its chief, elected by the freemen, but the important chiefs were the
                    heads of the hundreds and the head of the tribe, whom the freemen also
                    appointed. Some tribes had kings, but their power had no other source than that
                    of other chiefs, nor was it more extensive; their only distinction was that they
                    were chosen from particular noble families supposed to have sprung from the
                    gods.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n491/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0491-0474"/>
                <p>The chiefs of the hundreds aud of the tribes had the right of gathering around
                    them bands of followers; and they never failed to exercise it, vying with each
                    other in the number and quality of the young men whom they attracted to their
                    sendee. These young men were generally eager for active duty, and if the tribe
                    was at peace an adventurous chief would often give them an opportunity of
                    distinguishing themselves by taking part in the wars of other communities. They
                    swore to be faithful to him, and he in return supplied them with horses, with
                    armour, and with food. The authority of the chief was extremely limited, the
                    constitution of ancient German society being essentially democratic. Every
                    village, hundred, and tribe had its periodical assembly, and these assemblies
                    were attended by all freemen, no one of whom had higher rights than his fellows.
                    Before the meeting of the assembly of the tribe, the king or other supreme chief
                    would consult with the chiefs of the hundreds, who formed his council; but the
                    final decision rested with the freemen, whom they could influence only by
                    persuasion. At this assembly the chiefs were elected; and in its presence
                    freemen clad their sons in the armour which indicated that they had attained the
                    rights of citizenship. It declared war and made peace, permitted the chiefs with
                    their followers <hi rend="subscript"> u</hi> to undertake war-like expeditions,
                    and settled all disputed cases of justice.</p>
                <p>The army was not a distinct institution; it was made up of the whole body of
                    freemen, all of whom were liable at any moment to be called to service. Each had
                    a long shield and spear, the cavalry having no other armour. The infantry were
                    provided also with missile weapons, of which they made dexterous use, and
                    occasionally wielded clubs aud battle-axes. The men of each hundred kept
                    together in war, and were commanded by their chief, the supreme command being
                    undertaken by the head of the tribe, or entrusted to a “herzog” appointed by the
                    army. In the event of several tribes uniting, a herzog was chosen by the chiefs
                    of the allied communities. The Germans rushed upon their enemies with fury,
                    shouting or chanting as they did so, and adding to the noise by putting their
                    shields to their mouths. To throw away the shield in panic was perhaps the worst
                    crime of a German; and most persons guilty of it committed suicide in an agony
                    of remorse and shame.</p>
                <p>The religion of the ancient Germans was essentially the same as that of their
                    Scandinavian kinsmen, but our sources of information respecting it are few and
                    imperfect. The highest place among the gods was held by Wuotan or Wodan, the
                    Scandinavian Odin. The Romans identified him with Mercury, and the mediaeval
                    German writers, in referring to him, follow their example. He was the god of the
                    air and of the sky, and was looked upon as the giver of the fruits of the earth.
                    He delighted in battle and in the chase, and was represented as an imposing
                    figure in a large white mantle, riding upon a white horse. Along with him the
                    Germans worshipped Donar, the Scandinavian Thor, to whom Tacitus seems to refer
                    in speaking of Hercules as a German divinity. He was the god of thunder and of
                    the weather, and was armed with a hammer or thunderbolt. In later times the
                    Germans supposed him to be Jupiter. He presided over marriage, and controlled
                    the operations of agriculture; and to him were sacred the oak and the mountain
                    ash, the bear and the ram. Another great divinity was Ziu or Tiu, the
                    Scandinavian Tyr, the god of war, whom Tacitus speaks of as Mars, and whose
                    symbol was the sword. Tacitus says that a powerful goddess called Nerthus was
                    worshipped on the shores of the Baltic; he also mentions Isis as a goddess of
                    the Suevic tribes. Both names evidently refer to the same divinity. On the
                    coasts her symbol was a ship; inland, it was a waggon; in some districts she was
                    represented with the plough. Like Donar, she presided over marriage; she also
                    watched over the house and the fields, was the giver and protector of children,
                    and ruled the world of the dead. At a later time she was known to the Saxons as
                    Fria or Frigg, to the Franks as Holda, to the Bavarians as Perchta,—the first
                    name indicating her freedom of manner, the second her kindness, the third her
                    splendour. In the Scandinavian mythology Frigg is the wife of Odin; and to this
                    day, it is said, the peasants in certain parts of Low Germany speak of Fru
                    Fricke, the wife of the wild hunter Wod. The mythology of the Germans, like that
                    of the Scandinavians, included the three sisters of fate, two of whom were fair
                    and good, the third dark and evil. Beneath the gods were giants, elves, and
                    dwarfs. After death <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> it was believed, good men were
                    received into Walhalla; and by good men were meant warriors who never shrank in
                    battle—above all, warriors who died fighting. The Germans were profoundly
                    influenced by their religious faith, and both in daily life and on special
                    occasions attended scrupulously to the duties and precautions it was supposed to
                    involve. Each god and goddess had his and her own festival, and their images
                    were preserved in sacred groves. Sacrifices were offered to them, and their will
                    was discovered by means of lots, the neighing of wild horses, and the flight of
                    birds. Priests, without dominating the whole of life, exercised considerable
                    influence, especially when the freemen met in public assembly, and when they
                    were advancing against an enemy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roman Period.</hi></p>
                <p>The Cimbri and the Teutones, who appear to have wandered from the northern coasts
                    of Germany, were the first German tribes with whom the Romans came into contact.
                    In rather less than half a century after their final defeat by Marius,
                    Ariovistus, a bold and powerful Suevic chief, crossed into Gaul with his
                    followers to aid the Sequani against the Aedui. The latter were defeated, and,
                    in reward for his services, he received from the Sequani a third of their best
                    lands. It soon became obvious that his friendship was dangerous, and in 58 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> his terrified allies appealed for aid to the new
                    proconsul, Julius Caesar, who had just inflicted a crushing defeat on the
                    Helvetii. When Caesar sent to him proposing a personal interview, the barbarian
                    haughtily answered that he himself had better come, which Caesar quickly did.
                    And the issue was that the army of Ariovistus was utterly beaten, and that he
                    escaped with difficulty, severely wounded, across the Rhine, and soon afterwards
                    died. Caesar crossed the Rhine twice, but left no permanent mark of his
                    invasions. He thoroughly subdued the Germans on the left bank, and from this
                    time the whole people began to be powerfully affected by their mighty
                    neighbours, many of them taking service in the Roman army.</p>
                <p>The first serious attempt to conquer Germany was made by Augustus, who, after he
                    rose to supreme power, wanted occupation for his legions. He began by conquering
                    Rhaetia and Noricum, Celtic countries along the southern borders of Germany,
                    extending northwards through what is now German Austria and Bavaria to the
                    Danube. Drusus, who, with Tiberius, executed this conquest in the summer of 15
                    B,c., was then entrusted with the task of subduing Germany. Deciding to reach
                    the interior of the country by means of the sea and the northern rivers, he cut
                    a canal between the Yssel and the Rhine; and for the protection of Gaul he built
                    no fewer than fifty forts along the latter river. Many of the tribes were at
                    enmity with one another, and in his first expedition in 12 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> he was able to form an alliance with the Frisii against the Chauci
                    and the Bructeri. In three different expeditions in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n492/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0492-0475"/> immediately following years he found other native
                    allies, and with their help mastered so many positions that the conquest of the
                    whole country must have seemed quite certain. After the death of Drusus in 9 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Tiberius conquered the Tencteri and Usipetes; and at
                    a lateι <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> time he not only subdued the Sicambri,
                    but settled 40,000 of them at the mouth of the Rhine, where they lived under
                    Roman rule. A good many of the Istaevones were now overcome, while others
                    entered into a more or less compulsory alliance with Rome; and it is probable
                    that, if great generals had represented the empire, Germany would soon have
                    shared the fate of Gaul. Quinctilius Varus, who, in 6 A.D., was placed at the
                    head of the Roman troops in Germany, lost all the advantages gained by his
                    predecessors. He had held office in Syria, where he had ruled with great
                    harshness; and fancying that he might act in the same way towards the fierce
                    tribes of the north, he roused among them a bitter hatred of the Romans. They
                    found in Arminius, a son of the chief of the Cherusci, a leader of extraordinary
                    bravery and resource. He had been a Roman soldier, and had so distinguished
                    himself— perhaps in wars against his countrymen—that he was made a citizen and
                    knight. He formed the design of freeing his people, and soon came to a secret
                    understanding with influential Cheruscan and other chiefs. In the year 9, in the
                    month of September, Varus, who had been told that a northern tribe was in
                    revolt, was led at the head of his legions into the Teutoburg Forest. Here the
                    Germans were lying in wait for him; and everything was in their favour, the
                    narrow defiles having caused disorder among the troops, and the ground having
                    been made muddy by heavy rains. The battle which ensued lasted three days,
                    during which the Romans were altogether destroyed, and Varus, in despair, killed
                    himself by falling upon his sword.</p>
                <p>The despairing cry of Augustus—“Varus, Varus, give me back my legions
                    !”—testifies to the consternation which tlιis defeat caused at Rome, where it
                    was expected that the barbarians would take a terrible revenge for the wrongs
                    they supposed themselves to have suffered. The Germans, however, were too much
                    occupied with internal disputes to think of any enterprise beyond their own
                    country; and in the year 14, after Tiberius had become emperor, Rome again
                    assumed the offensive. Germanicus, the son of Drusus, crossed the Rhine, and
                    defeated the Marsi. He returned in the year 15, when he was joined by the Chauci
                    and other tribes, who fought for him as zealously as his own soldiers.
                    Thusnelda, the wife of Arminius, fell into the hands of Germanicus, and was sent
                    as a prisoner to Rome. This intensified the hostility of the young chief, who
                    now exerted to the utmost his vast influence to stir up against the invaders his
                    tribe and its allies. The Teutoburg Forest was again selected as the scene of an
                    attack; and although Arminius was not victorious, he so far injured his enemy
                    that Germanicus was forced to retreat. The struggle was resumed in the year 16,
                    when Germanicus gained two victories. He gained them, however, at so great a
                    cost that he and his army had to take refuge in their ships, the greater number,
                    of which were lost in a storm.</p>
                <p>No sooner had the Romans been driven off than Arminius had to protect his people
                    against an internal danger. Maroboduus, the chief of the Marcomanni, a man of
                    great ambition, had by treachery or by open fighting made himself master of
                    several neighbouring tribes. Arminius began to fear his designs, and after the
                    defeat of Varus warned him of his peril by sending him the Roman general’s head.
                    When Germanicus finally left the country, Arminius declared war against
                    Maroboduus, broke up his kingdom, and drove him from Germany. It is possible
                    that Arminius himself may afterwards have wished to found a great state. At any
                    rate, a number of chiefs combined against him, and in the year 21, at the age of
                    thirty-seven, he was killed.</p>
                <p>Although the Romans did not again attempt on a large scale the conquest of
                    Germany, they acquired great influence throughout the country, and they
                    gradually obtained considerable possessions to the east of the Rhine and to the
                    south of the Main. Among the tribes whom they forced to become their allies were
                    the Frisians and the Batavians; and in the year 69 a formidable conspiracy
                    against them was headed by a Batavian chief, Claudius Civilis, who, like
                    Arminius, had been a Roman soldier. Having been embittered by ill-usage from the
                    emperor Nero, he stirred up his countrymen, and he found a large number of
                    allies on both banks of the Rhine. He struggled valiantly for a time, supported
                    by the mysterious utterances of Velleda, a prophetess who lived in a tower in
                    the land of the Bructeri, and excited popular enthusiasm on behalf of the enemy
                    of Rome. At last he was overcome by the Roman general Cerealis, and the
                    Batavians were thenceforth compelled to send recruits to the Roman army.</p>
                <p>About a hundred years after this time the relations of the Romans and the Germans
                    began to be reversed, the latter being the aggressors. In the Marcomannic war
                    Marcus Aurelius opposed for thirteen years a vast host of Germans who sought to
                    push southward into Roman territory. Meanwhile the Romans had profoundly
                    influenced large parts of the country. They built many fortresses along their
                    frontier, and some of these were connected by a great wall, of which there are
                    still remnants in southern Germany. Around the fortresses grew up towns, which
                    became the centres of civilization over pretty wide districts. In Rhaetia, which
                    reached from the Lake of Constance along the Danube as far as the Inn, there
                    were important settlements at Augsburg and Regensburg (Ratisbon); Noricum, which
                    stretched far to the east of Rhaetia, possessed, among other towns, Vienna,
                    Salzburg, and Weis. Germania Superior and Germania Inferior, on the left bank of
                    the Rhine, included Strasburg, Mainz (Mayence), Worms, Cologne, and Bonn. In the
                    province of Belgium, which was at least partly German, was the great city of
                    Treves, one of the most splendid in the Roman empire, and often the residence of
                    the emperors.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Confederations of Tribes.</hi></p>
                <p>The experience of the Germans in contending with the Romans taught them the
                    necessity of some measure of union; and from the third century we hear no longer
                    of the individual tribes which had before been famous, but of groups or
                    confederations, each forming, for purposes of attack and defence, a single
                    state. The Goths were one of the most important of these groups. They included
                    many of the tribes in the eastern and north-eastern parts of Germany, such as
                    the Vandals, the Burgundians, and the Heruli. Next to them, in the order in
                    which they appear in history, were the Alemanni, a confederation made up of
                    several Suevic tribes. They held the Rhine country in the neighbourhood of the
                    Main, and were continually pushing southwards and eastwards in the hope of
                    securing Roman lands and towns. To the north of them, on both banks of the Rhine
                    as far as the sea, were the Franks; and to the east of the Franks, the Frisians
                    and Saxons. The Thuringians, descendants of the Hermunduri, inhabited the
                    Thuringian Forest and the surrounding country.</p>
                <p>The Goths were the first of these confederations to found a great kingdom; in the
                    4th century their lands stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea. This vast
                    state was broken up by the Huns, who poured in immense hordes from the Asiatic
                    steppes into Europe. Urged forward by so tremendous a force, the Burgundians,
                    the Vandals, and many of the Suevi wandered westwards early in the 5th <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n493/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0493-0476"/> century in search of new homes; and the
                    Burgundians soon conquered from the Romans the whole of the valley of the Rhone,
                    in which they thenceforth settled. The Vandals and the Suevi went on to Spain,
                    the latter remaining there, but the former crossing over to Africa, where they
                    maintained an independent kingdom for upwards of a century. Meanwhile, in a
                    portion of Rhaetia a new confederation had been forming itself, the Bavarians,
                    who were probably in part descendants of the Marcomanni and also included some
                    of the bands which had been driven westwards by the Huns. When the latter had
                    settled themselves in the Gothic lands, the East Goths continued subject to
                    them; but the West Goths crossed the Danube into Roman territory, and
                    afterwards, under their bold chief Alaric, penetrated into Italy and seized Rome
                    itself. In the 5th century they conquered the southern part of Gaul, and nearly
                    the whole of »Spain, shutting up the Suevi, who had preceded them, in the small
                    part of the peninsula which now forms Portugal. In the great battle with Attila,
                    in which the destinies of civilization were decided, they fought by the side of
                    the Romans; and it was chiefly owing to their valour that he was forced to
                    retreat. After his fall and the consequent disruption of his kingdom, Odoacer,
                    the chief of the Heruli, became lord of Italy, and his authority was recognized
                    beyond the Alps as far as Bavaria. Theodoric, the East Goth, displaced him; and
                    to Theodoric, too, the Bavarians yielded some kind of submission. None of the
                    German kings who planted themselves on Roman soil displayed higher statesmanship
                    than this great sovereign; but his kingdom was built on too narrow foundations,
                    and after his death soon gave way. The Lombards, Vvho succeeded the East Goths
                    in Italy, were not so brilliantly successful, but their power was more
                    enduring.</p>
                <p>While these migrations were going on, great changes took place in the mother
                    country. The Slavs, the last of the Aryan family to enter Europe, and at that
                    time a listless and indolent race, having been stirred up by the terrific
                    onslaughts of the Huns, had followed the general impulse towards the west.
                    Finding many German lands vacant, they took possession of them; and so numerous
                    were their incursions that in the 5th century the Elbe and the Saale became the
                    eastern boundaries of Germany. Within Germany itself the confederations had
                    greatly extended their lands. The Alemanni held both banks of the Rhine at the
                    points where it is joined by the Moselle and the Main, and reached far into what
                    is now Switzerland. The Thuringians had pushed down as far as the Danube, and
                    penetrated northwards and westwards along the Elbe and towards the Weser. The
                    basins of the Elbe and the Weser were in the hands of the Saxons, and the
                    Bavarians steadily advanced in and around the valley of the Inn.</p>
                <p>More important than any of these groups were the Franks, whose destiny it was to
                    found the German and the French kingdoms. They were remarkable for the
                    comparatively friendly terms on which they lived with the Romans, in whose
                    armies many of them served, and by whose side they fought the Alemanni, the West
                    Goths, and the Burgundians. This alliance did not, however, prevent them from
                    enriching themselves, whenever they had an opportunity, at the expense of the
                    Romans, who were repeatedly compelled to turn against them and drive them back.
                    The Franks who lived to the east and the west of the Rhine were called
                    Ripuarians; those at the mouth of the Rhine and along the western shores of the
                    North Sea were known as Salians,—both of them names whose origin is still
                    uncertain. One consequence of the relation of the Franks to the Romans was that
                    the kingly authority soon became higher among them than among other Germans. The
                    Salic code, which probably belongs to the middle of the 5th century, shows us
                    the Salian king as in all respects the centre of his state. He was not then
                    elected, but inherited his rights; and the only nobility which existed was that
                    belonging to his officers and followers. The state was divided into “gaus,”
                    presided over by grafs or counts, whose duty was to administer the laws
                    emanating from him, and to execute the sentences of his tribunal. There were
                    still, however, popular assemblies, without whose sanction the king could not
                    undertake any national enterprise.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Early Mediaeval Period.</hi></p>
                <p>The first Salian king of whom we know anything is Chlodi.^&gt;, who reigned about
                    the middle of the 5th century, and whose kingdom reached to the Somme. His
                    successor, Merwig, or Merovaeus, who gave his name to the first great Frankish
                    dynasty, fought beside the Romans and the West Goths against Attila. Childeric
                    I., the son of Merovaeus, offended his people, and appears to have fled from
                    them and taken refuge for a time among the Thuringians. During his absence the
                    Salians placed themselves under the Roman commander-in-chief, Aegidius, not as
                    the representative of Rome, but as a personal ruler in whom they had confidence.
                    His representative governed so badly that they were glad to welcome Childeric
                    back. In a great battle Childeric overcame Aegidius, and made himself master of
                    Cologne and Treves; but afterwards he was reconciled to the Romans, and before
                    his death he ruled in their name in Paris. When he died in 481, his son and
                    successor, Chlodwig (Clovis) was a boy of fifteen, but a boy of high spirit,
                    daring and aggressive. From him, in 486, came, in the battle of Soissons, the
                    blow which made an end of Roman rule in Gaul. In a few years he conquered the
                    greater part of the country, and many of his warriors scattered themselves over
                    it, seizing much of its most fruitful land. He turned also agaiust men of his
                    own race. The Alemanni having made war on the Ripuarian Franks, the latter
                    appealed for help to Chlodwig, who gladly responded to their summons, and
                    defeated the invaders in the battle of Zülpich. It was in this battle that he
                    vowed, according to tradition, to become .a member of the Catholic Church if the
                    God of the Christians gave him the victory. Whether or not the tale be true, it
                    is certain that to his baptism he owed the greater part of his amazing success;
                    for the West Goths and the Burgundians were Arians, and the Gallic clergy, who
                    exercised unlimited power over the popular mind, welcomed into their country an
                    orthodox believer. As for the Alemanni, he would have annexed their whole
                    territory, but Theodoric, the East Goth, who was interested in them, and whom he
                    did not dare offend, warned him that he must not treat them with undue severity.
                    He must, however, have taken the part of their territory in the neighbourhood of
                    the Main and the Neckar, for it was henceforth known as Franconia. At a somewhat
                    later date the whole of Alemannia was added to his kingdom. Being as
                    unscrupulous as he was ambitious, he put to death all who had any claim to
                    independent authority among the Franks; so that he became their sole king, and
                    they quickly acquired the proud feeling of being the centre of a vast and
                    growing state.</p>
                <p>Chlodwig died in Paris, his capital, in 511, leaving four sons. They did not
                    destroy the unity of the kingdom, which in its relation to the outer world
                    continued to be regarded as a single power. But each, as a king of the Franks,
                    received a separate territory. TÍie East or Rhenish Franks, with the Alemanni
                    subject to them, were placed under Theodoric, the eldest. He was as valiant as
                    his father, and not less deceitful and cruel. The great Thuringian kingdom was
                    in his time ruled by three brothers, Hermanfried, Berthar, and Baderich. The
                    former of these was married to a niece of Theodoric the East Goth, Amala-berga,
                    a kind of Thuringian Lady Macbeth. Consumed by <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0494-0477"/> a vehement ambition, she persuaded her husband to
                    murder Berthar; and she would have caused the death of Baderich also, but that
                    he knew her design and rose against the guilty pair. Hermanfried sent to
                    Theodoric, the East Frankish king, and offered to reward him if he would form an
                    alliance against Baderich. The offer was gladly accepted, and in a battle which
                    followed Baderich was slain. No reward, however, was given, and Theodoric,
                    indignant at being thus treated, vowed to be avenged. He allied himself with the
                    northern neighbours of the Thuringians—the Saxons; and with their united forces
                    they completely subdued the country. Theodoric himself murdered Hermanfried by
                    pushing him off the wall of Zülpich, where they were carrying on an apparently
                    friendly conversation, the Thuringian king having received an assurance that he
                    would be treated with honour. Thereupon the murderer divided between himself and
                    the Saxons the territory of the Thuringians, annexing the southern half to the
                    Frankish kingdom. His son, Theudebert, not only maintained this conquest but
                    added to it, after the downfall of the Gothic kingdom in Italy, that of Bavaria.
                    The Alemanni were also made altogether subject to his rule. Thus the Saxons and
                    the Frisians alone retained their independence.</p>
                <p>The rights of the Franks in Germany were at first vigorously asserted; but a
                    change soon came. The Merovingian kings carried on so many fierce wars with each
                    other that they had little time to look after their -subjects in the remote
                    east; moreover, the rise of a great new aristocracy steadily undermined the
                    royal power. This aristocracy was made up of the class directly associated with
                    the king by military or court duties. They were rewarded by immense grants of
                    land, which they held in the first instance subject to the condition of
                    rendering faithful service, but the possession of which, in most cases, became
                    in the end absolute and hereditary. Nowhere was the new aristocracy so powerful
                    as in Austrasia, the eastern division of the Frankish monarchy. In Neustria, the
                    western division, where the sovereign had to deal for the most part with a race
                    which for five centuries had been accustomed to the despotic government of Rome,
                    he had little difficulty in maintaining his supremacy; for the Franks settled in
                    different districts could not but be more or less influenced by the feeling of
                    the native population. Besides, they lived at great distances from one another,
                    so that it was difficult to hold popular assemblies of any kind, and the powers
                    which belonged to them were naturally transferred to the head of the state.
                    Hence, even when the Merovingian kings of Neustria were driven into the
                    background, and the mayors of the palace governed, the latter had high
                    authority, and exercised it, as a rule, in the interests of the crown. In
                    Austrasia the conditions were wholly different. There the Franks were the
                    predominant element; and the distances were not so great but that an assembly
                    could be rapidly summoned on every occasion of real need. Thus the important
                    landowners of Austrasia were able to hold together, and to limit the powers of
                    the sovereign on the one hand and of the ordinary freemen on the other. And the
                    mayor of the palace, who was their nominee, and could at any moment be dismissed
                    if he displeased them, usually acted as their representative and leader.</p>
                <p>Kings under the authority of an aristocracy of this kind are not likely to be
                    troublesome to unruly subjects; especially kings of such feeble personal
                    character as those who, from the first half of the 7th century, nominally held
                    the sceptre of the mighty Chlodwig. The German confederations which he and his
                    immediate descendants had conquered soon became virtually free. They continued
                    to acknowledge Frankish supremacy; but the acknowledgment was only formal. At
                    the head of each confederation was its own herzog or duke. These rulers were at
                    first appointed by the Frankish kings, or received their sanction; but in course
                    of time the office became hereditary in particular families. This was the case,
                    longer than anywhere else, in Bavaria, where the ancient Agilolfing family held
                    the ducal dignity from the earliest days of Frankish authority down to the time
                    of Charles the Great. The dukes were far from being absolute sovereigns, for in
                    Germany the freemen had retained many of their primeval rights. The assemblies
                    of the hundred and of the confederation still exercised great authority. As
                    among the Austrasian Franks, however, although in a less degree, the leading
                    landowners constantly encroached upon the powers both of the poorer freemen and
                    of the head of the state.</p>
                <p>In the time of the great dukes of the Franks, who arose to infuse new life into
                    the decaying monarchy, there was another profound change in the position of the
                    Germans. After the battle of Testri, in 687, in which Pippin of Heristal decided
                    that the Frankish kingdom should not then fall to pieces, and that, in the
                    reunited state, the Austrasian Franks should have the supremacy, the German
                    dukes began to find that they were likely again to have a master. He made war on
                    them, and forced them to some extent to return to the allegiance which they had
                    all but forgotten. His successor, Charles Martel, asserted his rights with not
                    less vigour, and added East Friesland for the first time to the monarchy. The
                    high importance of the efforts of these two illustrious rulers was seen in the
                    struggle of Charles Martel with the Arabs. Had the Frankish kingdom been
                    dissolved, they would have had little difficulty in overrunning Europe; but
                    having under him a state more or less organized, Charles was able to rally
                    around him powerful warriors from all the districts he governed, Germany among
                    the rest. And so, at the memorable battle of Poitiers, he saved Christendom.
                    Other favourable results of the policy of Charles and his father were that new
                    and vigorous life streamed towards the Gallic part of the kingdom from Germany,
                    while the Germans were brought into closer contact than before with the higher
                    and more refined civilization of the Gauls. Pippin the Short, the first king of
                    the Carolingian line, although his chief fame was won in his wars with Aquitania
                    and with Lombardy, did not neglect Germany,, in which he strove to assert an
                    authority more thorough and extensive than had been exercised even by the early
                    Merovingian sovereigns.</p>
                <p>After all, however, even these powerful Frankish conquerors had but imperfect
                    success in Germany. When they were present with their formidable armies, they
                    could command obedience; when engaged, as they often were, in distant parts of
                    the vast Frankish territory, they could not trust to the fulfilment of the fair
                    promises they had exacted. One of the chief causes of their ill-success was the
                    continued independence of the Saxons. Ever since they had acquired the northern
                    half of Thuringia, this warlike race had been extending its power. They were
                    still heathens, and maintained all the old customs and institutions of primitive
                    Germany. As in ancient times, they appointed a herzog only when an officer of
                    this class was needed, in time of war; at ordinary times the chiefs elected by
                    the freemen ruled in association with the popular assemblies. They cherished
                    bitter hatred towards the Franks, whom they justly regarded as the enemies both
                    of their liberties and of their religion; and their hatred found expression, not
                    only in expeditions into Frankish territory, but in help willingly rendered to
                    every German confederation which wished to throw off the Frankish yoke. No
                    rebellion against the dukes of the F ranks, or against King Pippin, took place
                    in Germany without the Saxons coming forward to aid the rebels. This was
                    perfectly understood by the Frankish rulers, who tried <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n495/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0495-0478"/> again and again to put au end to the evil by
                    subduing the Saxons. They could not, however, attain their object. An occasional
                    victory was gained, and some border tribes were from time to time compelled to
                    pay tribute; but the mass of the Saxons remained unconquered. This was partly
                    due to the fact that the Saxons had not, like the other German confederations, a
                    duke who, when beaten, could be held responsible for the engagements forced upon
                    him as the representative of his subjects. A Saxon chief who made peace with the
                    Franks could undertake nothing for the whole people. As a conquering race, they
                    were firmly compact; conquered, they were in the hands of the victor a rope of
                    sand.</p>
                <p>Although, at the time of King Pippin’s death in 768, the Germans were still
                    imperfectly subdued, they had received the germs of new life; for, with the
                    exception of the Saxons, they were then nominally Christians. The first
                    missionaries to Germany were Irish monks. In the 7th century a number of these
                    laboured with considerable success in different parts of the country, especially
                    among the Alemanni and the Bavarians; and when the influence of the Franks
                    became dominant, Frankish missionaries also began to do for the church what the
                    warriors did for the state. The honour of converting Germany as a whole,
                    however, belongs mainly to St Boniface, an Englishman, who in 717 began the task
                    of his life as an assistant to another English missionary, Willibrord, in
                    Friesland. Soon afterwards, during a visit to Rome, he received from Pope
                    Gregory II. a commission as apostle of the Germans, and worked incessantly among
                    the Thuringians and the Frisians. He proved himself one of the most skilful of
                    missionaries, adapting the conceptions of Christianity to the ideas of those
                    whom he taught. The peculiar powers of Wodan, for instance, were transferred to
                    the archangel Michael, those of Donar to St Peter; and the chief Christian
                    festival, Easter, received its name from the goddess Ostara. His zeal and
                    talent, although largely rewarded, effected less than he had hoped, so that in
                    723 he went once more to Rome to obtain, if possible, increased powers. Hitherto
                    the mission in Germany had possessed an essentially independent character;
                    Boniface now undertook to work in all things under the direction and for the
                    benefit of the papacy. In return for this engagement he was not only made bishop
                    of all Germans who had been or should be converted, but received from the pope a
                    letter commending him to Charles, the mighty duke of the Franks. The Frankish
                    bishops, who had no wish to become subordinate to the papacy, received Boniface
                    coldly, and threw every kind of obstacle in his way. Charles, however, believing
                    that the conversion of Germany would be the most effectual means of establishing
                    Frankish authority, took Boniface under his protection, and sent him forth with
                    orders that he should be everywhere respected. Thus strengthened, he entered
                    upon a wholly new stage of his career. He was looked upon as to some extent
                    armed with the authority of the great warrior and ruler, and he and his
                    fellow-workers rapidly brought vast districts within the pale of the church.
                    Possessing a high talent for organization, he would willingly have established
                    an orderly ecclesiastical system as he proceeded; but the Alemanni and the
                    Bavarians, among whom Christianity had made some progress before his time, would
                    not allow him free scope for his activity; and Charles, who, by “resuming”
                    church lands and granting them to faithful followers, had done much to weaken
                    ecclesiastical authority in Gaul, did not wish to see it assume threatening
                    proportions in Germany. In 738 Boniface again visited Rome, from which he
                    returned in the following year as papal legate to the Frankish state. Armed with
                    this new authority, he was able to some extent to give effect to his ideas. The
                    duke of Bavaria permitted him to divide the whole of</p>
                <p>Bavaria into the episcopal sees of Salzburg, Freisingen, Ratisbon, and Passau,
                    and to appoint the bishops; and a little later, with the sanction of Charles, he
                    formed also the sees of Würzburg, Erfurt, Buraburg, and Eichstädt.</p>
                <p>Before Pippin the Short was made king, he ruled for some years in association
                    with his brother Carlman, to whom the eastern part of the kingdom was confided.
                    Carlman was a man of strongly religious temperament, and warmly supported
                    Boniface. He set up by his advice bishoprics and monasteries, among the latter
                    being the great abbey of Fulda, which, throughout the Middle Ages, was one of
                    the chief centres of intellectual light in Germany. In 742 was held the first
                    German council, summoned by Carlman, and presided over by Boniface. It did much
                    for the organization of the church, and was the beginning of an important
                    movement for the reform of ecclesiastical abuses among the Franks. Boniface
                    wished to become archbishop of Cologne, that he might the more readily influence
                    the Frisians; but the suggestion met with opposition, and he ultimately accepted
                    the see of Mainz. As archbishop of Mainz and primate of Germany, he was able to
                    foster and control the institutions he had established. The last years of his
                    life he spent in missionary labours among the Frisians, and in 755 he died a
                    martyr’s death. By that time all German tribes, with the exception of the
                    Saxons, professed Christianity; and the church was not only highly organized,
                    but possessed great wealth. The old pagan faith had struck its roots too deeply
                    into the German nature to be at once or soon completely destroyed. Traces of its
                    influence may even yet be detected in popular beliefs and customs; and for many
                    centuries some of its conceptions, in altered forms, had hardly less vitality
                    than those of the •Catholic creed. Christianity was, however, the dominant
                    power, and soon became a great civilizing agency. It was a fact of high
                    importance that its triumph was due mainly to the influence of the papacy. The
                    German Church thus stood from the beginning in close relation to the pope,— a
                    circumstance which added largely to his power, and which was followed by results
                    of the utmost consequence in the later history of the nation.</p>
                <p>Under Charles the Great (Charlemagne) a momentous era dawned in the history of
                    the Germans. From the outset of his reign he had vast plans, which, however,
                    were not so great as those ultimately realized. He saw at once that he could not
                    hope to execute his schemes if on the north-eastern boundary of his kingdom
                    there was a powerful and hostile people, ready at all times to plot against him,
                    and to take advantage of any misfortune which might temporarily befall him.
                    Accordingly, when the death of his brother Carlman made him, in 771, sole king,
                    one of his first resolutions was to advance against the Saxons, and thoroughly
                    to subdue them. It is not necessary to suppose that he went to war without an
                    adequate special reason; for, as the Frankish and the Saxon frontiers touched
                    each other along the whole western and southern boundary of Saxony, and as the
                    Saxons were continually robbing their neighbours, pretexts for war were always
                    overabundant. In his first campaign in 772 he overran the country, took the
                    fortress of Eresburg, previously supposed to be impregnable, and cast down the
                    Irminsul, a mysterious column to which the Saxons attached profound religious
                    significance. Awed by the lordly bearing of the great Frank, by the numbers and
                    discipline of his army, and by these proofs of his power, the Saxons appeared to
                    submit at once, and Charles was under the impression that he had conquered them.
                    Never was there a more profound mistake; in reality, he was at the beginning of
                    a struggle which lasted upwards of thirty years. Time after time, when
                    apparently they were utterly beaten, they rose against the invaders, and tried
                    with desperate<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n496/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0496-0479"/> energy to drive them from the country. The
                    execution of 4500 prisoners by Charles—an act which even then was looked upon as
                    barbarous—only deepened their resolve never to yield to his authority. At last,
                    however, their strength was exhausted, and they had no alternative but to
                    submit. Charles introduced among them the political institutions which were
                    established throughout the kingdom; and they were compelled to exchange their
                    heathenism for the Christian faith. Thus one of the greatest dangers which
                    threatened the stability of the Frankish kingdom was overcome, and all Germany
                    was for the first time brought under a single ruler.</p>
                <p>The part of Germany which, next to Saxony, had retained most independence was
                    Bavaria. Its duke, Thassilo, had been on ill terms with Pippin, and, had he
                    allied himself with the Saxons during their great conflict, he might have
                    baffled even Charles. But he did not become troublesome until they were too weak
                    to be of service to him. Repeated acts of treachery gave Charles a pretext for
                    depriving him of his office, and after him no duke was placed over the country.
                    As the dukes of the Alemanni and the Thuringians had also been displaced,
                    Germany became, more directly than it had ever before been, subject to the
                    Frankish sovereign. Not content with completing the conquest of the German
                    people, he made war on the tribes which harassed their eastern frontier. The
                    Avars, who held the greater part of what is now Hungary, were thoroughly beaten;
                    and the Slavs, including the Czechs of Bohemia and Moravia, and the Slavonic
                    tribes to the north of them, as far as the Baltic, were also more or less
                    effectually forced into submission.</p>
                <p>The great step taken by Charles on Christmas Day 800, when at St Peter’s in Rome
                    he was crowned Roman emperor, intensified the allegiance of his German as ’of
                    his other subjects; but it could not produce so powerful an impression in
                    Germany as in Gaul. Ultimately, however, it was in Germany that the significance
                    of the step was fully revealed; for, in becoming emperor, Charles created so
                    splendid a prize, that later German kings could not resist the temptation to
                    grasp at it, and its possession proved their ruin.</p>
                <p>All the advantages which attended the rule of Charles throughout his vast empire
                    were shared by the Germans. The border countries he formed into “marches,” over
                    which he appointed margraves, whose duty was to administer justice in his name,
                    to collect tribute, and to extend his conquests. Germany itself was placed under
                    counts, who did not merely, like the counts of an earlier time, execute the
                    sentences of the royal tribunals, but themselves decided questions of justice in
                    accordance with local laws and the capitularies of Charles. Four times a year
                    the whole country was visited by his Missi Dominici, who reported as to the
                    state of their districts, investigated grievances, and proclaimed the imperial
                    decrees. Although he could not write, Charles was a man of true culture, and
                    encouraged education by causing schools to be established in connexion with
                    cathedrals and monasteries. These schools were modelled on the famous school of
                    the palace over which Alcuin presided, and in which the emperor himself passed
                    some of his happiest hours. By his magnificent basilica in Aachen
                    (Aix-la-Chapelle), his favourite capital, and by the palaces he built there and
                    in Ingelheim and Nimeguen, he fostered a love of art among the more advanced of
                    his German subjects.</p>
                <p>In Germany, as in Gaul, Charles treated the clergy in the spirit in which he
                    treated the papacy; he set up and put down archbishops, bishops, and abbots, as
                    if he were the supreme lord of the church,—which indeed, in theory as well as in
                    practice, he claimed to be. But the church never had a truer friend. As emperor,
                    he believed that his chief duty was to protect and to encourage it, and he was
                    stimulated to the performance of his supposed duty by the conviction that a
                    strong spiritual power would be one of the soundest pillars of his secular
                    authority. Hence he not only founded bishoprics and monasteries in Germany, and
                    enriched them with magnificent gifts of land, but invested the prelates with
                    some of the functions which properly belonged to the counts. Criminal cases they
                    did not yet decide; but they were allowed to settle all civil disputes between
                    the inhabitants of their territories. This policy may have been beneficial at
                    the time, but it caused much disaster to his German successors; for the church
                    became one of the most vigorous and obstinate powers with which they had to
                    contend in maintaining their lawful functions.</p>
                <p>Although in many respects one of the greatest of statesmen, Charles was of
                    thoroughly despotic temper; more than any previous Frankish king he set himself
                    against popular liberties. Hitherto all Germans had had the right of attending
                    national assemblies or diets; the common freemen were now excluded, and only the
                    great nobles, spiritual and secular, were summoned. Even they had but slight
                    influence. They had the right of advising, but Charles himself originated and
                    decided; and he would not brook opposition, although, indeed, so commanding was
                    his presence, and so high the moral authority conferred by his great deeds, very
                    little opposition was ever offered. Popular assemblies of all kinds he
                    discouraged, transferring their functions to the counts. Not only were the
                    rights of freemen limited, but severe hardships were imposed upon them by
                    Charles’s incessant warlike expeditions. At any moment they were liable to be
                    dragged from their homes to some distant corner of the empire; and while they
                    were away, their fields lay neglected, and their families suffered grinding
                    poverty. What made this evil most galling was the fact that its pressure was
                    very unequally felt. Well-off freemen knew how to purchase exemption from the
                    counts, part of whose business was to see that the ranks of the army should be
                    properly filled. It is true that Charles treated severely offences of this kind;
                    but in such an empire as his, it was impossible even for his Missi Dominici to
                    find out every case of injustice. Thus the burden of his many wars fell to the
                    largest extent on the poorer class of freemen, who had but a sorry recompense in
                    the glory their sacrifices reflected on their lord.</p>
                <p>Not content with the general allegiance due to him as king and emperor, Charles
                    compelled many great landowners to take the oath of vassals; he imposed a like
                    condition on his prelates and counts. A man might be his vassal without
                    possessing land; but no land was granted by Charles except to those who were
                    willing to assume this intimate personal relation. As his conquests put vast
                    quantities of land at his disposal, especially in Saxony and on the frontiers,
                    many freemen gladly swore to be his “men” in the hope that he would reward them
                    for their services with extensive benefices. On the other hand, large numbers of
                    poor freemen became the vassals of their stronger neighbours, as there was a
                    chance that the military demands made upon them would thus be made rather less
                    exorbitant. By these changes, due either directly or indirectly to him, Charles
                    helped to build up that system of feudal tenures, the foundations of which had
                    been laid by the first Merovingian kings. As in giving great temporal power to
                    the church, so in establishing feudalism, he imagined that he was providing for
                    the monarchy a steady support; but in the latter case, even more than in the
                    former, he prepared weakness and humiliation for those who came after him.</p>
                <p>After the death of Charles Germany remained for some time, in common with the
                    other countries which composed the Frankish empire, under the direct rule of his
                    son, Louis (Hludwig or Ludwig) the Pious. On the division of the monarchy,
                    effected by the emperor in 817, in order <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0497-0480"/> to secure the succession, Bavaria was given to
                    his second son Louis; the other parts of Germany fell to his eldest son Lothair
                    (Hlothar), who received also the rest of the empire, except Aquitania, which was
                    the portion of Pippin, the youngest. This arrangement lasted until the emperor
                    fell completely under the power of his second wife, Judith, a Bavarian princess,
                    who intrigued incessantly to obtain for her son Charles—afterwards “Charles the
                    Bald”—a position similar to that of his half brothers. The emperor at last, at
                    the expense of his son Lothair, marked off an important territory for this
                    inconvenient child. In the wars which followed, Louis the Bavarian firmly
                    maintained his rights; but he disapproved the cruel harshness with which his
                    father was treated by Lothair. In Germany the emperor was highly esteemed,—
                    especially in Saxony, where he softened the rigorous system introduced by
                    Charles, by sanctioning as far as possible a return to ancient popular
                    institutions. The result was that when he was virtually deposed by Lothair, and
                    afterwards not only deposed but humiliated almost ‘beyond endurance, the Germans
                    warmly supported Louis the Bavarian in insisting that the emperor should be
                    restored to imperial rights. For his services on these occasions Louis received
                    extensive additions of territory, and had he continued to be fairly treated, he
                    would have been the most effectual support of his father’s power. But the spirit
                    of the gentle-hearted emperor was broken by misfortune, and when Pippin of
                    Aquitania died, he was easily persuaded by Judith, who had come to an
                    understanding with Lothair, to sanction a division of the empire by which his
                    son in Germany would have been confined strictly to his original possession of
                    Bavaria. Louis instantly revolted; and it was in marching against him that the
                    emperor fell sick and died, in 8 40, on a small island on the Rhine opposite
                    Ingelheim. The last words of the dying sovereign were a message of forgiveness
                    to his rebellious son.</p>
                <p>Lothair at once assumed the imperial dignity, and showed that he intended to
                    demand the complete submission of his brothers, Louis and Charles. They combined
                    against him, and in the battle of Fontenay, in 841, after fearful slaughter,
                    defeated him. The armies of the allied brothers soon afterwards met in
                    Strasburg, where they swore to be true to each other, Louis taking the oath, so
                    as to be understood by the army of Charles, in a language in which we find the
                    beginnings of modern French, Charles in a German dialect. In 843 the treaty of
                    Verdun was signed. By this treaty Lothair retained the title of emperor, and
                    received, in addition to the Italian territory of the Franks, a long narrow
                    kingdom, stretching from the Mediterranean up through the valleys of the Rhone
                    and the Rhine to the North Sea. This kingdom was called Lotharingia, a name
                    afterwards confined to the northern part of it along the left bank of the Rhine.
                    To the west of Lotharingia was the kingdom of Charles, which included the
                    greater part of what is now France. Louis received most of the German lands to
                    the east of the Rhine, with the towns and sees of Mainz, Worms, and Spires, on
                    the western bank.</p>
                <p>Nothing was further from the intention of the brothers than finally to break up
                    the Frankish state by this division. In relation to the outer world the empire
                    was still considered a single power, as the kingdom had been after the death of
                    Chlodwig, more than three centuries before. And, after a time, it was for a
                    brief period reunited under one head. Still it is not an arbitrary impulse that
                    has led historians to fix upon 843 as the date of the real beginning of the
                    German as well as of the French kingdom. Although it can hardly be said that a
                    true national life had yet revealed itself in Germany, at least the foundations
                    of national life had been laid. For the first time Germany was ruled by a king
                    who reigned nowhere else, and it could not but be that the people should slowly
                    acquire a sense of common interests.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Middle Med larval Period.</hi></p>
                <p>Keen animosity soon revealed itself between Louis and Charles the B.dd, and on
                    one occasion when the former, accepting the invitation of certain West-Frankish
                    nobles, rashly invaded his brother’s territory, he was made prisoner. He escaped
                    without dishonour only by the intercession of Lothair II., the emperor Lothair’s
                    second son, who, after his father’s death, had received the greater part, and
                    ultimately the whole, of Lothair’s kingdom to the north of Italy. When Lothair
                    II. died in 8G9, Charles the Bald pounced upon his territory; but Louis the
                    German had naturally something to say to this seizure of the whole prize, and in
                    870 the rival brothers signed the treaty of Mersen, by which Louis became
                    possessed of most of Lotharingia or Lorraine. Germany at this time assumed very
                    nearly the proportions which it maintained during the Middle Ages. On the east
                    its boundaries were the Elbe and the Saale; to the west it reached to aud
                    included the valleys of the Meuse and the Moselle, taking in, among others, the
                    important towns and dioceses of Utrecht, Aix-la-Chapelle, Metz, Strasburg, and
                    Basel. Franconia, which reached eastward from the Rhine through the valleys of
                    the Neckar and the Main to the Saale, and extended also a little to the west of
                    the Rhine, occupied the central positipn, and, as the home of the Franks, was
                    the most important division of the kingdom. To the north and north-east of it
                    were Saxony and Thuringia; to the south, Alemannia, or, as it now began to be
                    called, Swabia; and to the east of Swabia, in the valley of the Inn, Bavaria.
                    There were five archbishoprics, those of Mainz, Treves, Cologne, Salzburg, and
                    Bremen.</p>
                <p>Louis, who was on the whole the worthiest of the grandsons of Charles the Great,
                    ruled his kingdom vigorously and efficiently. During his reign the Frankish
                    empire was vexed throughout nearly its whole extent by the Northmen, whom the
                    fame of Charles the Great had held in awe, but who now swept the coasts of
                    northern, southern, and western Europe with persistent fury. The East-Frankish
                    kingdom was, however, much less troubled at this time than the kingdom of the
                    West Franks; the main evil with which Louis had to contend was the arrogance of
                    his Slavonic neighbours. Exactly to the east of Franconia, from the Saale to the
                    Oder, were the Sorabi, and to the north of them, between the Elbe and the Oder,
                    the Wiltzi and Abotrites; while along the Baltic coast, as far as the Vistula,
                    in what is now Pomerania, were the Wends. To the south of the Sorabi, behind the
                    Bohemian Forest, were the Czechs of Bohemia and Moravia. All these Slavonic
                    tribes Charles the Great had either thoroughly subdued or made tributary; and of
                    course Louis the German claimed supremacy over them. But it was hard to make his
                    claims good. While he was a very young ruler, a vigorous duke—Moimir—acquired a
                    position of great power among the Moravians. Soon after the signing of the
                    treaty of Verdun, Louis, becoming alarmed at the growing influence of this
                    chief, advanced against him, and put in hia place a chief named Rastislaus, on
                    whose allegiance he thought he could rely. But on his way back he was defeated
                    by the Bohemians, who were on good terms with the Moravians. From this time the
                    Moravians were a source of incessant anxiety to him. Rastislaus extended his
                    kingdom far to the east, and formed alliances with the Bulgarians and even with
                    the Byzantine emperor; at the same time he stirred up the Bohemians and the
                    Sorabi against Louis, and built strong fortresses on his western frontier. This
                    gallant chief, after much fighting, at last fell into the hands of his enemies,
                    who put out his eyes, and caused him to end his <pb break="no"

                    Suatopluk, was not less energetic, and Louis was never able to overmaster
                    him.</p>
                <p>The emperor Lothair’s successor in the empire was his eldest son Louis II., who
                    received as his kingdom the Frankish possessions in Italy. After his death
                    Charles the Bald adroitly managed to secure the imperial crown. This happened in
                    875, almost immediately before the death of Louis the German. Having succeeded
                    so easily in regard to the supreme title, Charles fancied he might be able to
                    unite the whole empire under his rule. But Louis had divided Germany between his
                    three sons, Carlman, Louis, and Charles; and the second of these met Charles the
                    Bald on the field of Andernach, and by a decided victory convinced the West
                    Franks that it was useless to hope for dominion east of the Rhine. The same son
                    of Louis the German forced Charles the Bald to give up such portions of Lorraine
                    as had been ceded to him by the treaty of Mersen, so that the right of
                    possessing the whole of this important territory, which included the best part
                    of what had been Austrasia, was vindicated for the Germans. The two eldest sons
                    of Louis soon died, and the kingdom passed into the hands of the youngest,
                    Charles the Fat, a prince of indolent habits and feeble mind. He crossed the
                    Alps, however, and was crowned emperor; and, as the Northmen were at this time
                    tormenting the West-Frankish kingdom, and no descendant of Charles the Bald was
                    fit to cope with them, Charles the Fat was invited to become king of the West
                    Franks. He thus ruled, with the exception of Burgundy, which at this time became
                    an independent state, the whole empire of Charles the Great; but the mighty
                    fabric could not exist without the genius which had built it up. In Germany also
                    the Northmen had made themselves more and more troublesome. Time after time
                    their skiffs had penetrated far up the Rhine; they had plundered Cologne and
                    Treves, and fed their horses over the grave of the great Charles himself, in his
                    own beautiful basilica. His degenerate great-grandson adopted the policy of
                    buying them off, and when he reached Paris, to the disgust of his subjects, he
                    pursued the same course. It happened that his brother Carlman had left an
                    illegitimate son, Arnulf, whom he had made ruler of Carinthia, a country lying
                    to the east of Bavaria. This young noble, who inherited the undaunted spirit of
                    his forefathers, was indignant at the cowardice of his uncle; and when the
                    latter, in 887, summoned an assembly in Tribur, Arnulf, instead of obeying the
                    summons, marched at the head of a powerful army against the emperor. Deserted
                    even by his ministers, and unable to offer the smallest resistance, Charles was
                    dethroned, and in a week or two afterwards died; and Arnulf, notwithstanding his
                    illegitimacy, became king. For some time after this, Germany was still called
                    East Francia, and the western kingdom West Francia, but they never again had a
                    common ruler; they were now in all respects separate, independent states. The
                    empire of Charles the Great had fallen to pieces.</p>
                <p>Arnulf, following the example of Charles the Fat, went to Rome and was made
                    emperor. He could exercise but little authority in Italy, however, and soon
                    returned. In 890 the Northmen desolated the valleys of the Meuse and the
                    Moselle, and Arnulf, instead of buying them off, sent against them a powerful
                    army. As it was defeated, he himself took the command in the following year. The
                    Northmen occupied a strongly entrenched camp near Louvain; and Arnulf’s force,
                    consisting mainly of cavalry, seemed to be quite powerless. Leaping from his
                    horse, he induced his men to fight beside him on foot; and they were so
                    stimulated by his valour that for the first time the dreaded enemy fled, leaving
                    thousands of bodies on the field. They never returned in such numbers as to be
                    again a national peril. The emperor had also to wage war with the Moravians, but
                    his efforts here were not crowned with like success. By this time the fierce and
                    warlike Magyars had become a terror to eastern Europe, and it occurred to Arnulf
                    to ask for their alliance. They gladly assented; and with their help he overcame
                    one of the three reigning sons of Suatopluk, and contrived to detach from
                    Moravia the Bohemians, the Sorabi, and other Slavs whom Suatopluk had joined to
                    his kingdom. But at the time of his death, in 899, he had not succeeded in
                    breaking up the state established by this powerful warrior and his
                    predecessor.</p>
                <p>During the nominal reign of Louis the Child—the last of the Carolingian dynasty
                    in Germany (899-911)—the German people passed through one of the darkest periods
                    of their history; for when the Magyars heard that Arnulf had been succeeded by a
                    child, they swept into Germany in vast numbers, and fearful was the havoc they
                    caused in every part of the kingdom. At such a time as this it happened that
                    there was no leader around whom the nation could rally; it was virtually
                    defenceless, and year after year savage hordes returned, bearing away with them
                    as much plunder as they could carry, and driving before them as many prisoners
                    as they could control. Where the Northmen had whipped with cords, these
                    barbarians lashed with scorpions.</p>
                <p>During the wars with the Magyars, the Northmen, and the Slavs, feudalism made
                    rapid advances in Germany. Even in the days of Louis the German and Arnulf it
                    was impossible for the sovereign to protect at all times every part of the
                    kingdom. The people themselves were obliged to rise against their enemies, and,
                    as in old times, they appointed herzogs or dukes for special warlike
                    expeditions. These leaders, being chosen from the ancient ducal families,
                    naturally began to think of restoring the power of which their fathers had been
                    deprived; and, as there never was more urgent need of strong local rulers, they
                    found no great difficulty in gratifying their ambition. The first reigning duke
                    of whom we hear is Otto of Saxony, a country not only liable, like the rest of
                    Germany, to the attacks of the Magyars, but specially exposed to the
                    Scandinavian sea-robbers and the northern Slavs. This duke ruled over both
                    Saxony and Thuringia. Soon afterwards we hear also of dukes in Bavaria, in
                    Swabia, in Lorraine, and last of all, in Franconia. Having unusual opportunities
                    of acquiring new lands, the dukes increased their power by granting them as
                    fiefs to vassals on whom they could depend; and many independent landowners were
                    glad to obtain their protection by offering them homage. Multitudes of the
                    humbler class of freemen either were forced to change the tenure of their
                    possessions into a feudal tenure, or did so in order to escape from still
                    greater evils. Thus, when Louis the Child died, the feudal tenure of land was
                    the prevailing system in nearly all parts of the country. Even those who held
                    their offices and lands immediately of the monarch, like the dukes themselves,
                    might still, in theory, be deprived of both; but in reality they asserted almost
                    complete independence, rendering only such service to their lord as he could
                    force from them, or as suited their convenience. The royal authority, nominally
                    great, had become but a shadow of the authority exercised by the early
                    Carolingian kings.</p>
                <p>Had Germany had no powerful external enemy, it is probable that it would now have
                    lost the slight measure of unity to which it had attained. While Louis lived,
                    the dukes were virtually kings in their duchies; and their natural tendency
                    would have been to make themselves absolute rulers. But, threatened as they were
                    by the Magyars, with the Slavs and Northmen always ready to take advantage of
                    their weakness, they could not afford to do without a central government.
                    Accordingly the nobles assembled at Forchheim, and by the advice of Otto, the
                    aged duke of Saxony, Conrad <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n499/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0499-0482"/> of Franconia was raised to the throne (911-918).
                    He had some excellent qualities, and in quieter times would have done good
                    service to Germany; but he was rash and impulsive, and far too ready to submit
                    to priestly influence. The dukes of Bavaria, Swabia, and Lorraine were not
                    present at his election; and the choice displeased them, probably because he was
                    likely to prove considerably more powerful than they wished. Rather than
                    acknowledge him, the duke of Lotharingia or Lorraine transferred his allegiance
                    to Charles the Simple of France; and it was in vain that Conrad protested and
                    despatched armies into Lorraine. With the help of the French king the duke
                    maintained his ground, and, for the time, his country was lost to Germany.
                    Bavaria and Swabia yielded, but, mainly through the fault of the king himself,
                    their submission was of brief duration. The rise of the dukes had been watched
                    with extreme jealousy by the leading prelates. They saw that the independence
                    they had hitherto enjoyed would be much more imperilled by powerful local
                    governors than by a sovereign who necessarily regarded it as part of his duty to
                    protect the church. Hence they had done everything they could to prevent the
                    dukes from extending their authority, and as the government was carried on
                    during the reign of Louis the Child mainly by Hatto, archbishop of Mainz, they
                    had been able to throw considerable obstacles in the way of their rivals. They
                    now induced Conrad to force a quarrel both upon Swabia and upon Bavaria, and the
                    result was a series of wars in which he had only partial success. What was
                    incomparably worse, his clerical advisers involved him in a struggle with Henry,
                    duke of Saxony, son of the duke to whom he chiefly owed his crown. Henry was a
                    man of great personal charm, a just ruler, strong, and brave. The Saxon people
                    were devoted to him; and his influence over them was intensified by the virtues
                    of his beautiful wife, to whom he was known to be passionately attached. Conrad
                    committed a profound mistake in making an enemy of a man like this; and he lived
                    to repent his error. On his death-bed he recommended the Franconian nobles to
                    offer the crown to Henry, whom, with fine generosity, he recognized as the only
                    man in the kingdom who could cope with the anarchy by which he had himself been
                    baffled.</p>
                <p>The nobles of Franconia acted upon the advice of their chief and king, and the
                    Saxons were very willing that the duke they loved so well should rise to still
                    higher honours. Henry I. (918-936) was one of the best kings Germany ever had, a
                    born statesman and warrior. His ambition was of the noblest order, for he sank
                    his personal interests in the cause of his country; and he knew exactly when to
                    attain his objects by force, and when by calmness and moderation." By wise
                    concessions he almost immediately overcame the opposition of the dukes of Swabia
                    and Bavaria; and some time later, taking advantage of the troubled state of
                    France, he accepted the homage of the duke of Lorraine, which for many centuries
                    afterwards remained a part of the German kingdom.</p>
                <p>Having established internal order, Henry was able to turn to matters of even more
                    pressing moment. In the very first year of his reign the terrible Magyars, who
                    had continued to scourge Germany during the reign of Conrad, broke into Saxony
                    and plundered the land almost without hindrance. In 924 they returned, and this
                    time, by good fortune, one of their greatest princes fell into the hands of the
                    Germans. Henry restored him to his countrymen on condition that they should
                    agree to a truce of nine years; and he had the courage to undertake to pay,
                    during this period, yearly tribute. The heedless barbarians accepted his terms,
                    and faithfully kept their word in regard to the immediate lands of Henry,
                    although Bavaria, Swabia, and Franconia they occasionally invaded as before. He
                    made admirable use of the opportunity he had secured, confining his efforts to
                    Saxony and Thuringia, the only parts of Germany over which he had strong
                    control. In the southern and western German lands, towns and fortified places
                    had long existed; but in the north, where Roman influence had but feebly
                    extended, and where even the· Franks had not exercised much authority until the
                    time of Charles the Great, the people still lived as in ancient times either on
                    solitary farms or in exposed villages. Such fortresses as Charles had built had
                    been for the most part destroyed in the wars after his time, and almost the only
                    attempts at fortification were to be found around the towers or castles of the
                    great nobles, and the dwellings of the leading churchmen. Henry saw that, while
                    this state of things lasted, the population could never be safe, and began in
                    earnest the construction of fortresses and walled towns. Of every group of nine
                    men one was compelled to devote himself to this work, while the remaining eight
                    cultivated his fields, and allowed a third of their produce to be stored against
                    times of trouble. The necessities of military discipline were next attended to.
                    Hitherto the Germans had fought mainly on foot, and, as the Magyars came on
                    horseback, the nation was placed at an immense disadvantage. A powerful force of
                    cavalry was now raised, while at the same time the infantry were drilled in new
                    and more effective modes of fighting. Although these preparations were carried
                    on directly under Henry’s supervision only in Saxony and Thuringia, the
                    neighbouring dukes knew what he was doing, and were stimulated to follow his
                    example. When he concluded that he was almost ready, he made use of his new
                    troops, before turning them against their chief enemy, the Magyars, to punish
                    refractory Slavonic tribes; and at this time he brought under temporary
                    subjection nearly all the Slavs between the Elbe and the Oder. He proceeded also
                    against the Bohemians, whoso duke was compelled to do homage.</p>
                <p>At the expiry of the truce the Magyar messengers came as usual for their tribute.
                    They were sent away empty handed, whereupon a vast body of invaders crossed as
                    in former years the frontier of Thuringia. Henry prudently waited until dearth
                    of provisions forced the enemy to divide into two bands. He then swept down upon
                    the weaker force, annihilated it, and rapidly advanced against the remaining
                    portion of the army. The second battle was more severe than the first, but not
                    less decisive. The Magyars, unable to cope with a disciplined army, were cut
                    down in great numbers, and those who survived rode in wild terror from the
                    field. The exact scenes of these conflicts are not known, but few more important
                    battles have ever been fought. The power of the Magyars was not indeed
                    destroyed, but it was broken, and the way was prepared for the effective
                    liberation of Germany from an intolerable plague. While the Magyars had been
                    troubling Germany on the east and south, the Danes had been irritating her on
                    the north. Charles the Great had established a march between the Eider and the
                    Schlei; but in course of time the Danes had not only seized this territory, but
                    had driven the German population beyond the Elbe. The Saxons had been slowly
                    reconquering the lost ground, and now Henry, advancing with his victorious army
                    into Jutland, forced Gorm, the Danish king, to become his vassal. The German
                    lands were given back, and it is probable that the march of Schleswig was at
                    this time instituted.</p>
                <p>When this great king died, every land inhabited by a German population formed
                    part of the kingdom, and none of the duchies were at war either with him or
                    among themselves. Along the northern and eastern frontier were tributary races,
                    and the country was for the time rid of an enemy which, for nearly a generation,
                    had kept it in perpetual fear. Vast as were these results, perhaps Henry did
                    even greater service in beginning the growth of towns <pb break="no"

                    merely making them places of defence, he decreed that they should be centres for
                    the adminstration of justice, and that in them should be held all public
                    festivities and ceremonies; he also instituted town markets, and encouraged
                    traders to take advantage of the opportunities provided for them. A strong check
                    was thus imposed upon the tendency of freemen to become the vassals of great
                    lords. This movement was made so powerful by the troubles of the epoch that, had
                    no other current of influence set in, the entire class of freemen must soon have
                    disappeared. As they now knew that they could in the last resort find protection
                    without looking to a superior, they had less temptation to give up their
                    independence, and many of them settled in the towns, where they could be safe
                    and free. Besides maintaining a manly spirit in the population, the towns
                    rapidly added to their importance by the stimulus they gave to all kinds of
                    industry and trade.</p>
                <p>Before his death, Henry obtained the promise of the nobles at a national assembly
                    or diet in Erfurt to recognize his son Otto as his successor, and the promise
                    was kept. Otto I. (936-973) began his reign under the most favourable
                    circumstances. He was twenty-four years of age, and to so high a pitch of honour
                    had Henry raised the crown that, at the coronation festival, which was of
                    unprecedented splendour, the dukes performed for the first time the nominally
                    menial offices known as the arch offices of the German kingdom. These peaceful
                    relations soon came to an end. It was Henry’s aim to establish the dukes in
                    their rights, maintaining the royal authority rather by moral influence than by
                    force. Otto, who was of haughty temper, despotic, and ambitious, seems early to
                    have resolved that the dukes should act in the strictest sense as his vassals,
                    or lose their dignities. At the time of his coronation Germany was virtually a
                    federal state; he wished to transform it into a firm and compact monarchy. This
                    policy speedily led to a formidable rebellion, headed by Thankmar, the king’s
                    half-brother, a fierce warrior, who fancied that he had a prior claim to the
                    crown, and who had managed to secure a number of followers in Saxony. He was
                    joined by the dukes of Franconia and Bavaria; and it was only by the aid of the
                    duke of Swabia, whom the duke of Franconia had offended, that the rising was put
                    down. A second rebellion, led by Otto’s brother Henry, was supported, among
                    other nobles, by the dukes of Franconia and Lorraine. Otto again triumphed, and
                    derived immense advantages from his success. The duchy of Franconia he kept in
                    his own hands, and he granted Lorraine to Conrad, an energetic and honourable
                    count, whom he still further attached by promising him his daughter to wife.
                    Bavaria, on the death of its duke, was placed under Henry, who, having been
                    pardoned, had become a loyal subject and friend of his brother. The duchy of
                    Swabia was also brought into Otto’s family by the marriage of his son Ludolf
                    with the duke's daughter. By these means he made himself master of the kingdom,
                    as none of his immediate predecessors had been. For the time, feudalism in truth
                    meant that lands and offices were held on condition of service; the king was the
                    genuine ruler, not only of freemen but of the highest vassals in the nation.</p>
                <p>In the midst of his troubles at home Otto had brought fresh perplexities upon
                    himself by intriguing in the West-Frankish kingdom against “Louis d’Outremer.”
                    Louis responded with unexpected vigour, giving the signal for the second rising
                    against Otto by invading Alsace. He also asserted a claim to Lorraine. When
                    peace had been restored in Germany, Otto penetrated far into France, and
                    received the homage of “Hugh the Great,” his son-in-law; but he soon returned,
                    and afterwards used his great influence in favour of Louis against his
                    rebellious nobles. Much more important than Otto’s doings in France were his
                    wars with his northern and eastern neighbours. The duke of Bohemia, after a long
                    struggle, was brought to submission. Among the Slavs between the Elbe and the
                    Oder the king was represented by Margrave Gero, one of his most important
                    vassals, a warrior well fitted for the rough work he had to do, loyal to his
                    sovereign, but capable of any treachery towards his enemies, and sometimes
                    guilty of outrageous harshness. This remarkable man conquered most of the
                    country north of Bohemia between the Oder and the Upper and Middle Elbe.
                    Margrave Billung, who looked after the Abotrites at the Lower Elbe, was less
                    fortunate, mainly because of the neighbourhood of the Danes, who, after the
                    death of King Henry, often attacked the hated Germans. At last they made Billung
                    prisoner, and Otto himself had to proceed against them. Their king did him
                    homage, and he reestablished the march of Schleswig, after which the margrave
                    made rapid way among the Abotrites and Wends. Otto, having profound faith in the
                    power of the church to reconcile conquered peoples to his rule, provided for the
                    benefit of the Danes the bishoprics of Schleswig, Ripen, and Aarhuus; and among
                    those which he established for the Slavs was the important bishopric of
                    Brandenburg. In his later years he set up the archbishopric of Magdeburg, which
                    took in the sees of Meissen, Zeitz, and Merseburg.</p>
                <p>Having secured peace in Germany, and begun the real conquest of the border races,
                    Otto was by far the greatest sovereign in Europe; and, had he and his successors
                    refused to go beyond the limits within which he had hitherto acted, it is almost
                    certain they would have established a united monarchy. But a decision to which
                    Otto soon came deprived posterity of the results which might have sprung from
                    the policy of his earlier years. About this time Adelaide, the young and
                    beautiful widow of Lothair, son of King Hugh of Provence, having refused to
                    marry the son of Berengar, king of Lombardy, was cast into prison and cruelly
                    treated. She appealed to the mighty German sovereign, and the appeal not only
                    touched his sympathies, but awoke an overmastering ambition, since the way was
                    thus opened for a partial restoration of the Carolingian empire. At the head of
                    a great force, accompanied by his son Ludolf and many of his chief nobles, he
                    crossed the Alps in 951, and descended into Lombardy. He displaced Berengar, and
                    was so fascinated by Queen Adelaide that within a few weeks he married her.
                    Ludolf, who had received a promise of the German crown, saw his rights
                    threatened by this marriage, and returned sullenly to Germany. He went to an old
                    enemy of his father, the archbishop of Mainz, and the two plotted together
                    against the king, who, hearing of their proceedings, hastily departed, leaving
                    Duke Conrad of Lorraine to attend to Italy. Otto had already taken the title of
                    king of Italy, and Duke Henry, who hoped to obtain a large addition to his
                    duchy, joined Queen Adelaide in urging him to assert the claims of the old
                    Frankish sovereigns. Conrad, however, soon appeared with the intelligence that
                    he had restored the Italian kingdom to Berengar, although as a fief of the
                    German crown. This news being roughly received, Conrad took offence, and entered
                    into the conspiracy of Ludolf and the archbishop. Otto, who did not suspect how
                    deep were their designs, paid a visit to Mainz, and there was compelled to take
                    certain solemn pledges which, after his escape, he repudiated. War then broke
                    out, and the struggle was the ∣ most serious in which he had been engaged. In
                    Lorraine, of which Otto made his brother Bruno, archbishop of Cologne,
                    administrator, his cause was triumphant; but everywhere else dark clouds
                    gathered over his head. Henry of Bavaria was deserted by his vassals; in Swabia
                    <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> in Franconia, and even in Saxony, the native land
                    of the king, his own duchy, the majority sided with the rebels.</p>

                <p>It is extremely remarkable that the movement acquired so quickly this force and
                    volume. Tlιe explanation, according to some historians, is that the people
                    looked forward with alarm ιυ the union of Germany with Italy aud the empire.
                    There were still traditions of the hardships inflicted upon the common folk by
                    the vast expeditions of Charles the Great, and it is supposed that they
                    anticipated like evils in the event of his empire being once more set up.
                    Whether or not this be the true explanation, the power of Otto was shaken to its
                    foundations. At last he was saved by the presence of an immense external peril.
                    The Magyars were as usual stimulated to action by the disunion of their enemies;
                    and Conrad and Ludolf were guilty of the fatal crime and blunder of inviting
                    their co-operation. This baseness disgusted the Germans, many of whom fell away
                    from the enterprise, and rallied to the head and protector of the nation. In a
                    very short time Conrad and the archbishop of Mainz submitted; and although
                    Ludolf held out a little longer, he too broke down and entreated to be pardoned.
                    The archbishop was ordered to be closely confined in a monastery, and soon
                    afterwards died. Lorraine was given to Bruno; but Conrad, its former duke,
                    although thus punished, was not disgraced, for Otto had urgent need of his
                    services in the war with the Magyars. The great battle against them was fought
                    in 9Õ5 at the Lechfeld, near Augsburg. They had never before appeared in such
                    numbers, and there was a strong feeling on both sides that it was to be finally
                    settled whether the work of King Henry should be completed or wholly overthrown.
                    After a fierce and obstinate fight, in which Conrad with many other nobles fell,
                    the question was decided in favour of Germany and of Europe; the Magyars were
                    even more thoroughly scourged than in the battles in which Otto’s father had
                    given them their first real check. The deliverance of Germany was complete, and
                    from this time, notwithstanding certain wild raids towards the east, the Magyars
                    began to settle in the land they still occupy, and to adapt themselves to the
                    conditions of civilized life.</p>
                <p>Entreated by Pope John XII., who needed a helper against King Berengar, Otto went
                    a second time to Italy, in 962; and on this occasion he received from the pope
                    the imperial crown. He did not return to Germany for more than two years; and in
                    966 he was again in Italy, where he remained six years, exercising to the full
                    his imperial rights in regard to the papacy, but occupied mainly in an attempt
                    to make himself mister of the southern as well as of the northern half of the
                    peninsula.</p>
                <p>By far the most important act of Otto’s eventful life was his assumption of the
                    Lombard and the imperial crowns. His successors so steadily followed his example
                    that the sovereign crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle claimed as his right to be
                    afterwards crowmed in Milan and in Rome. Thus grew up the Holy Roman empire,
                    that strange state which, directly descending, through the empire of Charles the
                    Great, from the empire of the Caesars, contained so many elements foreign to
                    ancient life. We are here concerned with it only in so far as it affected
                    Germany. Germany itself never until our own day became an empire. It is true
                    that at last the Holy Roman empire was as a matter of fact confined to Germany;
                    but in theory it was something quite different. Like France, Germany was a
                    kingdom, but it differed from France in this, that its king was also king in
                    Italy and Roman emperor. As the latter title made him nominally the secular lord
                    of the world, it might have been expected to excite the pride of his German
                    subjects; and doubtless, after a time, they did learn to think highly of
                    themselves as the imperial race. But the evidence tends to show that at first
                    they had no wish for this honour, and would have much preferred had their ruler
                    limited himself strictly to his own people.</p>
                <p>There are signs that during Otto’s reign they began to have a distinct
                    consciousness of national life, their use of the word “deutsch” to indicate the
                    whole people being one of these symptoms. Their common sufferings, struggles,
                    and triumphs, however, account far more readily fur this feeling than the
                    supposition that they were elated by their king undertaking obligations which
                    took him for years together from his native land. So solemn were the
                    associations with the imperial title that, after acquiring it, Otto probably
                    looked for more intimate obedience from his subjects. They were willing enough
                    to admit its abstract claims; but in the world of feudalism there was a
                    multitude of established customs and rights which rudely conflicted with them,
                    and in action, remote and abstract considerations gave way before concrete and
                    present realities. Instead of strengthening the allegiance of the Germans
                    towards their sovereign, the imperial title was the means of steadily
                    undermining it. To the connexion of their kingdom with the empire they owe the
                    fact that for centuries they were the most divided of European nations, and that
                    they have only now begun to create a genuinely united state. France was made up
                    of a number of loosely connected lands, each with its own lord, when Germany,
                    under Otto, was to a large extent moved by a single will, well organized, and
                    strong. But the attention of the French kings was concentrated on their
                    immediate interests, and in course of time they brought their unruly vassals to
                    order. The German kings, as emperors, had duties which often took them away for
                    long periods from Germany. This alone would have shaken their authority, for,
                    during their absence, the great vassals seized rights which it was afterwards
                    difficult to recover. But the emperors were not merely absent, they had to
                    engage in struggles in which they exhausted the energies necessary to enforce
                    obedience at home; and, in order to obtain help, they were sometimes glad to
                    concede advantages to which, under other conditions, they would have tenaciously
                    clung. Moreover, the greatest of all their struggles was with the papacy; so
                    that a power outside their kingdom, but exercising immense influence within it,
                    was in the end always prepared to weaken them by exciting dissension among their
                    people. Thus the imperial crown was the most fatal gift that could have been
                    offered to the German kings; apparently giving them all things, it deprived them
                    of nearly everything. And in doing this, it inflicted on many generations
                    incalculable aud needless suffering.</p>
                <p>By the policy of his later years Otto did much to prepare the way for the process
                    of disintegration which he rendered inevitable by restoring the empire. With the
                    kingdom divided into five great duchies, the sovereign could always have
                    maintained at least so much unity as King Henry secured; and, as the experience
                    of Otto himself showed, therewi&gt;uld have beenchances of much greater
                    centralization. Yet he threw away this advantage. Lorraine was divided into two
                    duchies, Upper Lorraine and Lower Lorraine. In each duchy of the kingdom he
                    appointed a palsgrave, whose duty was to maintain royal rights; and after
                    Margrave Gero died, his territory was divided into several marches, and placed
                    under six margraves, each with the same powers as Gero, and having extensive
                    lands. Otto gave up the practice of retaining the duchies either in his own
                    hands or in those of relatives. Even Saxony, his native duchy, and the chief
                    source of his strength, was given to Margrave Billung, whose family long
                    afterwards kept it. As a set-off to the power of the princes—for the reigning
                    immediate vassals of the crown ranked as princes—Otto, especially after he
                    became emperor and looked upon himself as the protector of the church, immensely
                    increased the importance of the prelates. They received great gifts of land,
                    were endowed with jurisdiction in criminal as well as civil cases, and obtained
                    several other valuable sovereign rights. The <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0502-0485"/> emperor’s idea was that, as church lands and
                    offices could not be hereditary, their holders would necessarily favour the
                    crown. But he forgot that the church had a head beyond Germany, and that the
                    passion for the rights of an order may be not less intense than that for the
                    rights of a family. While the empire was at peace with the popes, the prelates
                    did strongly uphold it, and their influence was unquestionably, on the whole,
                    higher than that of rude secular nobles. But with the empire and the papacy in
                    conflict, they could not but abide, as a rule, by the authority which had the
                    most sacred claims to their loyalty. From all these circumstances it curiously
                    happened that the sovereign who did more than almost any other to raise the
                    royal power, was also the sovereign who, more than any other, wrought its
                    decay.</p>
                <p>Otto II. (973-983) had been crowned king and co-imperator in his father’s
                    lifetime. His troubles began within a year in Bavaria, which was now a very
                    great duchy, not only including the valley of the Inn, but reaching up along the
                    western frontier of Bohemia and the eastern frontiers of Swabia and Franconia as
                    far as the Bohemian Forest. Henry, the brother of Otto I., had died soon after
                    the battle of the Lechfeld, and had been succeeded by a young son, who, as he
                    grew up, showed himself of so contentious a disposition that he was known as
                    Henry the Wrangler. This young duke’s sister had married the aged duke of
                    Swabia, over whom she had absolute control, so that the younger branch of the
                    house of Saxony had acquired an importance which the emperor could not affect to
                    ignore. Taking offence at some action of Otto’s, Henry the Wrangler conspired
                    against him and rebelled. This first rebellion was easily put down, but Henry
                    soon escaped from the imprisonment to which he was condemned, and then Bavaria
                    was the scene of a war which gave occasion to great bloodshed. When at last
                    Henry was overcome, his duchy was taken from him and granted to one of the
                    emperor’s cousins, a son of Ludolf, who had caused so much anxiety to Otto I. As
                    this prince had already received Swabia, Otto was able, without seeming to be
                    harsh, to deprive Bavaria of some of its importance. The southern part,
                    Carinthia, which had hitherto been a march, was separated from it and made a
                    duchy; and the eastern march, Austria, was also taken away, and formally made
                    over to Liutpold, of the Babenberg family, who had already ruled it for some
                    time, and had proved himself a faithful vassal. Another member of the same house
                    was invested with the Nordgau, a part of Bavaria to the north of the Danube,
                    which formed a sort of wedge between Bohemia on the one hand and Franconia and
                    Swabia on the other. Having arrived at this settlement, Otto went to chastise
                    the unruly Bohemians; but while he was away war was begun behind him by the new
                    duke of Carinthia, who, forgetful of the benefits he had just received, rose to
                    avenge the wrongs of his friend Duke Henry. The emperor hastily concluded peace
                    with Bohemia, the duke of which did him homage; and the rising was quickly put
                    down. Henry was made over to the keeping of the bishop of Utrecht, and Carinthia
                    received another duke.</p>
                <p>In his anxiety to obtain southern Italy, Otto I. had secured, as wife for his
                    successor, Theophano, daughter of the Byzantine emperor, to whom southern Italy
                    belonged. Otto II., having all his father’s ambition with much of his strength
                    and haughtiness, and being in the full flush of youth, longed to get away from
                    Germany and to claim these remote possessions. But he was detained for some time
                    by a sudden and unscrupulous invasion of Lower Lorraine in 978 by Lothair, king
                    of France. So stealthily did the invader advance that the emperor and empress,
                    who happened at the time to be at Aix-la-Chapelle, had just time to escape
                    before the town was seized. As quickly as possible Otto placed himself at the
                    head of a great army, and marched to Paris. The approach of winter compelled him
                    to return without taking the city, which was well fortified; but soon afterwards
                    Lothair gave up all claim to Lorraine, and peace was restored. At this time
                    Lower Lorraine, which Otto I. had added to the crown lands, was held as a <hi
                    rend="superscript"> f</hi> fief of the German sovereign by King Lothair’s
                    brother Charles, the last of the Carolings, whose claims to the Frenchſth'r'óñe
                    were afterwards put aside in favour of Hugh the Great'.</p>
                <p>At last Otto was able to fulfil the wish of his heart, and he did not again see
                    Germany. His claims to southern Italy were vehemently opposed; and in 982 he
                    suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Greek emperor’s'subjects and
                    their allies, the Saracens of Sicily,—saving his life by a romantic adventure.
                    The tidings of this crushing blow cast gloom over Germany, and in the north and
                    east the Danes and Slavs, as if the spell by which the first Otto had held them
                    was broken, attacked the Germans with an audacity and a determination they had
                    never before displayed. With the Danes the Saxons were able to cope; but the
                    Slavs, who vehemently detested the German yoke, fought with such desperate
                    courage that much of the work effected by Margraves Billung and Gero was
                    altogether undone. They had seemed to be decisively conquered, but two centuries
                    passed before they were beaten back to the position to which they had been
                    reduced in the previous reign. Such were the first fruits of the assumption of
                    the imperial title.</p>
                <p>About a year before his sudden death in Borne, Otto held a diet in Verona which
                    was attended by the German princes. They would not help him in his Italian
                    enterprise, which was extremely unpopular; but they consented to recognize his
                    infant son Otto as his successor. This child they took back with them to
                    Germany, and after the emperor’s death he was crowned in Aix-la-Chapelle. Henry
                    the Wrangler, as his near relative, was released from confinement and made hi is
                    guardian; but as this restless prince soon showed an inclination to secure the
                    crown for himself, the infant king was taken from him and placed under the
                    charge of his mother Theophano. Afterwards, when she died, he lived with his
                    grandmother, the empress Adelaide. While these two-ladies acted, one after the
                    other, as regent, the chief functions of government were discharged by Willigis,
                    archbishop of Mainz, a vigorous prelate who had risen from a humble rank to the
                    highest position in the German Church. He was aided by the princes of the state,
                    each of whom claimed to have a voice in the supreme administration. Under these
                    conditions vigorous rule was impossible; so that during the minority of Otto the
                    royal authority was greatly weakened. In Bavaria, after the death of Henry the
                    Wrangler, the higher vassals, without waiting for the appointment of a duke,
                    returned to the ancient German custom, and elected Henry’s son. A similar
                    election took place in Thuringia, the head of which, although not a duke, ranked
                    with the chief aristocracy. And along the coasts of Friesland was formed a
                    virtually free state, which was at a later time'the scene of a long-continued
                    contest between the Frieslanders and the powerful counts of Holland. At the age
                    of fifteen Otto III. (983-1002) was declared to have reached his majority. He
                    had been so carefully trained in all the ìeaTn-ing of the age that he was called
                    “the wonder of the world,” and a certain fascination still attaches to his
                    imaginative^ although somewhat fantastic, nature. His mother having imbued him
                    with the extravagant conceptions of the Byzantine emperors, he introduced into
                    his court an amount of splendour and ceremonial that had hitherto been unknown
                    in western Europe. Most of his time he spent in Rome, and here he cherished a
                    vast scheme by which he was tb <hi rend="superscript"> ,r</hi> do* much more
                    than recall the empire of Charles the GreâtVn’ its whole extent. As the heir of
                    the Western emperors, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n503/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0503-0486"/> the grandson of an Eastern emperor, he fancied
                    that he might unite the entire known world under his rule. Rome was to be its
                    centre, and Germany but a province. In this vague design he was warmly
                    encouraged by Gerbert, the greatest scholar of the day, whom, as Silvester II.,
                    he raised to the papal see. Silvester saw that in such an empire, with such an
                    emperor, it would not be difficult for the papacy to become the real source of
                    influence. Meanwhile Germany suffered severely from internal disorder and from
                    the inroads of her rude neighbours; and when, in the year 1000—a year which
                    Otto, with many others, feared might see the end of the world—he visited his
                    northern kingdom, there were eager hopes that he would smite the national
                    enemies with something of the vigour of his predecessors. But the imperial
                    dreamer found it more interesting to go to Aix-la-Chapelle, and to descend into
                    the tomb of the mighty Charles, beside whose gorgeously arrayed body, as it sat
                    on its marble throne, he gave free scope to his fancy,—apparently under the
                    strange impression that his was a spirit akin to that of the worldly and
                    resolute conqueror. One practical step he did take, but it was in a direction
                    contrary to that desired by his subjects. The Poles, of whom we hear first
                    during the reign of Otto I., and who inhabited the country immediately to the
                    east of the Oder, had since his time owed a vague allegiance to the Germans.
                    They were now ruled by Boleslaus, a chief of an aggressive and determined
                    spirit, who by ostentatious loyalty gained the goodwill of Otto III. The latter
                    commissioned him to conquer the Pomeranians, a duty which he gladly and
                    effectually discharged, adding to the Pomeranians the Prussians and some of the
                    Bohemians. The large state thus formed the emperor made independent of Germany,
                    probably in the hope that it might form the centre for a province of his future
                    empire. Its Christian missions were severed from the church of Germany and
                    formed into a new Polish church; and the emperor himself founded the head see at
                    Gnesen, where his friend Adalbert had met a martyr’s death. This was done with
                    the sanction of Pope Silvester, who at the same time established an independent
                    national church in Hungary, and encouraged Stephen to become the first Magyar
                    king, by sending him from Rome a golden crown.</p>
                <p>Otto’s magnificent plans received a fatal shock from the insubordination of the
                    Romans, for whose city he designed so much honour. When he died, perhaps by
                    poison, there was no representative of the elder branch of the Saxon family, and
                    several candidates came forward for the throne. Henry II. (1002-1024), son and
                    successor of Henry the Wrangler, and therefore the great-grandson of King Henry
                    I. by a younger line, managed to reach Aix-la-Chapelle before his chief rival,
                    the duke of Swabia, and was there crowned. As he had not been elected, he was
                    obliged to humble himself by going about among the princes and entreating their
                    allegiance. His shattered health, querulous temper, and abject submission to
                    priestly influence unfitted him for the great position to which he had raised
                    himself, and his reign was an unfortunate one for Germany. For ten years civil
                    war raged in Lorraine; in Saxony, too, torrents of blood were shed in petty
                    quarrels. Hitherto it had been the right of the crown, when a duke or other
                    prince died, to appoint his successor; and obviously no royal right was of
                    greater importance. In Henry’s time the principle of inheritance was virtually
                    established in favour of the immediate vassals of the sovereign. He the more
                    willingly made this concession because of his extravagant generosity to the
                    church, in which, like Otto I., he ∣ooked for his main support. He had his
                    reward in the attachment of the papacy, by wſhich he was ultimately canonized;
                    but he succeeded no better than his predecessors in counterbalancing the secular
                    by the spiritual princes. In his foreign wars he was as little prosperous as in
                    his government at home. Boleslaus, who was now a powerful sovereign, had
                    conquered Bohemia and Lusatia; and so anxious was Henry to win back these lands
                    that, notwithstanding his Christian zeal, he obtained the alliance of certain
                    Slavonic tribes by undertaking that their religion should not be interfered
                    with. Bohemia and Lusatia were for a time detached from the Polish kingdom, but
                    they were reconquered, and after a war of fourteen years the Pole was a greater
                    ruler than ever. Henry went three times to Italy, and was crowned Lombard king
                    and emperor. Before he became emperor, in order to assert his right of
                    sovereignty over Rome, he called himself king of the Romans; and this was the
                    designation borne by his successors until they received the higher title from
                    the pope. Up to this time a sovereign crowned in Aix-la-Chapelle was simply
                    “king of the East Franks” or “king of the Franks and Saxons.”</p>
                <p>The great nobles now met at Oppenheim, and elected to the throne Conrad, a count
                    of Franconia. The dukes of Upper and Lower Lorraine, with a number of prelates,
                    opposed this choice; but their objections were overborne, and Conrad II.
                    (1024-39) seemed to have no reason to dread internal enemies. Very soon,
                    however, he had to battle with a formidable conspiracy, and during nearly his
                    whole reign he was exposed to dangers of this kind; for he was a masterful king,
                    looked with extreme jealousy on the rights the princes had acquired, and wished
                    his crown to be the symbol of a genuine central authority. He was remarkably
                    successful in contending with rebellion; and the chief cause of his success was
                    that he allied himself with a powerful force, the significance of which had not
                    been detected by previous sovereigns. Hitherto the vassals of great lords— the
                    mediate nobles—had been very much at the mercy of their superiors. Conrad,
                    seeing that he and they had a common danger, made them more independent. It was
                    not until nearly the end of his reign that he issued his famous edict in Italy,
                    decreeing that no fief-holder should be deprived of his fief without judgment of
                    his peers; but he carried out this policy from the beginning in Germany, and
                    even from the judgment of a fief-holder’s peers there was a right of appeal to
                    the royal tribunals. The result of this policy was that the inferior
                    fief-holders were unwilling to follow their lords against the king. Thus when
                    Duke Ernest of Swabia, his stepson, rose against him,and appealed to his men, as
                    in old times, to make his cause their own, they refused, urging that the
                    sovereign was the supreme protector of their liberties. Conrad soon revealed
                    that his object was the same as that which Otto I. long pursued,—not to do away
                    with the duchies, but to get them, if possible, under his immediate control. The
                    principle of inheritance he extended to the throne; and in his case it was
                    recognized, his son Henry being crowned as his successor soon after he himself
                    became king. To young King Henry he granted Bavaria in fief, when the reigning
                    duke, by rising against him, forfeited his title; and afterwards, despite the
                    bitter opposition of the nobles, he invested the same prince with Swabia, the
                    ducal family of which died out. Carinthia, being vacant, was given to Conrad’s
                    nephew. As Franconia ever since the time of Otto had remained in the hands of
                    the sovereign, Saxony, Thuringia, and the two Lorraines were the only duchies of
                    which Conrad was not more or less master.</p>
                <p>When Conrad mounted the throne, the safety of Germany was endangered from three
                    different points. On the north Denmark was ruled by Canute, the great English
                    sovereign; on the east was the wide Polish state, whose sovereign Boleslaus
                    crowned himself king, and still had possession of Bohemia and Lusatia; to the
                    south-east was Hungary, which, under Stephen I., was rapidly becoming an
                    organized and formidable power. Conrad was prudent enough to ask <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n504/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0504-0487"/> in marriage for his son Henry Canute’s daughter;
                    and in return he ceded to Denmark the march of Schleswig. The Danes thus became
                    the friends of the Germans, and were of service to them in keeping down the
                    Wends. With Hungary, Conrad waged war, but not successfully, for, although a
                    statesman, he appears to have been no great general. He was more fortunate in
                    Poland; Boleslaus having died, the Poles plunged into a furious civil war, and
                    he was able to turn their disunion to his own advantage. Moreover, a youthful
                    hero, Breteslaus, an illegitimate son of the duke of Bohemia, having carried
                    away from a convent a young German lady, a powerful noble’s daughter, whom he
                    passionately loved, and who had unbounded influence over him, was induced to
                    place his sword at the disposal of Conrad, and by a single raid he drove the
                    Poles from Lusatia. Lusatia and Bohemia were thus restored to Germany, and the
                    Polish ruler, who now claimed no higher title than duke, did homage to Conrad
                    for his lands.</p>
                <p>In Italy Conrad was ill received, for although as emperor aud Lombard king he was
                    its lawful sovereign, the Germans were still looked upon as intruders, and by
                    force alone they could maintain their rights. The event which at the time threw
                    most lustre on his reign was his acquisition of the kingdom of Burgundy or
                    Arles. It was bequeathed to him by Rudolf III., whose niece Gisela was Conrad’s
                    wife. In 1032 he was crowned, and was at once recognized by the German-speaking
                    population. The others resisted, but in two years all opposition had been
                    overcome, and he received in Geneva the homage of the leading southern nobles.
                    This beautiful kingdom was full of prosperous cities, and its possession seemed
                    to add incalculably to the power of the German kings; but in the end it proved
                    an occasion of humiliation rather than of strength.</p>
                <p>Henry III. (1039-56), who had been crowned, while his father was alive, king of
                    Burgundy as well as of Germany, had none of the rudeness and reckless
                    impulsiveness which marred Conrad’s great qualities; but he had the same
                    decisive judgment, far-reaching ambition, and irresistible will. In the later
                    years of Conrad, Breteslaus, the young Bohemian prince who had served him so
                    well in Lusatia, having succeeded his father as duke of Bohemia, waged war in
                    his own interest against the disunited Poles, and easily brought their whole
                    state into subjection. As he showed signs of wishing to become an independent
                    sovereign, Henry invaded his territory, and so completely overcame him that he
                    appeared before the king in Ratisbon, barefooted and in a penitent’s garb. Henry
                    treated him generously, and was rewarded by receiving to the end of his reign
                    the service of a loyal vassal; and the young king also gained the good-will of
                    the Poles by placing over them their lawful prince, Casimir, who willingly did
                    homage for his land. The king of Denmark, too, acknowledged Henry as his feudal
                    lord. Moreover, by several campaigns in Hungary, forced upon him by the violence
                    of its king, Samuel, son-in-law of Stephen I., Henry brought that country for
                    the first time, but only temporarily, into the position of a fief of the German
                    crown. In Germany itself he acquired, during the first ten years of his reign,
                    an authority which had been unknown since the days of Otto I. His bitter enemy,
                    Duke Gottfried of Upper Lorraine, who conspired against him time after time, and
                    found powerful allies in certain Burgundian nobles and in the counts of Flanders
                    and of Holland, was beaten down; and he was able to dispense against the most
                    powerful princes the laws of the kingdom, and to force them to maintain the
                    public peace. Under this severe and beneficent rule Germany enjoyed a period of
                    internal quiet such as she had probably never before experienced. But even Henry
                    could not permanently divert from its course the central political tendency of
                    the age. The princes, convinced that his aim was to bring the duchies under his
                    direct authority, and thus to create a monarchy which should have but one head,
                    sullenly awaited their opportunity; and it came when, .in 1052, after a ten
                    months’ siege of Presburg, he was obliged to retreat precipitately from Hungary.
                    The influence of his great fame was shaken, and from this time he had to contend
                    against warlike nobles. On one occasion he found out, only through the death-bed
                    repentance of a rebel, that he was the object of a widespread conspiracy, which,
                    had he remained in ignorance, would inevitably have succeeded. Even the mediate
                    nobles, who had stood loyally by Conrad, were not his friends; for his wars made
                    serious demands upon them, and his administration of justice was often stricter
                    in regard to their class than they quite approved. Although at the time of his
                    death he was still one of the most powerful sovereigns who ever reigned in
                    Germany, he was obliged to adopt a conciliatory policy,—even Duke Gottfried,
                    after all his offences, being established in his duchy.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of Henry’s reign the church all over Europe was in a deplorable
                    condition. Simony in its basest forms was almost universally practised, and
                    morality among the clergy was at its lowest ebb. The papacy, too, had sunk into
                    a degraded state, its authority being annihilated, not only by the character of
                    successive popes, but by the fact that there were at the same time three
                    claimants of the Roman see. These evils were regarded with sorrow by Henry, who
                    was a man of sincere and rigorous piety. Associating himself with the reforming
                    movement which proceeded from Cluny, he not only commanded and pleaded with his
                    prelates to put an end to abuses, but resolved to strike the evil at its root by
                    stern exercise of his imperial rights. In 1046 he entered Rome at the head of an
                    army which had secured for him in northern Italy such respect as had been given
                    to noGerman ruler since Charles the Great, and summarily deposed the three popes
                    whose contentions had caused scandal throughout Christendom. He then raised to
                    the papal see the bishop of Bamberg as Clement II., who crowned him emperor; and
                    after Clement, when death made fresh appointments necessary, three other German
                    popes, Damasus II., Leo IX., and Victor II. Under these popes a new era began
                    for the church and for the papacy. Behind the two latter was the stern,
                    unfaltering, high-minded Hildebrand, who, as their adviser, silently prepared
                    the way for his own memorable term of rule. In thus reforming the papacy, Henry
                    III. fulfilled what was regarded as the noblest duty of his imperial office; but
                    he also sharpened a weapon whose keen edge was first tried against his son.</p>
                <p>The last years of Henry III. form a turning-point in German history. Great kings
                    and emperors came after him; but none of them possessed the direct, absolute
                    authority which he freely wielded; even in the case of the strongest, the forms
                    of feudalism more and more interposed themselves between the monarch and the
                    nation, and at last royal authority virtually altogether disappeared. The
                    process was hastened by the unfortunate fact that Henry III. was;succeeded by a
                    child. The infant king, Henry IV. (1056-1106), was at first in charge of his
                    mother, the empress Agnes, a lady of excellent qualities, but too gentle for a
                    position which demanded the exercise of stem virtues. Her rule was jealously
                    watched by Anno, archbishop of Cologne, a rigid churchman of imposing
                    personality, cold to the ordinary interests of the world, but passionately
                    devoted to his order. Discontented by the predominant influence of the bishop of
                    Augsburg at court, he managed, by a clever trick, to get possession of the king
                    and the insignia of royalty. Agnes, knowing his power, and deserted by her
                    friends, retired from the regency; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n505/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0505-0488"/> and Anno began forthwith to rule the state. By
                    and by he was compelled by the diet to share his duties with Adalbert,
                    archbishop of Bremen, who was not less ambitious than Anno, but was as gay,
                    sociable, and worldly as his rival was proud and morose. In the end Adalbert
                    made himself complete master of Henry, who thus grew up under the most diverse
                    influences. The young king was generous, and endowed with considerable
                    intellectual gifts; but, passing as he did from the gloomy palace in Cologne,
                    where he lived a monk’s life under terrible censors, to the palace in Bremen,
                    where he was petted and flattered, he became wayward and self-willed. He assumed
                    the duties of government at the age of fifteen, and soon made enemies of nearly
                    all the chief princes. In Saxony, where, like his father, he held his court, he
                    excited by a series of injudicious proceedings intense hostility. While the
                    Ottos were in pursuit of the imperial phantom, a number of the crown lands in
                    this duchy had been seized by nobles whose descendants now held them. Henry
                    insisted on restoring these; and, as Henry I. had taken possession of the
                    domains of his Carolingian predecessors, so Henry IV. claimed the domains of his
                    Saxon predecessors. As if this were not enough, he built a number of fortresses
                    which the free peasantry imagined were intended for prisons; he kept in
                    confinement the heir to the duchy, and he persistently spoke of the Saxons in a
                    tone of supreme contempt. All classes were thus combined against him; and in
                    1073 the universal discontent found expression in a vast popular assembly,
                    attended alike by freemen and by nobles, and in which—such was the gratitude of
                    the church for royal favours—a leading place was taken by the archbishop of
                    Magdeburg and by the bishop of Halbertstadt, the former the brother, the latter
                    the nephew, of Archbishop Anno. Henry was surprised by a band of rebels in his
                    fortress of Harzburg, near Goslar. Attended by a few followers he escaped, and
                    appealed to the princes for support; but he could;not compel their aid, and of
                    free will they would grant him nothing. After tedious and degrading
                    negotiations, in jwhich he was accused of every kind of crime, he was at last
                    Obliged to yield the demands of his enemies. As ½ése:démands did not include the
                    destruction of the fortresses, the peasants, fancying they were betrayed,
                    refused toιday down their arms, and stormed through the duchy, not' only
                    battering down the detested buildings, but even destroying the chapel of the
                    Harzburg fortress and committing acts of desecration with ruthless fury. This so
                    alarmed the princes, both spiritual and secular, that Henry was able to advance
                    with a large army into Saxony, where in 1075 he gained a decisive victory, and
                    re-established the authority of the crown.</p>
                <p>While Germany was in this confused state, Hildebrand had:become pope, as Gregory
                    VIL, and in 1075 he issued his'famous decree against the marriage of the clergy
                    and agáiíist their' investiture by laymen,—for boldness and vastness the most
                    magnificent policy ever devised, since, had it been effected, the pope must have
                    become the secular as well as the spiritual lord of Christendom. So quickly had
                    the reforming zeal of Henry III. made the papacy a power which threatened to
                    overshadow the world. To the decree as to investiture it was impossible for any
                    sovereign to submit, and in Germany there were stronger reasons than elsewhere
                    for resistance. Half the land of the country was held by the clergy, and most of
                    it had been granted to them because, in virtue of their feudal relation to the
                    sovereign, it was supposed that they would &lt;be his most efficient helpers.
                    Had the feudal tie been broken, the crown would soon have vanished, and the
                    constitution of mediaeval society must have undergone a radical change. Henry,
                    who had hitherto treated the new pope with excessive respect, and was believed
                    at the Vatican to have no strength of character, now announced nis intention of
                    going to Rome and assuming the imperial title. The pope, to whom the Saxons had
                    been encouraged to make complaint, responded by sending back certain messengers
                    of Henry’s, with the command that he should do penance for the crimes of which
                    his subjects accused him. Enraged by this unlooked-for arrogance, Henry summoned
                    a synod of German bishops, who declared Hildebrand deposed. The answer was a
                    bull excommunicating the German king, dethroning him, and liberating his
                    subjects from their oath of allegiance.</p>
                <p>Never had a pope ventured to take so bold a step. It was within the memory of
                    even young men that a German king had dismissed three popes, and raised, one
                    after another, four of his own prelates to the Roman see. And now a pope
                    attempted to drag from his throne the successor of this very sovereign. The
                    effect of the bull was tremendous; no other was ever followed by equally
                    important results. The princes had long been chafing under royal power; they had
                    shaken even so stern an autocrat as Henry III., and the authority of Henry IV.
                    was already visibly lowered. At this important stage in their contest with the
                    crown a mighty ally suddenly offered himself, and, with indecent eagerness, they
                    hastened to associate themselves with him. Their vassals and subjects, appalled
                    by the invisible powers wielded by the head of the church, supported them in
                    their rebelliousness. Henry had looked for no such result as this; he had not
                    comprehended the influences which lay beneath the surface, and was horrified by
                    his unexpected isolation. At a diet in Oppenheim he in vain humbled himself
                    before the princes. They turned from him coldly, and decided that the pope
                    should be asked to come to Germany to investigate, along with themselves, the
                    accusations brought against him; that if, within a year, the sentence of
                    excommunication were not removed, the king should lose his crown; and that in
                    the meantime he should live in retirement.</p>
                <p>Now came the strange scene at Canossa which burned itself into the memory of
                    Europe. For three days, in the depth of winter, the representative of the
                    Caesars, clad in a penitent’s shirt, shivered in the outer court of the Countess
                    Mathilda’s castle, entreating to be admitted into the pope’s presence. No other
                    mode of escape than complete subjection to Gregory had suggested itself, or was
                    perhaps possible; but it did not save him. Although the pope in a manner forgave
                    him, the German princes, being resolved not to miss the chance which fortune had
                    given them, met in his absence and deposed him, electing Rudolf, duke of Swabia,
                    as his successor. But Henry’s bitter humiliations transformed his character;
                    they brought out all his latent capacities of manliness. From being a wilful,
                    thoughtless lad, he became a resolute man, with many evil traces indeed of his
                    irregular training, but with a deep consciousness of his rights, and a fixed
                    determination to maintain them.</p>
                <p>The war that followed —the war of investitures—was the opening of that tremendous
                    struggle between the empire and the papacy, which is the central fact of
                    mediaeval history, and which, after two centuries of conflict, ended in the
                    exhaustion of both powers. Its details belong more to the history of Italy than
                    to that of Germany, but in Germany its effects were most deeply felt. It was now
                    that the nation plucked the bitter fruits of the seed planted by Otto I. in
                    assuming the imperial crown, and both by Otto and his predecessors and
                    successors in lavishing worldly power upon the church. In the ambition of the
                    spiritual and the secular princes the popes had an immense engine of offence
                    against the emperors; and they unscrupulously turned it to the utmost advantage.
                    The most loyal friends of the emperors were the cities. They had been <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n506/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0506-0489"/> steadily growing up, especially in the Rhine
                    country and in southern Germany, and could not but see that they had far more to
                    fear from the princes than from the crown. Hence, when Henry returned to
                    Germany, Worms, Spires, and many other towns opened their gates to him, and
                    freely contributed of their wealth; and towards his successors they pursued a
                    like policy.</p>
                <p>After several indecisive battles the rival king, Rudolf, was, in 1080, defeated
                    and slain. Henry then carried the war into Italy, where he was crowned emperor
                    by his own antipope, and in 1085 Hildebrand died an exile from Rome, although
                    with unbroken spirit. In Germany two other rival kings were set up, Hermann,
                    count of Luxembourg, and Ekbert, margrave of Meissen; but they were only
                    partially successful, and after the death of the latter in 1089, had Germany
                    followed her own impulses, there would have been peace. In the papacy, however,
                    Henry had an implacable foe; and again and again, when he seemed to be on the
                    point of complete triumph, it kindled anew the smouldering embers. His son
                    Conrad was stirred up against him in Italy; and iu Germany, when he was near the
                    end of his days, his second son Henry was induced to head a dangerous rebellion.
                    During his reign the first crusade took place, and he suffered severely from the
                    pious zeal which it expressed and intensified. The movement was not in the end
                    favourable to papal supremacy, but the early crusaders, and those who
                    sympathized with them, regarded the enemies of the pope as the enemies of
                    religion.</p>
                <p>Pope Paschal II. did not doubt, after the death of Henry IV., that he would
                    immediately triumph, but he was mistaken. Henry V. (1106-25), who had promised,
                    with unconscious irony, to treat him as a father, went on, like his
                    predecessors, investing prelates with ring and staff, and, when expostulated
                    with, replied that he could not be expected to give’up a right which had
                    belonged to all previous kings. War broke out anew, and, as in the time of Henry
                    IV., the pope found enthusiastic supporters among the princes. One of the most
                    ardent of these was Lothair, whom Henry V. himself had made duke of Saxony,
                    after the extinction of the Billung line, by which for a century and a half the
                    duchy had been ruled. Henry’s chief friends were the two Hohenstaufen princes,
                    Frederick and Conrad, to the former of whom Henry IV. gave the duchy of Swabia
                    when Rudolf became his rival king, while the latter was created by Henry V. duke
                    of Franconia, a country which had been attached to the crown lands since the
                    time of Otto I. These two brothers were enthusiastic imperialists, and upheld
                    with persistent courage the cause of their sovereign on the repeated occasions
                    on which he went to Italy to chastise the pope. At last, in 1122, peace was
                    restored by the concordat of Worms. By this compromise, which was forced by
                    exhaustion upon both parties, the right of electing the prelates was granted to
                    the clergy, and the emperor resigned the right of investing them with ring and
                    staff. On the other hand, it was arranged that the elections should take place
                    in the presence either of the emperor or of his representative, and that he
                    should invest the prelates with the sceptre. The papacy was thus very far from
                    realizing the great schemes of Hildebrand; still, even in regard to the
                    particular question in dispute, it gained solid advantages, and its general
                    authority was incomparably more important than it had been half a century
                    before. For it had waged war on the emperor himself; instead of acknowledging
                    its inferiority as in old times, it had claimed to be the highest power; it had
                    even attempted to dispose of the imperial crown as if the empire were a fief
                    which it granted of its good will; and it had found out that it could at any
                    time hamper, perhaps paralyse, imperial authority, by exciting strife in
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>The Franconian dynasty died out with Henry V., and Lothair, duke of Saxony, was
                    elected to succeed him. Lothair (1125-37) excited the enmity of the Hohenstaufen
                    princes by demanding that they should give up certain crown lands which had been
                    incorporated with their duchies. Unable to defend himself against them without
                    help, he secured a powerful ally by granting his daughter in marriage to Henry
                    the Proud, grandson of Welf, a prince whom Henry IV. had made duke of Bavaria.
                    As this vehement noble soon succeeded to Bavaria, and was also invested with
                    Saxony, he became by far the greatest subject in Germany. Nevertheless, the duke
                    of Franconia and the duke of Swabia withstood him, and not until within three
                    years of the emperor’s death were they forced to crave for peace. A considerable
                    portion of Lothair’s reign was spent in Italy; and Innocent II. claimed that
                    when he received the imperial crown he did so as a vassal of the pope.</p>
                <p>Nothing could indicate more clearly than this fact how much of their old power
                    the German kings had lost. It was not past hope that even yet some of their
                    former splendour might be restored; and for a brief period monarchy did again
                    stand high. Still, its foundations were sapped. Incessant war, both at home and
                    in Italy, had deprived it of its force; it had lost moral influence by
                    humiliations of which the scene at Canossa was an extreme type. Steadily, with
                    unwearied energy, letting no opportunity escape, the princes had advanced
                    towards independence, and they might well look forward to such a bearing in
                    regard to the kings as the kings had formerly adopted in regard to them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Later Mediaeval Period.</hi></p>
                <p>Henry the Proud was confident that he would succeed Lothair; but, by a hasty and
                    irregular election, Conrad, duke of Franconia, was chosen king. Conrad III.
                    (1137-52), an impulsive and not very wise ruler, found himself at once in
                    serious perplexities. Henry the Proud, knowing that evil was designed against
                    him, rebelled, whereupon he was declared to have forfeited his duchies; and
                    Saxony was granted to Albert the Bear, a strong and truly great Saxon noble,
                    while Bavaria fell to Leopold, margrave of Austria. Thus again the country was
                    ravaged by war, for Henry the Proud, although he was unpopular in Bavaria—the
                    duchy he had inherited—was powerfully upheld in Saxony, which, ever since Henry
                    IV. had alienated it, had always been ready to join in an attack on the
                    monarchy. Henry suddenly died, but the struggle was continued by his brother
                    Duke Welf; and, but for the opportune death of some of the chief combatants,
                    among them Leopold of Bavaria, it seemed probable that it would go hard with the
                    king. Welf, hoping to be made Leopold’s successor, agreed to a compromise, by
                    which Saxony, with the assent of Albert the Bear, was granted to
                    Henry—afterwards Henry the Lion— the young son of Henry the Proud. Bavaria,
                    however, was in the end given to Henry Jasomirgott (so called from his habit of
                    saying “Ja so mir Gott helfe!”), margrave of Austria, a rough noble, who was
                    afterwards found to have a decidedly inconvenient temper. Welf again took to
                    arms, and for years contended with his rival. Notwithstanding this and many
                    other sources of confusion, Conrad was persuaded by tho passionate eloquence of
                    St Bernard to take part in the second crusade. He came back broken, dispirited,
                    and near his end, to find Henry the Lion at the head of a great army, claiming
                    Bavaria in addition to Saxony, —a claim which Conrad in vain attempted to
                    dispute.</p>
                <p>Germany now passed under one of the greatest of her sovereigns, Frederick
                    Barbarossa (1152-90), nephew of King Conrad, and son of the Frederick, duke of
                    Swabia, who had fought along with Conrad against Henry the Proud. He was a man
                    of large and noble nature, capable, indeed, <pb break="no"

                    lover of justice, with far-reaching ideals, ready to battle with gigantic
                    difficulties, yet knowing how to recognize and submit to the inevitable. Allied
                    to the Welfs through his mother, and having a personal regard for Henry the
                    Lion, he was anxious to bring to an end the strife of the Welfic and the
                    Hohenstaufen families, and began his reign by promising to secure for Henry the
                    duchy of Bavaria. For his adventurous and imaginative spirit the splendour of
                    the imperial name had an irresistible charm; and two years after he ascended the
                    throne, in 1154, he went to Rome to be crowned emperor. After this the best
                    years of his life were spent in Italy, where, in his obstinate struggle with the
                    Lombard cities and with Pope Alexander HL, he chiefly acquired his fame.
                    Although it was conducted on his side mainly with German troops, it properly
                    comes under Italian history, in which the record of his reign forms a bloody
                    page, while his name is associated with one of the most peaceful and prosperous
                    periods in the internal history of Germany.</p>
                <p>The promise that Bavaria should be granted to Henry the Lion was not easily
                    fulfilled, for Henry Jasomirgott doggedly refused to give it up. At last,
                    however, Frederick, after his return from his first expedition to Italy, in
                    1156, reconciled the surly prince by detaching Austria, his native march, from
                    Bavaria, and making it a duchy with certain special privileges,—an important
                    step in the process by which Austria gradually became the centre of a powerful
                    state. Henry the Lion then became duke both of Bavaria and of Saxony. This
                    prince often gave offence by a haughty and aggressive disposition, but few
                    German dukes won so true a title to the good-will of posterity. Since the time
                    of Otto II. and Otto III. the Slavonic countries to the east of Saxony had been
                    very imperfectly held in subjection. Henry devoted himself to the conquest of
                    the territory along the shores of the Baltic, and he succeeded as no one before
                    him had ever done. But he was not a mere conqueror; he built towns and
                    encouraged those which already existed, founded bishoprics in the newly-won
                    lands, and planted in them bodies of industrious colonists. While he was thus at
                    work, a similar task was fulfilled a little to the south of him by Albert the
                    Bear, the first margrave of Brandenburg, who, by just and energetic rule,
                    worthily prepared the land for its great, although far-off, destinies.</p>
                <p>Early in his reign, by settling a dispute between two brothers who claimed the
                    crown of Denmark, Frederick brought the king of that country once more into the
                    position of a vassal of Germany. He broke into Poland also, and compelled its
                    ruler to do homage, and, in return for great services rendered in his Polish
                    campaign, raised the duke of Bohemia to royal rank,—a change which in no way
                    affected his duties to the German crown, but which gave him a certain precedence
                    over all other subject princes. The king of Hungary, although no attempt was
                    made to subdue him, became a useful ally of Frederick. Thus the ancient fame of
                    Germany, which was lost during the confusion that came after Henry III., was to
                    a large extent restored in the neighbouring countries. Frederick reasserted the
                    royal authority in Burgundy, and added to the kingdom, by right of marriage,
                    Upper Burgundy, or, as it was afterwards called, Franche Comté. Internal quiet
                    he established by strictly applying such laws as existed against those who
                    should break the peace; and the robber nobles never found a more implacable
                    enemy. The cities flourished during his reign, and he attached them to himself
                    by granting to many of them the very liberties which, by a too literal
                    interpretation of his imperial rights, he withheld from the cities of Lombardy.
                    Yet, with all this, the nobles appear to have been enthusiastically devoted to
                    him. They followed him time after time into Italy, going through incredible
                    sufferings that he might assert claims which were of no advantage to them, and
                    which had been a curse to their nation. On one occasion, when a too confident
                    legate read before the diet a papal letter, which seemed to imply that the
                    empire was a fief of the papacy, indignant murmurs broke from the assembly, and
                    the life of the offender was saved only by the intervention of Frederick
                    himself. The secret of this great popularity was partly the national pride
                    excited by his foreign achievements, partly the ascendency which his genius gave
                    him over other minds, partly the conviction that, while he would abate nothing
                    of his rights, he would ask no more than the laws of the empire sanctioned.</p>
                <p>In the later years of Frederick’s reign, Henry the Lion had the misfortune to
                    incur his deep displeasure. The duke, rendered arrogant by success, positively
                    refused, because his conditions were not admitted, to attend the emperor in the
                    Italian campaign which resulted in the fatal battle of Legnano. Ascribing this
                    defeat wholly to Henry, Frederick returned to Germany resolved to work his ruin.
                    Summoned on three different occasions to attend the diet, Henry held aloof;
                    whereupon, by judgment of his peers, he was condemned to the loss of both his
                    duchies. After some resistance he submitted; but the utmost favour he could
                    secure was permission to retain Brunswick and Lüneburg, while his term of
                    banishment to England was reduced from seven years to three. Bavaria was granted
                    to Otto of Wittelsbach, but it lost much of its importance, for, among other
                    changes, Styria was taken from it and made a separate duchy. Saxony was finally
                    broken up. The duchy was confined to a comparatively small territory to the east
                    of Brunswick and Lüneburg, and conferred upon Bernard, son of Albert the Bear,
                    while most of the western half of the country was attached, as the duchy of
                    Westphalia, to the archbishopric of Cologne. The chief prelates of Saxony, and
                    many of the most important vassals of ’ the duke, such as the counts of
                    Oldenburg, of Holstein, and of Schwerin, were made virtually independent of all
                    control save that of the crown. Frederick’s object in thus disintegrating the
                    two greatest duchies in the kingdom was, by playing off the nobles against each
                    other, to secure imperial authority. But, in reality, he made it doubly certain
                    that the princes would one day shake off imperial power altogether; for it was
                    incomparably more difficult for the sovereign to contend with scores of petty
                    nobles than with two or three great lords.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of Frederick’s career fortune appeared to smile upon him.
                    Germany was at peace; even in Italy, since the force of events had persuaded him
                    that the time was past for too severe a straining of his lawful claims, he had
                    been well received by the cities which had wrought him so much disaster; pope
                    and emperor were temporarily reconciled; and, by the marriage of his son Henry
                    with the princess Constantia, he had reason to hope that the empire would soon
                    include Naples and Sicily. Resolving that the sunset of his life should be even
                    more splendid than its dawn, he undertook the third crusade, and started with a
                    great army for the Holy Land. When the news reached Germany that he had been
                    drowned, men felt that evil days must come, since the elements of strife could
                    no longer be controlled by his strong hand.</p>
                <p>Evil days did not, however, come in the time of Henry VI. (1190-97), who,
                    although without his father’s greatness of soul, had his determination and
                    energy. Partly by means of the immense ransom obtained from his prisoner Richard
                    of England, he was able to beat down resistance in the south Italian kingdom to
                    which his marriage entitled him; and the papacy was more completely subject to
                    him than it had ever been to Frederick. In Germany he was so powerful that he
                    not only secured the election of <pb break="no"

                    (as a king elected during the lifetime of an emperor was now and henceforth
                    called), but he made proposals that the crown should be declared hereditary. To
                    secure this important end, he offered so many concessions that, but for his
                    sudden death, it would probably have been achieved.</p>
                <p>Great as was Henry’s authority, there had been a dangerous conspiracy against
                    even him, and after his death the princes who had taken part in it refused, to
                    recognize his son. There was now a double election, those who were favourable to
                    the Hohenstaufen dynasty choosing Philip, Henry’s brother, their enemies
                    appointing Otto, son of Henry the Lion. Had Germany had no relation to the
                    papacy, or had the papacy continued as weak as in the days of Henry VI., there
                    could have been no doubt how the strife would end. A large majority of the
                    princes were on Philip’s side, and his personal character commanded universal
                    respect, while Otto was a man without principle, harsh and violent. But, to
                    Germany’s misfortune, the papal see was at this time held by Innocent III., a
                    pope in whom were revived the ambition, statesmanship, and force of Hildebrand.
                    After a little delay he decided for Otto, and thenceforward for some years the
                    country was desolated by civil war. Even with the help of the pope, Otto by and
                    by lost ground; and Philip, had he not been murdered, in 1208, would soon have
                    been universally acknowledged. After his death, however, there was no longer any
                    excuse for war, and Otto IV. was crowned emperor. While his position was
                    undecided he remained a humble suppliant of the pope, but after his coronation
                    he cast aside his pledges, and began to act as an independent sovereign. Up to
                    this time Frederick, the son of Henry VI., had lived in his southern kingdom,
                    nominally under the guardianship of Innocent, but in reality left to be trained
                    by the severe discipline of practical life. Although the pope did not altogether
                    like him, he now resolved to punish Otto by bringing forward this young prince
                    as a candidate for the German throne. A party among the princes was easily
                    induced to elect him, and in 1214 he started, full of youthful hope, on his
                    journey across the Alps. In the period which followed, he displayed an
                    unsurpassed power of managing men; while Otto, thinking to injure him by
                    indirectly striking a heavy blow at his patron the pope, was short-sighted
                    enough to leave Germany and to support John of England against the French king,
                    Philip Augustus. In the battle of Bouvines, memorable alike in the history of
                    England, France, and Germany, his fate was sealed. After so crushing a defeat
                    nothing remained for him but to make way for his rival by withdrawing from
                    public life.</p>
                <p>Frederick II. (1212-50), if not the strongest, was personally the most brilliant,
                    of the German kings. With the mediaeval passion for adventure he combined the
                    intellectual freedom and culture of a modern gentleman. A lover of poetry, of
                    science, and of art, he was also a great statesman; with a power of will which
                    the most adverse circumstances could not break, he knew how to adapt his policy
                    to changing circumstances, and how to move men by appealing at one time to their
                    selfishness and weakness, at another to the most ideal qua!ities of human
                    nature. And for outward splendour his position never was surpassed, since, when
                    he died, he possessed no fewer than six crowns,—the imperial crown, and the
                    crowns of Germany, Burgundy, Lombardy, Sicily, and Jerusalem. But Germany, his
                    proper kingdom, profited not at all by his magnificent gifts. In 1220 he left it
                    for a space of 15 years, to accomplish his famous crusade, to carry on his
                    bitter contest with the Lombard cities and Pope Gregory IX., and to rule Sicily,
                    with an insight into its needs that made it the most prosperous land in
                    Christendom. In his absence he was represented in Germany by his young son
                    Henry, who was crowned king of the Romans, and in whose name the country was
                    governed by two successive regents. Throughout the kingdom the princes did very
                    much what seemed good in their own eyes; and in the north a confused warfare was
                    carried on between the Germans and the Danes. As there was now no powerful Saxon
                    duke to uphold the northern interests of the kingdom, and as the central
                    Government did not choose, or was unable, to act with energy, the Danes had
                    decidedly the best of this struggle, and extended their power along the Baltic
                    coast. At the same time Prussia was conquered for Christianity and for
                    civilization by the knights of the Teutonic Order, who here slowly built up the
                    state which ultimately, in association with Brandenburg, was to influence so
                    profoundly the course of history. Crusading knights from all lands came to their
                    help against the Prussian heathen, and their strength was permanently increased
                    by their union with the Knights of the Sword, who, before their appearance in
                    Prussia, had been subduing Livonia and Courland. In all these countries
                    Christian institutions were introduced, and German settlers brought with them
                    the peaceful arts.</p>
                <p>As young King Henry grew up, he displayed none of the good characteristics of his
                    house, and in 1235 he openly rebelled. So confident was Frederick of his own
                    position that he entered Germany with only a few personal attendants, and his
                    presence had the effect he anticipated. At Mainz, amid circumstances of
                    unprecedented pomp, he held a diet which was attended by nearly all the princes,
                    and Henry was solemnly deposed. Yet Frederick was in •reality watched with
                    sullen suspicion. The princes did not know what might be implied in his
                    extraordinary display of imperial power; they resented his evident dislike of
                    their country; as loyal sons of the church, they could not but hold somewhat
                    aloof from one who was believed to be at heart a Mahometan. It was significant
                    of the limits of his influence that, in declaring private war to be unlawful, he
                    had to except cases in which justice could not be obtained; and that, although
                    desirous of setting up courts of justice which should make private war
                    unnecessary, he could only establish a tribunal from whose jurisdiction princes
                    of the empire were excluded.</p>
                <p>Some years after this, the gulf between Frederick and the nation was further
                    widened by his indifference to a fearful danger by which Germany was threatened.
                    Hordes of Mongols appeared on the eastern frontiers, yet Frederick had neither
                    counsel nor help for his subjects; the peril was warded off independently of him
                    by the brave margrave, Henry of Liegnitz. At that time he was once more absorbed
                    by his Italian wars. In Innocent IV. he found an enemy quite as persistent as
                    Gregory IX. Innocent grasped at the old and well-tried weapon, the ambition of
                    the princes; and he succeeded so far as to induce a number of them, mostly
                    prelates, to accept his sentence of deposition, and to appoint a rival king. The
                    king of their choice was Henry Raspe, landgrave of Thuringia, a rude noble, who
                    had extended his territories at the expense of those of his dead brother,
                    husband of the famous St Elizabeth of Hungary. Frederick’s younger son, Conrad,
                    who had some time before been elected king of the Romans, resisted the parsons’
                    king, as Henry Raspe was popularly called; and the rebellion did not at any time
                    assume dangerous proportions. After Henry Raspe’s death, the papal party elected
                    William, count of Holland, a prince who had no quality to recommend him, except
                    that he was young and weak, and therefore likely to be a willing tool in the
                    hands of his friends. Had Frederick chosen to leave the Lombard cities, he might
                    still have found sources of strength in Germany; but he preferred to remain at
                    what he considered the centre of his empire, and King Conrad had not influence
                    enough to restore harmony. At the time of the emperor’s death, when he was
                    almost ready <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n509/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0509-0492"/> to make a new spring at his enemies, but when to
                    the world he seemed to have lost everything, the prospects of his supporters
                    were dark indeed. They acknowledged Conrad IV. as their lawful sovereign, but
                    he, too, fought in Italy rather than at home, and the country continued till his
                    death, in 1254, to be torn by the two contending factions.</p>
                <p>With King Conrad IV. the Hohenstaufen line came to an end in Germany, and William
                    of Holland received a nominal allegiance. In two years he followed his
                    predecessors, and then there was a double election, that of Alphonso, king of
                    Castile, and Richard, earl of Cornwall, brother of Henry III. of England.
                    Richard was crowned, but he went to Germany only three times, and the majority
                    of his subjects probably hardly knew his name. Alphonso never even visited the
                    country of which he also claimed to be the sovereign.</p>
                <p>The age of the Hohenstaufen emperors is, in many respects, the most interesting
                    in the mediaeval history of Germany. Everywhere there were dramatic contrasts of
                    character: in the innumerable struggles of the time we are struck, now by heroic
                    devotion, again by almost incredible selfishness; a gay enjoyment of the world
                    as it is existed side by side with almost superhuman spirituality. Chivalry was
                    in full bloom, with much in its nature that was fantastic and insincere, but
                    keeping alive a beautiful ideal of manliness, courtesy, and generosity. Women
                    never held a higher place, nor, on the whole, did they ever respond more nobly
                    to the honours freely lavished upon them. The excitement of the crusades,
                    contact with the life of Italy (in that age presenting so many elements fitted
                    to awaken even dull minds), and study of the Provençal poets revealed worlds
                    that had been hitherto unknown; while the national genius for the first time
                    flowered in the romances and lyrics of the Minnesänger. In the cities,
                    magnificent churches in the Gothic style gave expression to high aspiration, and
                    gratified a cultivated feeling for art. And the problems of government were seen
                    in new lights, partly from the study of Roman law which passed from Italy to
                    Germany, partly from the summaries of native custom in the “Sachsenspiegel” and
                    “Schwabenspiegel.” Altogether, Germany has seen no more fascinating epoch, none
                    more full of life, movement, and colour.</p>
                <p>Yet it was in this age that the German nation utterly lost its political
                    strength. Even after Lothair the Saxon, a line of sovereigns rigidly confining
                    themselves to their own kingdom might have mastered the many influences which
                    were making for disunion. But the Hohenstaufen family, like their Saxon and
                    Franconian predecessors, would be content with nothing short of worlddominion;
                    and thus the crown which had once been significant of power and splendour
                    gradually sank into contempt. Under the strong rule of Frederick Barbarossa and
                    his son the process was temporarily stopped, but only to advance the more
                    rapidly when they were gone. During the confusion of the civil war carried on by
                    Otto IV. and Philip, the princes, being subject to hardly any check, seized
                    crown lands and crown rights; and the mischief was too extensive to be undone by
                    Frederick II. In 1220, in order to secure the adhesion of the church to his son
                    Henry, he formally confirmed the spiritual princes in their usurpations,
                    agreeing not to introduce into their territories, without their consent, new
                    coinage, or customs, or tolls. Fifteen years later the rebel king, Henry, was
                    isolated by similar advantages being granted to the secular princes. The two
                    pragmatic sanctions in which Frederick made these concessions formed the lawful
                    basis of the independence of the princely class. Such authority as he reserved
                    he could ill exercise from a distant land in which his energies were otherwise
                    occupied. His immediate successors can hardly be said to have exercised any
                    authority whatever; and they lost hold of the border countries which had
                    hitherto been dependent upon or connected with Germany. Denmark and Poland
                    rendered no homage thenceforth to the German crown, and Burgundy was gradually
                    absorbed by France.</p>
                <p>The country was not now divided into a few duchies which, with skilful
                    management, might still on difficult emergencies have been made to act together.
                    The age of the great duchies was past. As we have seen, Bavaria was shorn of
                    extensive lands, over which new dukes were placed, and the duchy of Saxony was
                    altogether broken up. Swabia and Franconia also ceased to have dukes, and
                    Lorraine gave place to the duchy of Brabant and other small immediate states.
                    Thus there were prelates, dukes, palsgraves, margraves, landgraves,
                    counts—forming together a large body—each of whom claimed to have no superior
                    save the emperor, whose authority they and their predecessors had slowly
                    destroyed. All immediate nobles were not princes; but even petty knights or
                    barons, who possessed little more than the rude towers from which they descended
                    upon passing travellers, if their only lord was the emperor, recognized no law
                    save their own will. Another independent element of the state was composed of
                    the imperial cities. So long as the emperor really reigned, they enjoyed only
                    such liberties as they could wring from him, or as he voluntarily conferred. But
                    when the sovereign’s power decayed, the imperial cities were really free
                    republics, governing themselves according to their own ideas of law and justice.
                    Besides the imperial cities, and the princes and other immediate nobles, there
                    were the mediate nobles, the men who held land in fief of the highest classes of
                    the aristocracy, and who, in virtue of this feudal relation, thought themselves
                    entitled to look down upon allodial proprietors or freemen, and upon simple
                    burghers. There were also mediate towns, acknowledging the supremacy of some
                    lord other than the sovereign. Beneath all these, forming the mass of the
                    agricultural population, were the peasantry and the serfs, the latter attached
                    to the land, the former ground down by heavy taxes.</p>
                <p>The period which followed the death of Conrad IV., called the Great Interregnum,
                    was made good use of by the princes for the extension of their territories and
                    the confirmation of their authority. On several occasions the crown had seemed
                    to be on the verge of becoming hereditary; but the jealousy of the papacy, and
                    the growing influence of the aristocracy, had succeeded in keeping it elective.
                    Although each election needed the sanction of the whole class of immediate
                    nobles, the right of appointing the king had long been virtually in the hands of
                    the leading princes. During the interregnum, mainly through the influence of
                    Pope Urban IV., it was definitely transferred to the archbishops of Mainz,
                    Cologne, and Treves, the houses of Wittelsbach and Saxony, the margrave of
                    Brandenburg, and the king of Bohemia. After this the electors became a distinct
                    element in the state. Their importance consisted in this, that they could
                    maintain the existing disunion by imposing rigid conditions on candidates for
                    the crown, and by taking care that it should be conferred on no prince likely to
                    be dangerous to the aristocracy.</p>
                <p>Up to the time of the interregnum the territories of a prince were never divided
                    among his descendants, the reason being that, although the private fiefs of the
                    princes were hereditary, their offices as rulers were in theory at the disposal
                    of the crown. This principle was now set aside. Otto, duke of Bavaria, of the
                    house of Wittelsbach, had become by marriage lord also of the Rhenish
                    palatinate. After his death these extensive lands were ruled in common by his
                    two sons; but a formal division soon took place, by which the powerful family of
                    Wittelsbach was separated into two branches, the Palatine and the Bavarian. The
                    small duchy of Saxony was also divided into two duchies, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n510/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0510-0493"/> that of Wittenberg and that of Lauenburg, the
                    former to the south, the latter to the north, of the great march of Brandenburg.
                    About the same time there were like divisions in Nassau, Brunswick, Meissen, and
                    Holstein. It vms thus practically settled that the offices and territories, as
                    well as the private fiefs, of the princes were hereditary, to be disposed of by
                    them at their pleasure. This being thoroughly established, it would have been
                    hard, perhaps impossible, even for a sovereign of the highest genius, to
                    reassert in anything like its full extent the royal authority. The process of
                    division and subdivision which steadily went on broke up Germany into a
                    bewildering multitude of principalities; but as a rule the members of each
                    princely house held together against common enemies. Ultimately they learned to
                    arrange by private treaties that no territory should pass from the family while
                    a single representative of it survived.</p>
                <p>This consolidation of the power of the princes was contemporary with the rise of
                    the cities into new importance. The destruction of imperial authority compelled
                    them to organize their resources, so as to be at all times prepared against
                    ambitious neighbours. They began to form leagues which the greatest princes, and
                    combinations of princes, could not afford to despise. Of these leagues the chief
                    at this time was the Rhenish Confederation, which was founded by Mainz and
                    Worms, and which, within a year of its formation—so pressing was the need of
                    union—included about 70 cities,—among them Cologne, Strasburg, Basel, and towns
                    far to the east and north, such as Nuremberg, Erfurt, and Bremen. Great
                    importance was also acquired by the Hanseatic League, which had originated some
                    time before the interregnum in a treaty of alliance between Lübeck and Hamburg.
                    It ultimately included more than 80 cities, and became one of the greatest
                    commercial powers in Europe.</p>
                <p>A political system which allowed the princes to do as they pleased was exactly to
                    their liking; and had they been able to follow their own impulses, it is
                    improbable that they would have placed over the country even a nominal king. But
                    the papacy intervened. It found from its troubles at home and from its
                    diminished northern revenues that it would still be convenient to have in
                    Germany a sovereign who would, like his predecessors, be the protector of the
                    church. Pope Gregory X. therefore, after the death of Richard, let the electors
                    know that if they did not choose a king he himself would appoint one. This
                    threat was effective. The electors met, and raised to the throne Rudolf, count
                    of Hapsburg, a petty Swabian noble who was supposed to be too unimportant to do
                    much harm. Rudolf (1273-91), however, proved himself to have much more energy
                    than the electors supposed. For a long time the most powerful prince in Germany
                    had been Ottocar, king of Bohemia. He had by marriage and conquest obtained a
                    great territory beyond his native state, including the Austrian possessions of
                    the house of Babenberg, of which the male line had died out. As he had himself
                    expected to receive the German crown, he refused to do homage to the new
                    sovereign, who could not for a time compel his allegiance. At last, in a great
                    battle at the Marchfeld, Ottocar was defeated and slain. Rudolf has often been
                    called the restorer of the German kingdom, but he has no real claim to this
                    honourable title. In the later years of his life he made some attempts to
                    maintain the public peace, and he distinguished himself by the vigour with which
                    he punished robber barons; he also won back some of the crown lands and dues
                    which had been stolen during the interregnum. But he made no essential change in
                    the condition of Germany. There was but one way iu which a king could hope still
                    to overcome the arrogance of the princes, and that was to encourage the cities
                    and to form with them a close and enduring alliance. This was the policy pursued
                    by the French kings, and it was pursued with splendid effect. But Rudolf
                    invariably favoured the princes rather than the cities. The latter had a
                    peculiar class of citizens called “pfahlbürger,” who dwelt in the open country
                    beyond the city palisades, and could claim the protection of the city
                    authorities. As freemen were able, by becoming pfahlbürger, to escape from the
                    tyranny of local despots, the princes vehemently opposed the right of the towns
                    to receive them. Rudolf not only took the side of despotism in this important
                    struggle, but harassed and weakened the cities by subjecting them to severe
                    imposts. He had all the sympathies and prejudices of a noble; and the supreme
                    object of his life was not to increase the authority of the state, but to add to
                    the greatness of his own family. In this he was brilliantly successful. Some
                    years after the fall of Ottocar he obtained the assent of the princes,
                    notwithstanding their dislike of the scheme, to the granting of Austria, Styria,
                    and Carníola in fief to his son Albert. Carinthia was given to Meinhard, count
                    of Tyrol, on condition that on the dying out of his male line it should fall to
                    Rudolf’s descendants. Thus Rudolf made himself memorable as the founder of the
                    house of Hapsburg, which from his time formed one of the most influential forces
                    in the national life of Germany.</p>
                <p>In vain Rudolf sought to obtain the crown for his son; the electors would not
                    take a step that might endanger their special rights. Guided mainly by the
                    archbishop of Cologne, they chose Adolf, count of Nassau (1291-98), a noble of
                    even less importance than Rudolf had been. He had, however, a considerable
                    reputation for valour and ability. Edward I. of England persuaded him to form an
                    alliance against France. Instead of applying the large sum sent from England to
                    promote the objects of the alliance, Adolf was unprincipled enough to expend it
                    in the purchase of Thuringia from the worthless landgrave, Albert the
                    Degenerate. As the transfer was resisted by Albert’s sons, it led to a war in
                    which Adolf was opposed by several princes. In his general policy he was much
                    more enlightened than in these wretched proceedings, for he detected what had
                    escaped his predecessor, the value of the cities as the true support of the
                    monarchy. He relieved them of some of their burdens, and upheld them in the
                    controversy respecting the pfahlbürger. Taking alarm, the electors met, and by
                    an irregular vote proclaimed him dethroned. Adolf resisted, but lost his life in
                    a battle near Worms.</p>
                <p>Now that there could be no pretext for asserting that the crown had been obtained
                    by inheritance, Duke Albert of Austria, Rudolf’s son, was chosen to be Adolf’s
                    successor. Albert I. (1298-1308); like his father, made it his principal object
                    to extend the power of his house, and he came very near to securing Bohemia and
                    Thuringia; but his schemes were cut short by a violent death. Although a hard,
                    stern man, he had a keen sense of justice when his selfish interests were not
                    involved, and few of the German kings possessed so strongly practical an
                    intelligence. He encouraged the cities even more effectually than his
                    predecessor, and was not content with issuing proclamations against private war,
                    but formed alliances with the princes in order to enforce his decrees. The
                    serfs, whose wrongs seldom attracted notice in an age indifferent to human
                    dignity, found a friend in this severe monarch, and he protected even the
                    despised and persecuted Jews.</p>
                <p>Albert’s successor was Henry, count of Luxembourg. Henry VII. (1308-13) was
                    fortunate enough to obtain for his son John the crown of Bohemia, but the
                    aggrandisement of his family was not the main object of this remarkable
                    sovereign, the last of the German kings of the old, grandly ambitious type. It
                    was the memory of the empire which stirred his blood; and from the beginning of
                    his reign he looked forward to the assumption of the Lombard and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0511-0494"/> imperial crowns. His purpose of crossing the Alps
                    at the head of a mighty force was hailed with delight in Italy by the Ghibelline
                    faction, whose aspirations found noble utterance in Dante’s prose; but the
                    emperor lived too short a time to fulfil the hopes of his friends. The effect of
                    the connexion of Germany with the empire was in his time, as in former ages,
                    altogether mischievous; for before starting for Rome he tried to conciliate the
                    princes by adding to their already enormous privileges and by repressing the
                    energies of the cities.</p>
                <p>The electors, with their usual dread of the crown becoming hereditary, would not
                    appoint Henry’s son, John, the young king of Bohemia. But they were unable to
                    agree on any one else, and the result of their disputes was a double
                    election—one party choosing Frederick the Fair, duke of Austria, son of Albert
                    I.; another, Louis, duke of Bavaria. War at once broke out and lasted for about
                    nine years. In 1322 the rival claims were set at rest by the battle of Mühlberg,
                    in which Frederick’s army was decisively routed. Louis had no personal ill-will
                    to his opponent, who was the friend of his youth; and in 1325 he agreed that
                    they should rule in common. Frederick III., however, being without strength of
                    character, sank into insignificance, and in 1330 he died.</p>
                <p>The success of Louis IV. (1314-47) in the war with Frederick was to a large
                    extent due to the imperial cities, which clung to him from the first. They not
                    only willingly paid high taxes, but made splendid voluntary contributions; aud
                    they often stimulated anew the king of their choice, when he himself would have
                    preferred to give up a struggle in which the sympathies of most of the princes
                    and nobles were with his enemy. He was even more indebted to the memorable
                    conflict between the house of Hapsburg and the League composed of Schwyz, Uri,
                    and Unterwalden. The inhabitants of these districts claimed to have never owed
                    allegiance to any sovereign save the emperor. Although this claim had been
                    confirmed by King Adolf and Henry VIL, the dukes of Austria would not recognize
                    it; and when Frederick was chosen king by his party among the electors, he sent
                    bailiffs into the country to bring it under the rule of his family. Probably the
                    tyranny of these officers, although it occurred at a later time than that to
                    which the Tell legend refers, afterwards gave rise to the romantic tales which
                    gathered around the name of the mythical champion of Swiss independence. At any
                    rate it brought on a conflict between Austria and the confederates, which
                    strained the resources of Frederick at the very time when he needed them in
                    defence of his royal claims. It was not only Louis who profited by this
                    struggle, for the splendid battle of Morgarten Pass laid the foundation of the
                    structure which we now see in free Switzerland.</p>
                <p>Had Louis been a wise prince it would have been easy for him to rise to a great
                    position after the battle of Mühlberg; but he was wayward, treacherous, and
                    selfish. He mortally offended King John of Bohemia, who had been of great
                    service to him, but who now became his bitter and unrelenting enemy. Pope John
                    XXII., stirred up by Charles IV. of France, who had some hope of obtaining the
                    empire for himself, took advantage of the strife of the two princes, and
                    arrogantly claimed that the German crown could not be worn but with papal
                    sanction. When Louis gave the answer that was to be expected, the pope responded
                    by excommunicating him and by placing under the interdict all places by which he
                    should be supported. Thus it seemed that the ancient struggle between the papacy
                    and the empire was to be revived; but the pope and his French master had
                    altogether misread the signs of the times. The princes had no longer, as in
                    former ages, reason to dread an ambitious ruler; the kingdom was their own, and
                    therefore they could not tolerate that its destinies should be decided by a
                    foreign power. Even the spiritual princes for the most part took this view. The
                    electors had of course the strongest of all motives for resisting the papal
                    claim, since, had it been conceded, they would have been deprived of their
                    importance. As for the cities, they had stood beside the empire in the most
                    difficult crises of its contest with Rome, and they were not likely to desert it
                    now. Encouraged, or rather driven forward, by the national sentiment, Louis
                    continued to maintain the independence of his crown, and even made a descent
                    upon Italy, where he was crowned emperor by .his own anti-pope. This enterprise
                    ended disastrously, but it made no difference in the conditions of the
                    controversy. Louis was personally very much frightened by the possible
                    consequences of excommunication, and intrigued incessantly with Pope John and
                    his successor Benedict XII. to be taken back into the church. In order to win
                    papal favour he basely betrayed Edward III. of England, with whom he had formed
                    an alliance against the French king, Philip VI. The nation, however, stood fast,
                    and in 1338 the electors, with the exception of King John of Bohemia, met at
                    Reuse, near Coblentz, and formally declared that the German king and emperor, if
                    appointed by a majority of the electors, received his authority from God alone,
                    and needed not papal sanction in the exercise of his rights. This declaration
                    was accepted as the fundamental law of the empire by a diet which Louis summoned
                    in Frankfort, and which was largely attended by princes, nobles, and
                    citizens.</p>
                <p>Louis did not maintain the popularity forced upon him by this conflict. His greed
                    of territory for his family made him so unscrupulous, and excited so many
                    jealousies, that the Bohemian king succeeded in forming a party against him; and
                    in 1346 a number of the electors voted his deposition, and appointed in his
                    place Charles, margrave of Moravia, King John’s son. The cities persisted in
                    their loyalty, and few of the princes were willing to involve themselves in
                    another great war; so that for a time the sentence of deposition had no effect.
                    But after King John had met his death, fighting heroically despite his blindness
                    as the French king’s ally, on the field of Crécy, Charles, who succeeded him on
                    the Bohemian throne, began to make vigorous preparations; and probably the
                    sudden death of Louis prevented Germany from being once more rent by civil
                    strife.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the defects of Louis’s personal character his reign was one of
                    the most important in German history. The claim of the papacy to political
                    supremacy received in his time its deathblow, and the popes themselves sowed the
                    seeds of the spiritual alienation from Rome which was effected at the
                    Reformation. In regard to the public peace, Louis persistently followed the
                    lines laid down by Albert I. He encouraged the princes to form alliances for its
                    maintenance, and at the time of his death such alliances existed in all parts of
                    the country. To the cities he usually showed himself a faithful friend. In many
                    of them there had been for more than a century a struggle between the old
                    patrician families and the guilds composed of workmen and tradespeople. Louis
                    could not always follow his own impulses; but whenever he could, he associated
                    himself with the latter party. Thus in his day the government of the imperial
                    cities became more democratic, and industry and trade flourished as they had
                    never before done. The steady dislike of the princes was the best proof of the
                    importance of the cities. They contained elements capable of enormous
                    development; and had a great king arisen he might even yet, by their means, have
                    secured for Germany a truly national life.</p>
                <p>The friends of Louis elected Günther, count of Schwarzburg, but Charles IV.
                    (1347—78), by a liberal use of bribes, bought over his enemies; and Günther
                    himself resigned <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n512/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0512-0495"/> his claim, and soon afterwards died. Charles was
                    an accomplished diplomatist, of a keen and penetrating intellect, but capable of
                    almost any trickery in order to gain his ends. Apparently the most pliant of
                    men, he had in reality great persistence of character, and if foiled in one set
                    of plans readily turned round and reached his goal by a wholly different path.
                    The result of his endless intrigues was that, when he died, he wore the crowns
                    of Bohemia, of Germany, of Burgundy, of Lombardy, and of the empire; and he
                    succeeded in adding to his native kingdom Lusatia, Silesia, and Brandenburg. As
                    a Bohemian king he ranked high among the rulers of his day. He so carefully
                    organized the administration, and practised such strict economy in government,
                    that no German country was so lightly taxed as Bohemia; and it became, under his
                    rule,a home of learning and of the arts. Towards Germany he was cynically
                    indifferent, caring for it only in so far as it could add to his personal
                    welfare. It never stood in more urgent need of a strong and beneficent ruler
                    than in the early years of his reign, for the Black Death swept over the land,
                    and the half-mad population rose in fury against the Jews, who were supposed to
                    have in some way caused the evil. In dealing with this monstrous outburst of
                    fanaticism, many of the princes, both spiritual and secular, displayed vigour
                    and humanity; but Charles saw in the suffering of the downtrodden race, which
                    was peculiarly under his protection, only an excuse for robbing it of its
                    wealth.</p>
                <p>His most famous achievement is the Golden Bull. Although the principle of
                    election to the crown had long been settled, it was surrounded by many practical
                    difficulties. It had never, for instance, been decided whether all the princes
                    of each electoral house were entitled to vote; nor was it certain, when a choice
                    was made among several branches of a family, by what law the choice ought to be
                    regulated. The Golden Bull, which was granted as the result of many tedious
                    negotiations in 1356, was primarily intended to set at rest such doubts as
                    these; but it did very much more. It decided that the number of electors should
                    be strictly limited to seven, that the spiritual electorates should belong as
                    before to the archbishops of Mainz, of Cologne, and of Treves, and the secular
                    electorates to the king of Bohemia, the Rhenish palsgrave, the duke of Saxony
                    (Sachsen-Wittenberg), and the margrave of Brandenburg. That there might be no
                    possibility of dispute between the princes of a single house, these countries
                    were declared to be indivisible, and to be heritable only on the principle of
                    primogeniture. The electors were invested with full sovereign rights within
                    their territories, and their subjects were allowed to appeal to the royal or
                    imperial tribunals only if the administration of justice should be refused. The
                    king of Bohemia received precedence among the secular electors, but it is
                    difficult to believe that this alone was his aim in making these vast
                    concessions. Whatever may have been his motives, the effect of the Golden Bull
                    was to perpetuate the disunion of the state. With such powers the electors
                    collectively were of more importance than the sovereign; and their greatness
                    stimulated the other princes to seize every chance of acquiring like
                    privileges.</p>
                <p>If we except the Golden Bull, the true interest of Charles’s reign is not in his
                    unimportant labours for Germany, but in the movements beyond the range of his
                    influence. It is significant that at this time the Fehmgerichte, for whose
                    origin we must go back to the 12th century, vastly extended the sphere of their
                    activity, and that in the utter absence of central authority they were respected
                    as a rough check upon the lawlessness even of high princes. The cities,
                    notwithstanding every kind of discouragement, formed new associations for mutual
                    defence, or strengthened those which already existed. The Hanseatic League
                    carried on war with the Danish king and forced him to come to terms, and its
                    commerce was extended to nearly every part of the known world. A powerful league
                    was formed by the Swabian towns, but it was defeated in the battle of Altheim by
                    a confederation of princes who regarded its growth with fear and jealousy.</p>
                <p>Wenceslaus (1378-1400), son of Charles IV., and also king of Bohemia, had some
                    good natural qualities; but he had been badly trained, and when he became his
                    own master was indolent and capricious. His bloodhounds had stronger attractions
                    for him than the duties of government, and even more than his father he left
                    Germany to look after itself, The tendency to association became the deepest of
                    the time; princes allied themselves against cities, cities against princes, and
                    nobles against both. For a brief period the prospects of the cities seemed to be
                    splendid, for the Swabian League recovered from the effects of its reverse,
                    extended its relations far and wide, and formed an alliance with the Swiss
                    confederates. The latter won the brilliant victories of Sempach and Näfels, and
                    had the Swabian League taken advantage of the opportunity, it might have
                    definitely gained predominance. But it gave the princes time to reorganize their
                    scattered forces, and in 1388, in the battle of Döffingen, it suffered complete
                    defeat. So crushing was this blow that the Swabian cities were never again so
                    strong, and all over Germany it encouraged the princes to fresh aggression.</p>
                <p>The confusion caused by the king’s neglect of his most elementary duties gave
                    rise to a conspiracy against him, in which Rupert, the elector of the
                    palatinate, took a leading part. Wenceslaus was deposed, and after much intrigue
                    the crown was granted to Rupert (1400-10). He was an excellent elector, and
                    under favourable circumstances would have been a good king; but such were the
                    jealousies and divisions of the state that he found no scope for his energy
                    beyond his native dominions. He made an attempt to reach Rome, but the result
                    covered him with ridicule. After his death Jobst, margrave of Moravia, and
                    Sigismund, king of Hungary, brother of Wenceslaus, were elected by opposing
                    parties. Jobst soon died, and then Sigismund was generally recognized. Sigismund
                    (1410-37) was an intelligent and cultivated prince, but vain, restless, and
                    shifty. He could form great plans, but had not determination to execute them,
                    and was easily moved by flattering counsellors. The commanding questions of his
                    reign were ecclesiastical. It was the age of the great schism, and through all
                    ranks of the church there was an urgent cry for thorough reform. Unfortunately,
                    the council of Constance, summoned mainly through the efforts of Sigismund,
                    marred its labours by the judicial murder of Huss and Jerome of Prague. This
                    atrocious act, for which the king was to a large extent responsible, stirred
                    vehement rage among the Bohemians; and when, after the death of Wenceslaus,
                    Sigismund, as his heir, claimed the crown, they broke into revolt. Led for a
                    time by the blind general Zisca, and afterwards by commanders who, although his
                    inferiors in genius, were of equally resolute temper, they defeated army after
                    army, and spread havoc through the neighbouring German lands.. So divided was
                    Germany, and so poor was Sigismund himself, that for fifteen years he could not
                    collect a force sufficient to put down the rebellion; and he at last succeeded
                    only because the Hussites gradually split into two factions, the Calixtines and
                    Taborites, and he was able to conciliate the less extreme party.</p>
                <p>Sigismund, who was of lavish habits, never had enough money for his wants;
                    sometimes he had even to force himself upon princes and cities as an unwelcome
                    guest, This undignified poverty had one good result. In return for 400,000
                    gulden he granted to his friend Frederick, count of Hohenzollern, first as a
                    pledge, afterwards as a permanent <pb break="no"

                    passed iuto the hands of the family under whom it was destined to become the
                    centre of a mighty kingdom.</p>
                <p>Sigismund was succeeded by Albert, duke of Austria, who, as his son-in-law,
                    became king of Bohemia and Hungary. Although the German crown remained elective,
                    it was henceforth always conferred on a member of the house of Hapsburg until
                    the extinction of the male line; and the same family never willingly lost its
                    grip of the two countries which now fell to it, and of which it ultimately
                    gained complete possession. Albert II. (1438-39) evidently meant well by
                    Germany; but his reign was too short to enable him to do more than indicate his
                    good intentions. He was succeeded by Frederick, duke of Styria. Frederick IV.
                    (1440-93), unfortunately for his subjects, occupied the throne longer than any
                    other sovereign. He was a solemn trifler, obstinate without being firm, and bent
                    on promoting only the interests of his family. The council of Basel having met
                    after the council of Constance, King Albert accepted its reforming decrees; and
                    it appeared probable that the abuses which scandalized Christendom were about to
                    be brought to an end. But Frederick, whose dull mind did not see that in the
                    changed circumstances of the world the papacy could be strong only in proportion
                    to its purity, fancied that in its existing condition it might be made a
                    powerful ally of the empire. He accordingly carried his submissiveness so far as
                    to sign in* 1448 the concordat of Aschaffenburg, perpetuating the very evils
                    from which the church had aimed at delivering itself. After his assent had been
                    obtained it was comparatively easy to overcome the scruples of the princes, so
                    that the chances of a voluntary reformation were lost; the upheaval of the 16th
                    century was rendered inevitable.</p>
                <p>Frederick’s career is one of great importance in Austrian history; he was
                    involved in wars with the Turks, with the Hungarians, with his brothers, and
                    with his own subjects. In 1452 he was crowned emperor, being the last who passed
                    through the ceremony in Rome. He had no influence in Italy; and in Burgundy he
                    could neither check the towering ambition of Charles the Bold, nor after
                    Charles’s death prevent the seizure of the duchy of Burgundy by the French king.
                    In Germany he hardly made a pretence of exercising supreme authority, and many
                    private wars were waged, especially between the cities and the princes. The most
                    famous of these was the margraves’ war, carried on by Albert of Brandenburg with
                    a number of princely allies against Nuremberg, which had the support of the
                    Swiss League and upwards of 70 cities. The war was in every respect a critical
                    one. Had the cities gained they might still have aimed at balancing the power of
                    the princes; but owing partly to their imperfect union, partly to the necessity
                    of fighting with hired troops, they were not successful. They won, indeed, great
                    advantages in the course of the war; but after the conclusion of peace it was
                    felt that on the whole they had decidedly lost ground. After this struggle,
                    which lasted seven years, there could be no doubt as to the element in which the
                    centre of gravity of the state was to be found.</p>
                <p>The princes, however, did not have everything their own way. About this time
                    their power was seriously limited by the formation of diets in nearly all the
                    principalities. These bodies were composed of the mediate prelates, the mediate
                    nobles, and representatives of the mediate cities. They were not summoned
                    because the princes wished their aid, but because arms could be had only with
                    the consent of the nobles, and money only with that of the cities and the
                    clergy. When once formed, the local diets soon extended their functions. They
                    claimed the right of sanctioning taxation; they had something to say as to the
                    expenditure of the public revenues; they insisted on justice beiug administered.
                    Such institutions as these were clearly of the highest importance, and for two
                    centuries they did much to make up for the lack of a genuine monarchy.</p>
                <p>During this reign the conditions of warfare began to be radically changed. The
                    discovery of gunpowder made small bodies of men, properly armed, more than a
                    match for great forces equipped in the mediaeval style. Hence the custom of
                    hiring mercenary troops came into use; and a prince could never feel sure,
                    however numerous his vassals, that the advantage would not rest with his
                    opponent. This fact, added to the influence of the local diets, made even the
                    princes sick of war; and everywhere a demand arose for the reform of the
                    national institutions. In 1488 a great Swabian confederation, consisting of
                    princes, nobles, and towns, was created for the establishment of peace; and its
                    effects were excellent. But obviously no partial remedy of this kind could
                    suffice; it was essential that there should be some central reform by which
                    every part of the kingdom could be effectually reached. Had the proposal been
                    that the imperial authority should be directly strengthened, Frederick would not
                    have objected; but the scheme repeatedly forced upon him was that he should in
                    some form delegate to others the power which theoretically belonged to him, so
                    that it might really be put in force. The emperor doggedly withheld his assent,
                    and the nation impatiently waited in the hope tliat his successor would be more
                    pliant.</p>
                <p>Maximilian I. (1493-1519) mounted the throne with unusual advantages. He was not
                    only lord of the great Austrian lands, but, as husband of the princess Mary,
                    daughter of Charles the Bold, administered the Low Countries and the free county
                    of Burgundy. These territories he soon gave up to their lawful ruler, his son
                    Philip; but the fact that they were in the possession of his family added to his
                    influence, which was still further increased when Philip, by marrying the
                    infanta Joanna, had the prospect of becoming king of Spain. From this time the
                    empire exercised in the affairs of Europe an authority which had not belonged to
                    it for several centuries. The reason was not that the empire itself was
                    stronger, but that the crown was held by princes who were in their own right
                    mighty sovereigns.</p>
                <p>This emperor is often called the last of the knights, and in some respects the
                    name is strikingly appropriate. He had not, indeed, sufficient dignity to rank
                    among the greatest representatives of chivalry. A knight who was also emperor
                    ought not, for instance, as Maximilian did at the siege of Terouenne, to have
                    served a foreign prince for pay. But he possessed many of the more prominent
                    qualities suggested by the word chivalry; he was a man of fascinating manner, a
                    lover of poetry and art, and endowed with a bold and adventurous spirit. Above
                    all, he was a knight in his political opinions. Maximilian never could learn
                    that the world had changed since the time of the Hohenstaufen dynasty; that the
                    old order of society was passing away, and a new order arising, was altogether
                    hidden from him. An irresistible fascination attracted him to the glitter of the
                    mediaeval empire, and the best part of his life he spent in vague schemes for
                    its revival. The agitation for reform in the direction indicated by the princes
                    and the cities met his unqualified disapproval. During the whole course of his
                    reign the diet, which was now composed of three colleges, the electors, the
                    princes, and representatives of the imperial cities, urged him with even greater
                    importunity than it had displayed toward his father, to adapt himself to the
                    circumstances of the time. The only occasions on which it could bend him to its
                    will were when he needed money for his military enterprises; and by taking
                    advantage of these opportunities it obtained bis sanction to the division of the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n514/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0514-0497"/> kingdom into ten circles, each with its own
                    administrators, appointed for the purpose of preventing private war. These
                    institutions were of genuine service, but no other real concession could be
                    wrung from Maximilian. In his first diet, held at Worms in 1495, a permanent
                    public peace was proclaimed, and he unwillingly consented to the formation of an
                    imperial chamber, consisting of a president and assessors, the former to be
                    appointed by the emperor, the latter by the states. This chamber was to judge
                    between princes of the empire, and to act as a court of appeal for parties of
                    lower grade; and partly for the payment of its expenses a tax called the common
                    penny was granted. Maximilian, who was always in straits for money, took much
                    interest in the common penny; but to the imperial chamber, which limited the
                    rights of the crown, he was so persistently hostile that it did no good in his
                    day. An administrative council to which, after his defeat by the Swiss League in
                    1499, he was forced to agree, also failed in consequence of his opposition.</p>
                <p>The famous invasion of Italy by Charles VIII. of France in 1494 brought
                    Maximilian into the field, and ever afterwards he mixed himself up in the
                    confused struggles to the south of the Alps, hoping to assert the ancient claims
                    of the German kings, at least in northern Italy. In 1508 he joined the infamous
                    League of Cambray against the Venetian republic, and at a later time he took
                    part in the conflict of the Holy League against Louis XII. of France. He was
                    everywhere baffled, for his own territories, great as they were, did not suffice
                    for his vast undertakings, and Germany refused to let herself be dragged into
                    conflicts in which she was η <hi rend="subscript"> k</hi> ot directly
                    concerned.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Period of the Reformation.</hi></p>
                <p>Tlιe reign of Maximilian must be regarded as in many respects the end of the
                    Middle Ages. The feudal relation between the king and the princes, and between
                    the princes and their vassals, had become purely nominal. No real control was
                    exerted by the crown over the heads of the various states, and now that war was
                    carried on mainly by mercenary troops, the mediate nobles did not hold their
                    lands on condition of military service. The princes were sovereigns, not merely
                    feudal lords; and by the institution of local diets in their territories an
                    approach was made to modern conceptions of government. The age of war was far
                    indeed from being over, but men had at least begun to see that unnecessary
                    bloodshed is an evil, and that the true outlet for the mass of human energies is
                    not conflict but peaceful industry. By the growth of the cities in social if not
                    in political importance the products of labour were being more and more widely
                    diffused: and it was now incomparably easier than at any previous time for the
                    nation to be moved by common ideas and impulses. The discovery of the New World,
                    the invention of printing, the revival of learning, and many other causes had
                    contributed to effect a radical change in the point of view from which the world
                    was regarded; and the strongest of all mediaeval relations, that of the nation
                    to the church, was about to pass through the fiery trial of the Reformation.
                    Tlιis vast movement, which began in the later years of Maximilian, definitely
                    severed the mediaeval from the modern world.</p>
                <p>The seeds of the Reformation were laid at so remote a time as that of the
                    conflict between the papacy aud the empire. The arrogance and the ambition of
                    the popes then stamped upon the minds of the people an impression that was never
                    effaced. During the temporary struggle of Louis IV. with the popes of his day
                    the old feeling revived with fresh intensity; all classes, clerical as well as
                    lay, looked upon resistance to papal pretensions as a necessity imposed by the
                    national honour. At the same time the spiritual teaching of the mystics awakened
                    in many minds an aspiration which the church, in its corrupt state, could ill
                    satisfy, and which was in any case unfavourable to a merely external authority.
                    The Hussite movement, shaking as it did many ancient beliefs and shattering many
                    ancient institutions, further weakened the spell of the church. Still more
                    powerful, because touching deeper elements of human nature and affecting a more
                    important class, was the influence of the Renaissance, which, towards the end of
                    the 15th century, passed from Italy to the universities of Germany. The men of
                    the new learning did not sever themselves from Christianity, but they became
                    indifferent to it; its conceptions seemed to them dim and faded, while there was
                    a constantly increasing charm in literature, in philosophy, and in art. No kind
                    of effort was made by the church to prepare for the storm which might have been
                    foreseen. The spiritual princes, besides displaying all the faults of the
                    secular princes, had special defects of their own; and as simony was universally
                    practised, the lives of multitudes of the inferior clergy were a public scandal,
                    while their services were cold and unimpressive. The moral sense was outraged by
                    such a pope as Alexander VI.; and neither the military ambition of Julius II.
                    nor the refined paganism of Leo X. could tend to revive the decaying faith in
                    the spirituality of their office. Pope Leo by his incessant demands for money,
                    and his unscrupulous methods of obtaining it, awakened bitter hostility in every
                    class of the community.</p>
                <p>The popular feeling for the first time found expression when Luther, in 1517,
                    nailed to a church door in Wittenberg the theses in which he contested the
                    doctrine at the root of the detestable traffic carried on for the pope by Tetzel
                    and his accomplices. In appearance a slight circumstance, this was in reality an
                    event of vast significance; for it brought to the front, as the exponent of the
                    national sentiment, one of the mightiest spirits whom Germany has produced,—a
                    man who had certainly many faults, but who amply made up for them by the force
                    of his intellect, the loftiness of his aims, and the rare combination of caution
                    and audacity with which he devoted himself to noble causes. Under the influence
                    of Luther’s great personality the most active and progressive elements of the
                    nation were soon in more or less open antagonism to the papacy.</p>
                <p>When Maximilian died, the throne was competed for by his grandson Charles, by
                    Henry VIII. of England, and by Francis I. of France. The first and the last were
                    the only real candidates, and ultimately Charles was chosen. By the time he
                    reached Germany in 1521, Luther had passed through his famous controversy with
                    Eck; he had confronted the papal legate, Cajetan; he had burned the pope’s bull.
                    After this, retreat was impossible; and his innumerable adherents waited with
                    keen excitement to see on which side the new king would declare himself. Charles
                    V. (1520-55), although a boy in years, was not really young. He soon made up his
                    mind as to the general lines of his policy, and no one who knew his grave and
                    obstinate spirit supposed that any influence would cause him to diverge from his
                    path. He had no adequate conception of the strength of the feeling which had
                    been aroused. He fancied, as had at first been imagined in Rome, that he had to
                    deal with a monkish quarrel; at one time he even supposed that a little money
                    would easily set the difficulty at rest. Nor did he ever comprehend the real
                    nature of the questions which stirred the hearts of his subjects. For Charles,
                    although a diplomatist of astonishing skill, was a man of cold and narrow
                    nature; it was incredible to him that men should be genuinely moved by
                    aspirations to which he was himself a stranger. Even if his knowledge had been
                    far more exact, he would not have turned against the church. Since the
                    interregnum none of the emperors, with the exception of Maximilian, had been
                    powerful princes <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n515/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0515-0498"/> apart from the empire, and some of them had been
                    wretchedly poor and insignificant. Maximilian himself could not compete on equal
                    terms with the leading European monarchs. Charles, however, was by far the most
                    important sovereign of his time. He was king of Spain and the Two Sicilies, with
                    the resources of the New World at his command, lord of the Low Countries and of
                    the county of Burgundy, co-regent with his brother Ferdinand of the great
                    Austrian inheritance; and now he had been made king of Germany with a right to
                    the imperial crown. To such a potentate it naturally seemed possible to restore
                    the splendour of Charles the Great, and he early set before himself this ideal.
                    But the protection of the church had always been looked upon as the chief
                    function of the empire; he could not, therefore, desert it at the very time when
                    it seemed to be in need of his services. He reserved to himself the same right
                    as his predecessors to resist it in the realm of politics; in the realm of faith
                    he considered that he owed it his entire allegiance. Moreover, he intended to
                    complete the task at which his grandfather had worked in vain, the subjection of
                    northern Italy; and in order to realize this scheme it was of high importance
                    that he should in no way needlessly offend the pope. Hence, in 1521, in the diet
                    of Worms, without really examining the positions of Luther, Charles issued an
                    edict denouncing him and his followers, and placing him under the ban of the
                    empire.</p>
                <p>Alarmed lest the emperor’s great power should be too freely applied in Germany,
                    the electors had before his appointment exacted a promise that he would respect
                    German liberties and institute the reforms which had been vainly demanded of
                    Maximilian. At the diet of Worms steps were taken to give effect to these
                    conditions. An administrative council was nominated for the government of
                    Germany while Charles should be away; and the imperial chamber was so
                    effectually re-established that, with the auüc council (which was at first
                    subordinate to it, but ultimately became independent), it lasted till the
                    destruction of the empire. A matricula was drawn up settling the number of
                    troops to be raised for common purposes by each state; and this also was in
                    force while the empire existed. Having made these arrangements, Charles invested
                    his brother Ferdinand with the sole authority in the Austrian territories, and
                    then left Germany, to begin soon after his long struggle with Francis I. of
                    France.</p>
                <p>While Charles was absent carrying on his wars with Francis, great disturbances
                    took place in Germany. One of the most remarkable of Luther’s friends was Ulrich
                    von Hutten, a young noble, who, although penetrated by the enthusiasm of the
                    Renaissance, was emphatically a man of action. His class, the nobles, had ever
                    chafed against the supremacy of the princes; and it occurred to him that the
                    Reformation might be made the means of effecting a total change in the
                    constitution of the empire. As no general reform either in church or state could
                    be effected while the nation was cut up into a large number of principalities,
                    his plan was to combine against the princes all who were discontented with the
                    existing order, and to place the emperor at the head of a united country. Then
                    the nobles would obtain their due, peace would be secured throughout the land,
                    and papal authority might be easily put down. The scheme was a great one, and
                    Hutten inspired with his enthusiasm Francis von Sickingen, an energetic and
                    popular Rhenish baron who could at any time attract a large army to his
                    standard. A force of 12,000 men was soon collected, and the enterprise was begun
                    in 1522 by an attack on the elector of Treves, who, being a spiritual prince,
                    would not, it was supposed, receive the sympathy of the reforming party. For a
                    moment it seemed as if this dream of a new empire might be realized; but it was
                    too late to make so vast a change. Several princes united, and in 1523 Sickingen
                    was defeated and slain, while Hutten, who had devoted pen and sword to his
                    cause, died in loneliness and misery on an island in the Lake of Zürich.</p>
                <p>This war was followed by another of a still more serious nature. The peasantry of
                    Germany had grievances compared with which those of the nobles were imaginary,
                    for they were treated as if they had no right to expect any ray of brightness in
                    their dreary lot. Extravagant hopes were kindled among them by the Reformation,
                    and in a few years, notwithstanding all Luther’s efforts to dissuade them,
                    widespread conspiracies were formed. In 1524 war broke out in the greater part
                    of southern and central Germany, and the peasants, aided by a few valiant
                    knights like Götz von Berlichingen, were at first triumphant. But they soon
                    became so violent that Luther himself urged they should be sternly punished; and
                    in 1525, after a vast amount of confusion and bloodshed, the rising was
                    completely suppressed. By these two wars the authority of the princes was made
                    greater than ever; the peasantry suffered if possible more severe oppression,
                    and many even of the immediate nobles were compelled to submit to a yoke which
                    they detested.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the injurious impression caused by the struggles of the peasantry
                    and of the barons, the Reformation made rapid progress, and those who remained
                    loyal to the church became so alarmed that at the diet of Spires in 1526 they
                    clamoured for repressive measures. The administrative council at the head of
                    Germany in Charles’s absence was, however, not unfriendly to the Reformers, and
                    the diet ended by decreeing that, until the questions in dispute should be
                    authoritatively settled, each state should have religious freedom. This proved
                    to be a most important edict. As yet no religious body had been organized to
                    compete with the Catholic Church; now the leading states in which the ideas of
                    the Reformation prevailed began, under the guidance of Luther and Melanchthon,
                    to carry out measures which they had in vain hoped the church itself, by means
                    of a general council, would undertake. The Catholics saw clearly the
                    significance of what was done; and at another diet held in Spires in 1529 they
                    obtained, in opposition to the previous edict, a new decree, forbidding further
                    changes in religion. The supporters of Luther formally protested; but the
                    Catholics maintained their ground. In the following year the emperor, who was no
                    longer an untried youth, but a sovereign famous for skill in council and success
                    in war, came to Germany for the express purpose of making an end of heresy. At
                    the diet he held in Augsburg the Lutherans submitted a summary of their
                    doctrines in the Augsburg Confession, which had been drawn up, with the sanction
                    of Luther, by Melanchthon, and which was afterwards regarded as their chief
                    standard of faith. Charles made no real effort to comprehend the controversy; he
                    was resolved, whether the heretics had right on their side or not, that they
                    should submit, and he had at first no doubt that he would awe them into
                    submission by an unwonted display of power and splendour. To his surprise the
                    Lutheran princes, while perfectly respectful, continued firm, and not only
                    declined to attend mass, but held Lutheran services in their own quarters.
                    Paying no attention to the edict of Spires of 1526, he renewed that’which he had
                    issued at Worms in 1521; and it seemed more than probable that if it were not
                    obeyed he would soon have recourse to arms.</p>
                <p>But fresh difficulties with France, and a threatened invasion of the Turks, who
                    had besieged Vienna in 1529, forced him to mask his designs. In 1532 he granted
                    the religious peace of Nuremberg, which conceded temporary toleration to the
                    adherents of the Augsburg Confession, and this peace was repeatedly confirmed in
                    the following years. Meanwhile, the Lutherans, both princes and cities, had
                    increased their power by forming the League of Smalkald, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n516/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0516-0499"/> and this confederation ultimately took in,
                    besides many cities of South Germany, most of the North-German cities and
                    principalities. The Reformation in Germany was above all things a popular
                    movement. It sprang directly from the heart of the nation, and, the conditions
                    favourable to it being widely spread, it passed with extraordinary speed from
                    one part of the country to another. Thus many princes, who would not of their
                    own accord have deserted the church, were compelled to do so from political
                    motives. They had been strong enough to undermine imperial authority; they were
                    not strong enough to resist the pressure of the majority of their subjects.</p>
                <p>His hands being full elsewhere, Charles was obliged to temporize during his
                    second absence from Germany, and to send counsels of moderation to his brother
                    Ferdinand, who had been elected king of the Romans. He never, however, gave up
                    his original purpose. His plan was, when he should have leisure to devote
                    himself to the task, to secure the meeting of a general council which should
                    make all necessary reforms, and to insist, at whatever cost, on the Lutherans
                    abiding by its decisions. The peace of Crespy, signed in 1544, gave him free
                    scope; and he began by inducing Pope Paul III. to summon the council which
                    ultimately met at Trent. At the same time he made vigorous preparations for war.
                    He affected that he had no intention of fighting for religious objects, but
                    merely wished to bring to subjection certain states which had set him at
                    defiance. By these means he was able to detach from the League of Smalkald the
                    reforming states which were without real enthusiasm, or which were too timid to
                    enter upon a great struggle. Those which took up arms were so disunited that the
                    troops sent to Charles from Italy and the Low Countries had no difficulty in
                    joining him; and in 1546 he not only made himself master of the South-German
                    Lutheran cities, but in the battle of Mühlberg completely routed the Saxons and
                    took their elector, John Frederick, prisoner. Shortly afterwards the landgrave
                    Philip of Hesse, who with the Saxon elector had been the main political support
                    of Lutheranism, fell into his hands, and both were treated with great harshness.
                    Charles took advantage of his triumph to issue what was called the “Interim,” a
                    confession which was to be obligatory on the Lutheran states until the council
                    then sitting should conclude its labours. It was everywhere resisted, but most
                    of the states had at least outwardly to submit. All Germany thus seemed to be at
                    the emperor’s feet. The Reformation had enabled him to deal both with the
                    princes and the imperial cities as no sovereign had dealt with them for five
                    centuries.</p>
                <p>. But his triumph was too great to be enduring. The Catholic princes themselves
                    were alarmed at his predominance; King Ferdinand was alienated by his attempts
                    to secure the crown for his son Philip; and the Lutheran princes chafed angrily
                    under his severe rule. The general discontent found a representative in Maurice,
                    a subtle and ambitious Saxon prince, who, caring little about doctrinal disputes
                    but a great deal about the increase of his own importance, had sided with
                    Charles against the Lutherans, and had been rewarded by being made John
                    Frederick’s successor. He now turned, under the influence of what motives it is
                    hard to determine, and plotted against the emperor, forming an alliance with the
                    chief Lutheran princes xnd with Henry II. of France, who eagerly caught the
                    opportunity to profit by the dissensions in the empire. Charles heard vague
                    rumours of what was going on; but he had been thrown off his guard by the ease
                    with which he had hitherto attained his will, and carelessly trusted to chance.
                    Suddenly, in 1552, Henry II. invaded Germany as protector of her liberties, and
                    Charles learned that Maurice was marching rapidly to Innsbruck with the
                    intention of making him prisoner. He fled, and all the advantages he had gained
                    by the battle of Mühlberg were at once lost. Within six months he had to sign
                    the treaty of Passau, agreeing that a diet should be summoned for the purpose of
                    arriving at a new settlement, and that in the meantime Lutherans and Catholics
                    should have like privileges. In 1555 the religious peace of Augsburg was
                    concluded by the diet thus promised.</p>
                <p>Henry II. had seized the bishoprics of Metz, Verdun, and Toul; and Charles
                    endeavoured at the earliest possible opportunity to win them back. But his
                    efforts failed; and thus in his last years the power he fancied he had
                    thoroughly humbled began a series of depredations which were thenceforth to be
                    continued at frequent intervals. Disgusted with his ill fortune, he handed over
                    the government of Germany to his brother Ferdinand in 1555, having in the
                    previous year entrusted Spain, the Two Sicilies, and the Low Countries to his
                    son Philip.</p>
                <p>The peace of Augsburg, instead of bringing tranquillity, was the cause of fresh
                    discord. The toleration it conceded did not include the Calvinist or Reformed
                    faith; only the Lutherans received liberty of worship. And even aLutheran was
                    not tolerated unless his prince chose to let him alone; for each secular state
                    had the right to eject from its territory all who did not accept the doctrine it
                    established. Thus Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist were exposed to irritating
                    despotism; and each came to regard the other with hearty detestation. Another
                    source of trouble was a clause in the treaty called the ecclesiastical
                    reservation. It required that if a spiritual prince accepted the Augsburg
                    Confession he should-forthwith resign his lands. The Lutherans denied the
                    validity of this clause; and notwithstanding the protests of the Catholics
                    several prelates became Lutherans and kept their territories as secular
                    possessions.</p>
                <p>Ferdinand I. (1556-64), who, like all German sovereigns after him, was recognized
                    as emperor without being crowned by the pope, had at one time been distinguished
                    for his zeal for the church. But the experience of his brother had taught him
                    the necessity of prudence; and he was also kept quiet by troubles in Bohemia and
                    Hungary, both of which countries he had acquired by marriage, and to both of
                    which the house of Hapsburg soon began to lay hereditary claim. He tried to
                    moderate the excesses of each party, and was anxious that the council of Trent
                    should follow a conciliatory policy. Maximilian II. (1564-76), one of the most
                    enlightened princes of his time, adopted the same line. He would have had the
                    state withdraw altogether from religious disputes, and so sincerely did he carry
                    out his principles that, although he was himself a Catholic, Protestant
                    doctrines spread during his reign throughout the Austrian hereditary lands, from
                    which they had hitherto been excluded. Rudolf II. (1576-1612) reversed the
                    policy of his immediate predecessors. The Jesuits, who had been hard at work,
                    although without much success, during his father’s reign, gained complete
                    ascendency over him; and acting on their advice he continually warred against
                    the Protestants. But he was too weak to do much good to his friends or injury to
                    his enemies. Trained in the gloomy court of Spain, he had come to be of a moody,
                    variable temperament; and he was given to outbursts of violent passion, followed
                    by abject submission to his advisers. So much confusion sprang from his
                    incompetence that the archdukes of Austria, with the sanction of the Spanish
                    branch of the house of Hapsburg, met in 1606, and placed the government of the
                    hereditary lands in the hands of his brother Matthias. He took refuge among his
                    Bohemian subjects, who, in 1609, wrung from him a royal charter, granting
                    religious freedom to the nobles, knights, and cities, with the right to build
                    churches on their own and the royal lands. Matthias, who succeeded him as
                    emperor (1612-19), was almost as unfit <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0517-0500"/> for the duties he assumed. He put forth his whole
                    energy against Protestantism; but he could not in the least discourage it, and
                    in his time it prevailed over by far the larger part of the Austrian
                    territory.</p>
                <p>By this time, however, there were signs of a great Catholic reaction which was to
                    work fearful havoc in Germany. It was due mainly to the persistent zeal of the
                    Jesuits. For a long time the Protestants absorbed the intellectual strength of
                    the country; but many able scholars and divines among the Jesuits could hold
                    their own with their antagonists, who afforded them excellent vantage ground by
                    foolish and bitter controversies. These devoted missionaries of the church gave
                    their attention mainly to the young; and during the reign of Rudolf they were
                    fortunate enough to make a profound impression upon two princes, each of whom
                    was destined to play a great part in the events of the time. These princes were
                    Maximilian, duke of Bavaria, and Ferdinand, duke of Styria. The former early
                    showed the fruit of his training by executing, in 1606, an unjust imperial
                    mandate against the Protestant city of Donauwörth, and afterwards treating it as
                    his own. The Protestant princes, rendered suspicious by this arbitrary act,
                    formed in 1608 a confederation called the Union, which was to last for ten
                    years; and in response the Catholics, under the guidance of Maximilian, to whom
                    they gave the command, united in a similar confederation called the League. As
                    the Union was headed by the elector palatine, who was a Calvinist, many
                    Lutherans, among them the Saxon elector, regarded it coldly. It acquired,
                    however, immense importance by an alliance with Henry IV. of France, who, like
                    Henry II., wished to profit by German quarrels. War was on the point of breaking
                    out between the two confederations in regard to the Juliers-Cleves territory;
                    but the Union did not venture to fight after the sudden death of the French
                    king.</p>
                <p>Ferdinand was even more vigorous than his friend in the defence of his religion.
                    His faith was that of a genuine fanatic, narrow, intense, austere; and with the
                    feelings of a monk rather than of a secular ruler, he began at once, on assuming
                    the government of Styria, to extirpate Protestantism. Individuals and families
                    were driven without mercy from their homes until at last a country which had
                    been mainly Protestant became in appearance altogether Catholic. He was the heir
                    of Matthias; and on coming to Vienna after the death of that sovereign, he found
                    himself in the midst of what seemed hopeless confusion. The Bohemians,
                    embittered by the violation of the royal charter granted by Rudolf, refused to
                    acknowledge him as king, and elected Frederick V. of the palatinate, son-in-law
                    of James I. of England; and the people of Hungary and of the Austrian lands,
                    terrified by the prospect of a stern rule in opposition to their religious
                    beliefs, were almost in open revolt. He succeeded in obtaining the imperial
                    crown; and from that time Ferdinand II. (1619-37) was dominated by a fixed
                    resolve to secure the triumph of his church throughout the empire,—a resolve
                    which cost Germany the Thirty Years’ War.</p>
                <p>He began with Bohemia. Although supported by Spain, he could not obtain from her
                    sufficient troops for his purpose: and as he was for some time nea&lt;rly
                    powerless in Vienna he was obliged to come to terms with Duke Maximilian, who,
                    after securing his own interests, put the army of the League commanded by Tilly
                    at his disposal. The Union helped Frederick V.; but being a man of feeble
                    character he wasted precious months, needlessly irritated his subjects, and
                    vaguely hoped that his wife’s father would see him out of his embarrassments. In
                    1620 his army was utterly routed at the battle of Weissenburg; and he and his
                    family had just timeto escape from the kingdom he had rashly undertaken to
                    govern. Ferdinand drove to the uttermost the advantages of his victory. The
                    Union was broken up; and Bohemia was placed under such a system of government
                    that in becoming Catholic it lost more than two-thirds of its population, sank
                    from high prosperity to a state of indigence, and ceased to be a seat of art and
                    learning. The Spanish troops and the army of the League next invaded the
                    palatinate, which after severe struggles, was finally subdued; and there also
                    the process of conversion was carried on with a thoroughness which ended in the
                    death or exile of multitudes of the inhabitants. Frederick was banished from his
                    inheritance; and the electorate he was declared to have forfeited was conferred
                    on Duke Maximilian.</p>
                <p>Thus ended the first stage of the Thirty Years’ War. The second began (1625) by
                    the formation, after much fruitless negotiation, of the Protestant League, which
                    comprised England, Holland, and Denmark. The burden of the struggle fell on the
                    last-named power, whose king, Christian IV., was also duke of Holstein, and
                    therefore a prince of the empire. It was in the war with him that Europe first
                    became familiar with the great name of Wallenstein, a Bohemian noble who, by
                    marriage and by loyal service to the emperor, had risen to immense wealth and
                    power. Ferdinand became restive at his dependence on the League, and gladly
                    accepted Wallenstein’s offer to raise an army over which it should have no
                    control. This scheming, mysterious general, cooperating with Tilly and soon
                    casting him into the shade, chased Christian, after the battle of Lutter, into
                    Denmark, and overran Mecklenburg, of which he was created duke. He apparently
                    intended to make himself master of the Hanse towns with the view of securing
                    predominance at sea as well as on land; but this purpose was thwarted by the
                    bravery of the city of Stralsund, which he in vain tried to conquer. Denmark,
                    however, was compelled to conclude peace in 1629.</p>
                <p>Intoxicated by success, Ferdinand now issued the edict of restitution, demanding
                    the restoration of all ecclesiastical lands of which the Protestants had become
                    possessed since the treaty of Passau. As two archbishoprics and twelve
                    bishoprics had become Protestant, this was to strike a tremendous blow at his
                    enemies; and it stirred among them intense and universal opposition. At the same
                    time, yielding to Duke Maximilian and other members of the League, he recalled
                    Wallenstein, whose movements had given rise to suspicion. A more inauspicious
                    moment could not have been chosen for these two important steps, for in 1630
                    Gustavus Adolphus left Sweden at the head of a well-disciplined army for the
                    purpose of raising up the Protestant cause which had fallen so low. At first
                    this great king was received coldly, even by his co-religionists. They wçre
                    ignorant of his designs, and did not want a stranger to profit by the internal
                    disputes of their country. A mistake at the outset would probably have proved
                    fatal to him; but he saw the dangers of his position, and moved so warily that
                    in less than a year he had obtained, partly by intimidation, partly by argument,
                    the alliance of the duke of Pomerania and the elector of Saxcny. Tilly, at the
                    head of nearly the whole force of the League, met him at Breitenfeld, and was
                    completely defeated. This victory put Germany at his feet; and had he realized
                    how utterly he had broken the imperial strength, he might have advanced on
                    Vienna itself. He preferred, however, to make the country around and behind him
                    absolutely secure; and everywhere the cities opened their gates to him as the
                    deliverer of the Protestants. After again defeating Tilly, who was wounded and
                    died, he took possession of the palace at Munich, while Duke Maximilian fled.
                    Whatever may have been the motives of Gustavus in undertaking this memorable
                    expedition,—and they were probably not altogether unselfish,—he had the power of
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n518/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0518-0501"/> kindling confidence and enthusiasm among those
                    who depended upon him; and the result of his presence in South Germany was that
                    the faith of the Protestants in their cause and in themselves revived, and that
                    they no longer doubted of ultimate victory. The emperor felt how great had been
                    his mistake in dismissing Wallenstein, and after many fruitless entreaties, at
                    last persuaded him to come forth from his retirement and form a second army. He
                    did so on condition that he should have absolute command; and so urgent was the
                    need of his services that Ferdinand allowed him to make himself in this way a
                    great and dangerous power within the state. In 1632 he was defeated at the
                    battle of Lützen; but the defeat was better than an ordinary victory, for the
                    Swedish hero was among the slain. Wallenstein now aimed at becoming a great
                    sovereign; perhaps he even aspired to the imperial crown itself. In any case his
                    dilatory movements, his endless intrigues, and his haughty tone caused such
                    profound uneasiness at Vienna that in 1634 he was got rid of by murder.</p>
                <p>For fourteen years longer, although the original objects of the war were almost
                    forgotten, the tempest continued to sweep over Germany. It received a fresh
                    impetus from the intervention of Cardinal Richelieu, who, although the enemy of
                    Protestants in France, thought fit to weaken Austria by aiding them in Germany.
                    While Gustavus Adolphus lived, Richelieu was kept comparatively in the
                    background; after the king’s death he was one of the mainsprings of the war. At
                    last, in 1648, after five years of negotiation at Osnabrück and Münster, the
                    peace of Westphalia was concluded.</p>
                <p>The Thirty Years’ War settled once for all the principle that men should not be
                    persecuted for their religious faith. It is true that the peace of Westphalia
                    formally recognized only the three creeds, Catholicism, Lutheranism, and
                    Calvinism, but so much suffering had been caused by the interference of the
                    state with individual conviction, that toleration in the largest sense, so. far
                    as law was concerned, was virtually conceded. This was the sole advantage gained
                    from the war by the Protestants. The Catholics insisted at first on keeping all
                    the ecclesiastical lands which had been taken from them before the edict of
                    restitution in 1630. The Protestants responded by demanding that they should
                    lose nothing which they had held before 1618, when the war began. A compromise
                    was at last effected by both parties agreeing to the date 1624,—an arrangement
                    which secured to the Catholics their immense gains in Bohemia and the other
                    territories of the house of Hapsburg. The restoration of the elector palatine to
                    part of his lands, and his reinstatement in the electoral office, were important
                    concessions; but on the other hand, the duke of Bavaria kept the Rhenish
                    palatinate, and, as he remained an elector, the votes of the Protestants in the
                    electoral college were fewer by one than they had been in 1618.</p>
                <p>The country suffered enormous territorial losses by the war. Up to this time the
                    possession of Metz, Toul, and Verdun by France had never been officially
                    recognized; now these bishoprics were formally conceded to her. She also
                    received as much of Alsace as belonged to Austria. To the Swedes were granted
                    Western Pomerania, with Stettin, and the bishoprics of Bremen and Verden. These
                    acquisitions, which surpassed the advantages Gustavus Adolphus had hoped to win,
                    gave Sweden the command both of the Baltic and of the North Sea. In virtue of
                    her German possessions Sweden became a member of the empire; but France obtained
                    absolute control of her new territories. There was a further diminutioα of
                    Germany by the recognition of the independence of Switzerland and the United
                    Provinces. Both had long been virtually free; they now for the first time took
                    the position of distinct nations.</p>
                <p>In the political constitution of Germany the peace of Westphalia did not so much
                    make changes as sanction those already effected. The whole tendency of the
                    Reformation had been to relax the bonds which united the various elements of the
                    state to each other and to their head. It divided the nation into two bitterly
                    hostile parties, and the emperor was not able to assume towards them a perfectly
                    impartial position. His imperial crown imposed upon him the necessity of
                    associating himself with the Catholics; so that the Protestants had a new and
                    powerful reason for looking upon him with jealousy, and trying to diminish his
                    authority. The Catholics, while maintaining their religion, were willing enough
                    to co-operate with them for this object; and Germany often saw the strange
                    spectacle of princes rallying round the emperor for the defence of the church,
                    and at the same time striking deadly blows at his political influence. The diet
                    was a scene of perpetual quarrelling between the two factions, and their
                    differences made it impossible for the imperial chamber to move beyond the
                    region of official routine. Thus before the Thirty Years’ War the empire had
                    virtually ceased to exist, Germany having become a loose confederation of
                    principalities and free cities. For a moment the emperor Ferdinand appeared to
                    have touched the ideal of Charles V., in so far, at least, as it related to
                    Germany, but only for a moment. The stars in their courses fought against him,
                    and at the time of his death he saw how far beyond his power were the forces
                    with which even Charles had been unable to contend. The state of things which
                    actually existed the peace of Westphalia made legal. So nearly complete was the
                    independence of the states that each received the right to form alliances with
                    any of the others or with foreign powers, nominally on condition that their
                    alliances should not be injurious to the emperor or to the empire. Any authority
                    which still lawfully belonged to the emperor was transferred to the diet. It
                    alone had now the power of making laws, of concluding treaties in the name of
                    Germany, and of declaring war and re-establishing peace. No one, however,
                    expected that it would be of any real service. After 1654 it became a permament
                    body, and was attended only by the representatives of the princes and the
                    cities; and from that time it occupied itself mainly with trifles, leaving the
                    affairs of each state to be looked after by its own authorities, and those of
                    the country generally to such fortunes as chance should determine.</p>
                <p>It would not have been strange if so shadowy an empire had been brought
                    altogether to an end. Some slight bond of connexion was, however, necessary for
                    defence against common dangers; and the empire had existed so long, and so many
                    great associations were connected with it, that it seemed to all parties
                    preferable to any other form of union. Moreover, Sweden, and other states which
                    were now members of the empire, warmly supported it; and the house of Hapsburg,
                    on which it reflected a certain splendour, would not willingly have let it die.
                    An Austrian ruler, even when he spoke only in the name of Austria, derived
                    authority from the fact that as emperor he represented many of the greatest
                    memories of European history.</p>
                <p>The effect of the Thirty Years’ War on the national life was disastrous. It had
                    not been carried on by disciplined armies, but by hordes of adventurers whose
                    sole object was plunder. The cruelties they inflicted on their victims are
                    almost beyond conception. Before the war the population was about twenty
                    millions; after it the number was probably five or seven millions, and cannot
                    have been more than ten. Whole towns and villages were laid in ashes, and vast
                    districts turned into deserts. Churches and schools were closed by hundreds, and
                    to such straits were the people often reduced that cannibalism is said to have
                    been not uncommon. Industry and trade were so completely paralysed that in 1635
                    the Hanseatic League was virtually broken up, because the members, once so
                    wealthy, could <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0519-0502"/> not meet the expenditure it involved. The
                    population was not only impoverished and reduced in numbers but broken in
                    spirit. It lost confidence in itself, and for a time effected in politics,
                    literature, art, and science little that is worthy of serious study.</p>
                <p>The princes knew well how to profit by the national prostration. The local diets,
                    which, as we have seen, formed a real check on petty tyranny, and kept up an
                    intimate relation between the princes and their subjects, were nearly all
                    destroyed. Those which remained were injurious rather than beneficial, since
                    they often gave an appearance of lawfulness to the caprices of arbitrary
                    sovereigns. After the Thirty Years’ War it became fashionable for the heirs of
                    principalities to travel, and especially to spend some time at the court of
                    France. Here they readily imbibed the ideas of Louis XIV., and in a short time
                    every petty court iu Germany was a feeble imitation of Versailles. Before the
                    Reformation, and even for some time after it, the princes were thorough Germans
                    in sympathies and habits; they now began to be separated by a wide gulf from
                    their people. Instead of studying the general welfare, they cruelly wrung from
                    exhausted states the largest possible revenue to support a lavish and ridiculous
                    expenditure. The pettiest princeling had his army, his palaces, his multitudes
                    of household officers; and most of them pampered every vulgar appetite without
                    respect either to morality or decency. Many nobles, whose lands had been wasted
                    during the war, flocked to the little capitals to make their way by contemptible
                    court services. Beneath an outward gloss of refinement these nobles were, as a
                    class, coarse and selfish, and they made it their chief object to promote their
                    own interests by fostering absolutist tendencies. Among the people there was no
                    public opinion to discourage despotism; the majority accepted their lot as
                    inevitable, and tried rather to reproduce than to restrain the vices of their
                    rulers. Even the churches offered little opposition to the excesses of persons
                    in authority, and in many instances the clergy, both Protestant and Catholic,
                    acquired an unenviable notoriety for their readiness to overlook or condone
                    actions which outraged the higher sentiments of humanity. In the free imperial
                    cities there was more manliness of tone than elsewhere, but there was little of
                    the generous rivalry among the different classes which had once raised them to a
                    high level of prosperity. Most of them resigned their liberties into the hands
                    of oligarchies, and others allowed themselves t⅛ be annexed by ambitious
                    princes.</p>

                <p>Ferdinand III. (1637-57) succeeded to the throne when the fortunes of his house
                    were at a low ebb, and he continued the Thirty Years’ War, not in the hope of
                    re-establishing the Catholic religion or of restoring the imperial authority,
                    but to undo as much as he could the havoc caused by his father’s recklessness.
                    After the conclusion of peace nothing happened to make his reign memorable. His
                    son, Leopold I. (1658-1705), was a man of narrow intellect and feeble will; yet
                    Germany seldom so keenly felt the need of a strong emperor, for she had during
                    two generations to contend with a watchful and grasping rival. For more than a
                    century it had been the policy of France to strengthen herself by fostering the
                    internal dissensions of Germany. This was now easy, and Louis XIV. made
                    unscrupulous use of the advantages his predecessors had helped to gain for him.
                    Germany as a whole could not for a long time be induced to resist him. His
                    schemes directly threatened the independence of the princes; but they were too
                    indolent to unite against his ambition. They grudged even the contributions
                    necessary for the maintenance of the frontier fortresses, and many of them
                    stooped to accept the bribes he offered them on condition that they should
                    remain quiet. In his war with the United Provinces and Spain, begun in 1672, he
                    was opposed by the emperor as ruler of Austria, and by Frederick William, the
                    elector of Brandenburg; and in 1675 the latter gained a splendid victory at
                    Fehrbellin over his allies, the Swedes. At the end of the war, in 1678, by the
                    peace of Nimeguen, Louis took care that Frederick William was deprived of the
                    fruits of his victory, and Austria had to resign Freiburg in Breisgau to the
                    French. Under the pretence that when France gained the Austrian lands in Alsace
                    she also acquired a right to all places that had ever been united to them, Louis
                    began a series of systematic robberies of German towns and territories.
                    “Chambers of Reunion” were appointed to give an appearance of legality to these
                    proceedings, which culminated, in 1681, in the seizure of Strasburg. Germans of
                    all states and ranks were indignant at so gross a humiliation, but even the loss
                    of Strasburg did not suffice to move the diet. The emperor himself might
                    probably have interfered, but Louis had provided him with ample employment by
                    stirring up against him the Hungarians and the Turks. So complete was his hold
                    over the majority of the princes that when the Turks, in 1683, surrounded
                    Vienna, and appeared not unlikely to advance into the heart of Germany, they
                    looked on indifferently, and allowed the emperor to be saved by the promptitude
                    and courage of Sobieski, king of Poland. At last, when, in 1689, on the most
                    frivolous pretext, Louis poured into south Germany armies which were guilty of
                    shameful outrages, a number of princes came forward and aided the emperor. This
                    time France was sternly opposed by the league of which William III. of England
                    was the moving spirit; and although at the end of the war he kept Strasburg, he
                    had to give up Freiburg, Philipsburg, Breisach, and the places he had seized
                    because of their former connexion with Alsace. In the war of the Spanish
                    succession two powerful princes, the elector of Bavaria and the elector of
                    Cologne, joined Louis; but as the states of the empire declared war against him
                    in 1702, the other princes, more or less loyally, supported the emperor and his
                    allies. Leopold died during the progress of this war, but it was vigorously
                    continued by his son Joseph I. (1705-11). Charles VI. (1711-40) also went on
                    with it; and such were the blows inflicted on France by the victories of
                    Blenheim, Ramillies, and Malplaquet that the war was generally expected to end
                    in her utter discomfiture. But the conclusion of the treaty of Utrecht by
                    England, in 1713, so limited the military power of Charles VI. that he was
                    obliged to resign the claims of Austria to the Spanish throne, and to content
                    himself with the Spanish Netherlands, Milan, Naples, and Sardinia. He cared so
                    little for Germany, as distinguished from Austria, that he allow <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> ed Louis to compel the diet to cede the imperial
                    fortress of Landau. At a later stage in his reign he was guilty of an act of
                    even grosser selfishness; for after the war of the Polish succession, in which
                    he supported the claims of Augustus III., elector of Saxony, he yielded Lorraine
                    to Leszczynski, whose claims had been defended by France, and through whom
                    France ultimately secured this beautiful German province. Having no son, Charles
                    drew up in 1713 the pragmatic sanction, which ordained that, in the event of an
                    Austrian ruler being without male heirs, his hereditary lands and titles should
                    pass to his nearest female relative. The aim of his whole policy was to secure
                    for this measure, which was proclaimed as a fundamental law in 1724, the
                    approval of Europe; and by promises and threats he did at last obtain the
                    guarantee of the states of the empire and the leading European powers.</p>
                <p>Germany was now about to be aroused from the torpor into which she had been cast
                    by the Thirty Years’ War; but her awakening was due, not to the action of the
                    empire, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n520/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0520-0503"/> which was more and more seen to be practically
                    dead, but to the rivalry of two great German states, Austria and Prussia. The
                    latter had long been laying the foundations of her power. Brandenburg, the
                    centre of the Prussian kingdom, was, as we have seen, granted in the Iðth
                    century by the emperor Sigismund to Frederick, count of Hoheu-zollern. In his
                    hands, and in those of his prudent successors, it became one of the most
                    flourishing of the North-German principalities. At the time of the Reformation
                    Albert, a member of a subordinate branch of the house of Hohenzollern, happened
                    to be grand master of the Teutonic Order. He became a Protestant, dissolved the
                    order, and received in fief of the king of Poland the duchy of Prussia. In 1611
                    this duchy fell by inheritance to the elector of Brandenburg, and by the treaty
                    of Wehlau, in 1657, in the time of Frederick William, the Great Elector, it was
                    declared independent of Poland. By skill, foresight, and courage Frederick
                    William managed to add largely to his territories; and in an age of degenerate
                    sovereigns he was looked upon as an almost model ruler. His son, Frederick,
                    aspired to royal dignity, and in 1701, having obtained the emperor’s assent, was
                    crowned king of Prussia. The extravagance of Frederick drained the resources of
                    his state, but this was amply atoned for by the rigid economy of Frederick
                    William I., who not only paid off the debts accumulated by his father, but
                    amassed an enormous treasure. He so organized all branches of the public service
                    that they were brought to a point of high efficiency, and his army was one of
                    the largest, best appointed, and best trained in Europe. He died in 17 40, and
                    within six months, when Frederick II. was on the Prussian throne, Maria Theresa
                    claimed, in virtue of the pragmatic sanction, the lands and hereditary titles of
                    her father, Charles VI.</p>
                <p>Frederick II., a young, ambitious, and energetic sovereign, longed not only to
                    add to his dominions but to play a great part in European politics. His father
                    had guaranteed the pragmatic sanction, but as the conditions on which the
                    guarantee had been granted had not been fulfilled by Charles VI., Frederick did
                    not feel bound by it, and revived some old claims of his family on certain
                    Silesian duchies. Maria Theresa would not abate her rights, but before she could
                    assert them Frederick had entered Silesia and made himself master of it.
                    Meanwhile, the elector of Bavaria had come forward and disputed Maria Theresa’s
                    right to the succession, and the elector of Saxony had also put in a claim to
                    the Austrian lands. Taking advantage of these disputes, France formed an
                    alliance with the two electors and with the king of Prussia against Austria; and
                    in the war which followed the allies were at first so successful that the
                    elector of Bavaria, through the influence of France, was crowned emperor as
                    Charles VII. (1742-45). Maria Theresa, a lady of a noble and undaunted spirit,
                    appealed, with her infant son, afterwards Joseph II., in her arms, to the
                    Hungarian diet, and the enthusiastic Magyars responded chivalrously to her call.
                    To be more at freedom she concluded peace with Frederick, and ceded Silesia to
                    him, although greatly against her will. Saxony also was pacified and retired
                    from the struggle. After this Maria Theresa, supported by England, made way so
                    rapidly and so triumphantly that Frederick became alarmed for his new
                    possession; and in 1742 he once more proclaimed war against her, nominally in
                    aid of the emperor, Charles VII. Ultimately, in 1748, she was able to conclude
                    an honourable peace at Aix-la-Chapelle; but she had been forced, as before, to
                    rid herself of Frederick by confirming him in the sovereignty of the territory
                    he had seized.</p>
                <p>After the death of Charles VII., Francis, grand duke of Tuscany, Maria Theresa’s
                    husband, was elected emperor. Francis I. (1745-65), an amiable nonentity, with
                    the instincts of a shopkeeper, made no pretence of discharging important
                    imperial duties, and the task of ruling the hereditary possessions of the house
                    of Hapsburg fell wholly to the empress-queen. »She executed it with discretion
                    and vigour, so that Austria in her hands was known to be one of the most
                    formidable powers in the world. Her rival, Frederick II., was, if possible,
                    Stillmore active. The bitter experiences of his youth, although they had soured
                    his temper, had not quenched the generous aspirations which had been fed by
                    study of the best writers of his time. It did not occur to him, any more than to
                    the other German sovereigns of the 18th century, to associate his people with
                    him in the government of the country; he was in every respect a thoroughly
                    absolute sovereign. Even his ministers performed but the duties of superior
                    clerks. But he shared the highest ideas of the age respecting the
                    responsibilities of a king, and throughout his long reign acted in the main
                    faithfully as “the first servant of the state.” The army he always kept in
                    readiness for war; but he also encouraged peaceful arts, and diffused throughout
                    his kingdom so much of his own alert and aggressive spirit that the Prussians
                    became more intelligent and more wealthy than they had ever before been. He
                    excited the admiration of the youth of Germany, and it was soon the fashion
                    among the petty princes to imitate his methods of government. As a rule, they
                    succeeded only in raising far larger armies than the taxpayers could afford to
                    maintain.</p>
                <p>Maria Theresa never gave up the hope of winning back Silesia, and, in order to
                    secure this object, she laid aside the jealousies of her house, and offered to
                    conclude an alliance with France. Frederick had excited the envy of surrounding
                    sovereigns, and had embittered them against him by stinging sarcasms. Not only
                    France, therefore, but Russia, Saxony, and ultimately Sweden, willingly came to
                    terms with Austria, and the aim of their union was nothing short of the
                    partition of Prussia. Frederick, gaining knowledge of the plot, turned to
                    England, which had in the previous war helped Austria. At the close of 1755 his
                    offer of an alliance was acceded to; and in the following year, hoping by
                    vigorously taking the initiative to prevent his enemies from united action, he
                    invaded Saxony, and began the Seven Years’ War (1756-63).</p>
                <p>The result of this war was to confirm Prussia for ever in the possession of
                    Silesia, but it was followed by still greater indirect consequences. Prussia now
                    took rank as one of the leading European powers, and by her rise a new element
                    was introduced into the political life of Germany. Austria, although associated
                    with the empire, could no longer feel sure of her predominance, and it was
                    inevitable that the jealousies of the two states should lead to a final conflict
                    for supremacy. Even before the Seven Years’ War there were signs that the German
                    people were tired of incessant imitation of France, for in literature they
                    welcomed the early efforts of Klopstock, Wieland, and Lessing; but the movement
                    received a powerful impulse from the great deeds of Frederick. The nation, as a
                    whole, was proud of his heroic courage, his splendid military qualities, and his
                    beneficent rule, and began, for the first time since the Thirty Years’ War, to
                    feel that it might once more assume a commanding place in the world. This stir
                    of life ultimately revealed itself in the outburst of philosophic and literary
                    activity represented by the names of Kant, Goethe, and Schiller. By that time
                    Germany had not only asserted intellectual independence, but had become
                    thoroughly tired of the national disunion and of the petty despotisms it imposed
                    upon them.</p>
                <p>In 1772 the necessities of Frederick’s position compelled him to join Russia and
                    Austria in the deplorable partition of Poland, whereby he gained West Prussia,
                    exclusive of Dantzic and Thorn, and Austria acquired West Silesia. After this he
                    had to watch closely the movements of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0521-0504"/> emperor Joseph II. (1765-90), who, although an
                    ardent admirer of Frederick, was anxious to restore to Austria the greatness she
                    had partially lost. The younger branch of the Wittelsbach line, which had
                    hitherto possessed Bavaria, having died out in 1777, Joseph asserted claims to
                    part of its territory. Frederick intervened, and although no battle was fought
                    in the nominal war which followed, the emperor was obliged to content himself
                    with a very unimportant concession. He made a second attempt in 1785, but
                    Frederick again came forward. This time he formed a league for the defence of
                    the imperial constitution, and it was joined by the majority of the small
                    states. The memory of this league was almost blotted out by the tremendous
                    events which soon absorbed the attention of Germany and the world, but it truly
                    indicated the direction of the political forces which were then at work beneath
                    the surface, and which long afterwards triumphed. The formation of the league
                    was a distinct attempt on the part of Prussia to make herself the centre for the
                    national aspirations both of northern and of southern Germany.</p>
                <p>The French Revolution was hailed by many of the best minds of Germany as the
                    opening of a new era. Among the princes it excited horror and alarm, and in 1792
                    the emperor Leopold II. (1790-92), and Frederick William II, the unworthy
                    successor of Frederick the Great, met at Pillnitz, and agreèd to support by arms
                    the cause of the French king. A more important resolution was never taken. It
                    plunged Europe into a conflict which cost millions of lives, and which overthrew
                    the entire state system of the Continent. Germany herself was the principal
                    sufferer. The structure which the princes had so laboriously built up crumbled
                    into ruins, and the mistakes of centuries were expiated in an agony of disaster
                    and humiliation.</p>
                <p>The states of the empire joined Austria and Prussia, and, had there been hearty
                    co-operation between the allies, they could scarcely have failed of success.
                    While the war was in progress, in 1793, Prussia joined Russia in the second
                    partition of Poland. Austria considered herself overreached, and began
                    negotiations with Russia for the third and final partition, which was effected
                    by the three powers in 1795. Prussia, irritated by the proceedings of her rival,
                    did as little as possible in the war with France; and in 1795 she retired from
                    the struggle, ceding to France her possessions on the left bank of the Rhine.
                    The war was continued by Austria, but her power was so effectually shattered by
                    blow after blow that in 1797 she was forced to conclude the peace of Campo
                    Formio. Napoleon Bonaparte, to whose genius the triumph of France was mainly
                    due, began separate negotiations with the states of the empire at Rastadt; but,
                    before terms could be agreed upon, war again began in 1799, Austria acting on
                    this occasion as the ally of England and Russia. She was beaten, and the peace
                    of Lunéville added fresh humiliations to those imposed upon her by the previous
                    war. France now obtained the whole of the left bank of the Rhine, the
                    dispossessed princes being compensated by grants of secularized church lands and
                    of mediatized imperial cities. The contempt of Napoleon for the empire was
                    illustrated by his occupation of Hanover in 1803, and by his seizure of the duke
                    of Enghien on imperial territory in 1804. In 1805 Austria once more appealed to
                    arms in association with her former allies, but in vain. By the peace of
                    Presburg she accepted more disastrous terms than ever, and for the moment it
                    seemed as if she could not again hope to rise to her former splendour. In this
                    war she was opposed not only by France, but by Bavaria, Würtemberg. and Baden,
                    all of which were liberally rewarded for their services, the rulers of the two
                    former countries being proclaimed kings. The degradation of Germany was
                    completed by the formation, in 1806, of the Confederation of the Rhine, which
                    was composed of the chief central and southern states. The welfare of the empire
                    was asserted to be its object, but a body of which Napoleon was the protector
                    existed, of course, for no other purpose than to be a menace to Austria and
                    Prussia. Francis II., who had succeeded Leopold II. in 1792, now resigned the
                    imperial crown, and thus the empire and the German kingdom came to an end. The
                    various states, which had for centuries been virtually independent, were during
                    the next few years not connected even by a nominal bond.</p>
                <p>Frederick William III. (1797-1840) of Prussia, the successor of Frederick William
                    II., had held selfishly aloof from the struggle of Austria with France. Alarmed
                    by the Confederation of the Rhine, he suddenly resolved on war. Napoleon gladly
                    accepted the challenge, and Prussia was so ill-prepared for the contest she had
                    invited that the first serious battle—the battle of Jena—prostrated her at his
                    feet. Aided by Russia, the king held out some time longer; but when, after the
                    battle of Friedland, in 1807, the czar was detached from the alliance, Frederick
                    William had to sign the treaty of Tilsit, by which he was deprived of the best
                    part of his kingdom and of more than half his subjects.</p>
                <p>In 1809 Austria made one more attempt to retrieve her fortunes, and at first not
                    without success. After the battle of Wagram, however, Napoleon dictated peace
                    from Vienna.</p>
                <p>Germany was now thoroughly in the grip of France, and the French emperor proved
                    how absolute was his power by annexing, in 1810, the whole northern coast as far
                    as the Elbe. The completeness of the humiliation of Germany was the means of her
                    deliverance. She had been taught self-respect by Frederick II., and by her great
                    writers in literature aud philosophy; it was felt to be intolerable that in
                    politics she should do the bidding of a foreign master. Among a large section of
                    the community patriotism became for the first time a consuming passion, and it
                    was stimulated by the counsels of several manly teachers, among whom the first
                    place belongs to Fichte. The Governments responded prudently to the national
                    movement. Even in Austria timely concessions were made to her various
                    populations. Prussia, under the guidance of her great minister Stein,
                    reorganized her entire administration. She abolished serfdom, granted municipal
                    rights to the cities, established an admirable system of elementary and
                    secondary education, and invited all classes to compete for civil offices; and
                    ample means were provided for the approaching struggle by drastic military
                    reform. Napoleon had exacted an engagement that the Prussian army should be
                    limited to 42,000 men. This was fulfilled in the letter, but in spirit set
                    aside, for one body of men was trained after another until the larger part of
                    the male population were in a position, when a fitting opportunity should occur,
                    to take up arms for their country.</p>
                <p>The disastrous retreat of the French from Moscow in 1812 gave Germany the
                    occasion she desired. In 1813 Prussia formed an alliance with Russia, which was
                    ultimately joined by Austria, and in the great battle of Leipsic the issue was
                    virtually settled. The first peace of Paris was soon followed by the escape of
                    Napoleon from Elba; but in the battle of Waterloo he was decisively overcome,
                    and Europe had no more to fear from his ambition. The Germans believed that by
                    the second peace of Paris they ought to have received back all the lands which
                    had ever been taken froιη, them by France, but they had to content themselves
                    with the recovery of their boundary as it had existed in 1792.</p>
                <p>Between the conclusion of the first and the second peace of Paris the congress of
                    Vienna had met and finished its labours. It was hard to reconcile the
                    conflicting claims of so many states, and no party was fully satisfied with the
                    compromise arrived at. The kingdom of Westphalia, and several other states set
                    up by Napoleon, were brought to an <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n522/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0522-0505"/> end. Prussia was compensated for her losses by
                    receiving a part of Saxony, the Rhineland, and Swedish Pomerania; and to Austria
                    were restored Salzburg, Vorarlberg, and Tyrol. Most of the members of the
                    Rhenish Confederation were either left alone or deprived of small portions of
                    territory; Hanover was made a kingdom; Weimar, Mecklenburg, and Oldenburg became
                    grand duchies; and Lübeck, Bremen, Hamburg, and Frankfort were declared free
                    cities.</p>
                <p>In regard to the political constitution of Germany, the people were prepared for
                    great and far-reaching changes. The need of union had been impressed upon them
                    by the bitter experiences of nearly a generation, and they would have welcomed
                    the establishment of a vigorous empire. But the jealousies of Austria and
                    Prussia, and the hostility of the petty princes, prevented the popular policy
                    from being adopted. Instead of an empire the congress formed the German bund or
                    confederation. It was composed of 39 states, each of which was to be independent
                    in regard to its internal affairs, the confederation taking cognizance only of
                    matters of common interest. A permanent diet, in which each state should have
                    its representative, was formed; it was to sit in Frankfort, and to be presided
                    over by the Austrian plenipotentiary. This body was to settle all disputed
                    questions between the various states, each of which engaged never to make war on
                    any of the others, nor to form alliances which should be injurious to a member
                    of the bund.</p>
                <p>The events which arose from the French Revolution had awakened in the German mind
                    not only a passionate desire for unity but an equally intense wish for freedom.
                    Growing intelligence had revealed to the people that personal rule is
                    ill-adapted to the wants of a civilized community, especially the personal rule
                    of such men as the majority of their princes, who clung obstinately to every
                    kind of abuse, and regarded their functions as a means rather of glorifying
                    themselves than of promoting the general welfare. Humiliating as had been their
                    submission to France, it had done something to deepen this conviction, for in
                    the districts ruled by French officials a higher idea of human rights was
                    introduced than had before prevailed, and what was great and attractive in the
                    principles of the Revolution stirred general sympathy. So urgent were the
                    demands for free government that, while the struggle with Napoleon remained
                    undecided, the princes made lavish promises of concession after peace should be
                    restored. The act of confederation contained a positive decree that in each
                    state should be established a constitutional system.</p>
                <p>The history of the next period is little more than a history of the elaborate and
                    pitiful devices by which the German sovereigns evaded their engagements. Within
                    a few years, indeed, the rulers of Nassau, Weimar, Bavaria, Baden, and
                    Wurtemberg granted constitutions, but even in these countries absolutism was
                    only in a slight degree modified. In Austria, where Prince Metternich was the
                    controlling spirit, the most diverse nationalities were governed as if they had
                    been a single people, and the methods of rule were as despotic and harsh as
                    could be tolerated in a modern community. Although Frederick William III. of
                    Prussia could not act upon quite so antiquated a system as Francis L, he
                    resisted popular aspirations. The utmost concession he made was to appoint a
                    number of provincial diets, which tended rather to foster than to allay the
                    general discontent. Every opportunity was seized by the various Governments to
                    repress the free movement of ideas. A number of students were guilty of some
                    follies at a festival in the Wartburg, and some time afterwards a fanatical
                    youth stabbed Kotzebue, the playwright, who had sided with the reactionary
                    party. These incidents were held to be symptoms of a grave peril; and in 1819 a
                    conference of ministers at Carlsbad issued what were called the Carlsbad
                    decrees, placing the universities under police supervision, reviving a rigid
                    censorship, and opposing the cession of state constitutions. A central
                    commission of inquiry was also appointed for the purpose of hunting out secret
                    societies, the very existence of which was merely subject of conjecture. In the
                    diet, whose authority was slighted by these decrees, there were several members
                    favourable to a conciliatory policy; and in the small states liberal politicians
                    continued to demand parliamentary representation. The reactionists, however,
                    were united and determined, and succeeded in thwarting political progress until
                    1830. Even in that year the Prussian and Austrian Governments were able to hold
                    on in their old path, but the French Revolution caused so loud an outcry in
                    countries in which the police were less powerful, that Hanover, Brunswick,
                    Saxony, and Hesse-Cassel received constitutions, and in the lands where
                    parliaments already existed the Governments granted freedom of the press, and
                    promised more liberal legislation for the future. The two leading powers looked
                    upon these changes with extreme disapproval, and they soon made use of the diet
                    as a means of virtually annulling every measure that conflicted with their own
                    aims. When the diet was instituted, it had been hoped that it would ultimately
                    lead to closer national unity, and to the establishment of modern political
                    institutions. It was now seen to be a mere instrument in the hands of the
                    enemies both of unity and of liberty. So soon did the princes pluck up courage
                    that in 1837 Ernest Augustus, who succeeded William IV. of England as king of
                    Hanover, abolished the constitution which his predecessor had sanctioned, and
                    set up another of an earlier period and of a far less liberal character. This
                    unlawful act met with resistance which had to be put down by force. An appeal on
                    behalf of the constitution was made to the diet, but with the result that was to
                    be expected from its previous action; it declined to consider the question.</p>
                <p>During this dismal period almost the sole political event on which Germans can
                    look back with pleasure is the formation of the Zollverein or customs union. As
                    in all other respects, the bund had failed to realize the expectations it had
                    excited respecting the abolition of injurious restrictions on commerce. Several
                    attempts had been made by groups oi states to regulate their customs, but none
                    of them had been attended with much success. At last Prussia arrived at an
                    understanding with Bavaria, Wurtemberg, and several other states, and between
                    1833 and 1835 the union thus formed was joined by all German countries with the
                    exception of Austria. It happened that about this time railways began to be
                    introduced. The customs union enabled the nation to derive from them the utmost
                    possible benefit, so that the prevalent political confusion did not hinder the
                    population from attaining to considerable material prosperity. The obvious
                    advantages of commercial union deepened the desire for unity in every great
                    department of the national life, and at the same time raised the position of
                    Prussia, which had been wise enough to associate itself with a most important
                    movement.</p>
                <p>It was not only by its relation to the customs union that Prussia attracted the
                    attention and awakened the hopes of German liberals. In 1840 Frederick William
                    IV. (1840-61) succeeded his father, and, as he was known to be a thoughtful and
                    cultivated prince, there was a general expectation that he would abandon the
                    arbitrary ideas of Frederick William III. He began his reign well. For some
                    years the Government had been in conflict with the Catholic Church; the struggle
                    was at once ended by graceful concessions. The king pardoned political

                    welcomed to the Berlin University the brothers Grimm, who, with five other
                    professors, had been driven from Göttingen for protesting against the violence
                    of Ernest Augustus. But it soon became manifest that Frederick William’s
                    favourite conception of “the Christian state” did not include auy genuine
                    exercise of political power by the nation; he wished to rule in a more
                    enlightened spirit than his father, but not less absolutely. It was arranged
                    that the provincial diets established by Frederick William III. should meet
                    periodically, but this was a poor substitute for the great positive measures
                    which had been anticipated. And within a very few years “the Christian state”
                    was found to be compatible with a strict censorship, with the arbitrary
                    punishment of schoolmasters, clergymen, and judges who did not meet the approval
                    of the Government, and generally with incessant and irritating interference with
                    the private life of the individual. The king lost all the popularity he had
                    acquired in the early days of his reign by vaguely enthusiastic promises, and
                    impartial observers saw that he and his people must sooner or later enter upon a
                    serious struggle. A like state of things existed all over Germany. The German,
                    Hungarian, Slavonic, and Italian subjects of the emperor Ferdinand (1835-48),
                    who succeeded Francis I., were all agitating for reform; and in Bavaria,
                    Hesse-Cassel, and Baden reactionary ministers were confronted by opponents who
                    daily acquired increased influ nee among the masses of the population.</p>
                <p>In so many threatening forms did the rising spirit of the Prussian people reveal
                    itself that in 1847 the king summoned to Berlin a united diet composed of the
                    representatives of the provincial diets. This assembly truly expressed the
                    popular feeling, but with so much moderation, and accompanying its demands by so
                    many sincere assurances of loyalty, that it could not alarm the most timid.
                    Frederick William, however, was offended by its tone, and haughtily proclaimed
                    that he would never abate the rights which, as a lawful prince, he held by a
                    higher than human authority.</p>
                <p>Such was the condition of Germany at the breaking out of the French revolution of
                    1848. Its effect upon the public mind was immediate and profound. It had been
                    made clear that no dependence was to be placed upon the engagements of the
                    sovereigns, and that if anything was to be done it must be done by the people
                    themselves. At a convention in Mannheim four demands were formulated— freedom of
                    the press, trial by jury, national armies, and national representation. These
                    demands were universally adopted as the liberal programme; and within a few days
                    there was a liberal ministry in every one of the small states. In Bavaria, King
                    Louis, whose well-meant efforts to make Munich a centre of art had not induced
                    the nation to forget its political rights, resigned the crown to his son
                    Maximilian. The popular excitement in Austria became so intense that Prince
                    Metternich was dismissed, constitutional government was promised, and the
                    Hungarians received a new cabinet. Still more vehement was the revolutionary
                    movement in Prussia. Scenes of great violence occurred in the streets of Berlin,
                    and on the 18th of March the king, who had previously tried to allay the storm
                    by announcing that the united diet should meet periodically,—a concession he had
                    refused to make at the proper moment,—declared that the national desire for a
                    constitution should be satisfied. There was, however, a general feeling of
                    distrust, and a conflict, which continued till the following morning, broke out
                    between the troops and the population. Frederick William, who, although an
                    ardent upholder of the divine right of kings, was too kind-hearted aman and too
                    timid to approve of a struggle of this kind, laid aside his high pretensions,
                    changed his ministers, and asserted that he would place himself at the head of
                    the national movement. By these means a more pacific temper was restored, and,
                    after the united diet had passed an electoral law, the country was called upon
                    to choose a national assembly.</p>
                <p>It was not only reform in the individual states that was demanded in 1848; the
                    majority of the people felt that the time had come for sweeping away the effete
                    bund which had done service only to the enemies of freedom, and for replacing it
                    by a system of national representation which should maintain the dignity of
                    Germany abroad and foster enlightened institutions at home. There was, indeed, a
                    general conviction' that only by means of a great central movement could the
                    special agitations lead to enduring results. A number of deputies, belonging to
                    different legislative assemblies, taking it upon themselves to give voice to the
                    national demands, met at Heidelberg, and a committee appointed by them invited
                    all Germans who then were, or who had formerly been, members of diets, as well
                    as some other public men, to meet at Frankfort for the purpose of considering
                    the question of national reform.</p>
                <p>About 500 representatives accepted the invitation. They constituted themselves a
                    preliminary parliament, and at once began to provide for the election of a
                    national assembly. It was decided that there should be a representative for
                    every group of 50,000 inhabitants, and that the election should be by universal
                    suffrage. A considerable party wished that the preliminary parliament should
                    continue to act until the assembly should be formed, but this was overruled, the
                    majority contenting themselves with the appointment of a committee of 50, whose
                    duty it should be in the interval to guard the national interests. Some of those
                    who were discontented with this decision retired from the preliminary
                    parliament, and a few of them, of republican sympathies, called the population
                    of Upper Baden to arms. The rising was put down by the troops of Baden, but it
                    did considerable injury by awakening the fears of the more moderate portion of
                    the community. Great hindrances were put in the way of the elections, but, as
                    the Prussian and Austrian Governments were too much occupied with their
                    immediate difficulties to resist to the uttermost, the assembly was at last
                    chosen, and met at Frankfort on the 18th May. The old diet broke up, and the
                    national representatives had before them a clear field. There is no reason to
                    doubt that if they had acted with promptitude and discretion they would have
                    succeeded in the task they had undertaken. Neither Austria nor Prussia was for
                    some time in a position to thwart them, and the sovereigns of the smaller states
                    were too much afraid of the revolutionary elements manifested on all sides to
                    give way to reactionary impulses. But the Germans had had no experience of free
                    political life. Nearly every deputy had his own theory of the course which ought
                    to be pursued, and felt sure that the country would go to ruin if it were not
                    adopted. Learned professors and talkative journalists insisted on delivering
                    interminable speeches, and on examining in the light of ultimate philosophical
                    principles every proposal laid before the assembly. Thus precious time was lost,
                    violent antagonisms were called forth, the patience of the nation was exhausted,
                    and the reactionary forces were able to gather strength for once more asserting
                    themselves. The very first important question brought out the weaknesses of the
                    deputies. This related to the nature of the central provisional executive. A
                    committee appointed to discuss the matter suggested that there should be a
                    directory of three members, appointed by the German Governments, subject to the
                    approval of the assembly, and ruling by means of ministers responsible to the
                    latter body. This elaborate scheme found favour with a large number of members,
                    but others insisted that there should be a president or a central committee,
                    appointed by the assembly, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n524/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0524-0507"/> while another party pleaded that the assembly
                    itself should exercise executive as well as legislative functions. At last,
                    after a vast amount of tedious and useless discussion, it was agreed that the
                    assembly should appoint an imperial vicar who should carry on the government by
                    means of a ministry selected by himself; and, by the decision of a large
                    majority, the archduke John of Austria was chosen for the office. With as little
                    delay as possible he formed an imperial cabinet, aud there were hopes that, as
                    his appointment was generally approved both by the sovereigns and the people,
                    more rapid progress would be made with the great and complicated work in hand.
                    Unfortunately, however, it was necessary to enter upon the discussion of the
                    fundamental laws, a subject presenting many opportunities for the display of
                    rhetoric and intellectual subtlety. It was soon obvious that beneath all
                    varieties of individual opinion there w ere two bitterly hostile
                    tendencies—those of the republicans, and those of the constitutionalists. These
                    two parties attacked each other with constantly growing animosity, and in a few
                    weeks sensible men outside the assembly gave up all hope of their dealing
                    satisfactorily with the problem they had been appointed to solve.</p>
                <p>In the midst of these disputes the attention of the nation was occupied by a
                    question which had arisen before the outbreak of the revolutionary
                    movements,—the so-called “Schleswig-Holstein question.” In 1846 Christian VIII.
                    of Denmark had officially proclaimed that Schleswig and the greater part of
                    Holstein were indissolubly connected with the Danish monarchy. This excited
                    vehement opposition among the Germans, on the ground that Holstein, although
                    subject to the king of Denmark, was a member of the German confederation, and
                    that in virtue of ancient treaties it could not be severed from Schleswig. In
                    1848 the German party in the duchies, headed by Prince Frederick of
                    Augustenburg, rose against the Danish Government. Frederick VII., who had just
                    succeeded Christian VIII., put down the rebellion, but Prussia, acting in the
                    name of the confederation, despatched an army against the Danes, and drove them
                    from Schleswig. The Danes, who were supported by Russia, responded by blockading
                    the Baltic ports, which Germany, having no navy, was unable effectually to
                    defend. By the mediation of England an armistice was concluded, and the Prussian
                    troops evacuated the northern districts of Schleswig. As the Danes soon
                    afterwards took possession of Schleswig again, the Prussians once more drove
                    them back, but on the 26th of August an armistice of seven months was agreed
                    upon at Malmoe.</p>
                <p>The new Frankfort Government disapproved the conditions of this armistice; but,
                    as it had empowered Prussia to act for it, it was obliged to accept what had
                    been done. The majority of the assembly, furious at an arrangement which was
                    denounced as a national humiliation, decided that the armistice should not be
                    sanctioned. The ministry resigned; but, a new combination being .impossible, it
                    was replaced, and the assembly unwillingly agreed to accept the armistice, on
                    the understanding that the Government should lose no time in negotiating for
                    peace on fair terms. A large minority, however, was intensely dissatisfied. It
                    was composed of the republicans and other radical sections; and when defeated,
                    they appealed from the assembly to the people. The Government kept its place,
                    but was unable to prevent a rising which led to the murder of two unpopular
                    representatives. There were also temporary republican agitations in Baden and
                    Würtemberg.</p>
                <p>While these events were in progress, it seemed not impossible that the Austrian
                    empire would fall to pieces. Bohemia and the Italian states were in revolt, and
                    the Hungarians strove with passionate earnestness for independence. Towards the
                    end of 1848 Vienna was completely in the hands of the revolutionary party, and
                    it was retaken only after desperate fighting. A reactionary ministry, headed by
                    Prince Schwarzenberg, was then raised to power, and in order that a strong
                    policy might be the more vigorously pushed forward, the emperor Ferdinand
                    resigned, and was succeeded by his nephew, Francis Joseph.</p>
                <p>The prospects of reform were not much more favourable in Prussia. The assembly
                    summoned amid the revolutionary excitement of March met on the 22d May. Demands
                    for a constitutional system were urged with great force, and they would probably
                    have been granted but for the opposition due to the violence of politicians out
                    of doors. The aristocratic class saw ruin before it if the smallest concession
                    were made to popular wishes, and it soon recovered from the terror into which it
                    had been plunged at the outbreak of the revolution. Extreme antagonism was
                    excited by such proposals as that the king should no longer be said to wear his
                    crown “by grace of God;” and the animosity between the liberal and the
                    conservative sections was driven to the highest pitch when, in the midst of the
                    struggle between the populace and the Government in Vienna, it was proposed that
                    Prussia should support the cause of freedom. The motion, although at first
                    rejected, was passed in a modified form. Before this, ministry after ministry
                    had been appointed, but none had been so decidedly reactionary as to preclude
                    the hope of a settlement. Now the king resolved to break finally with the
                    liberals, and, notwithstanding a solemn warning addressed to him by a deputation
                    from the assembly, he called to office a cabinet about whose intentions there
                    could be no misunderstanding. On the pretext that fair deliberation was
                    impossible in the capital, the assembly was ordered to meet in Brandenburg,
                    troops were concentrated near Berlin, and a state of siege was proclaimed. In
                    vain the assembly protested and continued its sittings, going even so far as to
                    forbid the payment of taxes while it was subjected to illegal treatment. It was
                    forced in the end to submit, but the discussions in Brandenburg were no more
                    successful than those in Berlin« At last, on the 5th December, the king
                    dissolved the assembly, granted a constitution about which it had not been
                    consulted, and gave orders for the election of a representative chamber.</p>
                <p>About the time that the Prussian parliament was thus created, and that the
                    emperor Ferdinand resigned, the Frankfort assembly succeeded in formulating the
                    fundamental laws, which were duly proclaimed to be the fundamental laws of
                    Germany as it was now to be constituted. The principal clauses of the
                    constitution then began to be discussed. By far the most difficult question was
                    the relation in which Austria should stand to the Germany of the future. There
                    was a universal wish that the Austrian Germans should be included in the German
                    state; on the other hand, it was felt that if all the various*nationalities of
                    Austria formed a united monarchy, and if this monarchy as a whole were included
                    in the confederation, it would necessarily overshadow Germany, and expose her to
                    unnecessary external dangers. It was therefore resolved that, although a German
                    country might be under the same ruler as non-German lands, it could not be so
                    joined to them as to form with them a single nation. Had the assembly adopted
                    this resolution at once, instead of exhausting itself by pedantic disquisitions
                    on the abstract principles of jurisprudence, it might have hoped to triumph; but
                    Austria was not likely to submit to so severe a blow at the very time when she
                    was strong enough to appoint a reactionary Government, and had nearly
                    re-established her authority, not only in Vienna, but in Bohemia and in Italy.
                    Prince Schwarzenberg took the earliest opportunity to declare that the empire
                    could not assent to any weakening of its influence<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n525/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0525-0508"/>. Bitter strife now broke out in the assembly. Two
                    of the ministers resigned, and one of those who took their place, Herr von
                    Gagern, proposed that, since Austria was to be a united state, she should not
                    enter the confederation, but that her relations to Germany should be regulated
                    by a special act of union. This of course meant that Prussia should be at the
                    head of Germany, and recommended itself to the majority of the constitutional
                    party. It was resisted by the Austrian members, who were supported by the
                    ultramontanes and the democrats, both of whom disliked Prussia, the former
                    because of her Protestantism, the latter because of her bureaucratic system.
                    Herr von Gagern’s proposal was, however, adopted. Immediately afterwards the
                    question as to the character of the executive was raised. Some voted that a
                    directory of princes should be appointed, others that there should be a
                    president, eligible from the whole German nation; but the final decision was
                    that the headship of the state should be offered by the assembly to some
                    particular German prince, and that he should bear the title of emperor of the
                    Germans.</p>
                <p>The whole subject was as eagerly discussed throughout the country as in
                    Frankfort. Austria firmly opposed the idea of a united German state, insisting
                    that the Austrian emperor could not consent to be subordinate to any other
                    prince. She was supported by Bavaria, but on the other side were Prussia,
                    Brunswick, Baden, Nassau, Mecklenberg, and various other countries, besides the
                    Hanseatic towns. F or some time Austria offered no counter scheme, but she
                    ultimately proposed that there should be a directory of seven princes, the chief
                    place being held alternately by a Prussian and an Austrian imperial vicar.
                    Nothing came of this suggestion, and in due time the assembly proceeded to the
                    second reading of the constitution. It was revised in a democratic sense, but
                    the imperial title was maintained, and a narrow majority decided that it should
                    be hereditary. Frederick William IV. of Prussia was then chosen emperor.</p>
                <p>All Germany awaited with anxiety the reply of Frederick William. It was thought
                    not improbable that he would accept the honour offered him, for in the early
                    part of his reign he had spoken of German unity as enthusiastically as of
                    liberty, and, besides, the opportunity was surprisingly favourable. The larger
                    number of the North-German states were at least not unwilling to submit to the
                    arrangement; and Austria, whose opposition in ordinary circumstances would have
                    been fatal, was paralysed by her struggle with Hungary. Frederick William had
                    not, however, the courage of his opinions; the deputation which waited upon him
                    was dismissed with the answer that he could not assume the imperial title
                    without the full sanction of the princes and the free cities.</p>
                <p>This answer was in reality a deathblow to the hopes of German patriots, but the
                    assembly affected to believe that its cause was not yet lost, and appointed a
                    committee to see that the provisions of the constitution were carried out. A
                    vigorous agitation began in the country for the acceptance of the constitution
                    by the Governments. The king of Wurtemberg was forced to accede to it; and in
                    Saxony, Baden, and Rhenish Bavaria armed multitudes kept the sovereigns in
                    terror. Prussia, which, following the example of Austria, had recalled her
                    representatives from Frankfort, sent her troops to put down these risings, and
                    on the 21st May 1849 the larger number of the deputies to the assembly
                    voluntarily resigned their seats. A few republican members held on by it, and
                    transferred the sittings to Stuttgart. Here they even elected an imperial
                    Government, but they had no longer any real influence, and on the 18th June they
                    were forcibly dispersed by the Würtemberg ministry.</p>
                <p>Although Frederick William had refused to become emperor, he was unwilling to
                    miss altogether the opportunity afforded by the difficulties of Austria. He
                    invited tho states to send representatives to Berlin to discuss the condition of
                    Germany; and he concluded a treaty with the kings of Saxony and Hanover. Two
                    days afterwards the three allies agreed upon a constitution which was in many
                    respects identical with that drawn up by the Frankfort assembly. The functions
                    of the executive were, however, extended, the electoral law was made less
                    democratic, and it was decided that, instead of an emperor, there should be
                    merely a supreme chief aided by a college of princes. This constitution was
                    accepted by a number of states, which assumed the name of the “The Union,” and
                    on the 20th March 1850 a parliament consisting of two houses met in Erfurt. Both
                    houses accepted the constitution; and, immediately after they broke up, the
                    members of the Union assembled in Berlin, and a provisional college of princes
                    was elected. By that time, however, the whole situation of Germany had changed.
                    In the autumn of 1849 Austria had succeeded, by the help of Russia, in quelling
                    the Hungarian insurrection, and she was then in no mood to let herself be thrust
                    aside by Prussia. Encouraged by her, Hanover and Saxony had severed themselves
                    from the Union, and Saxony, Würtemberg, and Bavaria arrived at an understanding
                    as to a wholly new constitution. Afterwards all four states, with several
                    others, accepted the invitation of Austria to consider the propriety of
                    re-establishing the Confederation. The representatives of the states favourable
                    to this proposal came together in Frankfort on the 4th September 1850, and acted
                    as the restored diet.</p>
                <p>Thus the issue to which the events of about a century had been pointing was
                    apparently raised; Germany was divided into two hostile parties, one set of
                    states grouping themselves around Austria, another around Prussia. A difficulty
                    which arose in Hesse-Cassel almost compelled the powers to bring their
                    differences to the test of war. In this small state the liberal movement of 1848
                    had been followed by reaction, and the elector ventured to replace Hassenpflug,
                    the unpopular minister who had been driven from power. Hassenpflug, being
                    detested by the chamber, dissolved it in June 1850; but the new one was not less
                    hostile, and refused to sanction the collection of the taxes until it had
                    considered the budget. For this offence it also was dissolved, and orders were
                    issued for the raising of the taxes without its consent. Many officials refused
                    to obey; the judges remained loyal to the constitution; and when attempts were
                    made to solve the difficulty by the army, the officers instructed to act
                    resigned in a body. Meanwhile, Hassenpflug had appealed to the representatives
                    in Frankfort who claimed to be the restored diet, and under the influence of
                    Austria they resolved to support him. Prussia, on the other hand, announced its
                    determination to carry out the principles of the Union, and to maintain the
                    Hessian constitution. Austrian and Bavarian troops having entered Hesse, a
                    Prussian army immediately occupied Cassel, and war appeared to be imminent.
                    Prussia, however, shrank from the conflict. Radowitz, the foreign minister, who
                    had so far pursued a vigorous policy, retired, and was replaced by Manteuffel,
                    who, although the whole Prussian army was mobilized, began by making
                    concessions. The Union was dissolved; and after Austria had despatched an
                    ultimatum formulating her demands, the new minister met Prince Schwarzenberg at
                    Olmütz, and virtually yielded everything he insisted upon. The difficulty in
                    Hesse was to be left to the decision of the German Governments; and as soon as
                    possible ministerial conferences were· to be held in Dresden, with a view to the
                    settlement of the German constitution.</p>
                <p>These conferences began in the last days of 1850. The Austrian Government strove
                    to secure the appointment of a stronger executive than had hitherto existed; but
                    its proposals met with steady opposition from Prussia. Every <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0526-0509"/> Prussian scheme was in like manner resisted by
                    Austria. Thus, from the sheer inability of the assembled ministers to devise a
                    plan on which all could agree, Prussia and the states that had joined her in the
                    Union were compelled to recognize the Frankfort diet. From the 12th June 1851
                    its sittings went on as if nothing had occurred since it was dispersed.</p>
                <p>This wretched fiasco was hardly less satisfactory to the majority of Germans than
                    the manner in which the national claims in Schleswig-Holstein were maintained.
                    The armistice of Malmoe having expired in March 1849, the war with Denmark was
                    resumed. A considerable army was despatched against the Danes by the Frankfort
                    Government, but on the 10th July an armistice was signed at Berlin for six
                    months, and a year afterwards Prussia concluded peace. The inhabitants of the
                    duchies, however, continued the war. During the interview at Olmütz between
                    Count Manteuffel and Prince Schwarzenberg it was agreed that, like the affairs
                    of Hesse-Cassel, those of Schleswig-Holstein should be submitted to the decision
                    of all German states, but that, in the meantime, Prussia and Austria should act
                    together. By the intervention of Austrian troops peace was restored; and when,
                    early in 1852, the Government of Denmark, in providing a constitution for the
                    whole monarchy, promised to appoint separate ministers for Schleswig and
                    Holstein, and to do equal justice to the German and the Danish populations, the
                    two powers declared themselves satisfied, and the Austrian forces were
                    withdrawn. The diet also, after some delay, professed to be content with this
                    arrangement. While it was discussing the subject, a conference of the European
                    powers met in London, and settled that Frederick VII. of Denmark should be
                    succeeded by Christian, duke of Glücksburg, and that the duchies should be
                    indissolubly united to the Danish monarchy. Austria and Prussia accepted the
                    protocol setting forth these results, but it was not signed by the diet.</p>
                <p>In all these later events the first place had been taken by Austria. The
                    temporary dissolution of the customs union in 1851 gave her an opportunity of
                    trying to extend her influence; she demanded that a union " should be formed of
                    which she should be the leading member. A congress of all German states, with
                    the exception of Prussia and one or two states which sympathized with her, -was
                    held in Vienna; and it was followed by several other congresses favourable to
                    Austrian pretensions. Prussia, however, being here on strong ground, refused to
                    give way; and not only was the customs union restored in accordance with her
                    wishes, but Austria concluded with her in 1853 a treaty of commerce which
                    embodied some important concessions.</p>
                <p>Germany had now fairly entered a period which, although it did not last very
                    long, was, in some respects, as humiliating as any in her history. The popular
                    movement, from which great things had been hoped, had on some occasions almost
                    touched its goal; and, as might have been expected, a reaction set in, which the
                    princes knew how to turn to the fullest advantage. The Austrian Government,
                    after the subjection of Hungary, withdrew every concession it had made under
                    pressure, and established a thorough despotism, trampling upon the rights of the
                    individual nationalities, and forcing all its subjects into a common political
                    mould. In Prussia the parliament, summoned by the king on the 5th December 1848,
                    met early in the following year. Although the democrats had declined to vote, it
                    was not conservative enough for the court, and not till the 31st January 1850
                    was an understanding arrived at respecting the constitution. The system thus
                    established was repeatedly revised, and always with the same object— to reduce
                    to a minimum the power of the national representatives, and to exalt and extend
                    that of the Government.</p>
                <p>At the same time the ministry persecuted the press, and allowed hardly a whisper
                    of discontent to pass unpunished. The smaller states followed with alacrity in
                    the steps of the two leading powers. The liberal ministries of 1848 were
                    dismissed, the constitutions were changed or abolished, and new chambers were
                    elected under a severely restricted suffrage. Had the battle been fairly fought
                    out between the Governments and the people, the latter would still have
                    triumphed; but the former had now, in the Frankfort diet, a mightier instrument
                    than ever against freedom. What it could do was seen too clearly from the case
                    of Hesse-Cassel. After the settlement of Olmütz, federal troops occupied that
                    country, and federal execution was carried out with shameful harshness. Martial
                    law was everywhere proclaimed; officers, and all classes of officials who had
                    incurred the displeasure of the Government, were subjected to arbitrary
                    penalties; and such was the misery of the people that multitudes of them were
                    compelled to emigrate. The constitution having been destroyed by the bund, the
                    elector proclaimed one of his own making; but even the chamber elected under the
                    provisions of this despotic scheme could not tolerate his hateful tyranny, and
                    there were incessant disputes between it and the Government. The bund interfered
                    in a like spirit in Hanover, although with less disastrous results, after the
                    accession of George V. in 1851. For the whole of Germany this was emphatically
                    the period of petty despotism; and not only from Hesse but from all parts of the
                    country there was a vast stream of emigration, mainly to the New World.</p>
                <p>The outbreak of the Crimean war profoundly moved the German nation. The
                    sympathies of Austria were necessarily with the Western powers, and in Prussia
                    the majority of the people took the same side; but the Prussian Government,
                    which was at this time completely under the control of Russia, gave its moral
                    support to the czar. It did, indeed, assent to a treaty—afterwards signed on
                    behalf of the bund—by which Prussia and Austria guaranteed each other, but it
                    resolutely opposed the mobilization of the confederate army. The Prussian people
                    were keenly irritated by the cordial relations between their court and the most
                    despotic power in Europe. They felt that they were thus most unjustly separated
                    from the main stream of Western progress.</p>
                <p>During the Crimean war the political reaction continued with unabated force. In
                    Prussia the Government appeared resolved to make up for its temporary submission
                    to the popular will by the utmost violence on which it could venture. A general
                    election took place in the autumn of 1855, and so harshly was the expression of
                    opinion restrained that a chamber was returned with scarcely a single liberal
                    element of serious importance. The feudalists called for a still further
                    revision of the constitution, and urged that even the reforms effected by Stein
                    should be undone. In Bavaria a chamber elected about the same time as that of
                    Prussia was rather less docile; but the Government shared to the full the
                    absolutist tendencies of the day, and energetically combated the party which
                    stood up for law and the constitution. The Hanoverian government, backed by the
                    Frankfort diet, was still more successful in its warfare with the moderate
                    reformers whom it was pleased to treat as revolutionists; and in Austria the
                    feudalists so completely gained the upper hand that on the 18th August 1855 the
                    Government signed a concordat, by which the state virtually submitted itself to
                    the control of the church.</p>
                <p>The German people seemed to have lost both the power and the will to assert their
                    rights; but in reality they were deeply dissatisfied. And it was clear to
                    impartial observers that, in the event of any great strain upon the power of the
                    Governments, the absolutist system would break down. The first symptom that the
                    reaction had attained its <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n527/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0527-0510"/> utmost development displayed itself in Prussia,
                    whose attention was for a time distracted from home politics by a quarrel with
                    Switzerland. The Swiss authorities had imprisoned some foolish royalists of
                    Neuchâtel, in which the house of Hohenzollern had never resigned its rights. War
                    was threatened by Prussia, but when the prisoners were set free, the two states
                    entered upon negotiations, and in the summer of 1857 King Frederick William
                    withdrew all claims to the principality. Soon after this, the mental condition
                    of the king made it necessary that his duties should be undertaken by a
                    substitute, and his brother, the Prince of Prussia, took his place for three
                    months. In October 1858 the prince became regent; and as he was unfavourable to
                    the policy which had hitherto been pursued, he appointed a new ministry of a
                    moderately liberal character. A general election was ordered; and, the free
                    action of the constituencies being in no way interfered with, they returned a
                    parliament in which the feudalists held the place that had belonged to the
                    liberals in the previous chamber. No more thorough proof could have been given
                    of the liberal sentiments of the population, and the effect was soon seen in the
                    growing hopefulness of the liberal party in every German state.</p>
                <p>The Italian war of 1859, in which Austria found herself opposed by France and
                    Sardinia, excited vehement interest in Germany. A section of the liberal party
                    would have been pleased had Prussia taken the occasion to reconstitute the
                    confederation by excluding Austria; but Prussia was so far from attempting this
                    that she put herself in a state of readiness for war with France. After the
                    battle of Magenta she mobilized part of her army, and gave her assent to the
                    placing of confederate troops on the upper Rhine. These measures induced the
                    emperor Napoleon to conclude a hasty peace; but Austria was bitterly offended
                    because she had not received the open support both of the bund and of
                    Prussia.</p>
                <p>The misfortunes of Austria in this war brought to light the instability of the
                    absolutist system which had been maintained since the crushing of the revolution
                    of 1848. The army had fought without enthusiasm, and after the restoration of
                    peace voices were everywhere raised for reform. Petty concessions were at first
                    attempted, but in December 1860 the emperor changed his ministers, promising
                    that the constitutions of the various provinces should be revised, and that a
                    Reichsrath, with the right of initiating legislation, should be freely elected
                    by the provincial diets. Although this arrangement was far from pacifying the
                    populations, it was a great advance on any previous proposal, and stirred the
                    hope of still larger concessions.</p>
                <p>Another result of the Italian war, of far greater importance for the general
                    progress of Germany, was the revival of the old desire for national unity. The
                    Germans could not persuade themselves that that which the Italians had attained
                    was unattainable by them; and they believed that, if they acquired the same
                    measure of unity, there would soon be an end of despotism. After the war, a
                    number of leading politicians, having held repeated conferences, founded what
                    they called the National Union, an organization intended to promote the national
                    cause; and it had a profound effect in maintaining and stimulating public
                    interest in its object. The Governments, seeing the strength of the movement,
                    sought to give it a direction suitable to their own interests. Prussia and
                    Austria entered into negotiations, but failed to arrive at an understanding. The
                    Saxon minister, Baron Beust, then came forward with a proposal, whose aim was to
                    play off the two great states against one another, and to enable the smaller
                    states to hold the balance. Austria was not unwilling to be persuaded: but
                    Prussia would have nothing to say to a scheme which would have effected a change
                    without improving her position. In 1863 the emperor Francis Joseph invited the
                    German princes to a congress in Frankfort, for the purpose of settling the
                    question. A settlement proposed by him was unlikely to be acceptable to Prussia;
                    and she held aloof. When the Austrian emperor’s plan was unfolded, its aim, as
                    every one expected, was seen to be the confirming of his own authority. It was,
                    therefore, with equal decision, rejected by the Prussian Government and by the
                    German liberals.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, changes had taken place in Prussia which were destined to lead to a
                    solution of the long-discussed problem, as complete as it was unexpected. On the
                    death of Frederick William IV. on the 2d January 1861, the prince regent assumed
                    the crown of Prussia as William I. Within ten years Germany was united, and this
                    amiable king was proclaimed emperor.</p>
                <p>This result was the issue of a vast series of historical causes; but it is
                    indissolubly associated with the name of King William’s great minister,
                    Bismarck, who was made Prussian premier in 1862. No more remarkable figure has
                    arisen in the history of Germany. Before he became prime minister he had acted
                    as Prussian plenipotentiary at the confederate diet, and as Prussian ambassador
                    in Paris and St Petersburg; he was, therefore, familiar with the conflicting
                    political currents of the time. When raised to the highest post in the state
                    under the crown, he soon formed the fixed resolution of adding to the power of
                    Prussia, and placing her at the head of united Germany. Having something of
                    Cromwell’s superstition as well as Cromwell’s strength, he apparently regarded
                    this as a sort of religious mission; and in many respects he could hardly have
                    been better adapted to the task. A rough, despotic, vehement nature, he was
                    undeterred by scruples which might harass ordinary statesmen; having set up a
                    goal, he marched to it by the straightest path. The solemn traditions of
                    diplomacy, to the astonishment of Europe, he laughed out of court. He respected
                    treaties exactly in so far as they were capable of being defended, and produced
                    by boisterous frankness the effects which other men achieve by mystery and
                    deceit. With little faith in the action of moral causes, he took care to have
                    behind him those big battalions which destiny is said unduly to favour. Prussia
                    at once recognized that she had in him a statesman of commanding type,—a bold
                    and resolute spirit, with narrow but intense vision, and a will created to go
                    crashing through difficulties, and to fashion a world to its liking.</p>
                <p>When Bismarck was made premier the Government was engaged in a hot dispute with
                    the representative chamber. The latter refused to sanction a great scheme of
                    military reform, and the ministry was compelled, in direct opposition to the
                    constitution, to trust to the upper house for supplies. Bismarck carried on the
                    contest with cynical audacity; and he was in no way shaken when the country,
                    over and over again, proved that its sympathies were with his opponents. The
                    military reforms were executed, and the nation was tolerably plainly told that
                    its approval was of secondary importance.</p>
                <p>An opportunity for stirring up the chaotic elements from which the Prussian
                    premier proposed to evolve a cosmos of his own was soon afforded by the revival
                    of that most complicated of “questions,” the question of Schleswig-Holstein.
                    Ever since the settlement of 1852 it had from time to time engaged attention.
                    The tendency of Danish policy, according to the Germans, was to subject Holstein
                    and Schleswig to wholly different treatment, and, in the application of the
                    general constitution of the kingdom, to pay insufficient respect to the rights
                    of Holstein as a member of the German confederation. Soon after the duke of
                    Glücksburg, in accordance with the London protocol, mounted the Danish <pb

                    the duchies, nominally to secure that the new king should fulfil his
                    predecessor’s engagements. In reality, however, their presence gave rise to
                    demonstrations among the German population in favour of Prince Frederick of
                    Augustenburg, who, although his father had renounced his rights, claimed to be
                    the true duke of Holstein. Prussia and Austria, having signed the London
                    protocol, professed to disapprove his pretensions, and towards the end of 1863
                    proposed in the diet that they should be empowered to occupy Schleswig, so that
                    justice might be done both to the Danish king and to the duchies. Tlιe proposal
                    was rejected, and had Austria been acting alone, there is no reason to believe
                    that she would have pushed her demands farther, if indeed she would ever have
                    advanced so far. But Prussian policy was determined by a statesman who had vast
                    ulterior ends to serve; and by his influence Austria was induced to join Prussia
                    in declaring that, since the bund would not follow their counsel, they were
                    forced to act independently. In the war which followed the Danes distinguished
                    themselves by their courage and military skill; but they could not very long
                    contend single-handed with two such enemies, and on the 1st August 1864 a treaty
                    was signed in Vienna, by which Denmark ceded to the conquerors Schleswig,
                    Holstein, and Lauenburg. All Europe disapproved these harsh conditions; but the
                    Prussian minister did not trouble himself about disapproval which found
                    utterance only in words.</p>
                <p>Before the outbreak of war, Prussia had been engaged in a serious dispute with
                    Austria. In 1862, in the name of the customs union, the former power had
                    concluded with France a treaty of commerce, based mainly on the principles of
                    free trade. Most of the small states, strongly objecting to the treaty, refused
                    to sign it; and they were supported by Austria, which had never given up the
                    hope of taking precedence of Prussia in the commercial as well as the political
                    relations of Germany. She∙protested against the treaty, and demanded admission
                    into the customs union. Prussia maintained her original position, insisting that
                    if the treaty with France were rejected she would regard the union as no longer
                    existing. After the war Bismarck not only succeeded in obtaining the signatures
                    of the small states, but induced Austria to conclude a commercial treaty,
                    essentially the same as that of 1853; and about the same time treaties were
                    signed, owing to his exertions, between the union and England and Belgium. These
                    triumphs unmistakably indicated the rising influence of Prussia.</p>
                <p>It was not long before grave difficulties sprang from the results of the
                    Schleswig-Holstein war. Prussia was of opinion that there was no longer any need
                    for the troops of the bund in Holstein; and although this view was hotly
                    contested, the diet was compelled in the end to act upon it. Still more
                    important was the question, what should now be done with the duchies. Austria
                    favoured the claims of the prince of Augustenburg; and the bund by a small
                    majority decided to request the two powers to invest him with the sovereignty of
                    Holstein. Prussia protested that the matter was beyond the competence of the
                    diet. What she herself intended was plainly shown by the fact that the Prussian
                    war minister explained in the Prussian parliament, in connexion with a special
                    demand for money, that it was to be devoted to the erection of a harbour at
                    Kiel. Austria, which had the same right as Prussia to Kiel, refused her assent
                    to this proposal; and an interchange of angry despatches took place, which made
                    it highly probable that the spoilers of Denmark would soon be at each other’s
                    throats. War was for a time prevented by the Gastein convention, by which
                    Austria handed over Lauenburg to Prussia, and it was agreed that the former
                    state should in the meantime administer Holstein, the latter Schleswig.</p>
                <p>Count Bismarck did not intend that the Gastein convention should seriously
                    interrupt the development of his policy. He had made up his mind to force a
                    quarrel on Austria, and to settle once for all the question, first raised by
                    Frederick the Great, whether she or Prussia should prevail in Germany. The
                    opportunity was so favourable that the like might never again offer itself.
                    Although the Government and the parliament of Prussia were still engaged in a
                    struggle which called forth much indignation on both sides, the mass of the
                    population was thoroughly loyal; and, as events proved, the army had been
                    reorganized with splendid skill. Never, perhaps, in the history of the world,
                    were there better fighters than the Prussian soldiersof that day; and they were
                    led by officers full of patriotic ardour, with almost unlimited influence over
                    their men, and trained in the best schools of military science. In the Austrian
                    empire, notwithstanding the reforms recently instituted, discontent was still
                    almost universal. The Hungarians sullenly demanded independence, and among the
                    Slavonic populations there were also dangerous agitations for local
                    self-government. Although the army was composed of magnificent material, it was
                    far behind that of Prussia in the mode of its administration, and grave doubts
                    were entertained whether confidence could be placed in its loyalty. In these
                    circumstances, no one familiar with the facts could hesitate as to the side on
                    which victory would declare itself in the event of war, and to Count Bismarck
                    the facts were intimately known. With well-considered boldness he advanced
                    rapidly to his aim. The Austrian governor of Holstein encouraged, as he had a
                    perfect right to do, the pretensions of the prince of Augustenburg. In January
                    1866 Count Bismarck made this the subject of a bitter despatch to the Vienna
                    Government; and Count Meusdorf, the Austrian foreign minister, replied in the
                    same tone. Both powers now began to make active preparations for the worst. The
                    majority of the small states sided with Austria; but Prussia found means of more
                    than counterbalancing this advantage. Now that Italy was partially united, the
                    Italians felt humiliated at Venetia remaining in the hands of Austria. Count
                    Bismarck offered, if she would conclude an alliance with Prussia against their
                    common enemy, to obtain for her this magnificent prize. The Italian Government
                    saw that it could never have a better chance, and signed the proposed
                    treaty.</p>
                <p>The occasion for which Count Bismarck waited presented itself when the Austrian
                    governor of Holstein summoned the assembly of the states. Holstein was at once
                    occupied by Prussian troops, and those of Austria were driven from the duchy.
                    The Austrian Government indignantlyprotested against this outrage; and on the
                    14th June 1866 its proposal that the forces of the bund should be mobilized
                    against Prussia was adopted by a majority of the diet. The Prussian
                    plenipotentiary withdrew after submitting a scheme for the reconstitution of
                    Germany; and the war immediately began. Its events followed each other with
                    startling rapidity. Within a fortnight Prussia had in her grasp Hanover,
                    Hesse-Cassel, and Saxony; and on the 3d July was fought the great battle of
                    Königgrätz, which laid her chief enemy at her feet. The power of Austria was
                    shattered by the swift and mighty blows directed against it; and on the 26th
                    July she was glad to accept the preliminaries of Nicolsburg, which were soon
                    afterwards followed by the peace of Prague.</p>
                <p>The result of this war was the final exclusion of Austria from Germany. Prussia
                    annexed Hanover, Hesse-Cassel, Nassau, Frankfort, and Schleswig-Holstein. By the
                    fifth clause of the treaty of Prague, indeed, the inhabitants of the northern
                    districts of Schleswig were to be reunited to Denmark, if, when freely
                    consulted, they expressed a wish <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n529/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0529-0512"/> for this result; but the engagement, which was
                    never seriously intended, was abrogated by secret treaty between Austria aud
                    Germany on tlιe 11 th October 1878. AU states to the north of the Main,
                    including the northern half of Hesse-Darmstadt, were compelled to form a
                    North-German confederation under the leadership of Prussia. The four
                    South-German states, Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, Würtemberg, and Bavaria, were left
                    independent, but with the right, if they chose, to form a South-German
                    confederation and to unite with that of North Germany. By secret treaties, as
                    Count Bismarck announced at a critical moment soon afterwards, they undertook to
                    place their armies at the disposal of Prussia in time of war.</p>
                <p>King William, who had accompanied his troops, returned in triumph to Berlin, and
                    the nation was so elated by his victories that the newly-elected house of
                    representatives willingly consented to forget past disputes. On the 24th
                    February 1867 the constituent diet of the confederation, elected by universal
                    suffrage and the ballot, met in Berlin, and soon accepted in its essential
                    features the constitution submitted to it. It was arranged that the headship of
                    the confederation should be hereditary, that it should belong to the king of
                    Prussia, and that legislative functions should be exercised by a federal
                    council, representative of the various Governments, and by a diet elected by the
                    whole people.</p>
                <p>The confederate parliament began at once the task of consolidating the new
                    institutions. In the sessions of 1869 and 1870 it established a supreme tribunal
                    of commerce, sitting in Leipsic, and passed a new penal code. Great as were
                    these results, they did not satisfy the aspirations of patriotic Germans, who,
                    having so suddenly and so unexpectedly approached unity, longed that the work
                    should be completed. A party called the “national liberals” was formed, whose
                    main object was to secure the incorporation of south with north Germany, and it
                    at once entered into peculiar relations with the great minister at the head of
                    the country. The members of this party, believing, as sincere liberals, that the
                    German people were ripe for free institutions, desired from the outset to give
                    larger power to the popular element of the constitution both in Prussia and in
                    Germany. With these ideas Prince Bismarck had no sympathy. Throughout his career
                    he has consistently manifested contempt for parliamentary forms of government.
                    He cannot tolerate that a minister should be thwarted or hindered by political
                    critics, and fancies that the community would be much better off if it allowed
                    itself to be directly governed by the statesmen who are good enough to devote
                    themselves to its service. But his achievements in the cause of German unity
                    have more than counterbalanced, in the esteem of the liberals, his dislike of
                    national freedom.</p>
                <p>An important step towards complete unity was supposed to be taken in 1867, by the
                    conclusion of a treaty with the southern states, by which it was agreed that all
                    questions of customs should be decided by the federal council and the federal
                    diet, and that, for the consideration of such questions, the southern states
                    should send representatives to Berlin. In reality, however, the customs
                    parliament was of no service beyond the strict limits of its special activity.
                    The mass of the South Germans were bitterly opposed to the idea of union with
                    the north. The democrats detested Prussia more than any other country, and
                    looked upon Count Bismarck as the incarnation of all that was most objectionable
                    in its aristocratic and military system of government. Among the ultramontanes
                    there was a not less vehement dislike of a nation which continually boasted that
                    it was the headquarters of Protestantism and free thought. Hence, in the
                    election to the customs parliament in 1868, Würtemberg did not return a single
                    deputy who was ’ favourable to the national cause; in Bavaria the
                    antinationalists had a large majority; and even in Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt,
                    where the opposition to Prussia was less severe, a powerful minority of the
                    deputies had no liking for the Prussian premier. Thus the customs parliament was
                    kept rigidly to the objects for which it was founded, greatly to the
                    disappointment of patriots who had not doubted that it would become an effective
                    instrument for the attainment of far larger purposes. Even in regard to the
                    army, notwithstanding the secret treaties giving Prussia the command of the
                    southern forces in the event of war, a spirit of bitter opposition to the
                    northern confédération was manifested. Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt reorganized
                    their armies in accordance with the Prussian system, but Bavaria and Würtemberg
                    were more obstinate, and in both countries there was an agitation for military
                    arrangements by which the secret treaties should be virtually annulled.</p>
                <p>Had the completion of unity depended wholly on internal causes, it certainly
                    would not have been soon achieved; but other forces, not altogether
                    unexpectedly, came to Count Bismarck’s aid. France had been irritated by the
                    enormous increase of Prussian power, and even before the treaty of Prague was
                    signed the emperor Napoleon III. indicated a wish to be “compensated” with the
                    left bank of the Rhine. Not being in a position to make war, he was compelled to
                    suppress this desire. Soon afterwards he proposed a secret arrangement by which
                    Belgium was to fall to France, while Prussia was to have free scope elsewhere.
                    Finding that if not decisively rejected his plan was at least not accepted,
                    Napoleon next sought to restore the balance by concluding a treaty with the king
                    of Holland, in 1867, for the purchase of Luxembourg. Prussia protested; and it
                    was on this occasion that Count Bismarck first made public the secret treaties
                    with the South-German states. War appeared almost inevitable, but the emperor,
                    being still uncertain as to the state of his forces, allowed the question to be
                    settled by a conference, which declared Luxembourg a neutral state, its
                    neutrality being guaranteed by the great powers.</p>
                <p>The idea of a war with Prussia was not given up by Napoleon. Whether he felt the
                    necessity of strengthening the claims of his dynasty by military glory, or
                    whether, as many Germans believe, he was urged forward by a powerful
                    ultramontane intrigue, he seems to have resolved in 1870 to undertake the
                    long-delayed struggle. A pretext was found in a proposal of the Spaniards to
                    raise to their throne Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern. There is no evidence that
                    the French people were in the least disturbed by this scheme; certainly, if they
                    had been left to their own free judgment, they would never have thought of going
                    to war about it. But the imperial ministry, managing to get up a little
                    artificial excitement among a noisy section of the Parisians, angrily protested;
                    and Prince Leopold announced that he would not accept the Spanish crown.
                    Stimulated by this diplomatic triumph, the emperor next required that Prussia
                    should give a general engagement that no Hohenzollern prince should in future
                    become king of Spain. Prussia declined to humble herself so far, whereupon, on
                    the 19th July 1870, France declared war against her. A telegram from Ems,
                    falsely stating that the French ambassador had been publicly insulted by
                    KingWilliam, caused considerable sensation in France; and enemies of Bismarck
                    often assert that he caused it to be despatched for the purpose of making war
                    unavoidable. Although this is a mere assertion, he was not unwilling to accept
                    the challenge, coming as it did in a manner that would have rendered any
                    shrinking from it disgraceful. He believed that, whatever policy she adopted,
                    Prussia would one day have to defend her conquests; and he could not but foresee
                    the enormous advantages which would spring from a triumphant war with
                    France.</p>
                <p>Napoleon, as we now know, had reason to suppose that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n530/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0530-0513"/> he might trust to the aid of Austria and Italy,
                    and his diplomatic agents in South Germany had left no doubt in his mind that
                    the South Germans would hail his approach as that of a deliverer. He was cruelly
                    undeceived. After his first reverses, Italy and Austria resolved to hold aloof;
                    and the South Germans did not for an instant hesitate; they loyally kept their
                    engagements with Prussia. The French emperor did not realize how bitter, in
                    South as well as in North Germany, were the memories of the sufferings caused by
                    his uncle. However energetically the various states might fight among
                    themselves, in the presence of “the hereditary enemy” their disputes were
                    forgotten; they remembered only their common origin and their common speech.
                    There is no parallel in German history to the enthusiasm called forth by the
                    French declaration of war. Its absolute universality was a new phenomenon, and
                    its intensity probably could not be surpassed.</p>
                <p>The course of the war went far beyond the expectations of the most sanguine
                    patriots. In battle after battle the armies of France were smitten to the
                    ground; her strong places, one after another, delivered themselves to the enemy;
                    and her brave sons were sent by hundreds of thousands as prisoners to Germany.
                    At last, on the 1st September, after the disastrous battle of Sedan, the emperor
                    yielded his sword to the Prussian king.</p>
                <p>It was the opinion of many impartial observers that the war ought now to have
                    stopped, and there were Germans who had the courage to express this conviction.
                    But the nation as a whole wished to see France thoroughly humbled, and applauded
                    the advance on Paris. In vain M. Gambetta sought to infuse into his countrymen
                    his own impulsive and vigorous spirit; they did what they could, but the German
                    armies were irresistible. On the 28th January 1871 Paris surrendered, and on the
                    10th May the peace of Frankfort was signed. By this treaty France engaged to pay
                    the enormous indemnity of five milliards of francs, and to restore to Germany
                    Alsace and the German portion of Lorraine.</p>
                <p>Amid the glowing pride of the Germans in the unsurpassed achievements of their
                    armies the difficulties which had hitherto prevented complete unity seemed
                    altogether to vanish. In the autumn of 1870 negotiations were opened between the
                    southern Governments and the northern confederation; and in the course of
                    November treaties were signed by which the North-German confederation became the
                    German confederation. Bavaria insisted upon some highly important reservations,
                    such as the maintenance of her own diplomacy, of her postal, telegraph, and
                    railway systems, of her military administration, and of certain valuable taxes.
                    Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, and Würtemberg also maintained special rights. But all
                    this was thought of comparatively little moment; and the treaties were readily
                    sanctioned both by the confederate parliament and by the southern parliaments.
                    Thus Germany became a united state. The king of Bavaria then proposed to the
                    other German sovereigns and to the free cities that the head of the
                    confederation should be declared emperor. The suggestion was approved; and on
                    the 18th January 1871, in the Hall of Mirrors in the palace of Versailles, the
                    king of Prussia was proclaimed, in presence of a brilliant assembly. of German
                    princes and officers, emperor in Germany.</p>
                <p>On the 21st of March 1871 the first diet of the empire met in Berlin. The
                    constitution of the northern confederation was extended so as to be applicable
                    to the changed circumstances of Germany, but no alteration was made in its
                    essential character.</p>
                <p>Since the conclusion of the treaty of Frankfort Germany has been at peace, but as
                    she believes that the French may one day seek to regain their lost provinces and
                    to avenge their recent humiliations, she has maintained the vast military system
                    to which her victories have been due. The main object of Prince Bismarck’s
                    foreign policy appears to have been to isolate France. While not unfriendly to
                    England, he has assiduously cultivated the friendship of Austria and of Russia.
                    In 1872 the czar and the Austrian emperor visited Berlin, and during their stay
                    the three emperors concluded an alliance, the exact limits and conditions of
                    which are not known. Soon afterwards Victor Emmanuel, the Italian king, also
                    visited the German capital, and the emperor William went for a short time to
                    Italy, where he was received with manifestations of hearty friendship. It is
                    understood that after the reopening of the Eastern question in 1875 Prince
                    Bismarck made repeated attempts tQ enter into close relations with England; but
                    in his public acts, both before and after the signing of the treaty of Berlin in
                    1878, he mainly supported Russia. He also encouraged Austria to extend her
                    influence in the east by occupying Bosnia.</p>
                <p>In her home politics the attention of Germany was for some years mainly occupied
                    with a great struggle between the state and the church in Prussia. After the
                    close of the Franco-German war—in the course of which the dogma of papal
                    infallibility was proclaimed—Prince Bismarck persuaded himself that the empire
                    was imperilled by ultramontane intrigues; and with his usual promptitude he took
                    vigorous precautions against his supposed enemies. He began in 1872 witlι the
                    expulsion of the Jesuits. This was followed in 1873 by tne famous May Laws,
                    introduced by Dr Falk, the energetic minister of public worship. By these laws
                    it was required tnat candidates for the clerical office should undergo a certain
                    amount of secular training at the universities, and that every ecclesiastical
                    appointment should receive the sanction of the secular authorities. A royal
                    tribunal for ecclesiastical matters was also set up. This legislation, which the
                    pope denounced as invalid, was disregarded by the Catholic bishops; and Prince
                    Bismarck, supported by Dr Falk, imposed penalty after penalty in order to
                    establish the supremacy of the state. Refractory bishops were imprisoned,
                    deposed, and banished; the contributions of the Government were withdrawn from
                    the clergy who incurred its displeasure; religious orders were dissolved; the
                    administration of church property was taken from the clergy and invested in
                    bodies of laymen. It may be that these stern measures were rendered necessary by
                    facts of which the world is insufficiently informed; but they have alienated
                    from Prince Bismarck, and from the empire founded by him, the sympathies of the
                    vast majority of the German Catholics.</p>
                <p>The period which has followed the war with France has been remarkable, not only
                    for the ecclesiastical struggle in Prussia, but for the rapid growth of
                    socialism throughout the empire. Socialism first became a power in Germany
                    through the labours of the ardent scholar and publicist, Ferdinand Lassalle. He
                    began his brief and noisy public career by addressing large audiences of workmen
                    in Berlin and Leipsic in 1862, and in less than two years he had formed a party
                    which regarded him with boundless reverence and admiration. He himself was a man
                    of fortune, with luxurious habits; but he had in an unusually intense degree the
                    desire, shared by all truly modern men, for the elevation of the depressed and
                    suffering masses. The theory of which he had convinced himself was that, with
                    existing social relations, workmen as a class can never improve their position;
                    that their sole chance is to form productive associations which shall enable
                    them to secure the whole benefit of their labour; and that it is the duty of the
                    state to provide such associations with capital, to see that justice is done to
                    their members, and to regulate the markets of the world. After the death of
                    Lassalle, this theory became a sort of evangel among his followers; but <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n531/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0531-0514"/> many of them stated it in violent terms, and
                    openly aimed at the equal division of property, if possible by peaceful
                    agitation, if necessary by revolution. At the time of the formation of the party
                    Herr von Bismarck was engaged in his struggle with the liberals in the Prussian
                    parliament, and he did not scruple to damage his opponents by encouraging
                    Lassalle, who detested them more vehemently than did the premier himself. Soon
                    after the war with France the condition of the country was in the highest degree
                    favourable to the progress of the movement. . Intoxicated by the national
                    triumphs, and having a vague impression that the French indemnity must be an
                    inexhaustible source of wealth, many of the German middle class indulged in wild
                    speculation, and contracted habits of reckless expenditure. At the same time the
                    resources of the nation were drained by the most costly military system the
                    world has ever seen. The inevitable result was that in a short time trade was
                    depressed beyond all recent experience; wages fell, and large numbers of workmen
                    were deprived of employment. Socialism found its opportunity; multitudes of the
                    sufferers eagerly listened to instructors who depicted for them a brilliant
                    future that might be easily attained. In England no considerable body of men has
                    ever been deeply impressed by socialist schemes; but in Germany the conditions
                    of political life are altogether different. There the Government is the greatest
                    of all powers. At every stage of a man’s life it makes itself felt; it creates
                    around the community a sort of political atmosphere from which there is no
                    escape, in which every one moves and breathes. Thus to an uninstructed German
                    there seems to be hardly any limit to the feats of which the state is capable.
                    It professes to be so nearly omnipotent that he appears to himself to be within
                    his right in asking it to make all poor men suddenly rich.</p>
                <p>At each successive general election the numbers of socialist deputies to the
                    imperial parliament increased; and in 1877 it was calculated that, although only
                    twelve members of the party were returned, about a tenth of the entire body of
                    voters were socialists. Some alarm was excited by these facts, but no one
                    thought of putting down the movement by force until one day in May 1878 a shot
                    was fired at the aged emperor in Berlin, as he drove along the Unter den Linden
                    with his daughter, the grand-duchess of Baden, by his side. The criminal, a
                    youth named Hödel, boasted of his socialist opinions and aims. A wave of anger
                    swept over the nation; and the reactionary party, fancying it had an opportunity
                    of laying a rough hand on far more than socialism, succeeded in inducing the
                    imperial Government to draw up without delay a severe measure, directed
                    nominally against the socialists, but in reality against all politicians
                    obnoxious to the conservatives. The bill was hurried through the federal council
                    and submitted to the diet. By that time the majority of the liberals had
                    recovered their self-control; and with the aid of the centre party they threw
                    out the proposed scheme by an immense majority. Parliament was prorogued, and it
                    was uncertain whether there would be any further attempt at repression.</p>
                <p>Suddenly the announcement came that the emperor had again been shot at, and that
                    this time he had been wounded. For some days Germany was convulsed with rage and
                    horror, and on all sides the cry was raised that now at last socialism must be
                    sternly dealt with. Taking courage, the Government dissolved parliament, and
                    pressure of every kind was put upon the electors to secure a thoroughly
                    reactionary diet. The country, however, reflected that, although it was
                    necessary to protect society, it might not be necessary to sacrifice the
                    liberties which it had with so much difficulty conquered. Accordingly, when the
                    new parliament assembled in August 1878, it was found that the liberals had not
                    sustained very serious losses. The progressists bitterly opposed the measure
                    introduced by the Government; but by some means Prince Bismarck managed, as he
                    had often done before, to overcome the objections of the national liberals. By
                    their support a law was passed which gave the police of the empire, for two
                    years and a half, enormous special powers. These powers were at once rigidly
                    enforced; and socialism appeared to vanish from the land. Whether, however, it
                    may not spring up in some great national crisis, all the stronger for the
                    sufferings of its adherents, is a point that can be determined only when some
                    great national crisis occurs.</p>
                <p>The socialists and the ultramontanes, without having anything else in common,
                    have joined in opposition to measures for promoting the national unity. They
                    have been aided by the Polish deputies, by the members for Alsace and Lorraine,
                    and by the so-called particularists, conservative politicians ardently attached
                    to the ancient customs and rights of the individual states. Notwithstanding this
                    formidable band of allies, considerable progress has been made in the task of
                    transforming a loose confederation of countries into a true nation. Between 1872
                    and 1875 utter anarchy in important departments of life was brought to an end by
                    laws relating to imperial coinage, imperial paper money, and the system of
                    banking. And in 1877 thorough investigation resulted in the appointment of a
                    supreme imperial tribunal (Reichsgericht). It was proposed that this tribunal
                    should sit in Berlin; but many liberals having no desire that that city should
                    assume in Germany the place which belongs in France to Paris, a large majority
                    decided for Leipsic. This was taken as a hint that, while Germany wishes to be
                    united, she will not voluntarily see herself transformed into a magnified
                    Prussia.</p>
                <p>In spite of their military strength, their victories, and the establishment of
                    their empire, the Germans are not, politically, a contented people; and the
                    reason is that they have outgrown their institutions. While a statesman of
                    extraordinary genius and authority stands in the way, a progressive system maybe
                    impossible; but the more intelligent classes have never lost the desire to add
                    to the hardly-earned national unity the crowning triumph of unfettered
                    representative government.</p>

                <p>PART HL—LANGUAGE.</p>
                <p>In its ordinary sense the name German Language or <hi rend="italic">Deutsche
                    Sprache</hi> is now generally used to denote, in all their stages from the
                    earliest time to the present day, the different languages and dialects of
                    Teutonic origin spoken in the German and Austrian empires and in Switzerland,
                    not including, however, the Frisian language, which once was spoken, and still
                    in a few remnants survives, on the shores and islands of the German Ocean, nor
                    the dialects of the Danish population of nortnern Schleswig. Flemish and Dutch,
                    although very closely connected with German, are likewise excluded. But the word
                    <hi rend="italic">Deutsch</hi> has also been, and still continues to be, used in
                    a wider sense. Jacob Grimm introduced it, in his famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deutsche Grammatik,</hi> as a comprehensive name for that family of the
                    so-called Indo-European or Aryan languages, for which English writers generally
                    use the name of “Teutonic,” and of which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n532/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0532-0515"/> the principal branches are represented by Gothic,
                    the Scandinavian languages, English, Frisian, and German. In this Grimm has had
                    many followers, but scarcely anywhere out of Germany; and even there the fact
                    that the name, in this application, besides being incorrect from an historical
                    point of view (as the word has never been used thus by any one of the people to
                    whom it has been applied by Grimm), is also liable to be misunderstood, has
                    caused a growing tendency towards confining it again to its original meaning
                    described above, and using <hi rend="italic">Germanisch,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Germanic,</hi> in the collective sense of the English “Teutonic.”
                    But even in the stricter sense the designation <hi rend="italic">Deutsch</hi> is
                    not of very long standing, nor has the word always been a real proper name for a
                    distinct people or tribe. In Bishop Ulfilas’s Gothic version of the Bible we
                    find the adverb <hi rend="italic">thiudisko (eθvικω&lt;s),</hi> Gal. ii. 14,
                    which is clearly a derivative from <hi rend="italic">thiuda (fθvο&lt;i),</hi>
                    meaning primarily “after the manner of the people.” German writers of tbe
                    earlier centuries were therefore as fully justified in calling their own
                    language <hi rend="italic">diutisc,</hi> or, in a Latinized form, <hi
                    rend="italic">theudiscus, theοtiscus,</hi> that is, their popular or vernacular
                    language, as were those mediaeval Latin writers of all nations who distinguished
                    their national languages by the name of <hi rend="italic">lingua vulgaris
                    irom.</hi> Latin, the only literary language fully acknowledged in their time.
                    It was not until the I Oth century that another Latinized form frequently used
                    in later times, viz., <hi rend="italic">teutonicus,</hi> began to be used
                    instead of the older <hi rend="italic">theοtiscus,</hi> of which the only rivals
                    in former times had been such local names as <hi rend="italic">frαnciscus
                    (frenkisc}</hi> or <hi rend="italic">saxoηi-cus,</hi> which were no doubt
                    derived from the names of single tribes, but were often also used in the same
                    comprehensive sense as <hi rend="italic">theotiscus,</hi> without necessarily
                    implying any allusion to dialectal differences between the languages of the
                    tribes they properly belonged to. The last name we have to mention here is the
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">Germanus,</hi> with its different derivatives in the
                    modern languages, including the English form <hi rend="italic">German.</hi> Many
                    attempts have been made to elucidate the origin of this word, but as yet nothing
                    can be taken for certain beyond the fact that it is neither of Latin nor of
                    German origin. Most probably it was a Celtic word, and, according to what
                    Tacitus says in his <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi> (ch. ii.), it was originally
                    the name of a Celtic tribe, from which, by some strange error of the Roman and
                    Greek historians, it has been transferred to the non-Celtic inhabitants of
                    Germany. Accordingly the name has never been used by the Germans themselves
                    except in imitation of its use in the works of Latin writers.</p>
                <p>As to its geographical extension the German language has undergone very great
                    changes in the course of the last two thousand years. At the dawn of history no
                    Germans were to be found to the left of the Rhine, and even to the right of it
                    Celtic tribes occur in the earliest times. There were Celts also in the south of
                    the present Germany as far north at least as the Danube and the Main; Bohemia,
                    too, derives its name from an early Celtic population, the Boii. Only the
                    midland and north were inhabited by Germanic nations or tribes, stretching as
                    far east as Poland, and perhaps covering even parts of the adjoining territories
                    of Russia, where Slavonic and. Finnish tribes were their neighbours. But of
                    these Germanic tribes and their languages some have left no equivalents in our
                    modern German tribes and dialects. We have mentioned the Frisian language as not
                    belonging to German in its proper sense, although the Frisians have kept their
                    original residence up to the present day, and have always been in constant
                    connexion and frequent intercourse with their “German” neighbours. Many other
                    tribes have wandered from their seats and colonized other countries. It was as
                    late as the middle of the 5th century that the Jutes, Angles, and Saxons began
                    their voyages of conquest to England, where they founded a new people and a new
                    language,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">English Language,</hi> vol. viii. p. 390
                    sqq.</p></note> leaving their native soil open to Danish invasions. Much earlier
                    the midland tribes had already been slowly pushing on to the west and south, and
                    expelling or subduing and assimilating the Celtic owners of the territories they
                    invaded. But what was gained in these parts was counterbalanced by great losses
                    in the north and east. The territories about the lower and middle Elbe, Oder,
                    and Vistula, abandoned by the Lombards, the Burgundians, the Goths, and some
                    other Germanic tribes, as well as Bohemia, which for some short time had been in
                    the possession of the German Marcomans, were soon filled up by the immigration
                    of numerous tribes of the great Slavonic family. Without going into details of
                    the facts which are well known to the student of history,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For fuller particulars see C. Zeuss, Die
                    Deutschen und die Nαch-barstämme, Munich, 1837.</p></note> we may simply state
                    that, since about 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> when the great migration
                    of the nations had come to an end so far as Germany was concerned, no further
                    change of any great importance has taken place in the western and southern
                    parts. In the east the German population at this time did not go beyond a line
                    that may be drawn from about Kiel to the Böhmerwald, passing near Hamburg,
                    Magdeburg, ^Naumburg, Coburg, and Baireuth. As is well known, it is in later
                    centuries that almost all the eastern districts have been recovered for the
                    German language.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See G.
                    Wendt, Die Nationalität der Bevölkerung der Deutschen Ostmarken vor dem Beginne
                    der Germanisierung, Göttingen, 1878.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the 6th century the remains of the numerous smaller Germanic tribes, mentioned
                    before and during the migration of the nations, had consolidated into seven
                    larger bodies or aggregations of tribes. The Frisians still held the extreme
                    north of Holland and Germany. Their midland and eastern neighbours were then
                    called by the new name of Saxons, borrowed from the Saxons who had left the
                    Continent for England. In the main parts of the Netherlands and Belgium, along
                    both sides of the Rhine, and across Germany to the Thuringian and Bohemian
                    Forests, the powerful Frankish confederation had established itself, and it soon
                    incorporated the smaller and less vigorous tribes of the Hessians and
                    Thuringians, which were surrounded by the midland or eastern Franks, the Saxons,
                    and the Slavs. Alsatia, Switzerland, and South Germany eastward to the river
                    Lech were occupied by the Alemannians, while the inhabitants of the remaining
                    districts of the present Bavaria and Austria bore the collective name of
                    Bavarians.</p>
                <p>The history of the German language cannot be severed from the history of these
                    tribes, for Frisian, Saxon, Frankish (Hessian, Thuringian), Alemannian, and
                    Bavarian are the leading dialects of the Continental branch of the Teutonic
                    family. What Dr J. A. H. Murray has pointed out about the origin of the
                    principal English dialects<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See <hi rend="smallcaps">English Language,</hi> as above, p. 391.</p></note>
                    may equally well be said of these Continental idioms. Having no specimens of the
                    languages of the Continental tribes for nearly three centuries after their final
                    settlement, we cannot tell to what extent they originally agreed with or
                    differed from each other, although there must have been some dialectal
                    differences to begin with, which were afterwards increased and multiplied,
                    partly by phonetic changes (most probably resulting from scarcely discernible
                    phonetic peculiarities, which, even in the earliest times, must have prevailed
                    in those idioms), and partly by such alterations of the inflexional systems as
                    are known to occur frequently in all languages whose character is not merely
                    literary. But, however scanty our means of illustrating the earliest history of
                    these idioms may be, there is no doubt that they were not all of them related to
                    each other in the same <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n533/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0533-0516"/> degree. Three main groups are easily
                    distinguishable :—</p>
                <p>(1) Frisian and Saxon, whose nearest relation is English;</p>
                <p>(2) Frankish, Hessian, and Thuringian; and (3) Alemaunian and Bavarian. Frisian
                    is generally considered as a separate language. From Saxon the later Low German
                    dialects <hi rend="italic">{Niederdeutsche Mundarten)</hi> have sprung. The
                    members of the third group (generally designated as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oberdeutsch,</hi> or Upper German), combined with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mitteldeutsch,</hi> or the midland dialects, viz., Thuringian, Hessian, and
                    part of the Frankish dialects, are the sources of the later <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hochdeutsch</hi> or High German. The greatest difference prevails between the
                    first and third groups; the second may be characterized as containing various
                    transition dialects. The southern Frankish dialects are very closely akin to the
                    adjacent Upper German idioms, while Dutch, the utmost offshoot of the Frankish
                    language to the north, does not very materially differ from Saxon or Frisian in
                    the earliest period. The most striking phonetic feature of the languages of the
                    first group is their regular dropping of the nasal sounds before the spirants
                    <hi rend="italic">f, th, s,</hi> accompanied by subsequent lengthening of the
                    preceding vowels. Thus we have in Anglo-Saxon or Old English <hi rend="italic"
                    >fiif, after, cuft, gas</hi> (Mod. English <hi rend="italic">five, other, {uni)
                    couth, goose),</hi> in Old Frisian <hi rend="italic">fif, othar, cuth, gos,</hi>
                    in Old Saxon <hi rend="italic">fif, othar, cuth,gοs,</hi> corresponding to such
                    Gothic forms as <hi rend="italic">fimf, anthar, kunths,</hi> or the ordinary
                    High German <hi rend="italic">fünf, ander, kund,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gans.</hi> Since, however, Dutch partakes of this peculiarity to some extent,
                    we cannot easily form a decisive opinion as to the value of this fact as a
                    distinctive mark; but more stress may be laid on a very remarkable difference in
                    the inflexional system of the verb. Here the languages of the first group have
                    melted together the forms of the three persons of the plural number, thus <hi
                    rend="italic">we, ge, his findaft,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fundon,</hi> we,
                    you, they find, or found, in Old English <hi rend="italic">∙,wi,gι, hia
                    findaft,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fundon</hi> in Old Frisian; <hi rend="italic"
                    >wi, gi, sia findaft,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fundon</hi> in Old Saxon. The
                    corresponding Old High German forms are <hi rend="italic">wir</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">findam,</hi><hi rend="italic">ir</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >findat,</hi><hi rend="italic">sie</hi><hi rend="italic">findant</hi> for the
                    present, <hi rend="italic">wir</hi><hi rend="italic">funium,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ir funtut,</hi><hi rend="italic">sie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >funtun</hi> for the perfect tense. Old Dutch joins, in this case, the German
                    branch; from <hi rend="italic">werthaη,</hi> to become, for instance, are
                    derived <hi rend="italic">wι werthun, gι werthift, sia τverthunt,</hi> &amp;c.
                    The declension of the substantives shows another remarkable difference. While
                    the languages of the first group have retained the original s in the nominative
                    plural of such words as Old English <hi rend="italic">dagas,</hi> days, Old
                    Saxon <hi rend="italic">dagos,</hi> or changed it to <hi rend="italic">r,</hi>
                    as Old Frisian <hi rend="italic">dagar,</hi> Dutch and German have dropped it
                    altogether, the corresponding forms being <hi rend="italic">daga</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">taga.</hi> These facts must be taken for decisive, as it seems to
                    be certain that they existed before any distinction of Low and High German in
                    their modern sense (a distinction chiefly dependent on subsequent changes in
                    their mute system) could be thought of. From a purely grammatical point of view,
                    Dutch, although generally considered a separate language (which no doubt it is,
                    with regard to its literary and political position), is entitled to claim a
                    closer relation to High German than even Low German, whose non· literary
                    character, taken along with the political union of northern and southern
                    Germany, has led to the current opinion that it is only a dialect of “German” in
                    its narrower sense. We do not mean to deny that there is, at present, a more
                    conspicuous conformity between Dutch and Low German than between Low German and
                    High German; but this is only due to the fact that High German, after the final
                    settlement of the German tribes, has deviated much more from its original
                    features than either Dutch or Low German. The most striking peculiarities of
                    High German, as opposed to all other Teutonic idioms, have mainly been caused by
                    the second or High German “Lautverschiebung,” or change of mute consonants,
                    which forme part of a long series of sound-changes generally comprehended under
                    the name of Germanische Lautverschiebung or Grimm’s Law. This Lautverschiebung
                    began, perhaps as early as the 7th century, in the south, and thence slowly
                    spread northward, but with decreasing vigour and consistency, Dutch and Low
                    German not being touched at all. It was only thus that the idiom of the
                    Netherlands Franks of the later centuries was separated from the dialects of
                    their “German” relations. Before, however, the first literary documents are met
                    with, this separation is complete; and we may therefore restrict ourselves here
                    to a short history of High and Low German alone.</p>
                <p>The German language presents, as do most of the cognate tongues, three maiu
                    stages of development,—Old, Middle, and Modern,—distinguished by their
                    inflexional and literary character. In accordance with Mr Henry Sweet’s

                    it is chiefly the literary character that distinguishes Modern High German from
                    Low German and its own earlier stages. A special form of High German is
                    established in this period for all literary purposes, supplanting the dialects
                    both of Low and of High German that formerly were freely used in literary
                    intercourse. Assuming two periods of <hi rend="italic">transition</hi> besides,
                    we have the following divisions, with the approximate dates:</p>

                <p>The same divisions have to be made for Low German, but the scheme cannot be so
                    fully carried through, as the time between 1000 and 1200 is almost destitute of
                    literary monuments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Old German.—</hi> The inflexional characteristics of Old German
                    are almost identical with those of Old English. Nouns had the same five
                    cases,—nominative, accusative (only in a few instances kept distinct), genitive,
                    dative, and instrumental. Strong and weak declensions of nouns and their
                    subdivisions are likewise the same. The dual of the first and second personal
                    pronouns is almost extinct in Old High German, but is quite common in Low
                    German. In the verb we find the same distinction of the subjunctive from the
                    indicative mood, and the same two inflected tenses, present and past,—the former
                    also used for the future, the latter for all shades of past time. The order of
                    the sentence corresponds generally to the modern use, but is not kept so
                    strictly as now, especially in the oldest prose texts, which are often
                    materially influenced by the Latin sources from which they have been derived or
                    translated.</p>
                <p>The earliest extant specimen of Low German belongs to the beginning of the 9th
                    century. It is a short formula of renunciation of the devil to be used before

                <p>We cannot, unfortunately, tell what special dialect of Low German this piece
                    belonged to, nor even whether it was originally written in German, as several
                    forms occurring in it have rather an Old English look. No more certain are the
                    place of origin and the dialect of the most important relic of the Old Saxon
                    language, the great poem of the <hi rend="italic">Heliand,</hi> or the History
                    of our Saviour, composed in the old alliterative verse by a Saxon cleric or
                    monk, about the year 830. We quote as a specimen the following lines from the
                    Munich MS.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This MS.

                <p>Much more numerous and various in age and dialect are the documents of Old High

                    be to the student of grammar, not much can be said for their intrinsic value.
                    Almost all the prose pieces are mere translations (many of them could not be
                    worse) from the Latin; and even such poetical works as Otfrid’s <hi

                <p>High German, as already hinted, is chiefly distinguished from the other Teutonic
                    languages by a certain transformation of its mute system. The ordinary

                <p>This is the state of things in the High Frankish or Eastern Frankish dialect,
                    spoken in the south-east of the Frankish territory. In the earliest period, as
                    may be seen from the above list, it still preserved the <hi rend="italic"
                    >th</hi> sound in many cases; in the later stages <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is
                    found to have been substituted, as in Modern High German. The Upper German
                    dialects show the same change at a much earlier time, and, in addition to this,
                    they have also changed <hi rend="italic">k</hi> initial and following a
                    consonant into <hi rend="italic">ch,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> initial into <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> (representing most likely voiceless soft stops, as still pronounced in
                    South Germany and Switzerland); Bavarian admits <hi rend="italic">p</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> even in the middle of words. Thus we have, for instance,
                    <hi rend="italic">denchen</hi> for Frankish i/wnføn, to think; <hi rend="italic"
                    >pitten</hi> for Frankish <hi rend="italic">bitten,</hi> to bid; <hi
                    rend="italic">keban,</hi> or Bavarian <hi rend="italic">kepan,</hi> for Frankish
                    <hi rend="italic">geban,</hi> to give. In illustration of these distinctions and
                    some other variations of spelling we may quote three contemporaneous versions of

                <p>It is impossible to give here a sufficient idea of the variability of Old High
                    German, as, indeed, out of several hundred pieces that have come to our
                    knowledge, there are not two representing exactly the same dialect to all its
                    shades or at least in exactly the same spelling. We shall therefore restrict
                    ourselves to a short notice of the more important documents. South-western
                    Frankish is best represented by a very old translation of a treatise by Isidorus

                    out the phonetic difference between such diphthongs as <hi rend="italic"

                    that their power reaches to the end of the world?”</p>
                <p>It will be clear from what has been said above that the main feature of the Old
                    High German period is the total absence of a common literary language. No
                    voluntary modifications of the form of speech are to be found, but such as are
                    naturally involved in any attempt to adapt a spoken idiom to literary use.
                    Nevertheless it has been suggested by K. Müllenhoff<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See his Denkmäler, Introduction.</p></note>
                    and others that idioms of a more refined character than the ordinary popular
                    dialects were spoken at the principal courts of the empire, and especially at
                    the imperial court itself, and that the authority of these <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hofsprachen</hi> was great enough to exercise a modifying influence on the
                    literary productions throughout the empire, or in those parts at least where
                    High German was the vernacular speech. But how these suppositions can be proved
                    does not appear, or how they can be reconciled with the fact that all literary
                    documents of the period <hi rend="italic">are</hi> dialectal.</p>

                    Scherer, Geschichte der deutschen Literatur im XI. und XII. Jahrhundert,

                    specimens of poetry, and these of poor quality, the number of poems (mainly of a
                    theological bearing) dating from the 11th century is not inconsiderable, and the
                    12th century shows a rapidity of literary development almost unparalleled. At
                    first indeed religious and legendary poetry is still prevalent, but soon
                    literature begins to take a more historical or epic turn. This tendency is
                    clearly visible in the <hi rend="italic">Kaiserchronik,</hi> or Emperor’s
                    Chronicle, in which the first attempt is made to give a survey of universal and
                    German history in a poetical form. The romantic tales of Alexander the Great and
                    of the battle of Roncesvalles weretranslated from the French,— the <hi
                    rend="italic">Alexanderlied</hi> by the Pfaffe Lamprecht, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rolandslied</hi> by the Pfaffe Konrad; while old national traditions
                    contributed fitting subjects for such epic poems as that concerning the
                    adventures of the Lombard King Rother. Lyric poetry, hitherto altogether
                    neglected, sprang suddenly into vigour in the remote east of Austria about the
                    middle of the century, and soon found its way to other countries. But the most
                    decided advance was not made till about 1180, when the new forms of social life
                    that had crept in among the more cultivated classes, in imitation of the laws
                    and customs of French chivalry, began to exercise a powerful reforming influence
                    on all branches of poetry. The example set by the Netherlands poet, Heinrich von
                    Veldeke (who for some time lived, and partly wrote, in Germany), in his <hi
                    rend="italic">JEηeit,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> was soon followed
                    by the three great epic masters of the period, Hartmann von Λue, Gottfried von
                    Strasburg, and Wolfram von Eschenbach. About the same time the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nibelungenlied</hi> and other compositions of a more national character were
                    composed, while lyric poetry was raised to a height of excellence never attained
                    at any other period of the Middle Ages, and best represented in the songs of
                    Walther von der Vogelweide. It is true enough that this new chivalrous poetry
                    was not always very original in thought; indeed, most epic poems of this class,
                    and many lyric stanzas, have been directly copied from French models; but its
                    influence on the culture of the language was immense. It was then for the first
                    time that Germany possessed a real literary language, undoubtedly homogeneous as
                    far as style and metre are concerned. Whether a similar unity of the outer form
                    of speech had already been reached at that period is a point very difficult to
                    decide. The question was raised for the first time as early as 1820, by Karl
                    Lachmann, in his <hi rend="italic">Ausιvahl</hi><hi rend="italic">aus den
                    hochdeutschen Dichtern des</hi><hi rend="italic">XIII. Jahrh.</hi> Lachmann’s
                    opinion was that the poets of the 13th century spoke a definite, unchangeable
                    sort of High German, a few minor dialectal peculiarities being excepted, and
                    that uneducated scribes had been guilty of introducing older or corrupt forms of
                    the common speech into our manuscripts. These views were at the time unanimously
                    accepted, and are still held (though in a somewhat modified form, admitting two
                    literary idioms, one in the south, the other in the midland) by a majority of
                    the German philologists of the present day. As a consequence of this, most of
                    the “critical” editions of Middle High German poetry that have appeared since
                    Lachmann’s time do not reproduce the original readings of the manuscripts, but
                    give the texts in a “corrected” form, commonly called “correct Middle High
                    German,” which is assumed to appear in its purest form in the works of Hartmann
                    von Aue. It is chiefly Alemannian, or Swabian, with some Frankish peculiarities
                    of spelling in the use of the consonants, in order to produce a greater
                    resemblance to ordinary Modern High German orthography. No manuscript, however,
                    is known to be written in exactly the same language or orthography; nor are
                    there any poets, except those of Swabia, who do not clearly show by their rhymes
                    the existence of dialectal forms in their speech, All incongruities in the
                    rhymes disappear when they are transferred to the forms peculiar to the local
                    dialects of their authors.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This has been exemplified in a most masterly manner by W. Braune, va
                    Untersuchungen über Heinrich von Veldeke·, see Zeitschrift für deutsche
                    Philologie, iv. p. 279 sqq. Braune has conclusively shown that Heinrich von
                    Veldeke never tried to write German (although he wrote for German readers), as
                    had generally been supposed before, but simply wrote in his familiar Netherlands
                    dialect.</p></note> It was therefore but natural that a reaction against
                    Lachmann’s views should ultimately have set in;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See especially H. Paul, Gab es eine
                    mittelhochdeutsche Schrift-sprächet Halle, 1873. Paul seems, however, to go too
                    far in denying the existence of some peculiarities of style pointed out by
                    Lachmann and his followers.</p></note> and this reaction appears to have been
                    right in denying that dialectal forms were purposely and studiously avoided,
                    even by the classic authors of the period, with a view to the approximation of
                    their language to a certain universal idiom never existing anywhere but in the
                    fancy of certain modern writers. How injurious to the study of Middle High
                    German dialects the views of Lachmann, had they prevailed, must have been, it is
                    easy to see; but on the other hand it must not be forgotten that the only method
                    of investigating the dialects of the single authors was that followed by
                    Lachmann, viz., to reconstruct them by a careful study of the rhymes, for the
                    dialects of the manuscripts are often, nay in most cases, clearly different from
                    those of the writers themselves, as shown by the rhymes. It is therefore not so
                    much the principle of reconstruction that has been resisted by Lachmann’s
                    opponents as the way in which this reconstruction has been practically carried
                    out. For prose writings of course no such reconstruction is possible; still,
                    prose documents, especially such as were destined for local use only (charters,
                    &lt;fcc.), and therefore less liable to adulterations of the original, are often
                    the main sources for German dialectology.</p>
                <p>The prominent feature of German (Low German included) in this period is the
                    levelling of the unaccented vowels of the inflexional and some of the derivative
                    syl-tables<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n536/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0536-0519"/> already mentioned. As to the former there is only
                    one exception, viz., the retaining of the termination <hi rend="italic">iu</hi>
                    (pronounced as Modern German <hi rend="italic">u</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> qt</hi> French long w) for the nom. sing. fem. and the nom. and acc.
                    plur. neutr. of the adjectives <hi rend="italic">(flindiu,</hi> while all other
                    cases have the levelled <hi rend="italic">e)</hi>; and even this seems to be a
                    speciality of Upper German, the corresponding Midland form being <hi
                    rend="italic">blinde</hi> as in Modern German. The unaccented <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> is frequently dropped in all dialects, especially in the south, where
                    the dropping is almost regular after an <hi rend="italic">r</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> closing a short syllable, as in <hi rend="italic">bern,
                    steln,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">bereu,</hi><hi rend="italic">stelen,</hi> to
                    bear, to steal; Old High German, <hi rend="italic">beraη, stelaη.</hi> In the
                    Midland dialects <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is often written for this <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> thus <hi rend="italic">berin, steliη.</hi> The accented
                    vowels of the root syllables are greatly changed in this period by the “Umlaut,”
                    or mutation of sounds, being an assimilation of these vowels to an <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">y</hi> originally following. Thus <hi
                    rend="italic">a, a, o,</hi><hi rend="italic">o, u, ü,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >uo</hi> are changed to e, ce, <hi rend="italic">Ü</hi> or ö, ce, w, <hi
                    rend="italic">iu</hi> (long <hi rend="italic">ü), üe,</hi> as may be seen in the
                    following instances :— <hi rend="italic">hant,</hi> hand, pl. <hi rend="italic"
                    >hende; rat,</hi> council, pl. <hi rend="italic">rcete; golt,</hi> gold, <hi
                    rend="italic">güldîn,</hi> golden, or <hi rend="italic">mohte,</hi> I might,
                    subj. <hi rend="italic">mohte; groz,</hi> great, <hi rend="italic">groeze,</hi>
                    size; <hi rend="italic">kus,</hi> a kiss, <hi rend="italic">küssen,</hi> to
                    kiss; <hi rend="italic">müs,</hi> mouse, pl. <hi rend="italic">miuse∙,
                    guot,</hi> good, <hi rend="italic">güete,</hi> goodness. The Umlaut, however, is
                    not always expressed in the spelling of the manuscripts, though it must have
                    existed in the living language. Of the diphthongs, <hi rend="italic">iu</hi> has
                    been changed into long <hi rend="italic">ü,</hi> but the old spelling is often
                    retained in the MSS. <hi rend="italic">(liute,</hi> modern <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leute,</hi> Old High German <hi rend="italic">liuti,</hi> people). As to the
                    consonants, the <hi rend="italic">th</hi> sound had nearly disappeared at the
                    beginning of the period, and was lost entirely in its course; <hi rend="italic"
                    >sk</hi> has passed into the <hi rend="italic">sh</hi> sound, written <hi
                    rend="italic">sch</hi> as in Modern German. Spelling in general is simpler, and
                    in some points more rigidly phonetic than in Old German. Final voiced
                    consonants, as <hi rend="italic">b, d, g,</hi> are generally changed into the
                    corresponding voiceless sounds, as <hi rend="italic">p, t, c</hi> (in High
                    German <hi rend="italic">grap,</hi> grave, gen. &lt;7rαδes, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ρfat,</hi> path, gen. <hi rend="italic">pfades, tac,</hi> day, gen. <hi
                    rend="italic">dages;</hi> in Low German <hi rend="italic">graf graves, pat
                    pades, dach dages).</hi> Double consonants are simplified in the same position,
                    as in Old German <hi rend="italic">{fal,</hi> ball, gen. <hi rend="italic"
                    >banes').</hi> The use of the letter <hi rend="italic">v</hi> has greatly
                    increased; in High German it means simply <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> and is
                    therefore quite superfluous; in Low German its pronunciation is <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> at the beginning of words, while in the middle of words it
                    lias the same sound as English <hi rend="italic">v.</hi></p>
                <p>The leading dialects of the period are those of Old German, the most noteworthy
                    difference being the accession of the dialects of the kingdom of Saxony <hi
                    rend="italic">{Obersächsisch,</hi> or Upper Saxon) and Silesia to the midland
                    dialects, and those of some eastern provinces of Prussia <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Niedersächsisch,</hi> or Low Saxon) to Low German, in consequence of the
                    German colonization of these countries. Low German, to begin with, has retained
                    the phonetic structure of its consonantal system unaltered, except by the loss
                    of the <hi rend="italic">th</hi> sound. The spelling of the vowel system is very
                    imperfect. Umlaut is not expressed in the older manuscripts, except in the case
                    of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> A long <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> corresponds to both High German <hi rend="italic">ei</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">ie,</hi> a long <hi rend="italic">o</hi> to High German
                    <hi rend="italic">ou, ou,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uo,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >üe,</hi> the only diphthong generally admitted being <hi rend="italic">ou</hi>
                    before a w, as in <hi rend="italic">hrnιwen,</hi> to hew. The pronunciation of ë
                    and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> must, however, in these cases have been different
                    according to their etymological values, for all the High German sounds mentioned
                    above are distinctly kept asunder in the modern Low German dialects, and <hi
                    rend="italic">ei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> or <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
                    are often written for ë and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> where they stand for High
                    German <hi rend="italic">ei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uo</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">üe,</hi> but never otherwise. It is most likely, judging from the
                    present state of things, that open <hi rend="italic">e,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >o</hi> were the equivalents for High German <hi rend="italic">ei,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ou, ou,</hi> while close <hi rend="italic">e,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> corresponded to High German <hi rend="italic">ie,
                    uo,</hi><hi rend="italic">üe.</hi> The préfixais dropped, as in English and in
                    the Scandinavian languages (thus <hi rend="italic">bort,</hi> birth, High German
                    <hi rend="italic">geburt).</hi> But the most remarkable fact in the history of
                    Low German sounds is the restoration of <hi rend="italic">nd</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ηn</hi> for <hi rend="italic">th</hi> after a dropped nasal sound
                    (see above, p. 516), as in <hi rend="italic">ander</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >anner,</hi> other, for Old Saxon <hi rend="italic">6thar,</hi> or in <hi
                    rend="italic">muηt,</hi> mouth, for Old Saxon <hi rend="italic">muth.</hi> This
                    transition cannot be explained by any phonetic laws, but must necessarily be
                    ascribed to High German influence. As to the inflexional system, a similar
                    influence seems to have introduced the High German terminations of the plural of
                    verbs <hi rend="italic">{wi geven, gi gevet, se geven</hi> we, you, they give).
                    The Old Saxon ∙* in the nominative plural has been dropped, as in High German.
                    The following lines quoted from the municipal laws of the town of Hamburg
                    (written 1270) maybe taken as a fair specimen of 13th-century Low German :—“Dat
                    nement syn erue verkopen schal, he ne bede id erst synen negesten. So we syn
                    erue vorkopen wil, dat bynnen desser stad vnde bynnen dessem wicbelde belegen
                    is, de schal id beden twen synen negesten vrunden, dar syn erue vp vallen mach,
                    vnde wil it erer nen kopen, so mot he syn erue wol vorkopen deme de erne dar
                    vmme allermest geuen wil.” “That nobody shall sell his inheritance, unless he
                    offer it first to his nearest (relations). Whosoever is willing to sell his
                    inheritance, that is situated within this town and within these precincts, shall
                    offer it to two his nearest friends (relations), to whom his inheritance may
                    fall, and if neither of them is willing to buy it, he must (may) well sell his
                    inheritance to him who is willing to give him most for it.”</p>
                <p>The differences of the main dialects of High German are not very striking during
                    the first stage of this period. Alemannian is best characterized by its rigidly
                    keeping its original vowel qualities, some of the modern Swiss dialects showing
                    exactly the same system as about 1200. Swabian is easily discovered by its
                    frequent use of <hi rend="italic">au</hi> for <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> as in
                    <hi rend="italic">gaun,</hi> to go, for <hi rend="italic">gaη.</hi> A very
                    important change of vowel qualities is found to have taken place, at a very
                    early time, in the Bavarian dialect. While <hi rend="italic">ie, uo, He</hi>
                    were preserved as in Alemannian, <hi rend="italic">ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou,
                    ou</hi> were changed into <hi rend="italic">oei</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">ai),
                    au, eu</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">au),</hi> and three new diphthongs, <hi
                    rend="italic">ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou, eu,</hi> sprang up from the long
                    vowels <hi rend="italic">ï, Û,</hi><hi rend="italic">iu (u).</hi> In the Midland
                    dialects again, <hi rend="italic">ei, mi,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ï, ü,
                    ü</hi> were kept, as in Alemannian (although <hi rend="italic">ü</hi> is
                    generally not distinguished from <hi rend="italic">u</hi> in writing, as in most
                    Midland manuscripts no special signs for the Umlaut vowels are u≡ed, except <hi
                    rend="italic">e),</hi> but <hi rend="italic">ie, uo,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >üe</hi> were contracted to simple <hi rend="italic">ï, ü</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(u),</hi> differing from the old <hi rend="italic">ï, ü,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >iu</hi> only in their open quality. The system of these changes may be
                    illustrated by the following list :—</p>

                    exercise discipline with the ban).”</p>
                <p>In the 14th and 15th centuries the development of the dialects rapidly advanced.
                    The greatest changes were those occurring in the vowel system. The new
                    diphthongs <hi rend="italic">ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou, eu,</hi> for older z,
                    w, <hi rend="italic">iu,</hi> which had originated in the southeastern parts of
                    the Bavarian district gradually spread to the north and west; even some of the
                    South Midland dialects, as Bohemian and Silesian, began to partake of this
                    change, while the north Midland dialects and Alemannian remained unaltered.
                    Short root syllables ending in a single consonant began to be lengthened in
                    almost all dialects, as <hi rend="italic">geben,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >riemeη,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">geben,</hi><hi rend="italic">nemen,</hi> to
                    give, to take. Unaccented <hi rend="italic">e</hi> was dropped in the southern
                    dialects, especially in Bavarian, to the utmost extent possible. Such forms as
                    <hi rend="italic">pschoech,</hi><hi rend="italic">gtorst, hcert,</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">beschoehe,</hi> happened (subj.), <hi rend="italic">getorste,</hi>
                    I durst, <hi rend="italic">gehoeret,</hi> heard (part.), began to be quite
                    familiar. Even before a final <hi rend="italic">l</hi> or nasal sound <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> was now and then dropped in Bavarian, as in&lt;7eδm for <hi
                    rend="italic">geben,</hi> to give, <hi rend="italic">gegnt</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">eg</hi><hi rend="italic">ende</hi>
                    country, which are exactly the forms still used in our time. Midland and Low
                    German dialects continued to be much more conservative in all these respects. In
                    the consonantal system we have to mention the loss of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >2</hi> sound in all dialects, where it was a simple spirant (notis); although
                    the letter <hi rend="italic">z</hi> was still often preserved in spelling, it
                    was frequently confounded with s in the rhymes, a thing which never occurred in
                    the earlier centuries. Alemannian is chiefly distinguished by its constant
                    change of <hi rend="italic">sm, sn, sl, sw, sp, st</hi> into <hi rend="italic"
                    >schm, schn,</hi><hi rend="italic">seid,</hi><hi rend="italic">schιv,
                    schp,</hi><hi rend="italic">seht,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">schmit,</hi>
                    smith, <hi rend="italic">sehne,</hi> snow, <hi rend="italic">schlahen,</hi> to
                    slay, <hi rend="italic">schwimmen,</hi> to swim, <hi rend="italic"
                    >geschproehen</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> spoken, <hi rend="italic"
                    >geischtlich,</hi> “ghostly,” spiritual. Late Bavarian favours such spellings as
                    <hi rend="italic">chrankch, pekch,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">krank,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">becke.</hi> Spelling in general was much neglected, although it
                    was not quite so bad as often in the 1Gth century, when there was a strong
                    tendency towards crowding as many letters into a word as possible.</p>
                <p>While the 15th century was thus marked by great divergencies of the spoken
                    dialects, important steps towards gaining a greater uniformity of literary
                    speech were made in the same period by the invention of the art of printing, and
                    by the development of certain <hi rend="italic">Kanzleisprachen,</hi> or
                    literary idioms of the imperial and other chanceries. There is no need to
                    explain how the habit of reading books printed in dialects not familiar to the
                    reader must have obliged the learned public of the time to acquire a certain
                    amount of knowledge of dialects in general, and must have made them better aware
                    of the peculiarities of their own idioms than was either necessary or possible
                    at the time when manuscripts written expressly in the local dialects of the
                    readers were the only means of conveying literary information. Besides, writers
                    as well as printers must soon have found it profitable to publish their works in
                    a language readily understood by readers in all parts of the country. The
                    principal work, however, was doue in Germany by the chanceries. Among these the
                    imperial chancery naturally held the most prominent position; and, inasmuch as
                    its public acts were addressed to readers of all dialects existing throughout
                    the empire, it obviously had also the greatest interest in calling into
                    existence a general idiom. In the 14th century no difference between the
                    language of the imperial chancery and the local idioms of the particular
                    emperors was yet visible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Louis of Bavaria (1314-1347) were written in the Bavarian dialect. The
                    succession of Charles IV. (1347-1378) was accompanied by the introduction of the
                    Bohemian dialect into the imperial charters. This dialect, as was natural from
                    its local position, was neither purely Southern nor purely Midland. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou, eu</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ï,
                    ü,</hi><hi rend="italic">iu</hi> were frequently adopted from the Southern
                    dialects, but <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> for <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> for <hi rend="italic">b</hi> were generally rejected;
                    unaccented vowels were preserved to about the same extent as in Midland German.
                    In the reign of Wenceslaus of Bohemia (1378-1400) the same state of things was
                    maintained; but in the charters of Rupert, the elector palatine (1400-1410), we
                    find the Midland dialect of the Palatinate. Sigismund (1410-1437) reintroduced
                    the Bohemian dialect, which by this time had, with the exception of a very short
                    period, prevailed for nearly a hundred years in the imperial chancery. It was
                    therefore but natural that Duke Frederick of Austria should exchange the
                    Austrian dialect of his ducal chancery (which abounded with <hi rend="italic"
                    >kch, kh, kg [oxk,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> for δ) for the Bohemian
                    chancery dialect of his predecessors, when he succeeded to the imperial throne
                    (1470-1493). His example was followed by Maximilian (1493-1519), but only so far
                    as public Acts were concerned. In charters destined for local Austrian use as
                    well as in his private correspondence he always kept his vernacular Austrian
                    dialect, showing thus that no change of the spoken idioms had been caused as yet
                    by the introduction of the new artificial language. In the same manner and at
                    the same time the Midland dialect of the electoral chancery of Saxony came to be
                    better adapted for general use by the adoption of the Southern <hi rend="italic"
                    >ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou, eu</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ï, ü,</hi><hi

                    tried to give a short sketch of the origin of literary Modern High German; and
                    it is this very idiom of the imperial and Saxon chanceries that Luther made
                    afterwards popular by his translation of the Bible and his numerous other
                    writings. We may quote his own words in confirmation :— .</p>
                <p>“Ich habe keine gewisse, sonderliche, eigne spräche im deutschen, sondern brauche
                    der gemeinen deutschen spräche, das mich beide Ober-und Niederländer verstehen

                    grammarians, as Sebastian Franck (1531) and Johannes Clajus (1578), and was
                    accordingly imitated, as the <pb break="no"

                    the 1Cth century many writers, especially in Switzerland and Lower Germany,
                    still clung with great pertinacity to their native dialects. But about 1600
                    Luther’s language was fully established as the only idiom of literary
                    intercourse throughout Germany.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    mostly concern the inflexional system. In the strong verbs the differences
                    between the singular and plural and the indicative and subjunctive of the past
                    have been levelled in the course of time: thus, <hi rend="italic">ich
                    fand,</hi><hi rend="italic">zvir</hi><hi rend="italic">fanden,</hi> I, we found,
                    subj. <hi rend="italic">ich fände,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ich schnitt, wir
                    schnitten,</hi> I, we cut, for <hi rend="italic">ich fand·, wir fanden, ich
                    fände,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ich schneit, ivir schnitten.</hi> At present
                    the verb <hi rend="italic">werden,</hi> to become, is the only specimen left of
                    the old regular inflexion :— <hi rend="italic">ich</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ward,</hi><hi rend="italic">wir</hi><hi rend="italic">ιvurden,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ich würde’,</hi> but even here a new irregular form, <hi
                    rend="italic">ich wurde,</hi> has come into use and almost superseded the more
                    archaic <hi rend="italic">ich</hi><hi rend="italic">ward,</hi> which is now
                    chiefly confined to poetry. Many other vowel changes have taken place besides,
                    as in <hi rend="italic">ιvebe,</hi><hi rend="italic">wob, gewoben,</hi> weave,
                    wove, woven, for Middle High German <hi rend="italic">wibe, reap, geweben,</hi>
                    so that the old system of “Ablaut,” or vowel change in the root syllables of the
                    strong verbs has often become quite indistinct. A great number of verbs have
                    passed from the strong inflexion to the weak, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> The declension of substantives has also been greatly altered. Umlaut
                    is now regularly used as a plural sign with most monosyllabic and many
                    dissyllabic masculine words, as in <hi rend="italic">baum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bäume,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nagel, nagel,</hi> for Middle High German <hi
                    rend="italic">bourn, bourne,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nagel, nagele-,</hi>
                    originally it was confined to a much smaller number of words (7-stems, as <hi
                    rend="italic">gast, gäste,</hi> Middle High German <hi rend="italic"
                    >gast,</hi><hi rend="italic">geste).</hi> Other masculine words have adopted the
                    plural-er, together with Umlaut of the root syllables, from the neuter
                    declension, as <hi rend="italic">mann, männer,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >geist,</hi><hi rend="italic">geister,</hi> besides frequent exchanges between
                    the strong and weak declensions, which cannot be specified here. The strong and
                    the weak declension of feminine words originally ending in <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> have been melted together, one form (ending in <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    or a consonant) being used for all singular, and one (ending in <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi> or <hi rend="italic">η</hi> after a consonant) for all
                    plural cases, as &lt;∕cιδe, <hi rend="italic">gaben, zahl, zahlen,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">zuηge,</hi><hi rend="italic">Zungen,</hi> for Middle High German
                    <hi rend="italic">gäbe, gäbe,</hi> gen. and dat. <hi rend="italic"
                    >gäben-,</hi><hi rend="italic">zαl,</hi><hi rend="italic">zal,</hi> gen. and
                    dat. ζα/π; <hi rend="italic">zunge,</hi> gen. dat. and acc. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zungen,</hi> pl. <hi rend="italic">Zungen</hi> throughout. As to phonology, no
                    change of vowel quality is noticeable in literary German. Modern High German
                    still has the Midland sounds 7 (often spelt <hi rend="italic">ie),</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ü,</hi><hi rend="italic">ü,</hi> for Southern <hi rend="italic"
                    >ie, uo,</hi><hi rend="italic">üe,</hi> as well as the Bavarian diphthongs <hi
                    rend="italic">ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">au, eu</hi> (αw), for the older sounds
                    7, <hi rend="italic">u, iu,</hi> the latter not being distinguished either in
                    spelling or in educated pronunciation from the older diphthongs <hi
                    rend="italic">ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou,</hi><hi rend="italic">on.</hi> We
                    have thus <hi rend="italic">zwei, drei,</hi><hi rend="italic">baum,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">haus,</hi><hi rend="italic">frende,</hi><hi rend="italic">hauser,

                    rend="italic">vronde, hiuser, liute.</hi> Change of vowel quantity is the most
                    prominent phonetic feature of Modern High German when compared with the earlier
                    stages of the language. All root-syllables ending formerly in a short vowel
                    followed by a simple consonant have now become long, either by lengthening the
                    vowel or by doubling the consonant, thus <hi rend="italic">täg, täge,
                    säl,</hi><hi rend="italic">bote,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gott, gottes,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">blatt, blätter,</hi> for AIiddle High German <hi rend="italic"
                    >tag</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">täc), täge,</hi><hi rend="italic">sal, bote,
                    got, gδtes, blat, bleter.</hi> The rules for dropping unaccented vowels have
                    often been changed accordingly. It must not be forgotten, however, that all
                    these rules are only applicable to the literary idiom; the dialects, and even
                    those of the educated people, often differ very materially from the rules laid
                    down above. There is, indeed, no such thing as a generally recognized standard
                    pronunciation of German, except perhaps on the stage, which no doubt has
                    exercised and still exercises a certain influence on the cur rent opinions as to
                    how one ought to pronounce, but has not been powerful enough to abolish all
                    dialectal peculiarities in the case of even the highest classes. Only a very few
                    general rules can be given. Englishmen will do well to pronounce the vowels as
                    in Italian: <hi rend="italic">ü</hi> and <hi rend="italic">'o</hi> are rounded
                    or labialized <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> sounds,
                    formed by pouting the lips while trying to pronounce <hi rend="italic">i</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> Long vowels are always pronounced simple, never as
                    diphthongs (which is frequently the case in English, especially with <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o).</hi> Unaccented <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> is invariably dropped in the terminations <hi rend="italic">el,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">en,</hi> the real pronunciation of such words as <hi rend="italic"

                    >häbm,</hi><hi rend="italic">nem</hi> (with a lengthened <hi rend="italic"

                    easily detected by their generally inserting a real vowel-sound before the l,
                    n.</p></note> Among the peculiarities of the consonantal system we may mention
                    the sound of <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> (in two distinct varieties as in <hi
                    rend="italic">αch</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ich),</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >z,</hi> which is a combination of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">s,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> which ought to be
                    trilled with the tip of the tongue, but is often pronounced as a uvular or
                    guttural sound. <hi rend="italic">S</hi> initial is generally sounded like the
                    English 2, in stage pronunciation, but not usually elsewhere; <hi rend="italic"
                    >st</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sp</hi> initial are never pronounced on the stage
                    like English <hi rend="italic">st</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sp,</hi> but are
                    always <hi rend="italic">sht, slip,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">stein,
                    spiel,</hi> pronounced (to use English spelling) as <hi rend="italic">shtine,
                    shpeel.</hi> The English <hi rend="italic">10</hi> ought to be avoided. The
                    German <hi rend="italic">w</hi> sound is more like English <hi rend="italic"
                    >v,</hi> but somewhat softer; in Midland pronunciation a sound intermediate
                    between English <hi rend="italic">w</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> takes its
                    place. German <hi rend="italic">v</hi> is simply ∕.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The varieties of the German dialects of the present are too numerous to be
                    described here. It may suffice to state that the old divisions of Low German,
                    Midland, and Upper German dialects are still applicable. Among the first, the
                    Western or Westphalian dialects are distinctly marked by the pronunciation of
                    <hi rend="italic">g</hi> initial as a <hi rend="italic">gh,</hi> or voiced <hi
                    rend="italic">ch</hi> (sometimes even voiceless), and the use of numerous
                    diphthongs, both long and short, instead of simple vowels. The principal
                    subdivisions of Midland German are the Lower Rhenish or Middle Frankish dialect
                    (including the German dialects of Transylvania), South-Western and Eastern or
                    High Frankish, Hessian, Thuringian, Saxon, and Silesian. Alemannian is divided
                    into the three main groupsof Swabian, Alsatian, and Swiss, while Bavarian is
                    constituted by several subdialects spoken in Bavaria and Austria. The study of
                    these dialects has been carried on in Germany for a considerable time,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A very full list of books
                    referring to German dialectology has been given by C. H. Herrmann, Bibliotheca

                    especially so far as phonology is concerned; for many observers, while
                    well-trained in all the disciplines of the older school of philology, have been
                    totally ignorant of the simplest laws of phonetics. It is only within the last
                    few years that the value of phonetic studies (although they began in German
                    researches) has been duly recognized in the country of their origin, and
                    dialectology has not hitherto gained much by the more theoretical study of
                    general phonetics. Some excellent beginnings indeed have been made, among which
                    Dr Winteler’s book on his native Swiss dialect holds by far the foremost
                    rank;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>J. Winteler, Die

                    Counties of Scotland, published in 1873.</p></note> but it is probable that a
                    long time must yet elapse before Germany can possess so well trained and
                    independent a school of phonetists as that which already exists in England
                    headed by Mr A. Melville Bell and Mr Alexander J. Ellis. Not till then, however,
                    can a real history of the German language be written. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.

                <p>There is a deep vein of poetry in the Teutonic nature, and it appears to have
                    revealed itself in the earliest ages. According to Tacitus, the Germans of his
                    time had ancient songs relating to the god Tuisco, his son Mannus, and the three
                    forefathers of the Teutonic race. They had also poems in honour of Arminius, the
                    original subject of which was probably the god Irmin, whose pillar Charles the
                    Great overthrew long afterwards in his first campaign against the Saxons. A song
                    called “barditus,” celebrating the greatness of the war-god whom Tacitus calls
                    Hercules, was sung or chanted by the freemen as they advanced to battle. The
                    name “barditus” led some ingenious writers of the 18th century to speculate
                    respecting an order of bards among the ancient Germans; but there is no evidence
                    that any such order existed. “Barditus” meant in the first instance a shield,
                    and was transferred to the song because, while the singing went on, the shield
                    was held to the mouth to make the sound more terrible. It is the opinion of many
                    critics that the stories of “Reynard the Fox” and “Isengrim the Wolf” may be
                    traced back to these remote times. If so, the probability is that they were
                    brought by the Teutons from Asia, and were originally common to the Aryan
                    family. There is every reason to believe that some elements of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> belong to the prehistoric age. The legend of
                    Siegfried has all the marks of extreme antiquity, and it seems to have had at
                    first a purely mythological character. Of the rhythm in which these primitive
                    conceptions were embodied we have no certain knowledge; but as the most ancient
                    poems which have been preserved are in alliterative verse, it is reasonable to
                    assume that this had grown up long before writing came into use.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">The Early Middle Age.—</hi> When the German tribes began to
                    accept Christianity the clergy every where opposed the native poetry, and strove
                    to replace its rude conceptions by the milder imagée of the gospel. Among the
                    Goths of the 4th century Bishop Ulfilas took the most effectual means of
                    achieving his purpose by preparing a clear, faithful, and simple rendering of
                    the Scriptures,—a translation which has been of inestimable value in the
                    scientific study of the Teutonic languages. No clergyman of like genius arose in
                    Germany itself; but there, too, pagan compositions were steadily discouraged.
                    Charles the Great was the first to check this hostile movement. He showed his
                    love of his native speech, not only by beginning to put together a German
                    grammar, but by issuing orders for a collection of old German poetry. Louis the
                    Pious had little sympathy with the taste of his father, but he could not efface
                    the impression produced by the great emperor. Many of the clergy ceased to
                    dislike that which so mighty a friend of the church had approved, and in some
                    monasteries there were ardent collectors of ancient epic fragments and
                    ballads.</p>
                <p>These treasures of Old High and Low German literature are nearly all lost, but
                    from the small portions which have come down to us, and from hints in Latin
                    chronicles, we can at least make out the themes with which many of them dealt.
                    Ermanrick, or Ermanaricus, the famous Gothic king of the 4th century, was the
                    subject of a large number of poetical legends. Siegfried continued to be a great
                    epic hero, and from about the 7th century he appears to have been no longer
                    treated as superhuman. The legend of the overthrow of the Burgundian king,
                    Gundicarius or Günther, by Attila assumed many forms, and was at a later time
                    connected with the story of Siegfried. Around the name of Theodoric the East
                    Goth, as Dieterich, several legends soon grouped themselves; and from about the
                    9th century he was associated with Attila, with whom in history he had nothing
                    to do. Unfortunately, the fragments which have been preserved—all of which are
                    alliterative—do not treat of these supreme heroes; their subjects are of
                    subordinate importance and interest. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hildebrandsl·ied,</hi> which was written from traditional narratives early in
                    the 9th century, and is in a mixed dialect, introduces us to a follower of
                    Dieterich. Hildebrand, returning from the wars carried on by his lord, is
                    compelled to fight his own son; but we are left in uncertainty whether father or
                    son is conqueror. The <hi rend="italic">Ludwigslied</hi> is a ballad of the
                    latter part of the 9th century, written in honour of a victory gained over the
                    Northmen by Louis III., the West-Frankish king. The author was probably a monk
                    who had been a favourite at the court of Charles the Bald. There is also an Old
                    High German ballad celebrating the reconciliation of Otto I. with his brother
                    Henry; and similar ballads are known to have kept up the fame of Duke Ernest of
                    Swabia, who rebelled against Conrad II., and of many other popular heroes.
                    Walter of Aquitania, who flies with his bride fpm the court of Attila, and at
                    Worms fights King Günther and his warriors, is the hero of a Latin poem of the
                    10th century, written by a mouk of St Gall, whose materials were evidently taken
                    from a more vigorous German original. The <hi rend="italic">Merseburger</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gediçhte,</hi> two songs of enchantment, were written in the 10th
                    century, but must have come down from a much more remote period. They are
                    chiefly interesting for the light they throw upon the religious beliefs and
                    customs of ancient Germany.</p>
                <p>The old ballads, which were intended to be sung as well as recited, were handed
                    down from generation to generation, and necessarily underwent many changes. They
                    were preserved from an early period in the memory of the people by professional
                    minstrels, who were held in considerable honour in the time of Charles the
                    Great, but were afterwards rather tolerated than encouraged by the higher
                    classes. Many of them were blind men, and in their solitary wanderings the
                    ancient stories must often have assumed in their minds new shapes. They usually
                    accompanied their singing with the zither or the harp.</p>
                <p>Of the works with which the church sought to counteract pagan influences very few
                    remain. The most important is <hi rend="italic">Heliand,</hi> a Low German poem
                    in alliterative verse said to have been written by a Saxon at the request of
                    Louis the Pious. It is a narrative of the life of Christ, and follows closely
                    the Four Gospels, whose separate accounts it attempts to harmonize. The author
                    has considerable force and freedom of expression, and seems to have been so
                    absorbed in the grandeur of his theme as to have deliberately rejected
                    rhetorical ornament. The so-called <hi rend="italic">Krist</hi> of Otfrid, a
                    High German poet, who dedicated his work to Louis the German, has the same
                    subject, but is not nearly so effective. It is the first rhymed German poem, and
                    the necessities of rhyme often compel Otfrid to fill out his line with words and
                    phrases which obscure his meaning. His lyrical passages are too didactic to rank
                    as genuine poetry. The fragment of <hi rend="italic">Muspilli,</hi> a Bavarian
                    poem of the 9th century on the Last Judgment, indicates power of a much higher
                    order. Its form is alliterative; and reminiscences of paganism are strangely
                    mingled with its Christian ideas.</p>
                <p>Duriug the reigns of Charles the Great and Louis the Pious secular learning was
                    zealously cultivated in the monasteries of Germany as well as in those of other
                    portions of the Frankish empire. The school established by Hrabanus Maurus in
                    the famous abbey of Fulda vied with that of Tours, where Hrabanus had been a
                    pupil <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n540/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0540-0523"/> of Alcuin, in the excellence of its teaching. In
                    the wars with the Northmen, with the Magyars, and with the Slavs under the later
                    Carolingian kings, many of the ecclesiastical institutions were destroyed; but
                    they sprang up again under the protection of Henry I. From the time of his son
                    Otto I. the Germans stood in direct relation with Italy; the marriage of Otto
                    II. with the princess Theophano brought them into connexion with the learning
                    and refinement of the Byzantine court and Gerbert, the friend of Otto III.,
                    afterwards Pope Silvester II., introduced them to some of the achievements of
                    Arabian science. These influences quickened the energies of enlightened
                    churchmen, and originated an intellectual movement which to some extent
                    continued during the vigorous reigns of the first two Franconian sovereigns,
                    Conrad II. and Henry III. The chief subject of study was the scholastic
                    philosophy, to which, however, in its earlier stages, Germany made no supremely
                    important contribution. The Neo-Platonic tendencies of Scotus Erigena were
                    opposed by Hrabanus Maurus, who remained loyal to Aristotle and Boetius; and his
                    example was generally followed, not only by his successors in Fulda, but by the
                    members of all other German schools. The school of St Gall was exceptionally
                    active, and one of the monks, Notker Labeo, who died in 1022, wrote some
                    original philosophical books, and translated into German the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Consolatione</hi> of Boetius and two of Aristotle’s
                    works. In pure literature very little was done; but there are several
                    well-written Latin histories belonging to the 11th century. The best thought of
                    the age was manifested in its Romanesque architecture, and in the then
                    subordinate arts of painting, sculpture, and music.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">The Age of Chivalry.—</hi> The reign of Henry IV., during
                    which the struggle between the empire and the papacy began, had a disastrous
                    effect on the national culture; and the evil was not remedied under the
                    disturbed rule of his two immediate successors. But under the Hohenstaufen
                    dynasty, during the period of Middle High German, the country passed through one
                    of the greatest epochs of its literature. The more learned of the clergy
                    interested themselves deeply in the development of scholasticism through the
                    nominalists and the realists; and in the 13th century Albertus Magnus, a native
                    of Swabia, produced the first systematic exposition of Aristotle, in the full
                    light of Arabian research. It was, however, in poetry that Germany achieved the
                    highest distinction; and her most important poets were members of the knightly
                    class, which at this time rose to its utmost power and fame. There were many
                    reasons why the members of this class became sensitive to the higher influences
                    of the imagination. In the first place, they had the elevating consciousness of
                    a life shared with a vast community which set before itself the loftiest aims.
                    Historians sometimes take a malicious pleasure in contrasting the mean
                    performance of many knights with their high vows; but these vows at any rate
                    introduced into the life of rough nobles an ideal element, and inclined them to
                    take interest in the gentler and nobler aspects of existence. In the Italian
                    wars of Frederick Barbarossa the German knights saw more than they had ever
                    before done of Southern civilization, and their minds were continually
                    stimulated by the varying fortunes of their adventurous emperor. Of still
                    greater importance was the influence of the crusades, in which the Germans first
                    took an active part under Frederick’s predecessor, Conrad III. The crusaders had
                    a remote and unselfish aim, connected with all that was most sacred and most
                    tender in their religious ideas; and this alone would have created a sentiment
                    favourable to poetic aspiration. But, besides this, the far-off Eastern lands,
                    with their strange peoples and mystical associations, awoke dreams which could
                    not have other than harmonious utterance, and on the return of the warriors they
                    stirred the fancy of their friends with reports of a new and greater world.
                    While the crusades lasted,the knights were forced into intimate acquaintance
                    with the clergy, whose refined culture inevitably to some extent softened their
                    rudeness; they also formed friendships with representatives of French chivalry.
                    In France the works of the troubadours and the trouvères formed one of the most
                    prominent elements of the national life, and the French nobles did not forget in
                    Palestine the songs and romances of their home. The better minds in the German
                    armies caught the inspiration, and longed to distinguish themselves by like
                    achievements. And their desire was deepened when, by the acquisition of the Free
                    County of Burgundy, Frederick Barbarossa opened a new pathway by which
                    intellectual influences might pass from the western to the eastern bank of the
                    Rhine.</p>
                <p>The poetic impulse which thus entered Germany affected a wide circle; the highest
                    princes as well as the humblest knights felt its power. Even the emperor Henry
                    VI. himself is said to have been moved by the prevailing feeling, and to have
                    composed verses. At the imperial and princely courts poets were encouraged to
                    give expression to their genius; and the ladies whose beauty and virtues they
                    delighted to praise stimulated their endeavours by marked appreciation. Thus the
                    national imagination found in the whole temper of the age an atmosphere well
                    adapted to the blooming of its first spring-time.</p>
                <p>The most characteristic outcome of this active era is the series of poetical
                    romances produced in the 12th and 13th centuries. The German poets might have
                    found magnificent material in their old, native legends; but for the most part
                    they preferred subjects which had already been artistically wrought by the
                    trouvères, whose methods and style they also closely imitated. Among the themes
                    they selected may be mentioned the legends of Alexander the Great, of Charles
                    the Great and his paladins, of Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, with
                    the allied legend of the Holy Grail. The fortunes of Tristram and Iseult also
                    exercised a powerful charm over many minds. These and all other chosen subjects
                    were treated wholly in the spirit of chivalry. The poets of the Middle Age had
                    no idea of being true to the characteristics of a particular epoch; their own
                    time was the only one they attempted to understand. Ancient heroes became in
                    their hands mediaeval knights; men who had died long before the rise of
                    Christianity were transformed into devoted servants of the Church. And in every
                    romance the supreme aim was to present an idealized picture of the virtues of
                    knighthood.</p>
                <p>One of those who prepared the way for the chief romancewriters was Conrad, a
                    priest in the service of Henry the Proud, who, before 1139, composed the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rolaηdslied,</hi> setting forth, in imitation of the French <hi
                    rend="italic">Chanson de Poland,</hi> the overthrow of Roland, the favourite
                    paladin of Charles the Great, in the pass of Roncesvalles. He was followed by
                    another priest, Lamprecht, who, also working upon a French original, relates in
                    <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic">∖∖</hi><hi rend="italic">Q
                    Alexaηderlied</hi> the deeds of the Macedonian hero. Greater than either of
                    these was Heinrich von Veldeke, the first of the poets who may claim to rank as
                    German trouvères. His great work was <hi rend="italic">i</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∖</hi><hi rend="italic">iQHneit,</hi> written beween 1175 and 1190. It is not
                    only in armour and in dress that Virgil’s characters are here changed; in
                    thought and feeling they are recreated. The language of the poem is so carefully
                    chosen, and the incidents are narrated with so much spirit, that it is still
                    possible to understand the immense popularity it once enjoyed. Hartmann von Aue,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Der Arme</hi><hi rend="italic">Heinrich</hi> and other
                    poems, selected themes that are extremely repulsive to modern feeling; but he
                    was endowed with genuinely plastic force, and interests us by touching certain
                    mystical -aspects of mediaeval sentiment<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n541/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0541-0524"/>. The master in whom these aspects were most fully
                    represented was Wolfram von Eschenbach, a member of a noble family of Franconia,
                    who wa3 born during the reign of Frederick Barbarossa and died during that of
                    his grandson, Frederick II. He was one of a group of poets who established
                    themselves at the Wartburg, the court of the brilliant landgrave Hermann of
                    Thuringia; and his chief poem, <hi rend="italic">Parzival,</hi> was composed
                    there towards the end of the 12th century. Germany did not produce during the
                    Middle Ages a more truly poetic mind, and it is curious to observe how exactly
                    he anticipated some of the qualities for which she long afterwards became
                    famous. He has all the dreaminess, the sentiment, the passion for the ideal,
                    which are, or rather at one time were, her most attractive characteristics. The
                    hero, trained by his mother amid circumstances of idyllic simplicity, suddenly
                    passes into a world of movement and adventure, and he is brought by accident to
                    the gorgeous palace of the Holy Grail, of whose kingdom he ultimately becomes
                    lord. The object of the poem is evidently to depict the strivings of a restless
                    but noble spirit, dissatisfied with passing pleasure, having always before it a
                    high and spotless aim. It is difficult for modern readers to detect the
                    spiritual significance of many of the scenes; the poet seems to escape from us
                    into a far-off region, whence his words reach us rather as dim echoes than as
                    clear, ringing sounds. And some of the descriptions are in themselves tedious
                    and superfluous, while advance from one stage of the tale to another apparently
                    proceeds according to the arbitrary whim of the moment. Nevertheless, the
                    character of Parzival is a true conception of genius, and enables us to
                    understand, better than any other imaginative creation of mediaeval Germany,
                    that discontent with life as it is, that sense of being haunted by visions of
                    spiritual loveliness, which, throughout the Middle Ages, existed side by side
                    with unrestrained delight in the outward world.</p>
                <p>A complete, almost a dramatic, contrast to Wolfram von Eschenbach is found in
                    Gottfried of Strasburg, the greatest of his literary contemporaries. These two
                    men are representatives of a distinction which incessantly recurs,—that between
                    the poet who fashions spirits of a finer mould than those we actually know, and
                    the poet who contents himself with penetrating into the innermost recesses of
                    existing character. Gottfried’s theme is Tristram and Iseult; and the charming
                    tale, which unfortunately he did not live to carry to the end, was perhaps never
                    more beautifully told. There are no mystic longings in the men and women he
                    presents tous: they love the earth and the sky, with their gorgeous colours,
                    graceful forms, and happy sounds; they care not to inquire what may lie behind
                    these, or whether in the scheme of things there is a place for moral law. Few
                    poets have set forth so powerfully the×fascination of youthful passion. In his
                    glowing pictures we find no shadowy figures like those of Wolfram, with step so
                    light that they appear to be the figures of a dream; his images are clear,
                    sharply cut, like those of the world from which they are taken. And although
                    psychological analysis was unknown to him, the actions of his characters display
                    keen insight into the secrets of human hearts when entangled in the most
                    confused meshes.</p>
                <p>Mediaeval romance bore its richest fruit in the works of these two great poets;
                    and most of their successors imitated one or other of them. Those who followed
                    in Gottfried’s steps came nearest to a happy result, for Wolfram was one of
                    those lonely and daring spirits in whose remote path it is given to few to tread
                    without stumbling. The best known of Gottfried’s imitators was Conrad von
                    Würzburg, who wrote on the Trojan war and many other subjects, and 13 considered
                    one of the most artistic of mediaeval writers. Towards the end of the 13th
                    century the movement showed signs of exhaustion, and romances began to make way
                    for rough popular tales and rhymed chronicles.</p>
                <p>Fortunately the poets of the age of chivalry did not all occupy themselves with
                    the subjects of French romances. A few, whose names we do not know, turned
                    towards the rich material in the metrical legends of their native land. Of these
                    poets the most important was he who collected and put into shape the ancient
                    ballads which make up the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied.</hi> How far he
                    modified them we cannot tell. In the form in which we possess them, they
                    probably owe something of their force to his genius; but he needed rather to
                    arrange and to curtail than to invent, and, although a genuine poet, he was not
                    at all times competent for his task. The work includes the legends of Siegfried,
                    of Gundicarius, or Günther, king of Burgundy, of Dieterich, and of Attila; and
                    the motives which bind them into a whole are the love and revenge of Kriemhild,
                    the sister of Günther and Siegfried’s wife. She excites the envy of Brunhild,
                    the Burgundian queen, whose friend, Hagen, one of Günther’s followers, discovers
                    the vulnerable point in Siegfried’s enchanted body, treacherously slays him, and
                    buries in the Rhine the treasure he has long before conquered from the race of
                    the Nibelungen. There is then a pause of thirteen years, after which Kriemhild,
                    the better to effect her fatal purpose, marries Attila, king of the Huns.
                    Thirteen years having again passed, her thirst for vengeance is satiated by the
                    slaying of the whole Burgundian court. The Germans justly regard this great epic
                    as one of the most precious gems of their literature. It has little of the grace
                    of courtly poetry; its characters are without subtlety or refinement; we are
                    throughout in the presence of vast elemental forces. But these forces are
                    rendered with extraordinary vividness of imagination, and with a profound
                    feeling for what is sublime and awful in human destiny. The narrative begins
                    with epic calmness, but swells into a torrent, and dashes vehemently forward,
                    when the injured queen makes a fearful return for her wrongs, and is herself
                    swept away by the tragic powers she has called to her service. In the management
                    of the story there are occasional traces of mediaevalism; but its spirit is that
                    of a more primitive time, when the German tribes were breaking into the Roman
                    empire, when passions were untamed by Christian influence, and when the
                    necessities of a wandering and aggressive life knit closely the bonds that
                    united the chief to his followers. Deliberate villany hardly appears in the
                    poem; the most savage actions spring either from the unrestricted play of
                    natural feeling, or from unquestioning fidelity to an acknowledged superior.
                    Here and there we come upon touches which indicate that the poet who preserved
                    the ancient legends was not incapable of appreciating finer effects than those
                    at which he generally aims. The sketch of the hospitable and chivalrous Rüdiger,
                    who receives the Burgundians on their way to the court of Attila, and afterwards
                    dies while unwillingly fighting them in obedience to his queen’s command, is not
                    surpassed in the most artistic of the mediaeval romances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gudrun</hi> is another epic in which a poet of this period gave
                    form to several old legends. They had for centuries been current along the
                    coasts of Friesland and Scandinavia, and the society they represent is
                    essentially the same as that of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied,</hi><hi

                    tragic; and we feel throughout that the beautiful Princess Gudrun of Seeland,

                    Gerlind heaps indignities, will at last be restored to King Herwig, her brave
                    and passionate lover. The characters stand out clearly in their rough vigour;

                <p>In the 15th century a German writer brought together in a single volume which he
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Heldenbuch</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the “Book
                    of Heroes”—a number of old legendary tales that must have been frequently on the
                    lips of the people and of the wandering minstrels, while the knightly poets were
                    singing of Tristram or of Arthur. This work, which was partly written by Kaspar
                    von der Rhön, will not compare in imaginative force with its more famous rivals.
                    The most powerful of the stories is probably the “Grosser Rosengarten,” in which
                    a monk, Ilsan, displays a very unclerical, but truly Teutonic, passion for
                    war.</p>
                <p>The age of chivalry was remarkable not only for its romances and epics but for
                    its lyrics. All the leading writers of the time exercised themselves in lyrical
                    poetry, and it was laboriously cultivated by multitudes who did not feel equal
                    to the task of a prolonged effort. Among those who gained more or less
                    distinction may be named Heinrich von Morungen, Reinmar der Alte, and Gottfried
                    von Neifen. The poets of this class were known as Minnesänger, because their
                    favourite theme was Minne or love. They began by imitating the troubadours,
                    whose metres they often reproduced when not penetrated by the emotion which
                    originally found in these forms a genuine expression. At a later stage it was
                    considered a point of honour for each poet to invent a stanza of his own,
                    whether or not those already existing were appropriate to his feeling. Thus many
                    of the minne songs produce an impression of unreality and coldness, seeming at
                    best to be but clever pieces of handiwork. But when the utmost deduction has
                    been made, it is surprising how much of what wa3 achieved by these ardent
                    writers still appeals to us. The best among them strike notes which respond in
                    every age to a master’s touch; and they do it with a fine sense of beauty, a
                    trained instinct for the appropriateness of words, and an evident delight both
                    in simple and in subtle melody.</p>
                <p>Perhaps no group of writers has ever had a deeper undertone of sadness than is to
                    be detected in the greatest of the minnesänger. They had a vivid consciousness
                    of the evanescence of human pleasure, an abiding feeling that corruption lurks
                    behind the gayest forms and brightest colours. But they caught with proportional
                    eagerness the passing rapture, letting no drop escape from the cup that would
                    soon fall from their grasp. This intensity of feeling is reproduced in their
                    lays, yet it was purified and generalized as it passed from the fleeting reality
                    to the permanent realm of art. Their treatment of love, although sometimes,
                    according to modern ideas, extravagant and fantastic, often displays genuine
                    elevation of sentiment. They sing also in impassioned strains the loyalty of the
                    vassal to his lord, the devotion of the Christian to his church. If they do not
                    exhibit the soaring spiritual ambition of Wolfram’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parzival,</hi> they have a kind of pathetic memory of a lost paradise, a vague
                    longing, by some distant difficult service, in battle with the infidel, to
                    attain to a world in which the discords of the present life may be forgotten or
                    harmonized. And behind all their images is the background of nature, whose
                    loveliness they do not the less appreciate because they refrain from elaborately
                    describing it. To the dwellers in dreary towers winter had often a cheerless and
                    melancholy aspect; but this made all the more enchanting the new life of spring.
                    It is in hailing the returning warmth and colour of the young season that the
                    minnesänger attain their happiest triumphs.</p>
                <p>Of all the minnesänger the first place belongs without question to Walther von
                    der Vogelweide, probably of Tyrol, whom Gottfried of Strasburg praises as
                    heartily as he slyly depreciates Wolfram von Eschenbach. Walther lived some time
                    at the Wartburg, and wa3 the friend of King Philip and Frederick II; he died on
                    a little estate which the latter gave him in fief. Other Minnesänger lavished
                    praise on generous princes; Walther was of a more manly character, and seems
                    always to have maintained an independent bearing. Besides the usual themes of
                    the lyrical poetry of his time, he wrote with enthusiasm of his native land; he
                    also frequently alludes to the strife between the spiritual and secular powers,
                    and sternly rebukes the ambition of the papacy. Beyond all his rivals he gives
                    us the impression of writing with ease and delight. The structure of his stanzas
                    does not hamper the movement of his feeling; it appears to provide the
                    conditions of perfect freedom. Such a lyric as his <hi rend="italic">Unter
                    der</hi><hi rend="italic">Linden an</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Heide,</hi> with its musical refrain <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tandaradei,</hi> although a masterpiece of art, is exquisite in its childlike
                    simplicity; it has the unaffected grace of a flower, the spontaneity of a bird’s
                    song.</p>
                <p>As the expression of all that was fantastic and ridiculous in the age of
                    chivalry, must be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Frauendienst</hi> of Ulrich
                    von Lichtenstein, a work which was written about the middle of the 13th century,
                    and had a certain popularity in its time. It is an autobiography, with a number
                    of lyrics interwoven to give variety and animation to the narrative. The solemn
                    gravity with which the author relates the amazing tasks imposed upou him by his
                    mistress shows how easily the worship of womanhood degenerated into almost
                    incredible childishness. Ulrich is sometimes compared to Don Quixote, but this
                    is to do extreme injustice to Cervantes’s hero. Amid all his illusions the
                    fictitious knight maintains a certain pathetic dignity; the knight of reality
                    passes from absurdity to absurdity without a touch of idealism to redeem his
                    folly. And his lyrics are the tasteless manufacture of a thoroughly prosaic
                    spirit.</p>
                <p>Several of the minnesänger, Walther von der Vogelweide especially, display at
                    times a strongly didactic tendency. From the beginning of the period this
                    tendency was developed by writers who took little interest in poetry for its own
                    sake, and it became more and more prominent as the purely lyrical impulse passed
                    away. The didactic poet, however significant his labours may be to his
                    contemporaries, has necessarily the stamp of commonplace for posterity; and the
                    gnomic writers of the 13th century form no exception to this rule. But several
                    of them have at least the interest that attaches to sincerity and earnestness.
                    There is genuine enthusiasm for pure morality in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Welsche</hi><hi rend="italic">Gast</hi> of Thomasin Zerklar; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bescheidenheit</hi> of Freidank expresses so high a conception of
                    duty, and expresses it so well, that the work was ascribed to Walther himself.
                    Reinmar von Zweter and Heinrich Frauenlob came a little later, and they were
                    followed by Hugo von Trimberg, whose <hi rend="italic">Renner</hi> sets forth
                    unimpeachable lessons in homely and satirical verses. A higher tone is
                    perceptible in <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Winsbecke,</hi> a
                    collection of sayings in which we find an echo of the reverence for noble women
                    that marked the epoch at its dawn. Among didactic writings must be classed the
                    well known <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Krieg</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">auf der</hi><hi rend="italic">Wartburg</hi> (“The Contest at the
                    Wartburg”). It includes the verses supposed to have been sung at a tournament of
                    poets attended by Heinrich von Ofterdingen, Walther von der Vogelweide, and
                    Wolfram von Eschenbach.</p>
                <p>As Latin continued to be the speech of scholars, and the passion for metrical
                    expression pervaded the higher classes, there was not much scope for the growth
                    of prose. Nevertheless, it is in this age that we find the first serious
                    attempts to secure for German prose a place in the national literature. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Sachsenspiegel</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schwabenspiegel,</hi> two great collections of local laws, although of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> a scientific character, and mainly interesting
                    because of their social importance, had considerable influence in encouraging
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n543/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0543-0526"/> respect of the Germans for their own language.
                    The preachers, however, were the principal founders of prose style. Preaching
                    became about the middle of the 13th century an agency of great power in the life
                    of Germany. A number of the clergy, dissatisfied with the technicalities of
                    scholasticism, and with the mere forms under which spiritual aspiration was
                    often crushed, strove to attain to a fresh vision of religious truth, and to
                    kindle their own enthusiasm in the minds of others. Of this generous band the
                    most popular was Brother Berthold, a Franciscan monk, a man of a noble and
                    commanding temper, and an orator of the highest rank. Love for the poor was his
                    dominant motive, and he sometimes expressed it in language a modern socialist
                    might envy. Having something of the imaginative glow of the minnesänger, he gave
                    such colour to his abstract teaching as made it at once intelligible and
                    attractive. Of a less poetical nature than Berthold, Master Eckhart, the next
                    early master of religious prose, was more deeply philosophical. Although
                    familiar with the scholastic systems, he broke away from their method, and
                    became the founder of the mystical school which was one of the most potent
                    factors in preparing the way for the Reformation. Eckhart’s reasonings are
                    sometimes hard to follow, but he is not a confused thinker; his obscurity arises
                    rather from the nature of his themes than from his mode of handling them. He
                    occasionally touches profound depths in the spiritual nature of man, and it is
                    refreshing to pass from the formal hairsplitting of the scholastic philosophers
                    to the large conceptions of a mind which obeys its own laws and is evidently in
                    direct contact with the problems it seeks to solve.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">The Later Middle Age.—</hi> After the fall of the
                    Hohenstaufen dynasty the age of chivalry in Germany virtually came to an end.
                    The breaking up of the old duchies set free a large number of petty nobles from
                    their allegiance to mediate lords; and as there was no longer a strong central
                    authority, either to hold them in check or to provide them with such outlets for
                    their energy as they had found in the crusades and in the imperial expeditions
                    into Italy, nearly the whole class sank from the high level to which it had
                    temporarily risen. Many knights became mere robbers, and thought themselves
                    honourably employed in taking part in the innumerable little wars which
                    shattered the prosperity of the nation. Men of this kind were not very likely to
                    inherit the free and poetic spirit of Walther von der Vogelweide. In the course
                    of the 14th and loth centuries attempts were still made by Wolkensteiu,
                    Muskatblüt, and other writers to imitate his style; but in their hands the lyre
                    of the minnesänger gave forth only feeble or discordant notes. For a long time
                    the princes were no more inclined to literature than the npbles; they were too
                    much occupied with mutual jealousies, and with incessant attempts to shake
                    themselves free of the crown, to give heed to anything so removed from practical
                    interests as poetry.</p>
                <p>It so happened that during this period the cities rose to a position of higher
                    importance than they had ever before occupied. There was a while when it even
                    seemed possible that by their leagues, and by alliance with those emperors who
                    had insight enough to recognize their strength, they might become the
                    preponderating element in the state. Driven from the castles of the princes and
                    the towers of the nobles, literature took refuge in these young and growing
                    centres of a vigorous life. Not one or two here and there, but multitudes of
                    honest citizens, became possessed by the desire to distinguish themselves in the
                    arts in which they had been so much surpassed by the nobles of a previous
                    generation. Unfortunately, they had no literary training; they were not familiar
                    with any great models; few of them had leisure for the cultivation of style; and
                    the character of their daily employments was not such as to kindle thoughts that
                    demand poetic utterance. At that time every trade had its guild; and they now
                    formed guilds of poetry, the task of whose members was in intervals of leisure
                    to produce songs according to a body of strict rules, as in hours of business
                    they produced shoes or loaves. The rules were called the “Tabulatur,” and the
                    rauk of each member was determined by his skill in applying them. The lowest
                    stage was that of a man who had simply been received into the guild; the
                    highest, that of a master, who had invented a new melody. Between these were the
                    scholar, the friend of the school, the singer, and the poet. Literature produced
                    under such conditions could not have much vitality. It amused the versifiers,
                    and developed a certain keenness in the detection of outward faults; but the
                    spirit of poetry was wanting, and there is hardly a “meistersänger” whose name
                    is worthy of being remembered.</p>
                <p>Much more important than these tedious manufacturers of verse were the unknown
                    authors of the earliest attempts at dramatic composition. In the 10th century
                    Hroswitha, the abbess of Gandersheim, wrote Latin imitations of Terence; but
                    they were without influence on the progress of culture. The real beginnings of
                    the modern drama were the crude representations of scriptural subjects with
                    which the clergy strove to replace certain pagan festivals. These
                    representations gradually passed into the “Mysteries” or “Miracle Plays,” in
                    which there was a rough endeavour to dramatize the events celebrated at Easter
                    and other sacred seasons. They were acted at first in churches, but afterwards
                    in open courts and market places; and for many hours, sometimes day after day,
                    they were listened to by enormous audiences. The fragment of a Swiss “Mystery”
                    of the 13th century has survived; but the earliest that has come down to us in a
                    complete form is a play of the first half of the 14th century, treating of the
                    parable of the ten virgins. Like those of France and England, these mediaeval
                    German dramas display little imagination; and they are often astonishingly
                    grotesque in their handling of the most awful themes. Along with them grew up
                    what w ere known as “Shrove Tuesday Plays,” dialogues setting forth some scene
                    of noisy fun, such as a quarrel between a husband and wife, with a few wise saws
                    interspersed. They were declaimed without much ceremony in the public room of an
                    inn, or before the door of a prominent citizen, and gave ample occasion for
                    impromptu wit. Nuremberg seems to have been particularly fond of “Shrove Tuesday
                    Plays,” for one of its poets, Hans Rosenblüt, who flourished about the middle of
                    the 15th century, was the most prolific author of them. A little later he was
                    extensively imitated by Hans Folz, a Nuremberg barber and meistersänger.</p>
                <p>By far the most interesting writers of the 14th century were the mystics, who
                    continued the movement started by Eckhart. Johannes Tauler of Strasburg
                    (1300-61) had not the originality and force of his predecessor, but the ultimate
                    mysteries of the world had an intense fascination for him, and his tender and
                    sensitive spirit opened itself to lights which find no way of entrance into more
                    robust and logical intellects. He did not in the main pass beyond the
                    speculations of Eckhart, but he added grace and finish to their expression, and
                    made them a greater popular power than they could have become through the
                    master’s writings. Heinrich Suso, of Constance (1300-65), who has been called
                    “the minnesangei ’ of the love of God,” made the doctrines of Eckhart an
                    occasion for the outpourings of a full and sometimes extravagant fancy.
                    Eckhart’s teaching was also put into shape by an unknown author, whose work was
                    afterwards published by Luther under the title <hi rend="italic">Eyn</hi><hi

                    space and time, in union with which man rises to his true life. They are chiefly
                    of importance in the history of speculative thought, but even from the point of
                    view of literature they were of high service in the development of a rich and
                    vigorous prose.</p>
                <p>A plain narrative prose style was cultivated in the chronicles which began at
                    this time to be written in different parts of Germany. The Limburg Chronicle
                    written between 1336 and 1398, the Alsace Chronicle about 1386, and the
                    Thuringian Chronicle, by Rothe, a monk of Eisenach, about 1430, have all
                    considerable historical value; and the fact that they are in German, not like
                    previous chronicles in Latin, proves the rising respect among the people for
                    their native speech.</p>
                <p>During the latter part of the 15th century there was in Germany, as in the other
                    leading European nations, a great revival of intellectual life. And it was due
                    to the same causes as prevailed elsewhere,—especially the rediscovery of Greek
                    literature and the invention of printing. The movement was naturally most
                    powerfully felt in the universities. The first of these institutions had been
                    founded early in the 14th century by Charles IV. in Prague. Soon afterwards
                    others were established in Vienna, Heidelberg, Cologne, and Erfurt; and in the
                    15th century universities were set up also in Rostock, Greifswald, Tübingen,
                    Leipsic, and elsewhere. For a long time lav; and divinity were almost the only
                    subjects studied; but when the Renaissance passed from Italy into Germany,
                    university teaching became the instrument of a freer and larger culture.
                    Scholastic philosophy fell into disrepute; the most active minds occupied
                    themselves only with the intellectual treasures of the ancient world. The men
                    devoted to the new studies were called “Humanists,” and they carried on
                    continual warfare with the more ignorant and intolerant of the clergy.
                    Unfortunately they knew nothing of the value of their own language; they wrote,
                    as the scholastic philosophers had done, solely in Latin, and they gave but
                    slight and contemptuous attention to the movements of popular literature.</p>
                <p>Yet the popular literature of their time was quite worthy of study, for the stir
                    of new life had affected not only scholars but all classes of society, citizens
                    and even peasants included. It is surprising how many books found their way to
                    the public between 1450 and the outbreak of the Reformation; every one seemed
                    anxious that the newly discovered process by which writers could appeal to so
                    wide an audience should be turned to the utmost possible advantage. Of this
                    great mass of literature a comparatively small proportion was created in
                    obedience to the free impulses of the intellect. The problems of the time were
                    mainly social and practical; men were less moved by ideal interests than by
                    questions as to the tyranny of the princes, the greed and sensuality of the
                    clergy, the worldliness of the papacy, the powerlessness of the crown to enforce
                    peace and order. Multitudes of little tales in prose and verse appeared, in
                    which the princes, the nobles, the clergy, and sometimes rich citizens, were
                    held up to ridicule. The “Shrove Tuesday Plays,” which now became extremely
                    popular, also expressed the general discontent; and there were even “Miracle
                    Plays” whose object was to reveal the wrongs of the people. In one of them, the
                    leading character of which was Joanna, the mythical female pope, a clerical
                    author did not hesitate to pour contempt on the Roman see itself.</p>
                <p>By far the greatest of these satirical writings was the epic narrative, <hi
                    rend="italic">Revneke Fios.</hi> It has beeu already stated that the stories of
                    “Reynard the Fox” and “Isengrim the Wolf” probably belong to prehistoric ages.
                    They became current, through the Franks, in Lorraine and France; and from the
                    11th to the 15th century they formed the subject of many works in Latin, French,
                    and German. The epic to which allusion is now made appeared in 1498, and was
                    probably by Hermann Barkhusen, a printer of Rostock. It is in Low German, and
                    its materials were obtained from a prose version of the tale which had appeared
                    some years before in Holland, and of which Caxton printed an English
                    translation. Originally, the story had no satirical significance; it was a
                    simple expression of interest in what may be called the social life of wild
                    animals. In the hands of the author of this Low German poem it becomes an
                    instrument of satire on some enduring tendencies of human nature. He does not
                    lash himself into fury at the vices he chastises; he laughs at while he exposes
                    them. His humour is broad and frank, and he did more than any one else to make
                    Reynard the type of the resource and cunning which overmaster not only brute
                    force but even truth and justice. There are several renderings of the poem into
                    High German, the most important being the well-known work of Goethe in
                    hexameters.</p>
                <p>Another popular satirical work was the <hi rend="italic">Narrenschif</hi> (“Ship
                    of Fools”) of Sebastian Brandt, published in Basel in 1494. It is an allegorical
                    poem of more than a hundred sections, in which the vices are satirized as fools.
                    This work passed through many editions, and was rendered into more than one Low
                    German dialect, and into Latin, French, and English; it was even made the
                    subject of a series of sermons by Geiler, of Kaisersberg, a well-known preacher
                    of the day, who had himself some satirical talent. Brandt was personally of a
                    mild and unassuming character, and the fact that he became a satirist in spite
                    of himself is a striking proof of the confusion which had fallen upon both
                    church and state. Now that the occasion of his book has passed away, it is
                    difficult to realize that it once enjoyed almost unprecedented popularity. We
                    cannot but feel that the writer was an honest man; but his allegories are
                    without force or charm, and his moral lessons have been the commonplaces of
                    every civilized society. A satirist of a bolder type was Thomas Murner, who,
                    although he lived far into the age of the Reformation, belongs in spirit
                    altogether to the preceding period. He was a preacher, and both in sermons and
                    in secular writings attacked without mercy the classes who were the butts of his
                    fellow-satirists. After the beginning of the Reformation he included Luther
                    among the objects of his comprehensive dislikes. His laughter was loud and
                    harsh, and can hardly have been favourable to any small buddings of charity that
                    may have revealed themselves among the antagonisms of his generation.</p>
                <p>One of the favourite books of this time was <hi rend="italic">Tyll</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Eulenspiegel.</hi> It was published in 1519, and the author
                    (probably Murner) seems to have included in it many anecdotes already well
                    known. According to the preface, Tyll was a Brunswick peasant of the 14th
                    century, who went about the country perpetrating practical jokes. The force of
                    his humour mainly consists in taking every word addressed to him in its most
                    literal sense, and in giving it applications altogether different from those
                    intended by the speaker. There are readers who still find amusement in his rough
                    pleasantries.</p>
                <p>During the better part of this stirring period Maximilian I. was emperor, and he
                    interested himself a good deal in the current literature. As in politics,
                    however, so in poetry, his sympathies were altogether with an earlier age; and
                    he attempted to revive the taste for mediaeval romance. From a sketch said to
                    have been prepared by him, Melchior Pfinzig celebrated iu <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theuerdanh</hi> the emperor’s marriage with Princess Mary of Burgundy. The work
                    was splendidly printed, and attracted much notice; but romantic poetry, once so
                    fascinating, produces in its pages <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n545/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0545-0528"/> the effect of an elderly coquette who, refusing
                    to believe in the ravages of years, tricks herself out in the gay adornments of
                    youth. An earlier book, the <hi rend="italic">Weiss Kunig,</hi> an autobiography
                    of Maximilian, written by his direction in prose by his secretary
                    Treizsauerwein, has the excellence neither of a chrouicle nor of a romance; it
                    is for the most part the fantastic work of a mind which misunderstood its epoch
                    and its own powers.</p>
                <p>Behind the strife aud noise of contending sections there was slowly growing up an
                    admirable intellectual product of Germany,—its popular poetry. One of the
                    earliest writers who struck the note of the popular poets was Veit Weber, a
                    Swiss who fought with his countrymen against Charles the Bold, and who
                    celebrated in vigorous verses the battles of Granson, Murten, and Nancy. From
                    this time the German people had always a living poetry of their own, created by
                    unknown authors, but caught up by the masses, passed on from village to village
                    till it was everywhere known, and handed down by each generation to its
                    successors. This popular poetry ultimately reflected every aspect of daily life
                    among the humbler classes; each section among them had its appropriate lyrics,
                    and there were songs of youth, of age, and of middle life. There is no
                    elaboration in these offshoots of the popular fancy, but many of them have an
                    artless beauty which touches the fountains of smiles and tears, and which had an
                    irresistible fascination for the poets of the greatest period of German
                    literature.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">The Century of the Reformation.—</hi> It is possible that
                    if there had been no Reformation the Renaissance would have revealed itself in
                    Germany in a great literary movement, as in France and England, or in a great
                    artistic movement, as in Italy. The conditions of both movements were present in
                    the labours of the humanists on the one hand, and of' the Holbeins, Albert
                    Dürer, and Lucas Cranach on the other. But the questions of the Reformation were
                    too profound and agitating for the mind of the nation to turn seriously to any
                    task save that which they imposed. Thus it happened that the young shoots of the
                    Renaissance withered almost before they were in leaf. It was settled that
                    Germany must wait until a much later time for the full exercise of her highest
                    energies.</p>
                <p>In literature not less than in religion Luther (1483-1546) was the commanding
                    spirit of the age; but he was so rather by accident than by choice. For form for
                    its own sake he cared little; he studied it solely that he might the better
                    produce the moral effect at which he aimed. It is hardly possible for any one to
                    sympathize now with the violence and the dogmatism of his tracts, addresses, and
                    sermons; but they had the high merit of addressing the nation in a language it
                    could understand. They are always clear, simple, warm with the glow of a
                    passionate nature; and amid their noise and fury an attentive ear will sometimes
                    catch the still small voice of a spirit touched to finer issues than mere party
                    warfare. “My husk may be hard,” he him3elf said, “but the kernel is soft and
                    sweet.” We do extreme injustice to Luther if we do not recognize in him a
                    strongly poetic element,—an element which had free play only in the best of his
                    private letters, and in his still popular hymns. By the highest of his literary
                    achievements, his translation of the Bible, he made a truly splendid
                    contribution to the spiritual life of his people. No body of literature has been
                    so fortunate in its translators as the Scriptures; and Luther’s rendering ranks
                    with the best. Its absolute simplicity brings it to the level of a child’s
                    understanding; its strength and grace give it an enduring place as a work of
                    art. Germany instantly felt its charm; and for three centuries it has been to
                    innumerable millions the supreme consoler and sanctifier, the power associated
                    with their tenderest, most pathetic memories, the one link which has connected
                    sordid lives with noble and sublime ideas. And for the first time it gave the
                    nation a literary language. Up to this stage every author had written in the
                    dialect with which he was himself familiar; henceforth for the men of Swabia, of
                    Bavaria, of Saxony, and of all other districts there was a common speech, which
                    the writers of each state could use without any sense of inferiority to those of
                    another. It is thus to Luther that the Germans owe the most essential of all the
                    conditions of a truly national life and literature.</p>
                <p>The writer who deserves to stand next to Luther is Ulrich von Hutten (1488-1523).
                    An accomplished humanist, he effectively attacked the enemies of the new culture
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Epistoloe</hi><hi rend="italic">Obscurorum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Virorum</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> of which he was
                    one of the chief writers. This was before the special work of Luther began; and
                    at a still earlier period he had assailed in a series of fine Latin orations the
                    tyranny of Duke Ulrich of Würtemberg, who was accused of murdering a member of
                    Hutten’s family. He had little real sympathy with Luther’s religious aims; but
                    he threw himself heartily into a movement by which it seemed possible to purge
                    the state of the spiritual and secular ills which were in deadly antagonism to
                    the progressive energy of humanism. His German writings are mainly short
                    satirical poems and prose dialogues and addresses. Their style is direct, bold,
                    and trenchant; but they are now in teresting mainly because of the spirit of
                    freedom which breathes through them, the lofty political ideals of the writer,
                    and his generous ardour for the popular welfare.</p>
                <p>A far more voluminous author than Hutten or Luther was Hans Sachs, meistersänger
                    of Nuremberg (1494- 1576). He was, indeed, one of the most prolific of German
                    writers, having composed, according to his own calculation, more than 6000
                    poems. Although extremely popular in his own time, Sachs was almost forgotten
                    after his death. His memory was revived by Wieland and Goethe, and he is now
                    universally admitted to have been the chief German poet of the 16th century.
                    Every species of verse then known he freely cultivated, and there is no
                    important element of his age which is not touched in one or other of his works.
                    He had little of the culture of the schools, and many of his verses are
                    excessively rude. But Hans had considerable force of imagination, sly humour,
                    and, in his happiest moments, a true feeling for melody. His best works are his
                    “Shrove Tuesday Plays.” It is true he makes hardly more attempt than Rosenblüt
                    to develop a dramatic action, but his characters have life, and in many
                    individual scenes are artistically grouped. His didactic dialogues and satirical
                    tales present a remarkably vivid picture of the ideas, controversies, and moral
                    sentiments of his generation; and some of his lyrics still live in the memory of
                    the nation. The song in which he hailed the “Wittenberg Nightingale” gave fine
                    utterance to the reverence of the Lutherans for their chief, and in his hymn,
                    <hi rend="italic">Warum betrübst du dich, mein Herz?</hi> he so happily met the
                    spiritual need of the day that it was soon translated into eight languages,
                    including English, French, and Greek.</p>
                <p>If Ilans Sachs was the most industrious poet of the century, Johann Fischart was
                    beyond all comparison its greatest satirist. There was a distinctly Rabelaisian
                    touch in this restless, bizarre, and effusive spirit,—a man of upright and manly
                    character, keenly alive to the evils of his time, and continually opening fire
                    at new points on his enemies. He was an enthusiast for the Reformation, and did
                    it more lasting service among the middle class than half the theologians. His
                    chief work was an adaptation of Rabelais’s <hi rend="italic">Gargantua,</hi>
                    which he rendered with an insight into its purpose, and a fulness of sympathy
                    with its <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n546/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0546-0529"/> methods, unsurpassed even by Urquhart. In the
                    poem, <hi rend="italic">Das Glückhaft</hi><hi rend="italic">Schiff,</hi> he
                    gives evidence of a faculty for stirring narrative verse, but his prose is
                    richer, fuller, and more free. Considering how imperfectly prose style was then
                    developed, he had an astonishing command over the resources of the language. He
                    delighted in new and complicated word-formations, and by means of them often
                    succeeded, while dealing with his main theme, in casting side lights on its
                    subordinate branches. Even he, penetrating and enlightened as he was, could not
                    rise so far above his age as to condemn the burning of witches; but hardly
                    another popular folly escaped his glance. From the evil practices of
                    hypocritical priests to the impudence of astrologers and weather prophets every
                    abuse found in him a watchful critic; and nothing of the kind could be more
                    admirable than the skill with which he excites contempt while professing to
                    write in a spirit of respect and credulity. The secret of his poweι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> lay also partly in his profound humanity, for this
                    scathing satirist was at heart thoroughly genial; his mockery had its root in an
                    abiding faith injustice.</p>
                <p>Several other cultivators of prose style deserve mention. Albert Durer, whose
                    paintings, drawings, and engravings gave to the age of transition between
                    mediaevalism and the modern world its most perfect artistic expression, wrote
                    several scientific treatises, one of which, on the proportions of the human
                    body, is a masterpiece of calm, clear, and systematic exposition. Johann
                    Thurnmeier, called Aventinus (1466-1534), Sebastian Franck (1500-45), and
                    Aegidius Tschudi, of Glarus (1505-72), wrote histories which,' as ordered
                    narratives, rank considerably above mere chronicles. The autobiography of Götz
                    von Berlichingen, if its style is without merit, has an enduring interest as a
                    sketch of the rude lives of the petty nobles at the time when the old social
                    order was breaking up under the influence of new ideas. Huldrich Zwingli, the
                    Swiss Reformer (1484- 1531), could state an argument with logical precision, but
                    his style is thin and weak in comparison with the nervous force of Luther.
                    Johann Agricola (1492-1566) wrote some theological work3 on the Catholic side;
                    he is chiefly important, however, for a collection of German proverbs, which
                    afford important evidence as to the currents of popular thought. Of a far higher
                    class as a religious writer was Johann Arndt (1555-1621), who wrote the most
                    widely read work of the 16th century, <hi rend="italic">Vier Bücher vom Wahren
                    Christenthum</hi> (“Four Books on True Christianity ”). Soon after Luther’s
                    death the doctrines of the Reformation lost nearly all vitality; becoming the
                    subjects of vehement controversy among contending theologians, they ceased to
                    interest the m ιsses, who turned to simpler and more congenial themes. Arndt,
                    like Eckhart, Tauler, and Luther himself, being a man of religious genius, saw
                    the futility of these noisy disputes, and brushing them aside went to the heart
                    of Christianity as a power fitted to nourish spiritual feeling and to govern
                    conduct. His work appeared in Magdeburg in 1610, passed through edition after
                    edition, and was translated into eleven languages. It still has a place of its
                    own, for beneath the forms of a past age there burns the fire of a true
                    enthusiasm. Sebastian Franck, already mentioned as a historian, wrote some
                    religious works in a spirit akin to that of Arndt; but he lacked the intensity,
                    the power of touching the popular mind, which was possessed by the later writer.
                    Less practical in tendency, but incomparably deeper in philosophic thought, were
                    the writings of the Görlitz theosophist, Jacob Boehme (1575-1624). Boehme is in
                    many respects one of the most striking figures in the history of German
                    speculation. A man of mild and humble temper, working in patient obscurity as a
                    shoemaker, he spent his life in grappling with the vastest problems which
                    perplex humanity. Starting from the dogmas of Christianity, he sought to ground
                    them in the deepest reason; and although he often appears to darken counsel by
                    words, yet his writings contain many bold suggestions, which have profoundly
                    influenced later philosophical systems. There are times when one feels that his
                    struggling thought is imperfectly uttered only because it is not expressed in
                    poetic forms. For Boehme was one of those thinkers who occupy the borderland
                    between philosophy and poetry, a fact often perceptible in the concrete shape
                    which the most abstract ideas assume in his hands. There is a touch of poetry in
                    the very title of his first and best known, although not perhaps his best, book,
                    <hi rend="italic">Aurora.</hi></p>
                <p>The secular poetry of this period, if we except the works of Hans Sachs and
                    Fischart, is without value. An ambitious didactic poem by Rollenhagen, <hi
                    rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Frosch-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mäusler,</hi> gained a certain reputation; but it stands far beneath <hi
                    rend="italic">Reineke</hi><hi rend="italic">Vos,</hi> of which it is partly an
                    imitation. The religious lyrics of the age are, however, of high excellence;
                    they, indeed, are the sole works in which a perfect marriage was effected
                    between idea and form in the epoch of the Reformation. In his grand battle-hymn
                    <hi rend="italic">Ein feste Burg ist unser</hi><hi rend="italic">Gott,</hi> in
                    his pathetic verses <hi rend="italic">Aus tieffer Not schrey</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ich zu</hi><hi rend="italic">dir,</hi> and in other lyrics, Luther
                    led the way; and he was, as we have seen, followed by Hans Sachs. Nicolaus
                    Herrmann in his <hi rend="italic">Erschienen ist der herrlich Tag,</hi> Paul
                    Eber in his <hi rend="italic">Wenn wir in höchsten Nöthen sein,</hi> Philip
                    Nicolai in his <hi rend="italic">Wie schön leucht uns der Morgenstern,</hi> and
                    several other writers not less distinguished, created, in moments of genuine
                    inspiration, lyrics which must move men while religious instincts survive. The
                    adherents of the Reformation everywhere opened their hearts to these beautiful
                    poems, for in them alone, not in creeds or sermons or controversial treatises,
                    were the deepest emotions of the time freely poured forth. Next to the
                    translation of the Bible, nothing did so much as the popular hymns to unite the
                    Protestants, to stimulate their faith, and to intensify their courage.</p>
                <p>During this century the drama made considerable progress. Besides the “Mysteries”
                    and “Shrove Tuesday Plays,” “School Comedies,” in imitation of Terence and
                    Plautus, were written and acted in the universities and public schools. Luther,
                    with the large humanity characteristic of him when dogmatic disputes were not in
                    question, encouraged these comedies, and was, indeed, friendly to dramatic
                    effort of all kinds. To persons who complained that modesty was often offended
                    by the actors he replied that if they carried out their principle they would
                    have to refrain from reading the Bible. When the Jesuits began to agitate in
                    opposition to Protestantism they detected at once, with their usual tact, the
                    importance of this element in popular life; and through their influence more
                    attention was paid not only to the plays but to the manner in which they were
                    represented. Towards the end of the 16th century Germany was visited by a band
                    of English comedians, who went about acting in their own language. They appear
                    to have produced a deep impression; and at least one of their importations, the
                    clown, the “Pickelhäring” of the Dutch, survived in Hanswurst or Jack Pudding,
                    who was formore than a century an indispensable character in every play designed
                    to gratify the prevailing taste. In imitation of the English comedians,
                    wandering companies, consisting largely of idle students, now began to be
                    formed, and thrilled both rustic and city audiences with blood-and-thunder
                    tragedies, and with comedies too coarse to deserve even the name of farces.
                    About the middle of the century a theatre was built in Nuremberg, and Augsburg
                    and other cities soon followed the example. Duke Julius of Brunswick (1564-1613)
                    not only built a theatre in his capital but maintained a permanent company; and
                    he amused himself by writing for it comedies and tragedies in the approved style
                    of the day.</p>

                <p>It is significant of the stage of literary culture reached by Germany that she
                    enjoyed the barbarous productions of this scribbling prince while English
                    audiences were appreciating “Hamlet” and “Othello.”</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">The Period of Decay.—</hi> The period at which we have now
                    arrived is in many respects the most dismal in German history. From 1618 to 1648
                    the country was desolated by the Thirty Years’ War, a struggle which—as Gustavus
                    Adolphus, its greatest hero, declared—absorbed into itself all the other wars of
                    Europe. It completed the disintegration of Germany, blurred every great national
                    memory, fastened upon the people hundreds of petty despotisms, reduced the
                    population by more than half, paused a whole generation to grow up in ignorance,
                    accustomed all classes to an almost incredible brutality of manners, and put an
                    end to the material prosperity which had been steadily growing during the 16th
                    century. It is not surprising that pure literature drooped and nearly died out
                    during the time which followed this tremendous war, for the conditions of pure
                    literature were almost wholly wanting. Had a man of high genius arisen, the buds
                    of his fancy must have faded for lack of light and air.</p>
                <p>The only species of literature for which the conditions were favourable was the
                    religious lyric. Under the pressure of grinding care, with no hope that a better
                    day would dawn for them in this world, meditative and gentle spirits devoted
                    their thoughts to another life; and many of them linked themselves to the truest
                    poets of the previous century by giving musical voice to their spiritual fears
                    and joys. Their prevailing tone in regard to “things seen” is one of profound
                    melancholy; but all the brighter are the strange lights from the invisible which
                    break through the gloom. The greatest of these writers is Paul Gerhardt
                    (1606-75), many of whose hymns—such as <hi rend="italic">0 Haupt</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">voll Blut und Wunden,</hi><hi rend="italic">0</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Welt sieh hier dein Leben—</hi> penetrate to the essence of
                    Christianity as the religion of humility, of sacrifice, and of sorrow. He had
                    worthy associates among the Protestants in Johann Rist (1607-67), Joachim
                    Neander (1610-88), and Louise Henriette of Brandenburg, wife of the Great
                    Elector (1627—67). Some of the wiser Jesuits also attempted the lyrical
                    expression of religious feeling; and one of them, Friedrich von Spee
                    (1592-1635), fell little short of the best among his Lutheran rivals. Spee was a
                    man of admirable moral as well as literary qualities. Asked by the elector of
                    Mainz how it happened that at the age of forty his hair was white, he answered,
                    “It is because I have accompanied to the stake so many women accused of
                    witchcraft, not one of whom was guilty.”</p>
                <p>The standard of pure speech set up by Luther in his translation of the Bible had
                    not been maintained by later writers. The innumerable dialects of Germany are an
                    almost inexhaustible fountain for the renewal of the youth of her literary
                    language; but when the literary language was less fixed than it is now, they
                    were also a temptation to barbarism. In addition to the evils of excessive
                    provinciality, the written speech had suffered from a too generous importation
                    of Latin, Spanish, and French words. In the early years of the 17th century the
                    prevailing laxity suggested to an enlightened prince, Louis of Anhalt-Köthen,
                    that it would be desirable to introduce into Germany institutions resembling the
                    Italian academies. Accordingly, in 1617, the “Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft”
                    (“The Fruit-bearing Society”) was established,—a union which took the form of an
                    order, with a palm tree for its emblem, and the words “Alles zu Nutzen”
                    (“Everything for use”) for its motto. It immediately became fashionable for
                    members of the highest classes of central Germany to belong to this society; and
                    at a somewhat later time other societies were started in imitation of it. Of
                    these the most famous was the “Order of the Pegnitzschäfer” (“Shepherds of the
                    River Pegnitz”) in Nuremberg, which to some extent took the place of the school
                    of meistersanger on which honour had been reflected by Hans Sachs.</p>
                <p>These societies were associated with much pedantic folly, and from none of them
                    proceeded any great work of genius; but they did good service by at least
                    protesting against unlawful forms of speech. One of the earliest writers who
                    worked in their spirit was Weckherlin (1584—1651), who, being associated with
                    the German embassy in London, became intimately acquainted with some of the many
                    forms in which the English genius then revealed itself. He wrote a number of
                    odes, idylls, and sonnets, with an evident desire to give them a careful
                    artistic finish. To him belongs the doubtful honour of having introduced
                    alexandrines into German poetry,—a measure totally unsuited to the national
                    spirit, but which for more than a century was in general use. The fame of
                    Weckherlin was soon overshadowed by that of Martin Opitz (1597-1639). The
                    beginnings of modern German poetry are often dated from the publication of his
                    critical book, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">deutsche</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Poeterei,</hi> which appeared in 1624, and enjoyed an astonishing
                    popularity. It became a sort of secular Bible to the “Fruit-bearing Society,” of
                    which Opitz was a member, and was regarded by several generations of
                    verse-makers as an almost infallible guide. In regard to merely outward forms,
                    it deserved its reputation, for Opitz was the first German writer who attempted
                    sharply to distinguish the different species of poetry, to bring together some
                    of the external laws which govern them, and to insist with emphasis that purity
                    of style is essential to high literary effect. He altogether missed the fact,
                    however, that poetry must be the expression of an emotional life; it became in
                    his exposition a mere handicraft, for excellence in which industry and
                    familiarity with good models are alone necessary. The result is seen in his own
                    lyrical and didactic poems, which are laudably correct in language and in metre,
                    but are hardly once lighted up by the fire of intense feeling.</p>
                <p>Opitz was born in Silesia; and from this circumstance the writers who shared his
                    tendency or came under his influence are known as the first Silesian school. By
                    far the most distinguished member of this so-called school was Paul Fleming
                    (1609-40), the only secular German poet of the 17th century of whom it can be
                    confidently said that he was endowed with true genius. He did not live long
                    enough to reveal his full capacity; he confined himself to short rapid flights,
                    and all his lyrics are contained in a moderately sized volume, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geistliche und Weltliche</hi><hi rend="italic">Poemata.</hi> This single
                    volume, however, comprises enough to secure for him an enduring place in
                    literature. He moves freely over the whole range of lyrical poetry, but his
                    charm is at once strongest and most delicate in his love verses, which sometimes
                    recall the gaiety of Herrick, although a touch of sentimentalism distinguishes
                    the German writer from the more worldly Englishman. A fine spirit of manliness
                    is the note of Fleming’s sonnets; and in several hymns he almost equals the
                    religious depth of Gerhardt. Even in its artistic qualities his best work is
                    higher than anything achieved by Opitz; in its power of awakening permanent
                    human sympathies it stands alone in its era.</p>
                <p>Another writer of the first Silesian school was Andreas Gryphius (1616-64), who
                    sought to create a drama in accordance with the laws laid down by Opitz. He was
                    the first German dramatist who divided his tragedies—of which he wrote five—into
                    five acts; but his characters are roughly conceived, and he produces his effects
                    rather by violence and bombast than by the gradual evolution of a definite
                    plan.</p>

                <p>His comedies, although also rude, have more life than his tragedies. In one of
                    them, <hi rend="italic">Peter Squenz,</hi> there are traces of Shake3peare <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s <hi rend="italic">Midsummer Night’s Dream,</hi> of
                    which Gryphius appears to have had some knowledge through a third writer.
                    Friedrich von Logau (1604-55) applied the principles of Opitz in epigram. He had
                    a decided talent for terse, emphatic expression, and a considerable number of
                    the vast collection of his epigrams have a keenness of edge which must have made
                    him a dreaded enemy. His prevailing tone is satirical, and the chief object of
                    his satire is the moral corruption of his time. Joachim Rachel (1618-69) was
                    another satirist who strove by means of polished verses to castigate popular
                    vices; but he lacked force and invention. There was much more vigour in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scherzgedichte</hi> of Hans Wilmsen Lauremberg (1591-1659), who
                    wrote in Platt Deutsch; he, however, can hardly be claimed as a member of the
                    first Silesian school. Philip von Zesen (1619-89), a writer of some versatility,
                    wrought in the spirit of Opitz by warring against foreign words which had
                    intruded into German,—a warfare in which his zeal was not always as wise as it
                    was patriotic. He founded in Hamburg, in imitation of the “Fruit-bearing
                    Society,” an association (the “Deutschgesinnte Gesellschaft ”) inspired by his
                    enthusiasm for Teutonic purity of speech.</p>
                <p>While the admirers of Opitz were striving, with the best intentions, to introduce
                    a correct poetic style, a movement of a very different kind originated among the
                    “Pegnitzschäfer” of Nuremberg. The members of this society, conscious of the
                    barrenness of existing poetry, and not feeling in themselves the sources of a
                    higher activity, turned for help to Italian literature. Instead of studying the
                    great Italian poets they attached themselves to Marino and his extravagant
                    school; and the chief result was a number of fantastic pastorals, the writers of
                    which seemed to have no other aim than to show how much silly affectation the
                    German language may be made to express. Their tendency was carried to its utmost
                    development by the second Silesian school, whose leading representatives were
                    Hoffmanns waldau (1618-79) and Lohenstein (1635-83). Hoffmannswaldau wrote odes,
                    pastorals, and heroic epistles, which are marked by a childish foppery of
                    manner, and whose tone affords startling evidence of the moral laxity of the
                    society to which they were addressed. Lohenstein chiefly cultivated the drama,
                    and he has the distinction of having written perhaps the worst plays ever
                    accepted as literature by a modern community. They are so wild and bombastic
                    that, even if presented as burlesques, they would now be condemned as
                    ridiculously extravagant. The lyrics of this pretentious writer are not less
                    crude and unnatural than his plays.</p>
                <p>As the century advanced, the German courts passed more and more under the
                    influence of France. Pocket editions of Louis XIV. were to be found in all the
                    little capitals, courtiers talked more French than German, and it was
                    unfashionable not to know, or not to affect to know, contemporary French
                    literature. It was, therefore, inevitable that some writers should turn away
                    from the path of the second Silesian school, and compete for court favour by
                    imitating the French style. This was done by Canitz (1654-99), Besser
                    (1654-1729), König (1688-1744), and many other authors of the same class. These
                    “court poets” took Boileau for their guide, and had, therefore, the negative
                    merit of avoiding the absurdities of Lohenstein and Hoffmannswaldau. But they
                    were, as a rule, tame, cold, and dull. In Canitz alone, who was a Prussian
                    statesman and wrote for his pleasure, is there any evidence of original energy;
                    the others were professional versifiers who produced appropriate odes and
                    sonnets at the bidding of their employers.</p>
                <p>During the greater part of the 17th century Germany produced few prose works that
                    can now be tolerated. Notwithstanding the efforts of the purists, the language
                    became more and more corrupt, and mo3t writers were either artificial, or
                    pedantic, or coarse. One of the small number whose power we can still feel was
                    Grimmelshausen, whose <hi rend="italic">Simplicissimus</hi> (1659) has qualities
                    bordering upon genius. The hero is a peasant’s son, who tells his own tale. Torn
                    from his parents during the Thirty Years’ War, he is brought up by a hermit;
                    afterwards in the service of a commandant, he makes himself notorious for tricks
                    like those of Tyll Eulenspiegel; he then becomes a soldier, rises to wealth and
                    rank, but ultimately loses both, passes through many wild adventures, and
                    retires from the world to a desert island, in which he devotes himself to
                    religion. The value of the book consists in its graphic pictures of the horrors
                    of the Thirty Years’ War,—pictures relieved by touches of rough, sometimes of
                    the coarsest, humour. Another writer of great but insufficiently cultivated
                    talent was Moscherosch, author of <hi rend="italic">Gesichte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Philanders von Sittewalt</hi> (1650), which is partly an imitation
                    of the Suenos of Quevedo. It is made up of a number of visions or dreams, some
                    of which, like passages of <hi rend="italic">Simplicissimus,</hi> convey a vivid
                    idea of the sufferings of Germany during her great struggle; in others the
                    writer strikes with effect at popular follies, including the extravagances of
                    the second Silesian school. Sigmund von Birken wrote a history of the house of
                    Austria, which, although one-sided, is not without merit as a plain narrative;
                    and an ecclesiastical history by Gottfried Arndt has some interest as an attempt
                    to do justice to heretics condemned by the church. A very good book of travels
                    was written by Adam Olearius, describing the adventures of a mission to Persia,
                    of which the author and Paul Fleming were subordinate officials. A Protestant
                    pastor, Balthasar Schupp (1610-61), was the author of several didactic prose
                    works, which, although rough in form, display native wit, and pour wholesome
                    ridicule on the follies and barbarisms of contemporary writers. Against these
                    more or less valuable prose writings we must set piles of enormous romances in
                    the style of D’Urfé and Mademoiselle Scudéry. The favourite authors of these
                    astonishing productions were Buchholtz, who wrote <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hercules</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Valisca,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Herculiscus</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Herculadisla;</hi> Anton Ulrich, duke of Brunswick, whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Octavia</hi> was loudly applauded by aristocratic readers; and Von Ziegler, the
                    writer of <hi rend="italic">The Asiatic Banise,</hi> an incredibly foolish book
                    which, published in 1688, took Germany by storm, and maintained its popularity
                    for more than a generation. Lohenstein was also the author of a romance, dealing
                    with the fortunes of Arminius and Thusnelda. It is hard to understand the
                    interest which works of this class once excited; they are barren of every
                    imaginative quality, with no kind of relation to life, and grotesque in style.
                    They were ultimately driven from the field by imitations of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Robinson Crusoe,</hi> which, notwithstanding the charm of their model, display
                    no more talent than the romances. Various writers imitated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simplicissimus,</hi> but they succeeded only in reproducing in an exaggerated
                    form its occasional brutalities. Abraham a Sancta Clara (1642-1709), a Vienna
                    priest, whose real name was Megerlin, revealed considerable power of satire in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Judas</hi><hi rend="italic">der Erzschelm</hi> (“Judas the
                    Arch-Rogue”), and in pamphlets and sermons; but his naturally rich fancy was
                    wholly uncontrolled, and his humorous passages are marred by a far larger number
                    in which he is pedantic or vulgar.</p>
                <p>No progress was made during the 17th century towards the formation of a national
                    drama. At the courts the Italian opera was the favourite entertainment, and the
                    wandering companies of actors represented for the most part barbarous plays of
                    their own devising, in which Hanswurst was generally the popular character.
                    Occasionally a man of some talent found his way into these companies<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n549/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0549-0532"/>; and one such actor, Velthen, showed so much
                    insight as to include in his repertory some of the works of Molière. But the
                    general tendency of what passed for the drama was from bad to worse, and the
                    usual character of the plays to a considerable extent justified the hatred with
                    which they were denounced by the clergy.</p>
                <p>For a time it almost seemed as if Germany could never hope to emerge from the
                    intellectual degradation into which she had sunk; but in reality the higher
                    forces of the nation were rallyiug in preparation for a new era. One of the
                    first symptoms of revival was presented by the remarkable pietistic movement,
                    which, although it ultimately led to the formation of the pettiest of petty
                    sects, was in its origin noble both in aim and in method. Its originators were
                    the ardent, generous, and eloquent Jacob Spener (1633— 1705), and August Hermann
                    Francke (1663-1727). The labours of these writers and preachers, who had close
                    affinity to the mystics, not only gave more sincerity to religious forms, but
                    did service to literature by quickening the popular intellect, and awakening
                    emotions which could find no satisfaction in the tedious writings of the day. Of
                    still greater importance were the beginnings of modern German philosophy. It was
                    in this dreary period that Germany gave birth to one of the most brilliant of
                    her thinkers, Leibnitz (1646-1716). The prevailing style of the day-—
                    “Mischmasch,” he called it—seems to have disgusted him with his own language,
                    for nearly all his writings are in French or Latin. Nevertheless, he exercised a
                    profound influence on the best minds of his generation. His monadology, his
                    doctrine of the pre-established harmony, his theory of the best of possible
                    worlds, while carrying on the central current of European thought, offered
                    Germauy new problems for solution, and helped to replace a rigid orthodoxy by a
                    spirit of disinterested curiosity. The task of giving shape to his ideas was
                    undertaken by Wolf (1679— 1754), who had none of Leibnitz’s genius, and often
                    crushed his fruitful suggestions under a burden of logical proofs. The disciple,
                    however, so far taught in his master’s spirit as to exalt the claims of reason
                    over mere authority; he aLso encouraged habits of systematic thinking, and
                    proved by his practice that serious writers had no excuse for clothing their
                    doctrines in any other language than their own. Less philosophical than
                    Leibnitz, and even than Wolf, Christian Thomasius (1655-1728) was an impressive
                    popular thinker. He edited the first German periodical, a sort of monthly
                    magazine, in which he vigorously attacked pedants and bigots. His style,
                    although not pure or graceful, received glow and warmth from his moral
                    earnestness. Through him literature became a great practical power, for it was
                    mainly he who put an end to the burning of witches and to punishment by
                    torture.</p>
                <p>Even in poetry, before the close of this period, there were a few glimmerings of
                    dawn. Wernicke, a man of cultivated and severe taste, published a volume of
                    epigrams (1697) in which he thrust home at the follies of Lohenstein and his
                    followers; and that his mockery had effect was plain from the outcry of two
                    noisy members of the school, Postel and Hunold. Günther (1695-1723), who died
                    too soon for his genius, wrote lyrics in which the voice of nature was once more
                    heard. “A poet in the full sense of the word,” Goethe calls him; and no one can
                    realize how great was his achievement without making some acquaintance with his
                    truly dismιl predecessors. Brockes (1680-1747) had not Günther’s fine
                    spontaneity, but he had the merit of giving simple expression to unaffected
                    pleasures,—a virtue for which historians of literature, remembering the
                    formality of the court poets and the insincere posturing of the second Silesian
                    school, readily forgive his occasional flatness and garrulity. He was the first
                    German poet who displayed some knowledge of English literature. Although
                    unacquainted with Shakespeare, he directed his countrymen to Milton, Young, and
                    Pope; and he appended to his chief work, <hi rend="italic">Irdisches
                    Vergnügen</hi><hi rend="italic">in Gott,</hi> a fair translation of Thomson’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Seasons.</hi></p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">The Period of Revival.—</hi> For five centuries there had
                    been no great literary period in Germany which deserves to be named with the
                    famous periods in the history of England, France, Italy, and Spain. The
                    Reformation was a spiritual achievement of splendid originality, but in
                    literature Germany had for the most part followed timidly in the footsteps of
                    her neighbours. She was soon to make up amply for this tardy progress; and we
                    have now reached the age in which she fairly awoke to a consciousness of her
                    strength,—an age mainly of preparation, but one which has also an independent
                    interest, since it includes names that rank high in the history of European as
                    well as of German culture. We have seen that in the midst of the period of decay
                    there were already symptoms of revival. These became more and more numerous, and
                    while they increased, Germany was suddenly startled by the appearance in her
                    midst of a great warrior and statesman. It is impossible to estimate with any
                    approach to exactness the impression produced by Frederick II.; but it is beyond
                    doubt that he profoundly affected the intellectual life not only of Prussia but
                    of Germany. After the Thirty Years’ War the people had lost confidence in
                    themselves. They forgot that they had a magnificent history; they only saw that
                    the structure of society had been rudely battered, and that nearly every
                    enterprise of the nation as a whole ended in failure. Frederick the Great
                    restored to them faith in their own vigour; he convinced them that it depended
                    on themselves whether or not they should rise to their ancient place in Europe;
                    and by the prompt, faithful, and energetic discharge of his personal duties he
                    set before them an example which was widely felt. Literature shared the impulse
                    which penetrated the national life. It became stronger, more independent, and
                    moved forward with the assured step of a power conscious of high destinies.</p>
                <p>Several causes of a purely literary character contributed to promote this
                    advance. One of these was the revival of classical study in the best sense.
                    Classical study had been pursued with ardour by the humanists; but after them it
                    became dry, pedantic, and tedious, and was subordinated to theological
                    controversy. In the 18th century a number of scholars arose, who, ceasing to
                    interest themselves in merely verbal criticism, sought to pierce to the meaning
                    of classical writers, to understand and enjoy their imagi native effects, their
                    ideas, and their style. They also strove to construct what the Germans call
                    “Alterthumswissenschaft,” the science of antiquity—that is, to comprehend the
                    life of the Greeks and Romans, their religion, art, and philosophy, and to
                    interpret their literature in the light of this knowledge. The movement passed
                    from one university to another and soon made itself felt in the public, schools.
                    Thus the best class of minds were familiarized with higher ideals than they had
                    yet known, and received, almost without being aware of it, the germs of new
                    activity. Another cause, which co-operated with the more intelligent study of

                    influences which had affected the Germans had come from Italy, Spain, and, above
                    all, France; but now they began to know something of contemporary English
                    writers, and gradually worked their way back to Shakespeare. The English genius
                    was instinctively recognized as more in harmony with that of Germany than any
                    other, and its products stimulated the free exercise of the imagination and the
                    reason, while the ancient classics led to the perception of the greatest laws of

                    belongs to Haller (1708-77), who, although chiefly famous as a man of science,
                    revealed imagination and poetic sympathies in his descriptive and didactic poem
                    <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Alpen</hi> (“The Alps”). Hagedorn
                    (1708-54) was for a time the most popular poet of his day in virtue of his
                    songs, odes, fables, and narratives in verse. He was of a genial and happy
                    temper; and no author who preceded him was master of so clear, bright, and
                    animated a style. One of the chief characteristics of the time was the tendency
                    of writers to group themselves in schools. If two or three writers who lived in
                    the same place happened to become friends, they forthwith called themselves a
                    school; and the result was that they usually developed some marked common
                    characteristics. These coteries inevitably became more or less narrow and
                    exclusive; but they also stimulated each other to fresh effort, and the clash of
                    their ideals sometimes helped the outside world to new points of view. The Saxon
                    school, whose headquarters were in Leipsic, was for some years more prominent
                    than any of its rivals. It was founded by Gottsched (1700-66), who, although he
                    made himself ridiculous by pedantry and vanity, became the ruling literary man
                    of Germany. He was appointed a professor in Leipsic in 1724, and founded there
                    “The German Society,” which soon became the centre of a number of similar bodies
                    for the cultivation of literature. Gottsched aimed at nothing short of the
                    complete reformation of German poetry. He had the sense to see that if he wished
                    to reach the people he must begin with the drama, and he was fortunate enough to
                    find in Frau Neuber, who had formed a company in Leipsic, an intelligent actress
                    capable of giving effect to his ideas. With her help he banished Hanswurst from
                    the stage; and she was forthwith supplied with plays by himself, by his clever
                    wife Louisa Victoria, and by several disciples. He gave his attention chiefly to
                    tragedy, and unfortunately he had but one idea in regard to it—that it had
                    reached the utmost possible excellence in the classic drama of France. The
                    English drama, he admitted, had some merit, but only in so far as it had
                    modelled itself on the work of Corneille and Racine. Hence, in his chief tragedy
                    <hi rend="italic">Der Sterbende</hi><hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> (“The Dying
                    Cato”) he availed himself freely of Addison’s <hi rend="italic">Cato;</hi> the
                    Elizabethan dramatists, of whom his direct knowledge was slight, he believed to
                    be mere barbarians. His taste gave the law in nearly every theatre in which
                    German plays were acted; and it was certainly a good consequence that Lohenstein
                    fell into permanent disrepute, while even the groundlings began to feel that the
                    uncouth works which actors themselves had hitherto produced were, to say the
                    least, far from perfection. On the other hand, the German genius was forced to
                    submit to arbitrary laws antagonistic to its true nature; and so long as its
                    submission lasted, a genuinely native drama was impossible. It was not only in
                    regard to drama that Gottsched insisted on absolute subservience to France. In
                    regard to all species of verse his sympathies were with the court poets, and
                    both by example and by critical precept he insisted that in poetry as in
                    everything else the understanding must be supreme, and that clearness of
                    statement, correctness in the management of figures, and logical arrangement are
                    the highest literary virtues. Regarding the function of imagination and feeling
                    in poetry he had no suggestion to offer.</p>
                <p>There were writers who instinctively felt that this could not be a complete
                    theory; and of these the chief were Bodmer and Breitinger, the leaders of the
                    Swiss school, which was formed in Zürich. These writers, although destitute of
                    creative genius, had nourished their imagination on English poetry, especially
                    on <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> and it was incredible to them that a
                    critical doctrine could be correct which left out of account or condemned their
                    favourite writers. At first they were on friendly terms with Gottsched, but when
                    the latter harshly criticized a translation of Milton’s epic issued by Bodmer,
                    his Swiss rivals prepared to defend themselves; and thus broke out a literary
                    controversy which made much noise at the time, and in which the angry critics,
                    to the edification of onlookers, pelted each other unmercifully with abusive
                    epithets. Neither party was fully conscious of the significance of its attack,
                    and sometimes the warriors seemed almost to change sides. But the general
                    tendency of the dispute was that the Swiss school, amid much exaggeration,
                    defended the claims of free poetic impulse, while the Saxon school, in a narrow
                    and pedantic spirit, maintained those of conscious art. It is hard werk now to
                    follow their arguments, but at the time they interested a considerable public in
                    literature, and opened fresh lines of investigation. One of the results was that
                    Baumgarten, a disciple of Wolf, published a book which Germans regard as the
                    beginning of modern aesthetics,—a branch of mental science to which their
                    philosophers have ever since devoted thought and labour.</p>
                <p>While this warfare of critics was going on, there were in Leipsic a number of
                    young writers who more or less attached themselves to Gottsched, but who
                    gradually shook off his authority. They founded a periodical, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bremer</hi><hi rend="italic">Beiträge</hi> (the “Bremen
                    Contributions ”), which had considerable influence in forming their own style,
                    and in keeping alive the popular interest excited by the central controversy.
                    After a while many of them were scattered over different parts of Germany, but
                    they retained their original impulse, and continued to be known as members of
                    the Saxon school. Gellert (1715- 69) was by far the most famous of the circle.
                    It is impossible to mention without respect this amiable writer. His plays are
                    unimportant, but his fables and tales reveal so gentle and pure a spirit that we
                    cannot wonder at his great popularity. He was a favourite among all classes,
                    even Frederick the Great himself, who rarely condescended to notice a German
                    author, declaring after a long interview that he was “the most reasonable of
                    German scholars.” His supreme defect was a tendency to weak sentimentalism and
                    pious commonplace. Rabener (1714-71) acquired fame as a good-humoured satirist.
                    His prose is fresh and clear, but he has not sufficient grasp of any important
                    principle to entitle him to very high rank among moralists. Christian Felix
                    Weisse (1726-1804), the friend of Lessing’s youth, failed as a writer of
                    tragedy, but was a favourite author of comic operettas. He was also the first
                    successful German writer for children, and edited for many years a periodical
                    (the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothek der schonen Wissenschaften)</hi> which had a
                    favourable influence on popular culture. Johann Elias Schlegel (1718-49), uncle
                    of the two Schlegels who became long afterwards leaders of the Romantic school,
                    gave evidence of high dramatic talent, but died when he was beginning to be
                    conscious of his power. Arnold Ebert distinguished himself by good translations
                    from English; and Zachariä wrote with some success mock heroics in the style of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Pape of the Lock.</hi> Kästner, whose disputations at the
                    Leipsic university were diligently attended by young Lessing, made himself
                    feared as a biting epigrammatist. Cramer became one of the most eloquent
                    preachers of the day, wrote popular religious odes, and edited <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Northern Guardian,</hi> a well-meaning but rather commonplace imitation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi> of Steele. These writers, who from being
                    Gottsched’s friends all became more or less hostile to him, have a clearness and
                    grace of style which were unknown in the previous century. Another author who
                    was from the beginning Gottsched’s enemy, but who had no relation with this
                    particular school, may be here mentioned,-—Liscow (1701-60).</p>

                <p>The Halle school of poets was in some respects different both from the Saxon and
                    the Swiss schools. Its original members were Gleim (1719-1803), Uz (1720-96),
                    and Götz (1721-81). These three writers formed a friendship in their student
                    days at Halle, where they came under the influence of the poets, Pastor Lange,
                    and the tutor of his children, Immanuel Pyra, ardent disciples of Bodmer and
                    Breitinger. The young students, while feeling sincere respect for the Swiss
                    critics, did not attempt any very serious flight; they preferred to amuse
                    themselves with lively little anacreontic verses, which they soon brought into
                    high repute. Afterwards Gleim settled in Halberstadt, where he lived to an
                    extreme age. His didactic poem <hi rend="italic">Halladat,</hi> which he wrote,
                    he himself modestly explained, in order to gratify a wish of his youth to
                    produce a book like the Bible, has no vitality; but during the Seven Years’ War
                    he composed TΓαr <hi rend="italic">Songs of a Grenadier,</hi> which were
                    everywhere read, and have not yet lost their popularity. They were edited by
                    Gleim’s friend Lessing, who, however, protested against their patriotic
                    vehemence. Gleim was one of the most kindly of men, and became the patron of
                    young poets, several of whom he always had in his pleasant bachelor’s home. He
                    also kept up an extensive correspondence with other writers·, which is now an
                    important source of information respecting the movements of contemporary
                    literature. One of his most intimate friends, who resembled him only in
                    geniality of disposition, was the noble-hearted Ewald Christian von Kleist
                    (1715-59), who was fatally wounded on the battle-field of Kunersdorf. He would
                    still deserve to be remembered as the man whom, of all others, the equally noble
                    Lessing most loved. His descriptive poem <hi rend="italic">Frühling</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(“</hi> Spring ”) is partly an imitation of Thomson; but it is
                    also the work of an independent lover of nature, who knew how to give beautiful
                    utterance to true and simple feeling. Ramler (1725-98), another friend of Gleim,
                    and the friend, too, of Kleist and Lessing, wrote spirited odes in Horatian
                    metres, which, like the <hi rend="italic">War Songs of a Grenadier,</hi> gave
                    pleasure because of their strongly patriotic tone,—the direct result in both
                    cases of Frederick’s influence. Anna Louisa Karsch (1722-91), a poetess who owed
                    much to Gleim’s goodness, was a favourite among the literary men of the day,
                    butj her verses are ruder than they ought to have been at so late a date.
                    Idyllic poetry, which Kleist and Götz to some extent cultivated, was taken up in
                    earnest by Solomon Gessner (1730-87), whose prose idylls, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Death of Abel, The First Sailor,</hi> and others, were translated into French
                    and English, and were better received in their foreign dress than in their
                    original form. They are written in an easy style, and express much harmless
                    although somewhat tedious sentiment. He was imitated by Xaver Bronner, a
                    Catholic priest, whose idylls have not half the merit of his autobiography,
                    which affords remarkable insight into the religious life of Catholic Germany
                    about the middle of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>The religious lyric, which had shared the general decay during the latter half of
                    the 17th century, displayed more vitality during part of this period. It owed
                    its fresh life mainly to the pietists, who reopened fountains of spiritual
                    feeling that had been apparently dried up by theologians. Among the best of this
                    younger generation of hymn writers were Freylinghausen, Neumeister, and
                    Tersteegen. Their fame was, however, less extensive than that of Count von
                    Zinzendorf (1700-60), the founder of the sect of Herrnhiiter or Moravian
                    Brethren. Besides hymns he wrote religious works in prose, and made himself one
                    of the most prominent figures of his time by ardent missionary zeal. His
                    followers, like all deeply religious sects in Germany, delighted in hymns; and
                    many of those they produced are remarkable for the sensuous, sometimes almost
                    sensual, forms in which their emotions are expressed.</p>
                <p>Fables were at this time an extremely popular class of writings, and nearly every
                    imaginative writer sought to distinguish himself as a fabulist. The Swiss
                    school, indeed, in their zeal for a combination of the wonderful and the useful
                    in literature, maintained that the fable was the highest type of literature. As
                    a rule, Lafontaine was taken as the model in works of this kind, but we look in
                    vain among his German imitators for his exquisite grace and naïveté Gellert
                    stands at the head of the more sentimental fabulists; after him may be named
                    Willanow and Lichtwer. The latter (1719-83) has humour as well as sentiment, and
                    some of his fables have an artistic finish that indicates a faculty by which he
                    might have won distinction in more important labours.</p>
                <p>From about the middle of the 18th century onwards a number of prose writers, who
                    may be classed together as popular philosophers, worked effectively for the
                    enlightenment of ordinary readers. They attached themselves to some extent to
                    Wolf; they also came under the influence, although not in any great degree, of
                    the French Encyclopedists; and they were admiring students of the English
                    deists, and of Locke, Shaftesbury, and Hutcheson. They are often condemned for
                    the shallowness of their thought; and if we compare them with the great thinkers
                    who followed them, the condemnation is just. They did not grasp the significance
                    of the problems which had been handed down by Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibnitz,
                    with which Hume was now grappling, and which were soon to enter upon a new phase
                    in the critical philosophy of Kant. In regard to religion they had a very
                    imperfect appreciation of every'element that could not be expressed in clear
                    logical statements; feeling and imagination were rigidly subordinated to the
                    understanding. And they had not even a remote suspicion of what is now familiar
                    as the historical spirit, so that they displayed amazing narrowness of vision in
                    their treatment of past spiritual developments, and of contemporary creeds with
                    which they did not happen to agree. But if we are to do justice to these popular
                    philosophers, they must be compared rather with their predecessors than with
                    their successors. An important place belongs to them in the movement by which
                    vital human interests have been raised above theological disputes, by which
                    morality has received a basis independent of dogmatic religion, and by which
                    toleration has been secured for men of every faith. They were penetrated by a
                    truly humane sentiment; and it must be counted a high merit that in a country
                    which had been more or less dominated by pedants, and whose great writers of a
                    later age have not always attempted to be both profound and clear, they sought
                    to express themselves in unpretending and straightforward German. The chief of
                    the popular philosophers was Moses Mendelssohn (1729-86), not a deep or massive
                    thinker, but a man of fine moral sympathies, an enthusiast for freedom—from the
                    lack of which he himself, as a Jew, keenly suffered—and an incisive
                    psychological analyst. His friend, Frederick Nicolai (1733-1811), the Berlin
                    bookseller, had the misfortune to outlive his epoch. He had only words of
                    contempt for Goethe and Schiller; and Kant, whom he did not profess to
                    understand, seemed to him a sort of cross between a bungler and an impostor.
                    These terrible mistakes have made poor Nicolai, notwithstanding his lifelong
                    warfare against bigotry, the type of a narrow-minded bigot. Yet in his earlier
                    days he was recognized by such a judge as Lessing, with whose friendship he was
                    honoured, as a writer of talent. And his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothek</hi>
                    (“Library ”), the most important literary periodical of his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n552/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0552-0535"/> day, did excellent service by providing the
                    popular philosophers with a medium for the expression of their opinions on all
                    the great questions which then agitated Germany. Other popular philosophers were
                    George Sulzer (1720-79), who devoted himself to aesthetics in the spirit of the
                    Swiss school, but with the advantage of later lights; Thomas Abbt (1738-66),
                    whose style was one of uncommon vigour; Christian Garve (1742-98), who did not
                    attempt any great original work, but in letters and articles examined many
                    individual philosophic questions from new points of view; and Johann Jacob Engel
                    (1741-1802), whose <hi rend="italic">Philosoph für</hi><hi rend="italic">die
                    Welt</hi> (“Philosopher for the World”) interested a class of readers who would
                    have been unable to follow a more adventurous guide. Zimmermann (1728— 95)
                    hardly deserves to be mentioned in such good company; but his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Betrachtungen über</hi><hi rend="italic">die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Einsamkeit</hi> (“Observations on Solitude ”) by its sentimentalism and
                    rhetoric carried his name far beyond the bounds of Germany. Some theologians,
                    without exactly sharing the beliefs of the popular philosophers, were profoundly
                    affected by them. Among these were Mosheim, the ecclesiastical historian;
                    Spalding, the translator of Shaftesbury; and Jerusalem, the father of the young
                    writer whose suicide suggested some elements in Goethe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Werther.</hi> These liberal theologians did not hold a very intelligible
                    logical position, but they were of some importance by their attempts to
                    introduce a freer and more polished style of eloquence than had hitherto marked
                    the German pulpit. In regard to the permanent movements of thought, their
                    influence was greatly inferior to that of Michaelis and Semler, whose labours
                    heralded the approach of modern Biblical criticism.</p>
                <p>In history Germany produced at this time at least one writer of high eminence,
                    Justus Möser (1720-94), author of the <hi rend="italic">Osnabrückische
                    Geschichte</hi> (“History of Osnabrück ”) and <hi rend="italic">Patriotische
                    Phantasien</hi><hi rend="italic">(f</hi> Patriotic Fancies ’’). Möser was the
                    first German historian who wrote a good style and attempted to penetrate to the
                    meaning of events and to present them in the light of great principles. He also
                    produced a strong impression by his enlightened patriotism and by his burning
                    scorn of wrong. Schröck and Schlözer were prominent historians, and the latter
                    made himself known as a clear writer on contemporary politics. Karl von Moser,
                    of Stuttgart, applied to political subjects a faculty for wit and satire that
                    was estimated highly in his own day. *</p>
                <p>It has been already stated that the revival of classical study was one of the
                    chief causes by which the mind of Germany was awakened to new effort. Professors
                    Christ and Ernesti, of Leipsic, who were the favourite teachers of many young
                    students, including Lessing, were two of the chief writers to whom this revival
                    was due. Incomparably greater than either, however, was Johann Joachim
                    Winckelmann (1717-68), whose <hi rend="italic">History of Ancient Art</hi>
                    (1764) opened a new era in the appreciation of ancient life. Later investigation
                    has corrected Winckelmann on many points, but no critic has displayed a keener
                    feeling for the beauty and the significance of such works as came within his
                    knowledge, or a truer imagination in bridging over the gulfs at which direct
                    knowledge failed him. And his style, warm with the glow of sustained enthusiasm,
                    yet calm, dignified, and harmonious, was worthy of his splendid theme. What he
                    did for ancient art was to some extent done for ancient literature by the
                    untiring editorial labours of Christian Gottlob Heyne (1729-1812).</p>
                <p>Important as were many of these writers, Winckelmann above all, they exercised
                    slight influence on the national mind compared with the three men whom the
                    Germans justly regard as the founders of their classical literature— Klopstock
                    (1724-1803), Wieland (1733-1813), and Lessing (1729-1781).</p>
                <p>Klopstock stood in direct relation to the Swiss writers. When a pupil at
                    Schulpforta, one of the great Saxon schools which sent forth many of the best
                    authors of the day, he was a diligent student of Bodmer, by whose critical
                    principles he guided himself in reading Homer, Virgil, and Milton. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Messiah,</hi> on which his fame mainly rests, is now little read,
                    and it is impossible even to glance through it without becoming conscious of
                    glaring faults. Klopstock’s genius was essentially lyrical; he lacked the
                    plastic force of imagination necessary for a great epic. His central figure is
                    nowhere presented in clear sharp outlines; it wavers between two distinct
                    conceptions, that of a divine and that of a human character. And the facts to
                    which he turns our gaze in the crisis of his narrative are not such as kindle
                    the deepest sympathies; he exhausts the powers of language to convey an
                    impression of the Messiah’s sufferings, but we hear nothing of the qualities of
                    soul which these sufferings rouse into action. The subordinate characters are
                    innumerable, and except Abaddona, a repentant fallen angel, between whose
                    character and whose fate there is an effective contrast, none of them can be
                    said to live; they exist only as an excuse for the utterance of Klopstock’s
                    feelings. They talk incessantly, weep, embrace, and kiss, but they never do
                    anything that exhibits more than a vast quantity of obtrusive sentiment.
                    Notwithstanding its obvious defects, however, the <hi rend="italic">Messiah</hi>
                    has qualities which must still command admiration; it reveals a nature full of
                    lofty aspiration and deep humanity, and it contains individual images of
                    striking force and beauty.</p>
                <p>It would be difficult to imagine anything more dreary than Klopstock’s plays, the
                    subject of three of which is Arminius, while the others deal with scriptural
                    themes. He knew enough neither of life nor of the stage to be a true dramatist;
                    his characters are mere names, and the incidents are grouped according to no
                    principle of art. His odes, which he continued to write from the beginning to
                    the end of his long career, are of far higher excellence. Those which derive
                    their inspiration from Northern mythology are too remote from general sympathy
                    and too obscure in construction to awaken interest; but the stamp of genius is
                    upon several of the lyrics in which he expresses his passionate feeling for the
                    grander phenomena of nature, his ardent patriotism, his enthusiasm for freedom,
                    and his elevated sense of human worth and destiny. Both as an epic poet and as a
                    writer of odes he had many imitators, who, like most others of their class,
                    exaggerated the defects of their model and left his virtues alone. His influence
                    upon the intellectual life of Germany was deep, and, on the whole, beneficent.
                    He encouraged the self-respect of his countrymen, intensified their desire for
                    an independent literature, and by handling high themes, sometimes powerfully,
                    alwayβ seriously, suggested that the national imagination would reveal its full
                    capacity only by undertaking greater enterprises than any it had yet
                    attempted.</p>
                <p>Although Klopstock was one of the central literary figures during two
                    generations, he was not a prolific writer; Wieland, on the other hand, was one
                    of the most prolific of German authors. He was continually at his desk, and in
                    the course of his career produced a considerable library. Of his many works the
                    romantic poem <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> is by far the most famous, and the
                    only one that really pleases modern readers. <hi rend="italic">Agathon</hi> is
                    perhaps the best of the prose romances in which he endeavoured to depict ancient
                    Greek life. He was not endowed with great vividness of imagination, and his
                    prevailing tendency is to extreme diffuseness; but some of his descriptive
                    passages, especially those in <hi rend="italic">Oberon,</hi> have a touch of
                    ideal grace which enables us to return to them with fresh relish. He had a fine
                    appreciation of style, and by the study of Greek <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n553/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0553-0536"/> and French masterpieces persistently strove to
                    acquire lightness, clearness, and ease. Even yet few German writers will compare
                    with him in these qualities. In all his works he had a strongly didactic
                    tendency, but his teaching was the opposite of that inculcated by most modern
                    writers who deliberately aim at ethical effect. Above all, he differed from his
                    great contemporary, Klopstock. Writing at first as a strict pietist, he
                    ultimately became a pronounced Epicurean in the popular sense, and made it his
                    object to proclaim an Epicurean theory of life, discouraging enthusiasm,
                    laughing at such aspirations as those of his own youth, exalting the claims of
                    the senses, and placing the highest virtue, in kindliness and good humour. This
                    tendency often conducts him to more slippery ground than any on which a German
                    writer of his standing would now venture; but it also gives him innumerable
                    occasions for the play of a gentle and refined irony.</p>
                <p>Whatever may be the excellences of Wieland and Klopstock, both are essentially
                    writers of the past. This cannot be said of Lessing, the third great German of
                    this period; he is still a living influence. He is, indeed, the only writer
                    before Goethe whom Germans can now read without feeling themselves in a world
                    foreign to their sympathies. Throughout his career he strove to renew and
                    fructify the intellectual life of his nation, and he achieved his aim by
                    important creative activity, and by the clearest, freest, and most drastic
                    criticism of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>As an imaginative writer he was chiefly distinguished in the drama, and his most
                    important dramatic work is <hi rend="italic">Minna von Barnhelm.</hi> If it
                    cannot be said that this is, in the highest sense, a comedy of genius, it is at
                    any rate a comedy which contains elements of permanent interest. The characters
                    are vividly presented; the plot is systematically, yet naturally, unfolded; the
                    dialogue is clear, fresh, and animated. And the work has the high merit of
                    giving artistic shape to elements taken by the dramatist from the living world
                    around him. <hi rend="italic">Emilia Galotti</hi> is marred by a deep flaw in
                    the conception of the central figure; but every other character in the tragedy
                    is conceived with bold imaginative force, and it is possible for a competent
                    actress to sotten, if not to harmonize, even the clashing elements in Emilia
                    herself. No drama making even a distant approach to the excellence of these two
                    plays had been produced in Germany; they thus gave literature in its highest
                    department a fresh start.</p>
                <p>But valuable as were Lessing’s imaginative creations, they were inferior to his
                    labours as a thinker. Here he was absolutely supreme among his contemporaries;
                    and in some respects he has not since been surpassed. His method is invariably
                    critical, but he aims at rising to the highest, most universal aspects of every
                    subject with which he deals. As a master of style he ranks with the greatest
                    European writers. The structure of his sentences is clear, precise, and compact;
                    and he keeps the mind awake by vivid images drawn from nature and from human
                    life, by interesting, sometimes remote, allusions, by rapid strokes of wit, and
                    by unexpected turns of thought, as if he were abandoning his main theme, while
                    he is in reality indirectly advancing it. He has often been called the most
                    critical of poets; it would be equally just to call him the most poetical of
                    critics.</p>
                <p>The greatest of Lessing’s purely critical writings is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laocoon,</hi> a fragment, but a fragment containing the germs of much of the
                    best thought of his own and the immediately succeeding generations. It has an
                    enduring value as the first serious and great attempt to distinguish sharply the
                    realms of art and poetry, and to foster both by subjecting each to its own laws.
                    Next in importance stands his <hi rend="italic">Hamburgische Dramaturgie,</hi> a
                    series of criticisms on plays represented at the Hamburg National Theatre. By
                    these splendid criticisms, which are based in the main on Aristotle’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Poetics,</hi> with many side-references to Diderot’s theories, he
                    put an end to the abject submission of dramatic writers to French traditions. In
                    his later years he issued the <hi rend="italic">Wolfenbüttel</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fragments,</hi> portions of a theological work by Reimarus, a
                    deistical writer of admirable force and clearness. He thus became involved in a
                    hot controversy with indignant professors and pastors, the noisiest of whom was
                    Pastor Goeze of Hamburg. The tracts issued by Lessing in the course of this
                    controversy are in form among the most perfect of his writings; they are at once
                    learned, keen, and witty. And in the history of Western thought they are of deep
                    significance. His immediate object was to secure for criticism absolute freedom
                    of movement; but he did very much more. He foreshadowed, as a vital element of
                    the coming time, inquiry as to the origin and growth of the Scriptures, the rise
                    of Christianity, and the fundamental character of religion. And he indicated a
                    far higher standpoint than that of the popular philosophers by vindicating the
                    claims of feeling in spiritual life as opposed to those of the bare
                    understanding. In his <hi rend="italic">Education of the Human Race</hi> he gave
                    systematic shape to the fruitful principle that a religion which is not true
                    absolutely or for all time may be of vast importance by meeting the needs of a
                    portion of the race in special epochs, and that there is in history,
                    notwithstanding apparent reactions, a progressive movement towards higher
                    intellectual and moral ideals. The suggestions thrown out in controversy he
                    developed artistically in one of the greatest of his writings, the fine dramatic
                    poem, <hi rend="italic">Nathan the Wise,</hi> a work which enshrines all that
                    was noblest in the struggles and the aspirations of his age, and connects the
                    thought of the 18th with that of the 19th century. As a drama, it has serious
                    faults; but it powerfully effects its purpose by revealing, in the enlightened
                    Jew, its hero, the grandeur of a nature which, instead of binding itself in
                    dogmatic fetters, cultivates a spirit of free and disinterested humanity.</p>
                <p>Thus in all directions this great writer laboured for the intellectual
                    regeneration of his people. If Goethe, Schiller, and Kant found a nation
                    prepared to receive their work, they owed the fact to many causes; but among
                    these the chief were the political activity of Frederick II. and the literary
                    activity of Lessing.</p>
                <p>VII. <hi rend="italic">The Classical Period.—</hi> At the close of the Seven
                    Years’ War the conditions of public life were very unfavourable to literature.
                    The country was impoverished, and Frederick the Great and Maria Theresa were
                    almost the only sovereigns who showed the least regard for the welfare of their
                    subjects. But the mind of the nation had been thoroughly aroused from its long
                    slumber. It had been startled into patriotism by Frederick’s unsurpassed energy,
                    while the labours of the chief writers had imbued the better part of the middle
                    class with a desire for a more varied and interesting life. As political freedom
                    was still a dream of the future, they turned more and more to books for
                    refreshment and stimulus. Multitudes of young men who in other circumstances
                    would have occupied themselves solely with practical duty became authors, and
                    they urged each other to an activity without parallel in any previous
                    period.</p>
                <p>Most of these young writers were deeply influenced by the men of the older
                    generation—Lessing, Wieland, and Klopstock. They were also ardent students of
                    Shakespeare, Ossian, and Dr Young, poets who were oddly supposed to be on the
                    same level and to share the same tendencies. Rousseau excited almost as much
                    enthusiasm in Germany as in France, and the criticism of Diderot found many warm
                    admirers. Under these diverse influences a curious movement began which is known
                    as that of “Sturm und <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n554/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0554-0537"/> Drang” (“Storm and Pressure”). It lasted, from
                    about 1770, for ten or twelve years, and included nearly all the writers who
                    still had fame to win. Their most prominent quality was discontent with the
                    existing world. They detested not only tyranny and superstition but everything
                    which prevented, or seemed to prevent, the free exercise of any powerful
                    impulse. To break down conventionalities appeared to the “Sturm und Drang” poets
                    their true function; but even this did not satisfy them. They longed for some
                    knowledge deeper and more intimate than that attained by science, philosophy, or
                    history, for some emotion intenser than can arise from any known human relation.
                    All these conflicting feelings they expressed in their writings. From slavish
                    submission to French critical laws they were of course completely emancipated.
                    Most of them despised laws of every kind in literature as well as in life, and
                    continually proclaimed that the duty of a man of genius was towrite precisely as
                    nature dictated. By “genius” they meant vehement sensations, by “nature” a free
                    use of vigorous epithets.</p>
                <p>The writer who formed the connecting link between Lessing on the one hand and
                    Goethe and Schiller on the other, and whom the best writers of the “Sturm und
                    Drang” movement regarded as their critical guide, was Johann Gottfried Herder
                    (1744-1803). Herder is sometimes compared with Lessing, but while Lessing has a
                    cosmopolitan touch which makes him intelligible and attractive to all the world,
                    Herder is in the strictest sense a German, and is only slightly studied beyond
                    his own nation. He was less boldly original than his older contemporary, and
                    never attained the clearness, force, and classic beauty of Lessing’s style.
                    Nevertheless he is justly ranked among the most distinguished spirits Germany
                    has produced. His mind was receptive in many different directions, and what he
                    absorbed he made his own by independent thought, giving it out in new and
                    suggestive forms. As an original poet, Herder does not rank high; yet genuine
                    poetic impulses are visible in the poem in which he gave shape to the Spanish
                    legends of the Cid. The literature in which he looked for the highest
                    manifestation of thought and feeling was that which appeals to popular sentiment
                    and has its root in popular life. Lessing had already called attention to the
                    songs and ballads of the people; but Herder was the first German who decisively
                    followed the impulse which led in England to the publication of Percy’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Reliques.</hi> In his <hi rend="italic">Stimmen der Völker</hi>
                    (“Voices of the Peoples”) he brought together an admirable collection of the
                    lyrical utterances of many races; and it would be difficult to overrate the
                    service he thus rendered, for he conducted his countrymen to a source of
                    imaginative pleasure and revival in which their literature is exceptionally
                    rich. By far his most important prose work was his <hi rend="italic">Ideen zur
                    Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit</hi> (“Ideas towards the Philosophy of
                    the History of Humanity”), in which, working to some extent on the lines laid
                    down in the brief paragraphs of Lessing’s <hi rend="italic">Education of the
                    Human Race,</hi> he develops the conception of progress, and indicates that we
                    can fully understand any single element of history only by seeing it in the
                    light of human evolution as a whole. This excellent book elevated the aims and
                    enlarged the scope of historic inquiry in Germany; and it still produces a
                    powerful moral effect by its noble spirit of humanity. To the end of his days
                    Herder was animated by a fine enthusiasm for human happiness, and it lights up
                    his pages even when his subject does not lead to its direct expression.</p>
                <p>To Herder belonged the high honour of stimulating and directing, at a critical
                    stage, the young genius of Johann Wolfgang Goethe (1749-1832). In naming Goethe
                    we mention the writer who holds in German literature the place held by
                    Shakespeare in the literature of England, and by Dante in that of Italy. He
                    towers high above even the greatest of his contemporaries, predecessors, and
                    successors,—Schiller himself, who is most worthily associated with him, being
                    far inferior in breadth of sympathy and splendour of creative impulse. Goethe,
                    indeed, is one of the few writers who, while marked by strongly national
                    characteristics, belong to the world rather than to a particular country. The
                    special phases of his age have begun to pass away, but his best work has lost
                    none of its freshness: it cannot become old, since it is rooted in elements of
                    human life that eternally endure.</p>
                <p>All things co-operated to render worthy of his destiny this favoured child of
                    fortune. During his long life he enjoyed almost uninterrupted physical vigour;
                    he was born into a family of prosperous circumstances, although not so highly
                    placed as to satisfy his ambition; he received the best intellectual training
                    his epoch could afford; in Weimar he was free to adapt the plan of his life to
                    his inclinations; and he appeared at the very time when, by an era of sincere
                    poetic endeavour and unparalleled critical labour, the mind of the nation had
                    been prepared for the boldest efforts of genius. Nature has seldom lavished so
                    many advantages on the greatest of her great men.</p>
                <p>The quality in Goethe which immediately arrests attention is the extraordinary
                    range of his activity. Hardly any aspect of human existence was strange to him.
                    He possessed in an unsurpassed degree the faculty of dramatically thinking
                    himself into phases of life to which his personal impulses would not have led
                    him; and he deliberately enlarged his experience by exercising this power at
                    every stage of his career. It was his prevailing conviction that all ideals
                    which fascinate or have fascinated humanity must have a touch of vitality; and
                    none was so remote from him but he sought to penetrate to its meaning. He could
                    be just to Hellenic culture without doing wrong to mediaevalism; he appreciated
                    the spirit of Christianity without being indifferent to the faith of the Parsees
                    or the Buddhists; he presented the ascetic aspirations of a “beautiful soul,”
                    while setting forth the gaiety of the brightest and. most careless tempers; he
                    felt the charm of art at the same time that he carried on profound researches in
                    science; he loved his country, and yet, even when it was overrun by Napoleon’s
                    troops, he would not join the patriots in saying a harsh word of France. This
                    absolute universality destroyed enthusiasm for special practical movements; but
                    it gave astonishing variety to his literary achievements. Goethe’s was in every
                    respect a thoroughly poetic nature. He could not pass through a profound
                    experience, an image of beauty could not cross his vision, without an
                    accompanying impulse to find for his emotion an adequate sensuous
                    representation. So vast a body of writings as bis inevitably includes much that
                    is tedious, but in his happiest moments his genius moved with the ease, the
                    certainty, the calmness of the great forces of nature; he could be as perfect in
                    the lightest stroke of delicate feeling as in the grandest flight of soaring
                    imagination. The world he reflects is the world we actually know; but he is not,
                    therefore, in any narrow sense, a realist. The facts he images are shaped and
                    coloured by his thought and feeling; he breathes into them a life by which they
                    are made of universal significance. This combination of realism and idealism is
                    one of the chief secrets of his power. His art aims at producing the most
                    general effects, yet it is kept fresh, vivid, and true by incessant contact with
                    the concrete life of men.</p>
                <p>Heine relates that he felt inclined to address Goethe in Greek, so like was the
                    calm dignified old man to an earthly Zeus; and this is probably the image
                    suggested to most minds by his name. But in youth he was full of eager life,
                    restless, and passionate, and his early works bear the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n555/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0555-0538"/> impress of turbulent feeling. Of these the first
                    published was <hi rend="italic">Götz</hi><hi rend="italic">von
                    Berlichiηgeη,</hi> which instantly established his fame as one of the chief
                    writers of the “Sturm und Drang” school. It is almost as formless as their
                    inartistic writings. The language is sometimes excessively rude, and there is no
                    attempt to combine the different scenes into an harmonious picture. Yet it is
                    sharply separated off from the tasteless plays with which it was compared, for
                    everywhere we find traces of immature power. The characters are alive; they act
                    and react upon each other as we should expect men and women to do in a stormy
                    and troubled epoch; and by a few touches of apparently unconscious art we are
                    made to realize the vital change through which the society of the age of the
                    Reformation was passing. <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Leiden des
                    jungen Werthers</hi> (“The Sufferings of Young Werther”) gave Goethe a European
                    reputation. Much of its sentimentalism now excites smiles instead of tears; but
                    with all its faults it has an enduring fascination. It breathes a warm love of
                    nature, of which it presents vivid pictures; it conveys a powerful impression of
                    the mingled force, sweetness, and unreasonableness of early passion; and it
                    expresses with deep pathos that weariness of life which forms one of the moods
                    of poetic youth, and the manifestation of which was a favourite pastime of the
                    less sincere “Sturm und Drang” versifiers. The promise of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glitz</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> was not sustained by all the
                    works produced in the first part of his career. <hi rend="italic">Clavigo</hi>
                    is only a fairly good acting play; and <hi rend="italic">Stella</hi> has even
                    more than the extravagant sentimentalism of <hi rend="italic">Werther.</hi> with
                    only an occasional touch of its poetry. On the other hand, it was now that
                    Goethe began <hi rend="italic">Faust;</hi> and the fragment, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prometheus,</hi> expresses a grand defiance that is the more impressive because
                    of the deep philosophic thought which may be .traced in the background. It was,
                    however, in his lyrics that the richly varied life of Goethe’s youth most
                    perfectly revealed itself. There are no German lyrics, if we except Heine’s,
                    which deserve to be compared with Goethe’s; perhaps none in any literature have
                    a more subtle charm. Profiting by the teaching of Herder, he studied the artless
                    beauty of the best songs of the people, to some of which he gave new form, while
                    retaining their primitive simplicity. His own lyrics are at once popular and
                    artistic; he takes as his themes the joys, the longings, the regrets which all
                    men understand, and weds them to melodies of delightful ease and grace. Almost
                    every poem was suggested by some passing emotion of his own; yet his feeling is
                    so purified that his words become the voice rather of humanity than of an
                    individual man. His ballads are not, as a rule, so powerful as his songe, but
                    both have one quality in common—without elaborate descriptions they continually
                    call up by an apparently accidental word or phrase a clear vision of some
                    natural object or scene. He is equally master of himself in rendering nature as
                    a mirror in which we see the reflection of our own experience, or as a power
                    moving on in calm indifference to our hopes and fears.</p>
                <p>In 1775 Goethe settled in Weimar, where Wieland already was, and whither he was
                    ultimately followed by Herder and Schiller, so that the little town became the
                    centre of the intellectual life of Germany. After an interval of ten years,
                    during which he published nothing, he paid his famous visit to Italy. Here his
                    genius was kindled anew, and a close study of sculpture and painting suggested
                    to him the necessity of submitting more fully than he had yet done to the
                    permanent laws of art. The fruits of this experience were <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iphigenia, Tasso,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Egmont,</hi> all of which he took
                    with him to Italy in an unfinished form. The first two of these dramas were
                    accepted as imitations of the antique; but they are so only in the sense that in
                    each the parts are rigidly subordinated to the intention of the whole, that
                    there is an orderly sequence in the development of the action, and that they are
                    marked by elevation and simplicity of style. While incomparably more finished as
                    works of art than any of the greater works he had before produced, they
                    indicated no falling off in energy of imagination. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iphigenia,</hi> although its subject is Greek, is in tone and motive altogether
                    Christian; and it would be difficult to name a more attractive picture of a
                    modern lady than the pure and high-minded heroine. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tasso</hi> Goethe draws in strong and sure outlines the sorrows of a poetic
                    nature which will not sharply discriminate the real from its own ideal world.
                    This dramatic poem is hardly more remarkable for the truth and vividness of its
                    conceptions than for the charm of its versification and the wealth and beauty of
                    its language. <hi rend="italic">Egmont,</hi> however, has more movement, and
                    touches human experience at deeper points. Most readers agree with Schiller’s
                    criticism, that there is too much melodrama in the closing scene, in which
                    Clärchen appears to the hero as the spirit of freedom, and that, notwithstanding
                    the liberties taken with history, Goethe has hardly succeeded in making Egmont
                    the type of an enemy of despotism. But Clärchen is a beautiful study of a mind
                    stirred by love to great resolves; and there is splendid portraiture in the
                    characters of Alva, William of Orange, and the Princess of Parma.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, a new literary force had revealed itself in the life of Germany:
                    Schiller (1759-1805), Goethe’s great rival, had begun to divide with him the
                    public attention and interest. The names of these two poets, in virtue of whose
                    labours their period deserves to be called classical, are indissolubly
                    connected, yet they were marked off from each other by profound distinctions.
                    Goethe is often called the poet of culture, and it is true that he never ceased
                    to subject his powers to systematic discipline. He was also one of the keenest
                    critics of modern times. But the charm of his best writings is not dependent on
                    criticism or culture; it springs from the spontaneous movement of a great
                    imaginative faculty. Schiller, on the other hand, while also endowed with
                    imagination, possessed it in a much less degree. His poetry would probably have
                    lived even if he had not had the advantage of a thorough grasp of aesthetic
                    laws; but it would certainly have had no claim to the distinguished place it now
                    holds in European literature. He did not attempt so wide a range as Goethe, and
                    within his scope he was not, like Goethe, a disinterested observer; he flung
                    himself into the midst of the struggles of his time, and fought valiantly as the
                    champion of a side. Fortunately for Germany, his side was always that of a truly
                    chivalrous mind; for Schiller was one of the most unselfish of men, with lofty
                    aspirations for the race, and a generous confidence in its essential goodness.
                    These qualities determined the character of his conceptions. Goethe presents us
                    with idealized pictures of the world; Schiller’s creations are not so much
                    pictures of the world as the figures of a realm distinct from actual life. His
                    supreme aim was to express great sentiments and ideas, and as the medium for
                    their utterance he conceived characters which are to be found only in a poet’s
                    dreams.</p>
                <p>Schiller began his literary career as a youth of two-and-twenty, inspired by
                    revolutionary ardour, detesting every conventionality of society, dreaming of a
                    world in which will and passion should have absolute licence. He relieved
                    himself of his vehement emotions in his first three plays, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Bäuber</hi><hi rend="italic">(“</hi> The Robbers ”),
                    <hi rend="italic">Fiesco,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cabale</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">und Liebe</hi> (“Intrigue and Love”). Genius never beat with more
                    Titanic energy against an unsympathetic world than in these dramas; the impulse
                    of the “Sturm und Drang” period, as it was about to die away, spoke in them its
                    wildest, most passionate word. <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos,</hi> his next

                    deeds by natural and intelligible motives. But we are no longer in the presence
                    of one who merely raises an outcry against the existing world; furious
                    resistance to despotism has become enlightened enthusiasm for freedom, humanity,
                    and progress. Although the part of Marquis Posa is imperfectly worked into the
                    scheme of the play, he is a nobly ideal creation; through him Schiller pours
                    forth his own aspirations for the welfare of mankind. There is admirable art in
                    the momentary elevation caused by his greatness of soul even in the dark and
                    selfish Philip and the restless and wayward Don Carlos.</p>
                <p>After he settled in Jena in 1789 as professor of history, Schiller was often in
                    Weimar; but for a time he and Goethe held apart. By and by they began to
                    approach each other, and from about 1794 their acquaintance ripened into fast
                    friendship. The friendship of Goethe and Schiller is one of the most beautiful
                    in the history of literature. It made no essential change in Goethe’s modes of
                    thought or expression, but it spurred him to the highest activity of which his
                    genius was capable. His friend, he himself declared, “created for him a second
                    youth, and again made him a poet, which he had almost ceased to be.” On the
                    other hand, in contact with Goethe’s larger intellectual life, Schiller was
                    raised to new points of view, and he acquired for the first time that mastery of
                    artistic methods which secured for him his highest triumphs. He now became as
                    remarkable for the perfection of his form as for the depth and warmth of his
                    feeling.</p>
                <p>The two friends worked harmoniously in connexion with Schiller’s journal <hi
                    rend="italic">Die Horen,</hi> and wrote in common the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Xenien,</hi> a number of epigrammatic verses meant to wound their literary
                    enemies. On the whole, it is surprising that comparatively so few of the arrows
                    in this rather large quiver are delicately pointed and feathered. A very
                    different stage of excellence is reached by Schiller’s well-known ballads, which
                    were written during the period of his intimacy with Goethe. Nearly all of them
                    are marked by force of conception and by purity and dignity of style. In lyrical
                    poetry he had acquired some distinction before he knew Goethe, but it was in
                    competition with his friend that he achieved his masterpiece, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Das</hi><hi rend="italic">Lied</hi><hi rend="italic">von der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cloche</hi> (“The Song of the Bell”), in which within a small
                    compass he presents an impressive picture of the course of human life, varying
                    his melody with subtle art to suit the changing aspects of his theme. Less
                    artistically perfect than the <hi rend="italic">Cloche,</hi> other lyrics, such
                    as <hi rend="italic">Der Genius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ideale, Der Spaziergang,</hi> have the power which belongs to deeper personal
                    emotion. In ease and spontaneity none of Schiller’s lyrics equal Goethe’s, in
                    which, as Heine says, “the word embraces you while the thought kisses you.” But
                    they express in clear and noble language some of the highest feelings excited in
                    a poetic mind by contemplation of human life and destiny,</p>
                <p>In his dramatic writings Schiller was influenced by Goethe even more than in his
                    lyrics and ballads. The whole series of tragedies which he now wrote have
                    historic or legendary themes, and he displays remarkable skill in unfolding
                    through the past his greatest ideas respecting the future. At the same time he
                    evokes from it a company of finely ideal figures, whose qualities are revealed
                    by the systematic development of large and carefully conceived schemes. <hi
                    rend="italic">Wallenstein,</hi> the earliest of the series, consists of two
                    plays, <hi rend="italic">The Piccolomini</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wallenstein’s Death,</hi> the former of which is preceded by a number of scenes
                    presenting a vivid picture of Wallenstein’s camp. The tragic motive of this
                    great work is somewhat obscure. We are made conscious by many artful touches of
                    the ultimate issue; but Schiller does not render fully intelligible the play of
                    the influences which result in disaster. There is, however, high imaginative
                    faculty in his conception of Wallenstein’s powerful, dark, and wavering
                    character; and every reader feels the charm of the love passages between Max
                    Piccolomini and Thekla. In <hi rend="italic">Maria Stuart</hi> Schiller triumphs
                    over an obvious difficulty by admitting the heroine’s guilt, while he stirs our
                    pity for her sufferings and our admiration for the spirit of endurance with
                    which they are met. In the <hi rend="italic">Jungfrau von Orleans,</hi> “The
                    Maid” would have given purer pleasure if she had not been represented as loving
                    one of the English commanders; but this only slightly mars the splendid picture
                    of her patriotic devotion. As a •work of art, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traut</hi><hi rend="italic">von Messina</hi> is the least successful of the
                    later dramas, for it attempts to combine romantic and classic elements which are
                    irreconcilable; it contains, however, some of the most brilliantly rhetorical
                    passages in the German language. The last of his completed works, and in some
                    respects the best, was <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Tell.</hi> Here his love of
                    freedom shaped for itself forms of immortal beauty. At a time when the French
                    emperor threatened the independence of all Europe, men felt the power of the
                    play more keenly than can be done in a calmer period; but it has permanently
                    enriched the life of humanity by its conception of a character dominated by
                    high, ideal passions. Schiller never saw Switzerland, yet in this powerful drama
                    he renders with astonishing vividness the grander effects of Alpine scenery.</p>
                <p>During his friendship with Schiller Goethe wrote in competition with him many
                    lyrics and ballads. In works of the latter class, as Goethe himself thought, he
                    was surpassed by his friend. He is incomparably more subtle and suggestive than
                    Schiller; but for this very reason he is less effective. A ballad does not
                    deserve its name if it is not popular; and we hear the voice of the people
                    themselves in Schiller’s free, bold, and simply harmonious verses. One of the
                    longer works published by Goethe during this period was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hermann</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Dorothea.</hi> His
                    delicately chosen language and dignified hexameters are not always in keeping
                    with the somewhat prosaic life they are here used to portray; but the poem is
                    the nearest approach that has been made to the successful epic treatment of an
                    ordinary theme. And it rises to a high level of imaginative power in the
                    contrast it suggests between the still life of the humble village, with its
                    little idyll of satisfied love, and the far-off desolation of the revolutionary
                    wars, of which we are reminded by the band of emigrants. The genius of Goethe
                    moves more freely in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister,</hi> of which the first
                    part was now published. This work has perhaps given rise to more contradictory
                    criticism than any other book in modern literature. We may safely disregard the
                    opinion of those who find in it all the excellences that can be combined in a
                    prose romance, for it is without plan, and its style is singularly unequal. When
                    Goethe himself admitted that he did not possess the key to its full
                    significance, his warmest admirers may allow that perhaps there is no key to
                    possess. Yet few of his writings present more striking evidence of the fertility
                    of his power. He interests us equally— to recall only a few of the characters—in
                    the gay and worldly Phillina, in the romantic Mariana, and in that most
                    mysterious, lovely, and fascinating of creations, Mignon, whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Kennst</hi><hi rend="italic">du das Land</hi> is perhaps the
                    noblest of those pathetic poems in which a soul in an uncongenial world calls up
                    a momentary vision of its true home. It is not only in its dramatic conceptions
                    that <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> is great; it contains some of
                    Goethe’s deepest thoughts on life and literature.</p>
                <p>After the death of Schiller Goethe turned his attention more and more to science,
                    his achievements in which have been fully appreciated only since the growth of
                    the doctrine of evolution. Still, it was in hi⅛ latest period that he completed
                    the most famous and the greatest of his works, <hi rend="italic">Faust,</hi> a
                    poem which he began in youth and did not finish <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n557/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0557-0540"/> until nearly his last birthday. The Faust of
                    legend was a vulgar magician; Goethe so conceives the character that it
                    indicates the deepest mysteries of human existence. The second part, in which
                    the problem of the poem is solved, can hardly be regarded as a work of art; it
                    is, or seems to be, confused and dark. And the individual elements of the first
                    part are not completely welded; they form rather a series of poems than a single
                    creation. In these individual elements, however, we find the grandest sweep of
                    imaginative thought yet achieved by the German genius. The episode of Gretchen
                    reflects with perfect art the most alluring and the most sorrowful facts of
                    life; and philosophy and religion in their highest aspects meet in Faust’s
                    aspirations and struggles.</p>
                <p>It might have been supposed that at the age of seventy Goethe had no new
                    imaginative worlds to conquer; yet he then published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Westöstlicher</hi><hi rend="italic">Divan,</hi> representing, with dramatic
                    sympathy and lyric force almost unabated, the combined mysticism and
                    sensuousness of Oriental life. Ten years before, he had issued <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wahlverwandtschaften</hi> (“Elective Affinities”), a powerful picture of
                    impulses which law cannot control, and in which are concealed the germs of
                    tragic issues. It has, however, less charm than another prose work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Dicldung</hi><hi rend="italic">und Wahrheit</hi> (“Poetry and
                    Truth”), in which he draws a slightly idealized sketch of his early life. This
                    fascinating book has made the figure of young Goethe as familiar as his chief
                    dramatic characters; and no creations of the fancy are better known than the
                    Frederikas and the Lilis, who had long before occasioned his sweetest lyrics,
                    and the memory of whom in old age gave delicacy and music to his style. ·</p>
                <p>While Goethe and Schiller were in thé midst of their career, Europe was startled
                    by the French Revolution. At first it stirred as much interest in Germany as in
                    England. The aged Klopstock greeted it with odes full of the fiery energy of
                    youth, and for a time Schiller almost fancied that his loftiest hopes were about
                    to be realized. Sympathy, however, was transformed into bitter opposition by the
                    Reign of Terror; and when Germany was trodden under foot by Napoleon, she turned
                    more and more from every kind of French influence. Thus it happened that,
                    although the ideas of the Revolution have indirectly affected the literature of
                    Germany as deeply as that of the. rest of Europe, their immediate effect was
                    slight and transitory.</p>
                <p>An event of the highest importance in the intellectual growth of Germany was the
                    publication, in 1781, of Kant’s <hi rend="italic">Kritik der Reinen
                    Vernunft.</hi> It is hard for men of a later time, accustomed to metaphysical
                    speculation, to realize the impression produced by this great book. Its effect
                    in philosophy was not unlike that caused in our own day in science by Mr
                    Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species.</hi> Everywhere among thoughtful
                    men, at the universities especially, philosophy became the absorbing subject of
                    study; and it was taken up at a point from which its whole past development was
                    for the first time intelligible. Goethe, without neglecting the movement, was
                    perhaps less stirred by it than any other prominent writer; Schiller became one
                    of Kant’s most enthusiastic students, and traces of the new system are to be
                    found in many of his later lyrics and dramas. He also applied its principles to
                    aestlietics in several admirable critical writings. By and by, dissatisfied with
                    the gulf left by Kant between mind and matter as “things in themselves,”
                    philosophers started in search of some principle which should harmonize all the
                    elements of existence; and thus grew up, one after the other, the systems of
                    Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. For more than a generation these thinkers excited
                    deeper interest than imaginative writers; the most serious minds were fascinated
                    by speculations which placed in new lights all the greatest questions relating
                    to human thought and action.</p>
                <p>Of the poets or versifiers who began their career with Goethe, the one who for
                    some time attracted most notice was Klinger (1753-1831), whose play, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sturm</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Drang,</hi>
                    is at least memorable through its title. Other plays of his were <hi
                    rend="italic">Conradin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Medea·,</hi> and he also wrote
                    romances, of which the best known were <hi rend="italic">Paust</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Leben,</hi><hi rend="italic">Thaten,</hi><hi rend="italic">und Höllenfahrt</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Der Weltmann und der Dichter.</hi> His writings are
                    violent and noisy, without a touch of true art; what he mistook for imagination
                    was a power of crude and unmeasured declamation. His later works express the
                    bitterness of a deeply disappointed man. Lenz (1750-92), whose name is usually
                    connected with that of Klinger, did not make even so distant an approach to
                    imagination as his rival; his plays are the wild outgrowths of a mind which has
                    made no sincere observation of life, and has submitted neither to intellectual
                    nor to moral discipline. A man of much greater talent than either was Daniel
                    Schubart (1739-91), the restless, licentious, and unfortunate poet who, for
                    publishing a piece of false news, was confined for ten years in a fortress,
                    where he suffered incredible hardships. In his attempts to portray the horrible
                    he is sometimes extremely grotesque, but his best verses have both music and
                    pathos, and they had the good fortune to exercise some influence on Schiller. He
                    was one of the earliest publicists of Germany, and his hatred of despotism was
                    the real cause of the infamous act which deprived him of freedom. Writers who
                    shared the spirit of “Sturm und Drang,” and applied it in new directions, were
                    Lavater and Basedow. Lavater enjoyed the friendship of nearly every
                    distinguished man of his day, yet he was vain and fanatical. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Physiognomische</hi><hi rend="italic">Fragmente</hi> (“Fragments
                    on Physiognomy ”) were supposed by thousands of readers to find in the relations
                    of mind and body the materials of a new and mysterious science; but the
                    pretended science was in reality a mixture of commonplace and extravagance.
                    Basedow, although with too passionate a faith in the power of education to
                    effect an immediate transformation of the race, did excellent service by
                    advocating, after Rousseau, a more humane and natural system of mental training
                    than had before prevailed. The same cause was more temperately promoted by
                    Campe, who wrote some admirable books for the young; and the Swiss educational
                    reformer, Pestalozzi, set forth methods of instruction in earnest didactic works
                    which had some effect in nearly every country in Europe.</p>
                <p>The excitement of the “Sturm und Drang” writers was shared by a band of young
                    poets who in other respects displayed a wholly different temper. Most of them
                    were students at Göttingen, where they gathered round Boie, editor of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Musenalmanach,</hi> a journal he had started in imitation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Mercure de France,</hi> and to which
                    Goethe and many of the best of the younger men of the day contributed. They
                    called themselves the “Hainbund” (“Grove Confederation ”), because of their
                    dancing one night by moonlight round an oak tree, swearing eternal friendship,
                    and vowing to devote themselves to their native land. The god of their idolatry
                    was Klopstock, whose somewhat fantastic enthusiasm for primitive Germany they
                    fully shared, and whose labours on behalf of virtue they never ceased to
                    celebrate, while they loathed and despised Wieland. Several members of the
                    “Hainbund” afterwards acquired distinction, and all of them were more or less
                    remarkable for the genuinely popular tone of their writings. By far the greatest
                    of them was Bürger (1748-94), who, although he never did full justice to
                    himself, gave evidence of an original and adventurous geniu3. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Lenore,</hi> a translation of which was Scott’s first published
                    work, is full of weird power, and his sonnets are among the most perfect in
                    German literature. His faculty of meeting the popular taste was possessed by
                    Holty (1748-76), who, however, delighted <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0558-0541"/> in mild and calm expression, while the best of
                    Bürger’s poems are full of stir and action. Johann Martin Miller (1750-1814)
                    became known chiefly as the author of the romance <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siegwart,</hi> a rather weak imitation of <hi rend="italic">Werther.</hi> Some
                    irreverent spirits ventured to laugh at its tedious pathos, but it was welcomed
                    by the majority of the middle class, who took especial delight in the songs it
                    includes. Christian, Count Stolberg, and his brother, Frederick Leopold, were
                    also members of the Göttingen school. Besides imitations of Greek plays, they
                    issued odes, ballads, and songs. Of the two the most powerful was Frederick
                    Leopold (1750-1819), in some of whose briefer pieces there is true feeling for
                    nature. He continually verges, however, on extravagance, and often takes the
                    fatal step from the sublime. A stronger writer was Johann Heinrich Voss
                    (1751-1826), author of a famous idyll, <hi rend="italic">Louise,</hi> which was
                    received by Schiller as a poem of first-rate importance, and suggested to Goethe
                    the idea of his <hi rend="italic">Hermann</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Dorothea.</hi> Its homeliness of style is perhaps more in keeping
                    with its simple and commonplace theme than the classic grace of Goethe’s verses.
                    Voss acquired a better title to fame by an admirable translation of Homer, which
                    did for the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> in Germany what Pope’s translation did
                    in England. Voss’s rendering is less polished than Pope’s, but incomparably more
                    faithful. Matthias Claudius (1740-1815), although not a member of the
                    “Hainbund,” is usually associated with it because of his general sympathy with
                    its tone. The <hi rend="italic">Waηdsl)ecker Bote</hi> (“Wandsbeck Messenger ”),
                    in which he brought together all his writings, contains much simple poetic
                    feeling, and some of his songs are still popular favourites.</p>
                <p>While these writers attached themselves to Klopstock, others showed traces of
                    Wieland’s influence. The most important of this class was Wilhelm Hei∏3e
                    (1749-1803), whose chief work was <hi rend="italic">Ardinghello,</hi> a prose
                    romance. He shares Wieland’s general theory of life, but, instead of expressing
                    it in the calm, ironical style of his master, he is vehement, tumultuous, and
                    enthusiastic. Amid his wild exaggerations he sometimes displays a remarkable
                    power of describing physical beauty. He was an ardent student of art, and was
                    the first German writer who succeeded in reproducing in glowing language the
                    impression produced upon him by pictures and music. Other imitators of Wieland
                    were Aloys Blumauer, who mistook vulgar burlesque for satire; Alxinger, whose
                    <hi rend="italic">Doolin von Mainz</hi> may be taken to represent a large class
                    of tiresome poems of chivalry; and Von Thümmel, who, with considerably more
                    ability than these writers, spoiled his good qualities by cynical grossness. An
                    indefinite number of mediaeval plays were written in imitation of Goethe’s <hi
                    rend="italic">C'otz,</hi> and robber romances in imitation of Schiller’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Räuber.</hi> Of the latter the earliest and most famous was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rinaldo Rinaldini</hi> of Vulpius. Jung Stilling (1740-1817)
                    continued the sentimental tone of <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> in a number of
                    curious autobiographic tales, which acquired extraordinary popularity, and threw
                    much light on the inner tendencies of the later pietists. Among imitators of
                    Schiller’s lyrical poetry the best were Matthison and Salis-Seewis; but they
                    were more successful in reproducing his moral feeling than in rivalling his high
                    art. For many years the stage was in the possession of Iffland (1759-1814) and
                    Kotzebue (1761-1819). The former, who was a distinguished actor, wrote dramas
                    chiefly of domestic interest. They are without genius, but had the merit of
                    almost displacing the foolish mediaeval plays of Goethe’s imitators. Kotzebue
                    was a most prolific writer; and although he had no imagination, and wrote merely
                    to catch the applause of the moment, his comedies still deserve to be named
                    among the few works of this class which have hitherto been produced in
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>A writer who exercised some influence over the youth of Goethe was Frederick
                    Jacobi (1743-1B19). He was the author of two romances, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alwill</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Woldemar,</hi> in both of which there is a
                    little of Werther’s sentimentalism, although their main purpose is didactic. He
                    also wrote a number of philosophical works. His main principle is that the
                    sources of religion and morality are to be found in intuition; and by a constant
                    reiteration of this doctrine he worked in opposition to Spinoza, to Kant, and to
                    Schelling. There are occasional gleams of philosophical genius in Jacobi, and he
                    is of some interest to English readers because of the attention Sir William
                    Hamilton appears to have devoted to his writings. An author of a very different
                    type, and of far greater eminence, was Jean Paul Richter, usually called Jean
                    Paul (1763-1825). It is difficult to do justice to Jean Paul, for he commits
                    almost every fault of which a writer of romance can be guilty; he is at
                    different times pedantic, extravagant, sentimental, and tedious. He prescribed
                    for himself no limits; everything that occurred to him at the moment of his
                    writing went down exactly as it suggested itself. Yet it is impossible even to
                    look into any of his innumerable books without recognizing his genius. The work
                    which has maintained the strongest hold over the nation is perhaps his charming
                    prose idyll, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Flegeljahre</hi> (“The
                    Years of Wild Oats”); but his great romance, <hi rend="italic">Titan,</hi> and
                    the less ambitious <hi rend="italic">Siebenkäs,</hi> or “Flower, Fruit, and
                    Thorn Pieces,” have also kept their place as works of permanent excellence. The
                    most admirable quality of Richter is his humour. No German writer plays with his
                    subject more delightfully, and he produces his most striking effects in dealing
                    with the simplest, most unpretending relations of life. He is usually very near
                    the sources of pathos when he smiles, and Jean Paul’s pathos, at its best, is
                    full of power, awakening the deepest feeling by its obvious sincerity. Sometimes
                    it is associated with lofty imagination, as in the famous dream in which he
                    describes a universe without religion. His feeling for the periodic changes of
                    season in nature is that of a poet in the highest sense, his descriptions of
                    spring being perhaps unsurpassed for their glowing yet tender beauty. To his
                    other excellences we must add the manly spirit which led him to scoff,
                    occasionally without due measure, at every kind of vulgarity and pretence, and
                    at the same time preserved in its original freshness bis sympathy with his
                    fellow-men and his passion for their enlightenment and progress.</p>
                <p>The most important literary movement which originated duringthe lifetime of
                    Goethe was that of the Romantic school, whose leading members at first attached
                    themselves to him, but gradually diverged more and more from his spirit. The
                    rise of the school was in some measure due to the philosophy of Fichte, whose
                    theory of the ego as the principle which freely creates its own world gave new
                    importance to the individual as opposed to law and convention. ’ Schelling still
                    more effectually prepared the way for the Romanticists by his poetic treatment
                    of the relations between the mind and nature; and several of his disciples,
                    especially Steffens, worked in the same direction by dwelling on the
                    possibilities of mystery in human life and in the external world. The aim of the
                    Romantic school was to assert for modern feeling the right of a freer, more
                    varied utterance than can be provided for it by the forms of classic literature.
                    They were not in sympathy with their own time; they found it tame, prosaic,
                    colourless; and to enrich it with new elements they went back to mediaevalism,
                    in which, as they conceived it, daily life had not been divorced from poetry.
                    They drew enthusiastic pictures of the Middle Ages, of the charms of chivalry,
                    of the loyalty of each class to the class above it and to society as a whole,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n559/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0559-0542"/> of the devout piety which was supposed to
                    regulate the conduct of prince and peasant alike, and which revealed itself in
                    splendid architecture aud a gorgeous ritual. With a like purpose the
                    Romanticists pointed to Oriental life, and began the serious study of Sanskrit
                    and Persian poetry. The chief writers whom they opposed to the classical poets
                    both of antiquity and of modern times were Shakespeare and Calderon; but they
                    also brought to light many mediaeval authors who had previously been neglected,
                    and. stimulated the Germans to a systematic study of the whole of their past
                    literature.</p>
                <p>The Romanticists did not strike out a wholly original path, for there were in the
                    writings of Lessing, Goethe, and Schiller—especially of Goethe—elements in full
                    harmony with all that was best in the new tendency. They were guilty of
                    grotesque exaggeration in their descriptions of the superior happiness of
                    mediaeval nations and Oriental peoples, aud they did much harm by checking the
                    rising appreciation of measure and order iu literary form which had been
                    encouraged by the great classical writers, In practical life, too, their labours
                    led to results opposed to the progressive tendencies of the age; for in the case
                    of many adherents of the Romantic school, enthusiasm for the Middle Ages soon
                    ceased to be a mere literary fancy,—they strove to reproduce obsolete mediaeval
                    ideas. Large numbers of them joined the Catholic Church, and became the most
                    vehement opponents of spiritual and political freedom. Still the Romanticists
                    gave prominence to certain vital principles. That we now feel the charm of what
                    was great and beautiful in the Middle Ages, is in part the result of their
                    teaching; and to some extent we owe to them the recognition of deeper elements
                    in the world than reason can formulate, and the conviction that the thought of
                    each age must create for itself a medium of expression adapted to its special
                    nature.</p>
                <p>The writer known as the prophet of the Romantic school was Frederick von
                    Hardenberg, generally called Novalis (1772-1801). In his unfinished romance, <hi
                    rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen,</hi> he revealed a mystical and
                    sensitive spirit, penetrated by religious aspiration, and feeling itself ill at
                    ease in the hard rough world. These qualities are still more pathetically
                    expressed in his poems, the best perhaps being those in which he directly utters
                    spiritual emotions. The critical leaders of the school were the brothers August
                    Wilhelm von Schlegel (1767-1845) and Friedrich von Schlegel (1772-1829). It is
                    to be feared that many English readers have derived their impression of the
                    former mainly from Heine’s malicious caricature. In reality, although destitute
                    of creative power, he was a man of great intellectual distinction. His
                    translations from Shakespeare are masterly, and his rendering of Calderon has
                    also genuine merit. He did much to promote the scientific study of Sanskrit, and
                    his lectures on dramatic art and literature, and on the theory and history of
                    plastic art, contain many fruitful suggestions. Friedrich von Schlegel, who <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> was a writer of greater depth and versatility than
                    his brother, caused much scandal by his romance, <hi rend="italic">Lucνnde,</hi>
                    in which the school appeared for the moment as a powerfully dissolving force in
                    regard to the most sacred of human relations. His most important work, however,
                    is his <hi rend="italic">History of Ancient and Modern Literature.</hi>
                    Throughout his exposition he is a propagandist of his special ideas; but the
                    book is of lasting importance as the earliest attempt to present a systematic
                    view of literary development as a whole. The period in which the brothers worked
                    most effectually for their school was between 1796 and 1800, when they lived in
                    Jena, and formed the centre of a brilliant circle which included Fichte,
                    Schelling, Tieck, and Wilhelm von Humboldt. Here they edited the <hi
                    rend="italic">Athenoeum,</hi> in which they chastised feeble and pretentious
                    writers, and awoke general interest in mediaeval art and literature, and in the
                    systems of philosophy that harmonized with their special tendency.</p>
                <p>The most productive, and for a time the most famous, writer of the Romantic
                    school was Ludwig Tieck (1773— 1853). Many of the smaller tales in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Phantasus</hi> have not yet lost their interest. They are, indeed,
                    as far as possible from representing the real life of mediaevalism, but they
                    have a mystic and fairy-like charm which is not the less powerful because it is
                    purely imaginative. In his later novels he took his themes from modern life, and
                    they display a remarkable talent for keen and searching satire. Most of them,
                    however, are already practically forgotten, for Tieck was unable to give form to
                    his ideas, and his imagination was wayward and eccentric. In his lyrical poetry
                    he seldom touches a true note, and his dramas have no high qualities to make up
                    for their utter and deliberate lack of plan. Yet his dramatic criticism, of
                    which he wrote a great deal in Dresden,—where he lived for many years, the
                    centre of an adoring body of disciples,— is often happy and suggestive; and his
                    completion of Schlegel’s translation of Shakespeare is poetic in feeling, and
                    indicates a rare mastery of language aud versification. A writer of less
                    importance, but who exercised considerable influence over Tieck at an early
                    period of his career, was W. H. Wackenroder (1772-98), whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phantasien über</hi><hi rend="italic">die Kunst</hi> (“Fancies concerning Art
                    ”) was published by Tieck after the writer’s early death. Both in this book and
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Overflowings from the Heart of an Art-loving Friar</hi>
                    he expresses a deep feeling for Christian, especially allegoric, art. He was
                    here in full sympathy with the whole Romantic school, which derived intense
                    delight from the spiritual art of the early mediaeval painters, but cared little
                    for the noble beauty of Greek art or of the art of the Renaissance.</p>
                <p>Among the authors who wrote in the spirit of the Romantic school, and who were
                    for a long time extremely popular, one of the chief was E. T. A. Hoffmann (1776-
                    1822). His treatment of ghostly and horrible themes is often very grotesque; but
                    he has flashes of vivid narrative which indicate a deep appreciation of some of
                    the more mysterious aspects of human nature. Clemens Brentano (1777-1842) was
                    one of the most ambitious of the Romanticists, and he had originality both of
                    thought and fancy; but he was too confused, too indifferent to form, to produce
                    more than a passing impression. Of far more enduring excellence than anything he
                    himself wrote was <hi rend="italic">Des Knaben Wunderhorn,</hi> a book of
                    popular lyrics which he collected with his brother-in-law, Achim von Arnim.
                    Arnim (1781-1831) revealed imagination and feeling in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kronenwächter</hi> (“' Guardians of the Crown ”); and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Countess Dolores</hi> gives evidence of great natural power. His works,
                    however, suffer the penalty which attaches to the total neglect of art. De La
                    Motte Fouqué (1777-1843) does not, in the majority of his writings, rise above
                    the level of his fellows; like them, he usually lacks clearness, precision, and
                    genuinely human interest. But in one little book, <hi rend="italic">Undine,</hi>
                    he achieved a masterpiece. This charming tale, with its sweetness, pathos, and
                    dream-like beauty, is now above criticism; it has taken its place as one of the
                    select clas≡ of creations which appeal to all the world, and do not depend for
                    their popularity on the tendencies of a particular time. Joseph von Eichendorff
                    (1788-1857) is an adherent of the Romantic school only in some of his tales; his
                    lyrics combine its depth of emotion with clear and musical expression, and his
                    best stories are written in a frank and attractive style. Adelbert von Chamisso
                    (1781-1838), although usually classed as to some extent a Romanticist, has none
                    of the dreaminess and mysticism of the school. He became a German both in
                    thought and feeling; but his <pb break="no"

                    of his French origin. He is now chiefly remembered by <hi rend="italic">Peter
                    Schlemihl,</hi> a tale of quaint and suggestive humour. The most distinguished
                    dramatist of the Romantic school was Heinrich von Kleist (1776-1811), whose
                    dramas were not represented till after his death, but have since then attracted
                    much attention. Some of his characters are conceived with great vigour, but in
                    his tragic motives he lacks invention, and all his works are more or less marred
                    by morbid sentimentalism. Allied to the Romantic school, although not directly
                    connected with it, were the writers of the so-called fate-tragedies. The
                    originator of this curious class of works was Werner (1768-1823). It would be
                    difficult to imagine a more trivial conception of fate than that which he
                    develops in his <hi rend="italic">Twenty-Fourth of February,</hi> which
                    represents a series of disasters as occurring at intervals on a particular day
                    in consequence of a father’s curse. The notion, however, struck the popular
                    fancy, and for ten years even Kotzebue could not contest the supremacy of the
                    fate-tragedians. The chief followers of Werner were Miillner and Houwald. Franz
                    Grillparzer (1791-1872) began his career with a play— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Ahnfrau</hi><hi rend="italic">(“</hi> The
                    Ancestress”)—in the style of these popular writers, but in his later tragedies
                    he strove to attain classic force and dignity; and by at least one play, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sappho,</hi> he achieved a place among the most distinguished
                    German dramatists.</p>
                <p>The whole life of Germany was to some extent influenced by the Romantic school.
                    In politics it was represented, among others, by Joseph Gorres, who agitated
                    with constantly growing enthusiasm for the revival of mediaevalism both in
                    church and state. In philosophy Franz Xaver von Baader followed a like tendency
                    by entering deeply into the spirit of Jacob Boehme’s mystical philosophy, and
                    interpreting its principles in accordance with Catholic doctrine. Frederick
                    Schleiermacher (1768-1834) was a thorough Protestant, and his services to
                    serious literature were incomparably higher than those of Baader. He was an
                    admirable dialectician, and did more than any other writer to promote in Germany
                    a sympathetic study of Plato. Yet there is a touch of Romanticism in the vague,
                    shadowy, and mystic language in which he presents the elements of Christian
                    thought and life. The love of the Romantic writers for previous epochs of German
                    history and literature led to the great researches of the brothers Grimm, who
                    founded the scientific study of the German language and of German antiquities.
                    They were followed by many devoted scholars, among whom may be named Beneke,
                    Lachmann, Moritz Haupt, and Franz Pfeiffer. The Oriental studies of the
                    Romanticists also promoted comparative philology, which acquired something of
                    the character it now bears through the labours of the illustrious scholars,
                    Wilhelm von Humboldt and Franz Bopp.</p>
                <p>During the calamitous period when Germany was beaten and humbled by Napoleon the
                    Romantic school, by continually recalling the past glories of the nation,
                    contributed largely to the revival of patriotic feeling. A like result was
                    achieved by Fichte, whose addresses to the German people, delivered in Berlin
                    while it was occupied by French soldiers, are models of fervid yet thoughtful
                    and dignified eloquence. In the war of liberation the popular excitement was
                    expressed with great spirit by Theodor Körner (1791-1813) and Ernst Moritz Arndt
                    (1769-1860). Of these two writers Arndt is the most poetic, but few even of his
                    lyrics have much literary value. To judge them fairly we must think ourselves
                    back into the epoch in which the nation spontaneously arose to avenge its wrongs
                    and assert its independence. It was as a writer of patriotic war-songs that
                    Frederick Rückert (1789-1866) opened his career. Afterwards he moved over a wide
                    range, distinguishing himself especially as a translator of Oriental poetry. He
                    was master of almost every form of lyrical expression, and had hardly less
                    facility in narrative and didactic verse. As regards the substance of his
                    poetry, he is perhaps chiefly remarkable for the tone of calm resignation which
                    he learned from his Eastern masters. In his preference for Oriental modes of
                    thought he has been followed in recent times by Daumer, Bodenstedt, and other
                    poets, who, however, chiefly aim at contrasting the ascetic ideals of
                    Christianity with a gayer, brighter scheme of life. The whole movement had its
                    origin, and was virtually exhausted, in Goethe’s <hi rend="italic">Westostlicher
                    Divan.</hi></p>
                <p>Had the hopes of German patriots been realized after the war of liberation,
                    literature might have profited by the growth of an intelligent national spirit.
                    But the reward of the German people for their immense sacrifices was bitter
                    opposition on the part of their Governments to every aspiration for freedom and
                    unity. Arndt himself, who had done so much to kindle patriotic ardour, was
                    dismissed in disgrace from his professorship at Bonn, which he did not regain
                    till 1840, when Frederick William IV. mounted the Prussian throne. And the
                    brothers Grimm with other scholars were ignominiously turned out of Gottingen.
                    The mass of the people lost interest in high thought and endeavour, and
                    nourished itself on weak poetry like the <hi rend="italic">Urania</hi> of
                    Tiedge, and detestable novels like those of Clauren. Yet even in poetry the
                    period was not destitute of important names. Ludwig Uhland (1787-1862), whose
                    first volume of poems appeared in 1815, ranks with the greatest of modern
                    lyrical writers. He is truly popular and patriotic in tone, yet his songs and
                    ballads have an ease and grace of style which raise him far above any of the
                    Romantic schotjl. Uhland was the founder of the so-called Swabian school of
                    poets, of whom the most cultivated was Gustav Schwab. Other Swabian poets were
                    Justinus Kerner, who attempted, not unsuccessfully, to combine pathos and
                    humour, and Eduard Mörike, whose poetry is generally of a melancholy tone,
                    relieved, however, by touches which indicate a fine sympathy with nature. The
                    theatre was dominated by Raupach (1784- 1852) and Freiherr von Auffenberg
                    (1798-1857), the former reigning in Berlin, the latter in Carlsruhe. Both had
                    talent and knowledge of the stage, but there is neither genius nor art in their
                    plays. Immermann (1796-1840), although not without poetic power, lacked the
                    faculty of controlling his dramatic conceptions. He was more successful in
                    romance—his <hi rend="italic">Epigonen,</hi> and still more his <hi
                    rend="italic">Münchhausen,</hi> displaying vivid fancy and a quaintly original
                    humour. Sir Walter Scott, who was deeply influenced by German literature, repaid
                    his obligations by influencing it in turn. One of the best of his imitators was
                    Wilhelm Hauff (1802-1827), who had the merit of nearly putting an end to
                    Clauren’s popularity by satirizing his style. Hauff ’ s chief work was <hi
                    rend="italic">Lichtenstein,</hi> which excited hopes that were too soon
                    extinguished by death. Wilhelm Häring, known as Wilibald Alexis (1798-1876),
                    also began as an imitator of Scott, but he afterwards wrote more original
                    historical romances, the scenes of which he laid in Brandenburg. Johanna
                    Schopenhauer, mother of the philosopher, was considered in her day an attractive
                    writer of romance, but she is now remembered only for the sake of her son. She
                    was surpassed in vigour of thought and style by Caroline Pichler (1769-1843),
                    who wrote several well-known historical novels.</p>
                <p>Throughout the whole of this period Germany maintained her eminence in classical
                    study, contributions of the highest importance to the knowledge of ancient life
                    being made by Wolf, Hermann, Boeckh, and Otfried Müller. In history she produced
                    several writers of distinction. Spittier (1752- 1810) was a worthy successor of
                    Justus Möser in the free and artistic treatment of historical subjects; in youth
                    he <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n561/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0561-0544"/> was kindly treated by Lessing, whose clear style
                    he appears to have taken as his model. Johannes von Müller (1752-1809), the
                    historian of Switzerland, used to be considered by the Germans an eloquent
                    writer, almost a prose poet, but he is now generally regarded as an affected
                    rhetorician. Raumer, in his chief work, <hi rend="italic">History of the</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hohenstaufen,</hi> gave forth the results of deep research in an
                    animated and vigorous narrative. Schlosser, author of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Eighteenth Century,</hi> was also an historian who combined
                    purity and strength of style with learning. Niebuhr, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Homan History,</hi> pushed his scepticism too far, but he profoundly modified
                    opinion in regard to the tests of historic credibility.</p>
                <p>VIII. <hi rend="italic">The Latest Period.—</hi> With the death of Goethe in 1832
                    began a new era in German literature, an era not yet closed. The period has been
                    one of intense political excitement. In 1848 the national aspiration for freedom
                    and unity found decisive expression in action; since that time Germany has
                    achieved unity by the sword, while she still slowly feels her way towards
                    freedom. It was inevitable that in such an epoch much of the best energy of the
                    nation should be devoted to politics, but there has also been great literary
                    activity—activity deeply influenced by the practical struggles, hopes, and fears
                    of the time.</p>
                <p>Philosophical speculation has been continued without interruption, and in many
                    respects it has been, and still is, the deepest current in the intellectual life
                    of Germany. From 1818 till his death in 1831, when he was a professor in Berlin,
                    Hegel dominated the highest thought. His vast system, in which he attempted to
                    explain the ultimate facts of the world and to bind by a chain of deductive
                    reasoning the elements of all knowledge, found enthusiastic adherents among the
                    more ambitious of the younger literary men, and for many years after his death
                    it determined the character of their work. Gradually, however, the school broke
                    up into three distinct divisions, the right, the centre, and the left. Of these
                    the most active were the members of the latter party, who interpreted Hegel’s
                    doctrine in a revolutionary sense. Arnold Ruge, one of the most brilliant
                    writers of the school, applied Hegelianism to politics, in which he associated
                    himself with the extreme radicals. David Friedrich Strauss, who also started as
                    a follower of Hegel, in his memorable <hi rend="italic">Leben Jesu</hi> resolved
                    the narratives of the Gospels into a series of myths, and found the vital
                    element of Christianity in its spiritual teaching. Feuerbach, going still
                    further, warred against all religion, urging that it should be replaced by a
                    sentiment of humanity. While the different sections of Hegelians opposed each
                    other, Schelling developed the later phases of his system; and thought was
                    turned into a new channel by Herbart, whose psychological work has been carried
                    on at a later time by Lotze. Krause also attracted attention by philosophical
                    ideas through which he aimed at solving the practical difficulties of modern
                    life. Ulrici and the younger Fichte have exercised considerable influence as the
                    advocates of a pantheistic doctrine by which they endeavour to reconcile
                    religion and science. None of these names, however, have the importance which
                    attaches to that of Arthur Schopenhauer, who, although his chief book was
                    written in the lifetime of Goethe, did not secure a hearing until long
                    afterwards. At the present time he stirs deeper interest than any other thinker.
                    German philosophers have, as a rule,been utterly indifferent to style, but
                    Schopenhauer’s prose is clear, firm, and graceful, and to this fact he owes much
                    of his popularity. He expressed bitter contempt for his philosophical
                    contemporaries, and, going back to Kant, claimed to have corrected and completed
                    his system. His main doctrine is that will is the fundamental principle of
                    existence; but his importance arises less from his abstract teaching than from
                    his descriptions of the misery of human life. History seemed to him but a record
                    of turmoil and wretchedness; and there is high literary genius as well as moral
                    earnestness in his graphic and scornful pictures of the darker aspects of the
                    world. Eduard von Hartmann, the latest original philosopher of Germany, works on
                    essentially the same lines, but seeks to reconcile Schopenhauer not only with
                    Hegel and Schelling but with Leibnitz.</p>
                <p>The growth of science has been one of the most powerful factors in the recent
                    intellectual development of Germany, and some of the best books of the period
                    have been works presenting in a popular form the results of scientific labour.
                    Among these the first place still belongs to the <hi rend="italic">Cosmos</hi>
                    of Alexander von Humboldt. Its fundamental conceptions are no longer in full
                    accordance with the best thought; but it is made enduringly impressive by the
                    writer’s power of handling vast masses of facts, by his poetic feeling for the
                    beauty and the order of nature, and by the purity and nobility of his style.
                    Some of the greatest men of science, such as Liebig, Virchow, and Helmholtz,
                    have also made admirable attempts to render their subjects intelligible and
                    interesting to ordinary readers. Büchner and Vogt have considerable merit as
                    popular scientific authors, but their writings are marred by a polemical
                    tendency, which induces them to dogmatize on metaphysical questions beyond their
                    proper range.</p>
                <p>In historical literature Germany has recently produced many eminent writers. The
                    historian who enjoys the widest popularity is Leopold Ranke, who has instructed
                    two generations by communicating in an agreeable style the results of extensive
                    research in many different fields of inquiry. Gervinus acquired a permanent
                    place as an historian by his excellent <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    Nineteenth Century.</hi> Works of high value have also proceeded from
                    Giesebrecht, who has written on the Holy Roman Empire with enthusiastic
                    appreciation of the great emperors; from Droysen, the diligent historian of
                    Prussia; from Dahlmann, whose labours included German, English, French, and
                    Danish history; from Häusser, whose masterpiece is an elaborate history of
                    Germany since the death of Frederick the Great; from Waitz, the chief authority
                    on the growth of the German constitution; from Sybel, by whose researches much
                    new light has been thrown on the French Revolution; from Mommsen, the vigorous
                    historian of ancient Rome; and from Curtius, whose history of Greece is not more
                    remarkable for its learning than for the clear and attractive arrangement of its
                    materials. Of late years much attention has been devoted to “Culturgeschichte,”
                    which describes the life of a people in all its phases, either through the whole
                    past or during a particular epoch. A favourable example of works of this class
                    is Karl Biedermann’s <hi rend="italic">Germany in the Eighteenth
                    Century.</hi></p>
                <p>Recent German literature is extraordinarily rich in histories of the individual
                    elements of intellectual development. In its histories of philosophy it is
                    absolutely supreme. Hegel still ranks as one of the greatest historians of
                    philosophy, although the value of his expositions is lowered by a tendency to
                    find his own doctrine in preceding thinkers. Erdmann, Schwegler, and Ueberweg
                    were among the most important workers in the same department; and with them may
                    be named Kuno Fischer, who writes the history of philosophy with a striking
                    power of sympathetic appreciation and in a fascinating literary style. Less
                    attractive in manner than Fischer, Lange, in his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Materialism,</hi> did full justice for the first time to the different phases of
                    materialistic philosophy, and is especially happy in the skill with which he
                    traces the growth of a recognition of law in the phenomena of nature. Since
                    Lessing, aesthetics have always formed a prominent branch of philosophy among
                    the Germans; and they have hardly <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0562-0545"/> been less successful as historians of art than as
                    historians of metaphysics. High distinction has been achieved, among other art
                    historians, by Kugler, Vischer, Carrière, and Lübke. Of historians of
                    literature, especially German literature, there is almost a small army. One of
                    the earliest of these was Gervinus, who, although his critical canons are not
                    now in favour, had an unusual faculty for grouping his materials and sharply
                    defining what seemed to him the essential qualities of particular writers and
                    movements. The history of German literature by Vilmar, although written in an
                    eloquent style, is too partial in its judgments to have permanent value.
                    Koberstein is remarkable rather for industry than for insight; but the literary
                    histories of Julian Schmidt and Gυttschall are both marked by decisive, often
                    penetrating, critical judgment. One of the best works of this kind for style,
                    thought, and research is Hettner’s elaborate <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Literature in the Eighteenth Century.</hi></p>
                <p>The Germans possess a vast mass of biographical literature, a large proportion of
                    which is rendered almost worthless by inartistic treatment. Luther alone forms
                    the subject of more than one hundred and fifty biographies; yet a satisfactory
                    study of the Reformer has still to be written. In recenttimes, however, there
                    has been amarked improvement, several biographers having conscientiously striven
                    not only to be thorough in research but to write simply, clearly, and vividly.
                    The first to set a good example was Varnhagen von Ense, whose numerous
                    biographies are masterpieces of well ordered and dignified prose. Germany owes
                    an admirable biography of Ulrich von Hutten to Strauss, who also wrote
                    interesting sketches of several prominent modern authors. Other biographies
                    which deserve mention are Karl Grün’s philosophical study of Feuerbach,
                    Rosenkranz’s scholar-like life of Diderot, and Justi’s life of Winckelmann. The
                    popularity of Mr Lewes’s life of Goethe for a long time deterred German writers
                    from touching a subject he had handled with so much talent; but of late there
                    has been a remarkable revival of interest in Goethe, and Hermann Grimm has
                    ventured to present a fresh study of his intellectual and moral character.</p>
                <p>In imaginative literature the greatest writer of the latest period is Heinrich
                    Heine. No German writer since Goethe and Schiller has excited so much interest
                    throughout Europe, and among the Germans themselves his fame is steadily rising.
                    He professed to care little for what men said of his poetry, yet it is mainly as
                    a lyrical poet that his name lives. His <hi rend="italic">Buch der Lieder</hi>
                    is one of the most fascinating collections of lyrics in European literature.
                    Although a deadly enemy of the Romantic school, he had moods, especially in
                    youth, in which he shared its dreaminess and mysticism; and these qualities he
                    expressed in some of his best songs, but with perfect grace of style and melody.
                    He struck with equally finished art chords of passion and aspiration beyond the
                    range of even the chief Romanticists, for Heine was in every respect a modern
                    man, penetrated by a love of freedom, and by a high enthusiasm for beauty.
                    Except Goethe, no other German poet achieves his effects by such simple means;
                    with the language of a village maiden he gives shape to feelings and ideas of
                    exquisite refinement and subtlety. His satirical poems are sometimes gross and
                    cynical; but none of them are without touches of humour. In his pro≡e, which
                    deals with a wide range of subjects, he is rather French than German in his love
                    of sparkling epigram and biting wit Almost every theme, however sacred, gives
                    Heine occasion for mockery, but in the midst of cruel laughter he is often
                    restrained by a pathetic memory, which he expresses with unsurpassed delicacy.
                    This combination of pathos, wit, and humour giveshim a unique place in the
                    literature of his country.</p>
                <p>Platen, who belongs rather to the previous period, was one of the many writers
                    whom Heine bitterly attacked, but he was a poet of considerable power. Like
                    Heine himself, he failed in the drama; and even in his successful writings he is
                    not remarkable for wealth of thought or depth of feeling. His odes and sonnets,
                    however, are in language and metre so artistically finished as to rank among the
                    best classical poems of modern times. Börne was another writer whose fame,
                    although the two men were at one time warm friends, suffered from Heine’s
                    satire. He was a manly literary critic, and as a political writer dealt at the
                    despotic Governments of Germany blows which they keenly felt.</p>
                <p>A school of writers known as Young Germany was deeply influenced by Heine, and
                    had the good fortune to be singled out for persecution by the confederate diet.
                    Their object was to effect a complete revolution in the political and social
                    institutions of Germany, and at the same time they became the propagandists of
                    ideas intended to undermine the church. The most important member of the school
                    was Karl Gutzkow, who wrote a number of dramas which maintain their hold of the
                    stage. He was also the author of many romances, of which the chief were <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Ritter vom Geiste</hi> (“The Knights of
                    the Mind”) and <hi rend="italic">Der Zauberer</hi><hi rend="italic">von
                    Roni</hi> (“The Magician of Rome”). These works are of enormous length, and
                    their polemical tendency has already begun to weaken their interest. But the
                    leading characters are genuine creations, and the incidents are interwoven with
                    great artistic skill. Heinrich Laube, another member of the group, is the author
                    of an historical romance, <hi rend="italic">The German War,</hi> which
                    represents, in a clear, fresh, and vivid style, the condition of Germany during
                    the Thirty Years’ War. He has also enriched the stage with several excellent
                    plays. Less important authors associated with these writers were Gustav Kühne,
                    Theodor Mundt, and Ludolf Wienbarg—the latter universally recognized as a keen
                    and vigorous critic.</p>
                <p>The novel has acquired the same important place in Germany as in France and
                    England, and it need scarcely be said that the vast majority of works of this
                    class are forgotten almost as soon as they are issued. One of the most
                    distinguished of recent novelists is Gustav Frey tag, whose chief work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Soll und Haben</hi> (“Debit and Credit”), is a study of commercial
                    life intensely realistic in tendency. Lately he has undertaken a series of
                    romances, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Ahnen</hi> (“The
                    Forefathers”), intended to represent in a highly poetic form the different
                    epochs of German history. Important historical romances have been written by
                    Levin Schücking, who is remarkable for his power of vividly conceiving
                    character. The Countess Ida Hahn-Hahn is the writer of a number of novels in an
                    artificial style, affecting to represent good society. Her manner has been
                    cleverly satirized by Fanny Lewaid, who is one of the best German novelists,
                    keen and true in observation of life, and artistic in method. Paul Heyse’s short
                    tales have firmness of outline, and are at the same time full of delicate grace;
                    as a writer of elaborate romance, he has also achieved success. The humour of
                    Hackländer is generally considered to surpass that of any other recent writer;
                    and among the novelists of simple village life Auerbach easily takes the first
                    place. Frederick Spielhagen has penetrated deeply into the spirit of the age,
                    and in <hi rend="italic">Problematische</hi><hi rend="italic">Haturen</hi>
                    (“Problematic Natures”) and other works reveals its tendencies with cultivated
                    imaginative force. The novels of Fritz Reuter, although written in Platt
                    Deutsch, take high rank; they are fresh in style, and combine keen observation
                    of life with a fine appreciation of comic effect.</p>
                <p>Contemporary literature has not, as in England, been divorced from the stage; the
                    best imaginative writers find scope for their energies in work for the theatre.
                    Besides Gutzkow and Laube, Gottschall has been a fertile writer <pb break="no"

                    Prutz, are original dramatic authors. The dramas of Christian Grabbe, full of
                    eccentricity, but with a certain wild power, originated a movement resembling to
                    some extent that of the “Sturm und Drang” poets. Its chief representative was
                    Hebbel, a writer endowed with imaginative gifts, but who marred every play by
                    affectation and extravagance. Freiherr von Münch-Bellinghausen, known as
                    Friedrich Halm, author of <hi rend="italic">Der Fechter</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >von Pavenna</hi> (“The Gladiator of Ravenna”), and Mosenthal, author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Deborah,</hi> achieved distinction by aiming at something higher
                    than mere stage effect. Paul Lindau is the author of some refined comedies, and
                    Adolf Wilbrandt has written both comedies and tragedies which meet the taste of
                    Vienna. Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer and Roderich Benedix were prolific writers of
                    plays with the sort of merit that belongs to an intimate knowledge of the
                    technical necessities of the stage.</p>
                <p>Many recent writers have attempted lyrical and narrative poetry, some of them
                    with sufficient power to maintain worthily the traditions of German literature.
                    From about 1830 onwards, a group of Austrian poets, more or less political in
                    tendency, commanded the respect of all Germans. The chief was Count von
                    Auersperg, who assumed the name of Anastasius Grün. His first important work was
                    <hi rend="italic">Walks of a Vienna Poet,</hi> published in 1831, but his fame
                    rests chiefly on two volumes of lyrics issued some years later. He had
                    enthusiastic faith in the future, and expresses his hopes in verses full of
                    colour, sometimes brilliant and effective. Another Austrian writer, Nicholas
                    Strehlenau, generally called Lenau, gives powerful utterance in several poems to
                    the sorrows of a deeply melancholy nature. Meissner and Hartmann, Bohemian
                    poets, have a considerable reputation, the latter as a writer of great artistic
                    merit, the former as a poet of vivid imagination and free sympathies. Leopold
                    Schefer was for a long time a popular poet, and the genial optimism of his chief
                    book, the <hi rend="italic">Laienbrevier,</hi> is interesting because of the
                    contrast it presents to the pessimist tone of more recent writers. Before the
                    revolutionary movements of 1848 a number of writers attempted to force poetry
                    into the service of freedom. Of these one of the best known is Herwegh. He
                    advocated liberty with a vehemence that won for him immense popularity, but the
                    interest of his writings is rather historical than literary. Ferdinand
                    Freiligrath was of a more truly poetic temperament. His poems, although without
                    delicacy, have graphic force, and in his earlier writings he displayed a
                    remarkable talent for reproducing the gorgeous colours of tropical landscape.
                    Other poets who have made verse a means of awakening in the popular mind a
                    passion for political justice are Hoffmann von Fallersleben, who has a
                    considerable command of musical expression, and Franz Dingelstedt, a versatile
                    writer who has done good work as a novelist and dramatist. Gottschall, already
                    named as a dramatist and an historian of literature, began as a political poet,
                    but afterwards gave evidence of disinterested imagination in two narrative
                    poems, <hi rend="italic">Göttin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zeno.</hi> The lyrics
                    of Emmanuel Geibel, some of which are also political, with a conservative
                    tendency, have found favour with nearly all classes; they reveal a gentle and
                    refined spirit, and are written with something of Uhland’s grace. Among the most
                    distinguished contemporary writers iβ Robert Hamerling, whose poetry is
                    remarkable for the boldness of its conceptions and its almost vehement
                    passion.</p>
                <p>Since the middle of the 18th century Germany has never been without writers of
                    deep thought and vast research; and in her supreme writers — in Lessing, Goethe,
                    Schiller, and Heine—these qualities have been associated with a feeling for
                    artistic finish which has not been surpassed in England or even in France. But
                    the tendency of German authors beneath the highest rank has been to neglect the
                    laws of expression. Thus there is in Germany an extraordinary quantity of
                    literature which, although the result of great labour, and full of ideas, makes
                    intolerable demands on the patience of readers. The lack of measure and
                    precision has in many cases deprived of nearly all value powers of imagination,
                    reason, and industry, which would have made the literary fortune of a Frenchman.
                    This deficiency of style is in some degree explained by the fact that an undue
                    proportion of German literature has hitherto been addressed, not to the public,
                    but to specialists, who naturally concern themselves more with substance than
                    with form. During the present generation there have been symptoms of a
                    remarkable change. Ever since the Germans began to feel that they are one
                    people, arid to strive after political unity, an increasing number of scholars
                    and thinkers have displayed an ambition to extend their influence, while several
                    imaginative writers have consciously appealed to the nation as a whole. The
                    inevitable result has been that they have aimed at more methodical arrangement
                    than their predecessors, and have cultivated greater force, simplicity, and
                    directness of speech. Nothing has fostered this wholesome tendency so much as
                    the growing respect of the nation for the great masters of its language, a
                    respect indicated by the new editions of their writings which appear year after
                    year. The higher class of poets, dramatists, and novelists have also profited by
                    the deepening conviction that the function of art is not to battle with
                    practical evils, but to create a world of ideal beauty in which the mind may
                    find refuge from the perplexities of real life.</p>
