                <p><label type="entry">GIUSTINIANI</label>, the name of a prominent Italian family
                    which originally belonged to Venice, but established itself subsequently in
                    Genoa also, and at various times had representatives in Naples, Corsica, and
                    several of the islands of the Archipelago.</p>
                <p>In the Venetian line the following are most worthy of mention. I. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lorenzo</hi> (1380-1465), the Laurentius Justinianus of the
                    Roman calendar, at an early age entered the congregation of the canons of Saint
                    George in Alga, and in 1433 became general of that order. About the same time he
                    was made by Eugenius IV. bishop of Venice; and his episcopate was marked by
                    considerable activity in church extension and reform. On the removal of the
                    patriarchate from Grado to Venice by Nicholas V. in 1451, Giustiniani was
                    promoted to that dignity, which he held for fourteen years. He died on January
                    8, 1465, was canonized by Pope Alexander VI II., his festival (semi-duplex)
                    being fixed by Innocent XII. for September 5th, the anniversary of his elevation
                    to the bishopric. His works, consisting of sermons, letters, and ascetic
                    treatises, have been frequently reprinted,—the best edition being that of the
                    Benedictine P. N. A. Giustiniani, published at Venice in 2 vols, folio, 1751.
                    They are wholly devoid of literary merit. His life has been written by Bernard
                    Giustiniani, by Maffei, and also by the Bollandists. (2.) <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Leonardo</hi> (1388-1446), brother of the preceding, was for some years a
                    senator of Venice, and in 1443 was chosen procurator of St Mark. He translated
                    into Italian Plutarch’s <hi rend="italic">Lives of Cinna and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lucullus,</hi> and was the author of some poetical pieces, amatory
                    and religious, as well as of rhetorical prose compositions. (3. ) <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Bernardo</hi> (1408-1489), son of Leonardo, was a pupil of
                    Guarino and of George of Trebizond, and <pb break="no"

                    served on several important diplomatic missions both to France and Rome, and
                    about 1485 became one of the council of ten. His orations and letters were
                    published in 1492; but his title to any measure of fame he possesses rests upon
                    his history of Venice, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine
                    Urbis</hi><hi rend="italic">Venetiarum</hi><hi rend="italic">rebusque ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ipsa</hi><hi rend="italic">gestis historia</hi> (1492), which was
                    translated into Italian by Domenichi in 1545, and which at the time of its
                    appearance was undoubtedly the best work upon the subject of which it treated.
                    It is to be found in vol. i. of the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi> of
                    Graevius. (4.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Pietro,</hi> also a senator, lived in the
                    16th century, and wrote an <hi rend="italic">Historia rerum Venetarum</hi> in
                    continuation of that of Bernardo. He was also the author of chronicles <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Gestis</hi><hi rend="italic">Petri
                    Hocenigi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De Bello</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Venetorum,</hi><hi rend="italic">cum Caτοlο VIII.</hi> The latter has been
                    reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">Script. Per. Ital.,</hi> vol. xxi.</p>
                <p>Of the Genoese branch of the family the most prominent members were the
                    following. (1.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Paolo, di Moniglia</hi> (1444-1502), a
                    member of the order of Dominicans, was, from a comparatively early age, prior of
                    their convent at G enoa. As a preacher he was very successful, and his talents
                    were fully recognized by successive popes, by whom he was made master of the
                    sacred palace, inquisitor-general for all the Genoese dominions, and ultimately
                    bishop of Scio and Hungarian legate. He was the author of a number of Biblical
                    commentaries (no longer extant), which are said to have been characterized by
                    great erudition. (2.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Agostino</hi> (1470-1536), was born
                    at Genoa, and spent some wild years in Valencia, Spain. Having in 1487 joined
                    the Dominican order, he gave himself with great energy to the study of Greek,
                    Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabic, and in 1514 commenced the preparation of a polyglot
                    edition of the Bible. As bishop of Nebbio in Corsica, he took part in some of
                    the earlier sittings of the Lateran council (1516- 17), but, in consequence of
                    party complications, withdrew to his diocese, and ultimately to France, where he
                    became a pensioner of Francis I., and was the first to occupy a chair of Hebrew
                    and Arabic in the university of Paris. After an absence from Corsica for a
                    period of five years, during which he visited England and the Low Countries, and
                    became acquainted with Erasmus and More, he returned to Nebbio about 1522, and
                    there remained, with comparatively little intermission, till in 1536, when,
                    while returning from a visit to Genoa, he perished in a storm at sea. He was the
                    possessor of a very fine library, which he bequeathed to the republic of Genoa.
                    Of his projected polyglot only the Psalter was published <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Psalterium Hebroeum, Groecum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Arabicum,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Chaldaicum,</hi> Genoa, 1616). Besides
                    the Hebrew text, the LXX. translation, the Chaldee paraphrase, and an Arabic
                    version, it contains the Vulgate translation, a new Latin translation by the
                    editor, a Latin translation of the Chaldee, and a collection of scholia.
                    Giustiniani printed 2000 copies at his own expense, including fifty in vellum
                    for presentation to the sovereigns of Europe and Asia; but the sale of the work
                    did not encourage him to proceed with the New Testament, which he had also
                    prepared for the press. Besides an edition of the book of Job, containing the
                    original text, the Vulgate, and a new translation, he published a Latin version
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Moreh Nevochim</hi> of Maimonides <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Director</hi><hi rend="italic">Dubitantium aut Perplexorum,</hi> 1520), and
                    also edited in Latin the <hi rend="italic">Aureus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Libellus</hi> of Aeneas Platonicus, and the <hi rend="italic">Timoeus</hi> of
                    Chalcidius. His annals of Genoa <hi rend="italic">(Castigatissimi annali</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">di Genova)</hi> were published posthumously in 1537.</p>
                <p>The name Giustiniani has also been borne by the following <hi rend="superscript"
                    >:</hi> —(l∙) <hi rend="smallcaps">Pompeio</hi> (1569-1616), a native of
                    Corsica, who served under Alessandro Farnese and the marquis of Spinola in the
                    Low Countries, where he lost an arm, and, from the artificial substitute which
                    he wore, came to be known by the soubriquet Bras de Fer. He also defended Crete
                    against the Turks; and subsequently was killed in a reconnaissance at Friuli. He
                    left in Italian a personal narrative of the war in Flanders, which has been
                    repeatedly published in a Latin translation <hi rend="italic">(Bellum
                    Belgicum,</hi> Antwerp, 1609). (2.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Giov</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">anni</hi> (1513-1556), born in Candia, translator of Terence’s

                    <hi rend="italic">In</hi><hi rend="italic">Verrem,</hi> and of Virgil’s <hi

                    (1538-1603), Venetian senator, translator of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oedipus</hi><hi rend="italic">Tyrannus</hi> of Sophocles, and author of a
                    collection of <hi rend="italic">Rime,</hi> in imitation of Petrarch. He is
                    regarded as one of the latest representatives of the classic Italian school.
                    (4.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Geronimo,</hi> a Genoese, flourished during the latter
                    half of the 16th century. He translated the <hi rend="italic">Alcestis</hi> of
                    Euripides and three of the plays of Sophocles; and wrote two original tragedies,
                    <hi rend="italic">Jephte</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Christo in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Passione.</hi> (5.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Vincenzo,</hi> who in the
                    beginning of the 17th century built the Roman palace and made the art-collection
                    which are still associated with his name (see <hi rend="italic">Galleria
                    Giustiniana,</hi> Rome, 1631). The collection was removed in 1807 to Paris,
                    where it was to some extent broken up. In 1815 all that remained of it, about
                    170 pictures, was purchased by the king of Prussia and removed to Berlin, where
                    it forms a portion of the royal museum.</p>
