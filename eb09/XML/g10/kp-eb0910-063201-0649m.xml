                    equalling or exceeding the tube in length. About ninety species are described,
                    of which number upwards of fifty are from the Cape, and the rest from tropical
                    Africa, the central and southern regions of Europe, Persia, the Caucasus, and
                    the Levant. One species, <hi rend="italic">G. illyricus,</hi> is found
                    apparently wild in England, in the New Forest, Hampshire. Some of the species
                    have been cultivated for a long period in our flower-gardens, where both the
                    introduced species and the modern varieties bred from them are very ornamental
                    and popular. <hi rend="italic">G. segetum</hi> has been cultivated since 1596,
                    and <hi rend="italic">G. byzantinus</hi> since 1629, while many additional
                    species were introduced during the latter half of the 18th century. One of the
                    earlier of the hybrids originated in gardens was the beautiful <hi rend="italic"
                    >G. Colvillii,</hi> raised in the nursery of Mr Colvill of Chelsea in 1823 from
                    <hi rend="italic">G. concolor</hi> fertilized by <hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cardinalis.</hi> In the first decade of the century, however, the
                    Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert had successfully crossed the showy <hi rend="italic">G.
                    cardinalis</hi> with the smaller but more free-flowering <hi rend="italic">G.
                    blαndus,</hi> and the result was the production of a race of great beauty and
                    fertility. Other crosses were made with <hi rend="italic">G. tristis,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">G.</hi><hi rend="italic">οppositiflorus,</hi><hi rend="italic">G.
                    hirsutus, G. alatus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >natalensis;</hi> but it was not till after the production of <hi rend="italic"
                    >G. gandavensis</hi> about 1843, by the crossing of <hi rend="italic">G.
                    natalensis</hi> with <hi rend="italic">G. oppositiβorus</hi> (sometimes
                    erroneously attributed to <hi rend="italic">natalensis</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">cαrdinalis</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">),</hi> that the gladiolus may be said to have become a general
                    favourite in gardens. Since that time the varieties have been greatly multiplied
                    in number, and improved in size and quality, as well as marvellously varied in
                    colour and marking, so that they have now become exceedingly popular. A few
                    years since large numbers of novel varieties were annually introduced by the
                    French florists, but the English-raised varieties are now in great measure
                    superseding them. One cultivator, Mr Kelway of Langport, devotes a space of not
                    less than 8 acres to gladioli, and cultivates annually from 10,000 to 60,000
                    each of some of the more popular kinds, while seedlings are raised to the extent
                    of half a million a year. The seeds are sown in the open ground about April,
                    glass culture with so large a number being out of the question; and in the first
                    season the young plants make bulbs averaging the size of peas. The time occupied
                    from the sowing of the seed until the plant attains its full strength is from
                    three to four years. The approved sorts, which are identified by name, are
                    multiplied by means of bulblets or offsets which form around the principal bulb
                    or corm; but in this they vary greatly, some kinds furnishing abundant increase
                    and soon becoming plentiful, while others persistently refuse to yield offsets.
                    The stately habit and rich glowing colours of the modern gladioli render them
                    exceedingly valuable as decorative plants during the late summer months. They
                    are, moreover, very desirable and useful flowers for cutting for the purpose of
                    room decoration, for while the blossoms themselves last fresh for some days, the
                    undeveloped buds open in succession, if the stalks are kept in water, so that a
                    cut spike will go on blooming for a considerable period.</p>
