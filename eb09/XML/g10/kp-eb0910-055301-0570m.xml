                    1786. From the gymnasium of his native town he passed in 1803 as a student of
                    philosophy and theology to the university of Helmstadt, where Henke was his most
                    influential teacher; but the latter part of his undergraduate course was taken
                    at Gottingen, where Eichhorn and T. C. Tychsen were then at the height of their
                    popularity. In 1806, shortly after graduation, he became “repetent” and
                    “privat-docent” in that university; and, as he was fond of afterwards relating,
                    had Neander for his first pupil in Hebrew. In 1809, on the recommendation of
                    Johann von Müller, he was appointed to a mastership in the gymnasium of
                    Heiligenstadt, Westphalia, whence, in the following year, he was transferred to
                    the university of Halle, where, from being professor extraordinarius in
                    theology, lie was in a very short time promoted to an ordinary chair (1811).
                    Many offers were subsequently made to him of high preferment elsewhere, but he
                    clung to Halle for the remainder of his life, and taught with great <pb

                    interruptions indeed being that of 1813-14, occasioned by the war of liberation,
                    during which the university was closed, and those occasioned by two prolonged
                    literary tours, first in 1820 to France and England in the society of his
                    colleague Thilo for the examination of rare Oriental manuscripts, and afterwards
                    in 1835 to England and Hollaud in connexion with his Phoenician studies. At a
                    very early period he became the most popular teacher of Hebrew and of Old
                    Testament introduction and exegesis in Germany; and during his later years the
                    annual number of students attending his lectures on these and kindred subjects,
                    such as church history and Biblical archaeology, amounted to nearly 500. Of his
                    pupils many have risen to great eminence in the departments he specially
                    cultivated; among these the names of Von Bohlen, Hoffmann, Hupfeld, Rödiger,
                    Tuch, Vatke, and Benfey may be mentioned. In 1827 Gesenius was made a
                    consistorialrath; but, unless account be taken of the violent attacks to which
                    he, along with his friend and colleague Wegscheider, was in 1830 subjected by
                    Hengstenberg and his party in the <hi rend="italic">Evangelische
                    Kirchenzeitung,</hi> there are few noteworthy occurrences to be recorded in his
                    biography. His death took place at Halle, October 23, 1842. It would be
                    difficult to overestimate the services rendered by Gesenius to Semitic
                    philology. To him belongs in a large measure the credit of having freed it from
                    the trammels of theological and religious prepossession by which it had
                    previously been hampered, and of inaugurating the strictly scientific method
                    which has since been so fruitful in valuable results. Nor can it be doubted that
                    as au exegete he has exercised a powerful, and on the whole a beneficial,
                    influence on the tendencies of modern theological investigation.</p>
                <p>Of his very numerous works the earliest, published, in 1810, entitled Versuch
                    uber die Maltesische Sprache, was a successful refutation of the widely current
                    opinion that the modem Maltese was of Punic origin. In the same year appeared
                    the first volume of the Hebräisches u. Ghaldäisches Handwörteriruch, completed
                    in 1812 (8th ed., 1878; English translation by Tregelles, 1846-52). The
                    Hebräische Grammatik, published in 1813 (22d ed., by Kautzsch, 1878), was
                    followed in 1815 by the Geschichte der Hebräischen Sprache (now very rare), and
                    in 1817 by the Ausführliches Lehrgebäude der Hebräischen Sprache. The first
                    volume of his well-known commentary on Isaiah {Der Prophet Jcsajd), with a
                    translation, appeared in 1821; but the work was not completed until 1829. The
                    Thesaurus philologico-criticus Lingua Hebraicae et Chaldaicoe V. T., begun in
                    1829, he did not live to complete; the latter part of the third volume is edited
                    by Rödiger (1858). The other works of Gesenius are De Pentateuchi Samaritani
                    Origine, Indole, et Auctoritate (1815), supplemented in 1822 and 1824 by the
                    treatise De Samaritanorum theologia, and by an edition of Carmina Samaritana;
                    PaläographiscJie Studien uber Phönizische u. Punischc Schrift (1835), a
                    pioneering work which he followed up in 1837 by his collection of Phoenician
                    monuments {Scripturee lingueeque Phoeniciae monumenta guotguot supersunt'); an
                    Aramaic lexicon (1834-39); and a treatise on the Himyaritic language written in
                    conjunction with Rödiger in 1841. Gesenius also contributed extensively to Erseh
                    and Graber’s Encyclopädie, and enriched the German translation of Burckhardt <hi

                    geographical notes. For many years he also edited the Halle Allgemeine
                    Litcraturzcitung. A well executed sketch of his life was published in 1843
