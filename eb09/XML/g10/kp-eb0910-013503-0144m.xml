                <p><label type="entry">GELSEMIUM</label>, a drug, consisting of the root of <hi
                    rend="italic">Gelsemium</hi> (or as sometimes less correctly called <hi
                    rend="italic">Gelseminum) sempervirens,</hi> a climbing shrub of the natural
                    order <hi rend="italic">Loganiaceoe,</hi> having a milky juice, opposite,
                    lanceolate shining leaves, and axillary clusters of from one to five large,
                    funnel-shaped, very fragrant yellow flowers, whose perfume has been compared to
                    that of the wallflower. The fruit is composed of two separable jointed
                    follicles, containing numerous flat-winged seeds. The stem often runs
                    underground for a considerable distance, and indiscriminately with the root it
                    is used in medicine. The plant is a native of the United States, growing on rich
                    clay soil by the side of streams near the coast, from Virginia to the south of
                    Florida. In the United States it is commonly known as the wild, yellow, or
                    Carolina jessamine, although in no way related to the true jessamines, which
                    belong to the <hi rend="italic">Oleaceoe.</hi> It was first described in 1640 by
                    John Parkinson, who grew it in his garden from seed sent by Tradescant from
                    Virginia; at the present time it is but rarely seen, even in botanical gardens,
                    in Great Britain.</p>
                <p>The root, on analysis by Kollock in 1855, was found to contain an alkaloid (now
                    called <hi rend="italic">Gelsemine</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gelsemia),</hi> a
                    dry acrid resin, ∣ per cent, of a volatile oil heavier than water, fatty resin,
                    fixed oil, yellow colouring matter, gallic acid, starch, albumen, gum, pectic
                    acid, extractive matter, lignin, and 3 ’ 17 per cent, of mineral matter,
                    consisting chiefly of salts of potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, and silica.
                    The leaves and flowers were found to contain the same ingredients in less
                    quantity. Eberle, who examined the root in 1869, states that the central woody
                    portion of the root does not contain any alkaloid, and that therefore the bark
                    is the physiologically active portion. In addition to the above, Wormley, in
                    1870, discovered in the root a crystalline substance named by him gelseminic
                    acid, whose solution in alkalies exhibits a powerful blue fluorescence. It has,
                    however, since been shown by Sonnenschein to be identical with aesculin, a
                    crystalline glucoside found in the bark of the horse chesnut, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aesculus</hi><hi rend="italic">Hippocastanum.</hi> The active properties of
                    gelsemium root have been proved by Wormley and Bartholow to depend upon the
                    alkaloid <hi rend="italic">gelsemine</hi> (C <hi rend="subscript"> 11</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 19</hi> NO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), which in the pure
                    state is a colourless, odourless solid, not yet obtained in a crystalline form,
                    readily soluble in ether and chloroform, less so in alcohol, and very sparingly
                    in water, except in the presence of hydrochloric acid, and having an intensely
                    persistent bitter taste, perceptible in a solution containing only <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ^⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th part of it by
                    weight.</p>
                <p>The readiest and best test for gelsemine, detecting the smallest traces, appears
                    to be the cherry-red colour developed when ceroso-ceric oxide is added to its
                    solution in concentrated sulphuric acid. The dose of the alkaloid is from, ∙ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> δ</hi> ⅛th to ∕ <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> th of a grain;
                    larger quantities are poisonous, ⅜th of a grain having proved fatal in an hour
                    and a half to a strong cat.</p>
                <p>The pharmaceutical preparation known as gelsemin consists chiefly of the resin,
                    combined with uncertain proportions of the other constituents of the root, and
                    is prepared by precipitation with water from the strong tincture.</p>
                <p>The medicinal properties of the root were discovered by accident, the infusion
                    having been administered instead of that of some other root, with the result of
                    curing the fever for which it was taken. It was then experimented upon by the
                    American eclectic practitioners. In 1852 Professor AV. Proctor called the
                    attention of the medical profession to its valuable properties; and in 1864 it
                    was placed on approval in the secondary list, and in 1873, so rapidly had it
                    risen in favour, in the primary list of remedies of acknowledged value in the
                    United States pharmacopoeia. It has latterly attracted considerable attention in
                    England as a remedy for certain forms of facial neuralgia, especially those
                    arising from decayed teeth, or involving branches of the fifth nerve. In the
                    United States it is more particularly valued for controlling nervous
                    irritability in fevers of a malarial type, in which it is said to excel every
                    other known agent. The physiological action of the drug lias been carefully
                    examined by Bartholow, Ott, and Ringer and Murrell, from whose investigations it
                    appears that it has a paralysing action on the motor centres, affecting
                    successively the third, fifth, and sixth nerves, its fatal action being due to
                    its causing paralysis of the respiratory muscles, and thus producing death by
                    asphyxia. Tn large doses it produces alarming symptoms, which occasionally
                    terminate fatally. These appear to vary slightly in different cases, but the
                    more prominent are pain in the forehead and in the eyeballs, giddiness, ptosis,
                    a feeling of lightness in the tongue slurred <pb break="no"

                    dilatation of the pupils, and impossibility of keeping an erect posture. The
                    mind in most cases remains clear until shortly before death. The earliest and
                    most prominent symptom of a fatal or dangerous dose is the drooping of the
                    eyelids, which indicates the immediate administration of stimulants, for when
                    the paralysis of the tongue which ensue3 extends to the epiglottis, deglutition
                    becomes impossible, and the epiglottis is apt, unless the sufferer be placed in
                    a forward position to flap back and close the windpipe. The antidotes which have
                    been found the most successful are carbonate of ammonia, brandy, aromatic
                    spirits of ammonia, and morphia. It has been found that death may be averted by
                    keeping up artificial respiration until the poison is eliminated by the
                    kidneys.</p>
