                <p><label type="entry">GORGIAS</label> of Leontini, in Sicily, a rhetorician and
                    sophist of whose personal history nothing is known beyond the facts that in 427,
                    when already a comparatively old man, he was sent by his fellow-citizens at the
                    head of an embassy to ask Athenian protection against the aggression of the
                    Syracusans; that he then settled in Athens, and supported himself by the
                    practice of oratory and by teaching rhetoric; and that he ended his days at
                    Larissa, in Thessaly. His birth and death may be approximately dated
                    respectively at 483 and 375 B.c. He was the author of a lost work <hi
                        rend="italic">On Nature or the Non-existent (πepl τov μη orτoς η</hi> 7r∈pt
                    φt'σeως), the substance of which may be gathered from the writings of Sextus
                    Empiricus, and also from the treatise (ascribed to Theophrastus) <hi
                        rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia.</hi> His
                    philosophical opinions may be summed up in three propositions, which stand in
                    direct relation to the teachings of the Eleatic school. He held (1) that there
                    is nothing which has any real existence; (2) that, even if anything did really
                    exist, it could not be known; and (3) that, supposing real existence to be
                    knowable, the knowledge would be incommunicable. On the first point his argument
                    was that a real existence must either have come into being or have been eternal.
                    But the first alternative would require it to have been produced, either from
                    the existent or from the non-existent; the second alternative would require us
                    to identify it with the infinite, but the infinite exists nowhere (for that
                    would involve the absurdity of its existing either within itself or within
                    something else), but what exists nowhere is nothing. In support of the second
                    proposition he argued that, if existence could be known, then thought would be
                    existence, and the non-existent would be unthinkable and error would be
                    impossible. The third point for which he argued was the inadequacy of language
                    to convey ideas, and the impossibility of the idea being the same in different
                    minds. In natural philosophy, his opinions, so far as these are known, appear to
                    have been similar to those of Empedocles. See the monograph, <hi rend="italic"
