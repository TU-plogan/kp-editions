                    strongly and generally prevalent. The earliest mention of the use of gold in a
                    woven fabric occurs in the description of the ephod made for Aaron (Exod. xxxix.
                    2, 3)—“And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
                    twined linen. And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires
                    (strips), to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in
                    the fine linen, with cunning work.” In both the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and
                    the (λ7yssey distinct allusion is frequently made to inwoven and embroidered
                    golden textiles. Many circumstances point to the conclusion that the art of
                    weaving and embroidering with gold and silver originated in India, where it is
                    still principally prosecuted, and that from one great city to another the
                    practice travelled westward,—Babylon, Tarsus, Baghdad, Damascus, the islands of
                    Cyprus and Sicily, Com <pb break="no"

                    time becoming famous centres of these much prized manufactures. Alexander the
                    Great found Indian kings and princes arrayed in robes of gold and purple; and”
                    the Persian monarch Darius, we are told, wore a war mantle of cloth of gold, on
                    which were figured two golden hawks as if pecking at each other. There is
                    reason, according to Josephus, to believe that the “royal apparel” worn by Herod
                    on the day of his death (Acts xii. 21) was a tissue of silver. Agrippina, the
                    wife of the emperor Claudius, had a robe woven entirely of gold, and from that
                    period downwards royal personages and high ecclesiastical dignitaries used cloth
                    and tissues of gold and silver for their state and ceremonial robes, as well as
                    for costly hangings and decorations. In England, at different periods, various
                    names were applied to cloths of gold, as ciclatoun, tar-tarium, naques or nac,
                    baudekin or baldachin, Cyprus damask, and twssewys or tissue. The thin flimsy
                    paper known as tissue paper, is so called because it originally was placed
                    between the folds of gold “tissue” to prevent the contiguous surfaces from
                    fraying each other. At what time the drawing of gold wire for the preparation of
                    these textiles was first practised is not accurately known. The art was probably
                    introduced and applied in different localities at widely different dates, but
                    down till mediaeval times the method graphically described in the Pentateuch
                    continued to be practised with both gold and silver.</p>
                <p>Fabrics woven with gold and silver continue to be used on the largest scale to
                    this day in India; and there the preparation of the varieties of wire, and the
                    working of the various forms of lace, brocade, and embroidery, is at once an
                    important and peculiar art. The basis of all modern fabrics of this kind is
                    wire, the “gold wire” of the manufacturer being in all cases silver gilt wire,
                    and silver wire being, of course, composed of pure silver. In India the wire is
                    drawn by means of simple draw-plates, with rude and simple appliances, from
                    rounded bars of silver, or gold-plated silver, as the case may be. The wire is
                    flattened into the strip or ribbon-like form it generally assumes by passing it,
                    fourteen or fifteen strands simultaneously, over a fine, smooth, round-topped
                    anvil, and beating it as it passes with a heavy hammer having a slightly convex
                    surface. From wire so flattened there is made in India io&gt;ιm, a tissue or
                    cloth of gold, the web or warp being composed entirely of golden strips, and <hi
                    rend="italic">ruperi,</hi> a similar tissue of silver. Gold lace is also made on
                    a warp of thick yellow silk with a weft of flat wire, and in the case of ribbons
                    the warp or web is composed of the metal. The flattened wires are twisted around
                    orange (in the case of silver, white) coloured silk thread, so as completely to
                    cover the thread and present the appearance of a continuous wire; and in this
                    form it is chiefly employed for weaving into the rich brocades known as kincobs
                    or kinkhâbs. Wires flattened, or partially flattened, are also twisted into
                    exceedingly fine spirals, and in this form they are the basis of numerous
                    ornamental applications. Such spirals drawn out till they present a waved
                    appearance, and in that state flattened, are much used for rich heavy
                    embroideries termed karchobs. Spangles for embroideries, &amp;c., are made from
                    spirals of comparatively stout wire, by cutting them down ring by ring, laying
                    each Ø-like ring on an anvil, and by a smart blow with a hammer flattening it
                    out into a thin round disk with a slit extending from the centre to one edge.
                    Fine spirals are also used for general embroidery purposes. The demand for
                    various kinds of loom-woven and embroidered gold and silver work in India is
                    immense; and the variety of textiles so ornamented is also very great. “Gold and
                    silver,” says Dr Birdwood in his <hi rend="italic">Handbook to the
                    British-Indian Section, Paris Exhibition,</hi> 1878, “are worked into the
                    decoration of all the more costly loom-made garments and Indian piece goods,
                    either on the borders only, or in stripes throughout, or in diapered figures.
                    The gold-bordered loom embroideries are made chiefly at Sattara, and the gold or
                    silver striped at Tanjore; the gold figured <hi rend="italic">mashrus</hi> at
                    Tanjore, Trichinopoly, and Hyderabad in the Deccan; and the highly ornamented
                    gold-figured silks and gold and silver tissues principally at Ahmedabad,
                    Benares, Murshedabad, and Trichinopoly.”</p>
                <p>Among the Western communities the demand for gold and silver lace and
                    embroideries arises chiefly in connexion with naval and military uniforms, court
                    costumes, public and private liveries, ecclesiastical robes and draperies,
                    theatrical dresses, and the badges and insignia of various orders. To a limited
                    extent there is a trade in gold wire and lace to India and China. The metallic
                    basis of the various fabrics is wire round and flattened, the wire being of
                    three kinds—1st, gold wire, which is invariably silver gilt wire; 2d, copper
                    gilt wire, used for common liveries and theatrical purposes; and 3d, silver
                    wire. These wires are drawn by the ordinary processes, and the flattening, when
                    done, is accomplished by passing the wire between a pair of revolving rollers of
                    fine polished steel. The various qualities of wire are prepared and used in
                    precisely the same way as in India,—round wire, flat wire, thread made of fiat
                    gold wire twisted round orange-coloured silk or cotton, known in the trade as
                    “orris,” fine spirals and spangles, all being in use in the West as in the East.
                    The lace is woven in the same manner as ribbons, and there are very numerous
                    varieties in richness, pattern, and quality. Cloth of gold, and brocades rich in
                    gold and silver, are woven for ecclesiastical vestments and draperies.</p>
                <p>The proportions of gold and silver in the gold thread for the lace trade varies,
                    but in all cases the proportion of gold is exceedingly small. An ordinary gold
                    lace wire is drawn from a bar containing 90 parts of silver and 7 of copper,
                    coated with 3 parts of gold. On an average each ounce troy of a bar so plated is
                    drawn into 1500 yards of wire; and therefore about 16 grains of gold cover a
                    mile of wire. It is estimated that about 250,000 ounces of gold wire are made
                    annually in Great Britain, of which about 20 per cent, is used for the headings
                    of calico, muslin, &amp;c., and the remainder is worked up in the gold lace
                    trade.</p>
