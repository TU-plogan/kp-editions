                    methodical demonstrations were the admiration of his fellow students. In Dr
                    Knox’s rooms he made the acquaintance of Edward Forbes, the naturalist. Goodsir
                    also worked under Mr Syme, Professor Christison, Dr John Macintosh, Professor
                    Robert Jameson, Dr Thomas Hope, and Dr Graham. His earliest scientific paper was
                    on the snail,—a novel, elaborate, and highly illustrated treatise. In 1835 he
                    became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh. After aiding Mr
                    Nasmyth, he joined his father in practice at Anstruther. Three years later he
                    communicated to the British Association a paper on the pulps and sacs of the
                    human teeth, his researches on the whole process of dentition being at this time
                    distinguished by their completeness. He had already commenced the formation of a
                    natural history museum, which attracted many visitors,—the habits of animals,
                    from the polype to the ape, possessing an irresistible charm for him. The
                    results of his studies in natural history were laid before the Society of St
                    Andrews, at the request of whose president, Sir D. Brewster, he furnished an
                    account of <hi rend="italic">cilia,</hi> reading to the society in 1840 his
                    views on the cephalic termination of the sympathetic nerve. The ichthyolites of
                    the Concerres quarry had not escaped him; and we find him now foreshowing his
                    diversified knowledge in essays on the eye of the cephalopodous mollusks, in
                    descriptions of his dredging expeditions with Edward Forbes, and in his lectures
                    at Cupar on the conditions of health. On the nomination of Forbes, he was in
                    1838 elected to the famous coterie called the “Universal Brotherhood of the
                    Friends of Truth,” which comprised artists, scholars, naturalists, and others
                    whose relationship became a potent influence in science. Goodsir was a noble
                    example of the brotherhood, which sought to bind man to man in ties of home and
                    friendship, love and good will. Goodsir and Forbes worked together at marine
                    zoology, but human anatomy, pathology, and morphology formed Goodsir’s chief
                    study. The connexion of these two men was illustrated in a paper read at the
                    British Association in 1840 on <hi rend="italic">Pelonaia,</hi> and further
                    researches on the British <hi rend="italic">Ciliograda.</hi> In that year
                    Goodsir became a member of the Wernerian Society, contributing several papers,
                    some jointly with Forbes. Professor Jameson was the president, which may account
                    for the greater part of Goodsir’s studies in comparative anatomy from 1840 to
                    1847 being imparted to its members. In 1841 he joined the Edinburgh Botanical
                    Society, holding the office of secretary from 1842-48, when he was chosen
                    vice-president. In 1840-42 ulcers and abscesses and continued fever, in cases of
                    which he advocated the depletive system, occupied his attention. He had
                    associated himself with the Royal Medical Society in 1833, and was in 1841-42
                    elected the senior president, at the same time becoming president of the
                    Anatomical and Physiological Societies, to which he submitted his studies on the
                    structure of the liver and kidneys. A member of the Royal Physical Society in
                    1841, he read his papers on the development of the skeleton in the series of
                    invertebrate animals; in 1849 he was elected president, remaining in office till
                    1852. His own estimate of his work at this period was represented to the Royal
                    College of Surgeons of Edinburgh on his candidature for the post of conservator
                    'of the museum. He stated that he had practised every department of preparation
                    and conservation, that he had considerable experience in modelling in clay,
                    plaster, and wax, and in the use of microscope and pencil, and that his own
                    collection of preparations in human, comparative, and morbid anatomy exceeded
                    400 examples. He succeeded Macgillivray in April 1841, giving lectures on the
                    subjects illustrated by the museum. Goodsir rested no small part of his
                    reputation on his knowledge of the anatomy of tissues. In his lectures in the
                    theatre of the college in 1842-43 he evidenced the largeness of his observation
                    of cell-life, both physiologically and pathologically, advocating the importance
                    of the cell as a centre of nutrition, and pointing out that the organism is
                    subdivided into a number of departments. Virchow recognized his indebtedness to
                    these discoveries by dedicating his <hi rend="italic">Cellular</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pathologie</hi> to Goodsir, as “one of the earliest and most acute
                    observers of cell-life.” In 1843 Goodsir obtained the post of curator in the
                    university of Edinburgh; the following year he was appointed demonstrator of
                    anatomy to Professor Monro, and in 1845 curator of the entire museum. He
                    elucidated about this time much that had been obscure in digestion, in parasitic
                    formation and in the secreting structures. He fully confirmed the supposition
                    that cells are the structures which perform the process of secretion, and that
                    the functions of nutrition and secretion are essentially alike in their nature.
                    His views on the nucleated cell as the great agent in absorption, nutrition, and
                    secretion are established data in the science of physiology. In 1846 Goodsir was
                    elected to the anatomical chair in the university of Edinburgh, his highest
                    ambition being thus satisfied. The same year the Royal Society of London
                    enrolled him as a fellow. All his energies were now devoted to the perfection of
                    the science of anatomy; and his system of teaching was regarded as the best that
                    ever regulated the anatomical department of any British university or medical
                    school.</p>
                <p>Human myology was his strong point; no one had laboured harder at the
                    dissecting-table; and he strongly emphasized the necessity of practice as a
                    means of research. He believed that anatomy, physiology, and pathology could
                    never be properly advanced without daily consideration and treatment of disease.
                    In 1848 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and in the same
                    year he joined the Highland and Agricultural Society, acting as chairman of the
                    veterinary department, and advising on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n799/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0799-0776"/> strictly agricultural matters. In 1847 he
                    delivered a series of systematic lectures on the comparative anatomy of the
                    invertebrata; and, about this period, as member of an aesthetic club, he wrote
                    papers on the natural principles of beauty, the aesthetics of the ugly, of
                    smell, the approbation or disapprobation of sounds, and other refinements. Owing
                    to the failing health of Professor Jameson, Goodsir was induced to deliver the
                    course of lectures on natural history during the summer of 1853. It was mainly
                    zoological, and included the psychological conditions of man as compared with
                    the brute, and the highest exercise of the human faculties—perception, logic,
                    and science. These lectures are among the <hi rend="italic">memorabilia</hi> of
                    the university; but the infinite amount of thought and exertion which they cost
                    broke the health of the lecturer. Goodsir, nevertheless, persisted in work till
                    1853, when the necessity for rest urged itself with painful force. A sojourn on
                    the Continent, though it refreshed, could not rid him of incipient paralysis,
                    the common penalty for overtaxing powers. The death of Forbes in 1854 was a sore
                    trial to Goodsir, and though other friends were numerous, the firm attachment of
                    this man could not be replaced. Goodsir persevered in his labours, writing in
                    1855 on organic electricity, in 1856 on morphological subjects, and afterwards
                    on the structure of organized forms,—his speculations in the latter domain
                    giving birth to his theory of a triangle as the mathematical figure upon which
                    nature had built up both the organic and inorganic worlds. The fundamental
                    principle of form he conceived to exist within the province of crystallography,
                    and to be discernible by a close study of the laws of that science. As he
                    believed that every cell had a parent cell, or “a mother,” so he argued there
                    was an umbilicus or centre in everything. He regarded man as simply a
                    conglomerate of cells, rising up, maturing, and decaying. He saw in the growth
                    and form and finished structure of man a tetrahedron,—man, a physical being and
                    a form divine, but a crystal in his structural entity and arrangement. Goodsir
                    hoped to complete the triangle theory of formation and law as the greatest of
                    his works. In his lectures on the skull and brain he held the doctrine that
                    symmetry of brain had more to do with the higher faculties than bulk or form.
                    Goodsir was still working out these higher studies when death ended his labours.
                    He expired at Wardie, near Edinburgh, on the 6th of March 1867, in the same
                    cottage in which his friend Edward Forbes died. Goodsir’s anatomical lectures
                    are remarkable for their solid basis of fact; and no one in Britain took so wide
                    a field for survey, or marshalled so many facts for anatomical tabulation and
                    synthesis.</p>
