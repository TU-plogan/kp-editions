                    (1625-1669), one of the most distinguished of the earlier Cartesians, was born
                    at Antwerp in 1625. Few details are known with regard to his life, and his more
                    important works are extremely rare. He studied philosophy and medicine at the
                    university of Louvain, and took there the degree of doctor. For twelve years he
                    continued at the same university as lecturer, and was noted as one of the most
                    successful teachera. For what reason he left is quite uncertain, but he seems to
                    have been obliged to fly from Louvain and to take refuge in Leyden, where he
                    appears to have been in the utmost distress. Only the generous assistance of a
                    friend, by name Heidanus, prevented his death from absolute want of means. At
                    Leyden he entered the Protestant Church, having been previously a Catholic, and
                    it has been supposed that his flight from Louvain was due to doubts excited
                    there as to his orthodoxy. This, however, is merely conjecture. In 1663, through
                    his friend Heidanus, he obtained leave to lecture at Leyden, and devoted himself
                    with the utmost zeal to hi3 new duties. He died in 1669. His most important
                    works were published posthumously. During his lifetime there seem to have been
                    made public only the theses which he defended on graduating at Louvain <hi

                    doctrine, left in an obscure and unsatisfactory state by Descartes, of the
                    relation between soul and body. Extension and thought, the essences of spiritual
                    and corporeal natures, are absolutely distinct, and cannot act upon one another.
                    External facts are not the causes of mental states, nor are mental states the
                    causes of physical facts. So far as the physical universe is concerned, we are
                    merely spectators. The influence we seem by will to exercise over bodies is only
                    apparent; volition and action only accompany one another. I cannot be the author
                    of any state of which I am unconscious, for my very nature is consciousness; but
                    I am not conscious of the mechanism by which bodily motion is produced, hence I
                    am not the author of bodily motion. Body and mind are like two clocks which act
                    together, because at each instant they are adjusted by God. A physical
                    occurrence is but the occasion on which God excites in me a corresponding mental
                    state. Geulincx is thus definitely the originator of the theory called
                    Occasionalism. But the principles on which that theory was founded compelled a
                    further advance. God, who is the cause of the concomitance of bodily and mental
                    facts, is in truth the sole cause in the universe. No fact contains in itself
                    the ground of any other; the existence of the facts is due to God, their
                    sequence and co-existence are also due to him. He is the ground of all that is.
                    My desire3 or volitions and my thoughts are thus the desires, volitions, or
                    thoughts of God. Apart from God, the finite being has no reality. Geulincx is
                    thus the precursor of Spinoza, and, like Spinoza, he gave out his final results
                    under the title of Ethics. Descartes had left untouched, or nearly so, the
                    difficult problem of the relation between the universal element or thought and
                    the particular desires or inclinations. All these are regarded by Geulincx as
                    modes of the divine thought and action, and accordingly the end of human
                    endeavour is the end of divine will, or the realization of reason. The love of
                    right reason is the supreme virtue, whence flow the cardinal virtues, diligence,
                    obedience, justice, and humility. Liberty is obedience to reason; <hi

                    rationi</hi><hi rend="italic">servit.</hi></p>
                <p>Geulincx has not directly touched the problem which evidently must have caused
                    the greatest difficulty to the Cartesians,—how we perceive extended
                    reality,—though he plainly indicates the opinion that we do not perceive it, but
                    have the idea of it from God. He thus carried out to their extreme consequences
                    the irreconcilable elements in the Cartesian metaphysics, and his works have the
                    peculiar value attaching to the vigorous development of a one-sided principle.
                    The abrupt contradictions to which such development leads of necessity compels
                    revision of the principle itself.</p>
