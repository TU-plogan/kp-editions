                <p><label type="entry">GAME LAWS</label>. This expression is applied in England to a
                    series of statutes of modern date, establishing a peculiar kind of property in
                    wild animals. These statutes, it is well known, are regarded with great dislike
                    by a large and important section of the people—partly on account of their
                    alleged injurious economic effects, and partly on account of their harsh and
                    exceptional character. It will be well to state first the principles of the
                    common law, and then to show how far they have been superseded by recent
                    legislation. By the very nature of the case, wild animals cannot be made the
                    subject of that absolute kind of ownership which is generally signified by the
                    term property. The substan tial basis of the law of property is physical
                    possession, the actual power of dealing with things as we see fit, and we can
                    have no such power over animals in a state of nature. Accordingly, the common
                    law recognized nothing like property in wild animals, until they had, as it
                    were, been reduced into possession. Wild animals reclaimed or confined become
                    property, but the moment they escape from confinement the property is gone, and
                    the rights of the owner are lost. Even bees, which might well be described as
                    domesticated and not wild animals, do not become property until they are hived.
                    “Though a swarm lights on any tree,” says Bracton, “I have no more property
                    therein than I have in the birds which make their nests thereon.” The owner of a
                    confined animal which escapes does indeed retain his property while he is in
                    pursuit of the fugitive; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> no other person can, in
                    the meantime, establish a right of property against him by capturing the animal,
                    just as a swarm of bees “which fly from and out of my hive are mine so long as I
                    can keep them in sight, and have power to pursue them.” Again, the law
                    recognized a right in wild animals <hi rend="italic">propter</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">impotentiam,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> when they were young
                    and unablo to move from place to place. With these exceptions wild animals were
                    <hi rend="italic">res mdliτιs,</hi> capable of being made the property of any
                    person reducing them into possession. A prior right to acquire property in such
                    animals was, however, allowed to the owner (or occupier) of the soil. Thus it is
                    said that “if A starts a hare in the ground of B, and hunts it and kills it
                    there, the property continues all the while in B.” B is said to have a right of
                    property in the wild animals on his land <hi rend="italic">ratione</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">soli.</hi> But “if A starts a hare on the ground of B, and hunts
                    it into the ground of C and kills it there, the property is in A, and not in B
                    or C.” That is to say, the so-called property in wild animals <hi rend="italic"
                    >ratione</hi><hi rend="italic">soli</hi> consists in this, that if one of them
                    is started and killed by a trespasser it belongs to the owner (or occupier) of
                    the soil. If the animal goes to another man’s land this inchoate right is
                    transferred to the other man. And the inchoate right of the owner becomes an
                    actual right of property only when the animal is both started and killed by the
                    trespasser on the same man’s land. Such right as the owner has belongs to the
                    occupier when the land is given without reserve to a tenant for a term.</p>
                <p>These principles, it will be observed, apply to all wild animals, and no
                    distinction is made between game and other animals. The laws of the forest,
                    however, established in derogation of the common law a different kind of
                    property in certain classes of wild animals, For an account of these see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Forest Law</hi> (vol. ix. p. 408). The forest code affected
                    definite districts of the country, and the right which they protected was the
                    exclusive right of hunting the animals of the forest within those districts.</p>
                <p>The game laws as above defined have virtually takeu the place of the forest laws.
                    The latter protected the privilege of the king and his favourites to hunt
                    certain animals in certain districts; the former have extended and protected the
                    right of an owner of the soil to the chase of certain animals on his own estate.
                    The means adopted have been to make trespass (in itself only a civil wrong) a
                    criminal offence punishable with great severity, and to restrict, by a system of
                    licences, the right as well of killing as of selling game. The principal Acts
                    are 1 &lt;fc 2 William IV. c. 32 (the Game Act), 9 Geo. IV. c. 69 (the Night
                    Poaching Act), 23 &amp; 24 Viet, c. 90 (Game Licences Act), and the Hares
                    Killing Act, 11 ώ 12 Vict. c. 29. The Game Act repeals a large number of
                    statutes on the subject, most of them passed in the 18th century. Game is
                    defined to include “hares, pheasants, partridges, grouse, heath or moor game,
                    black game, and</p>
                <p>I <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n71/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0071-0062"/> bustards,” and the same definition is found in
                    the Night Poaching Act. A close time is fixed for certain birds of game:—for
                    partridges from 1st February to 1st September; pheasants, 1st February to 1st
                    October; black game, 10th December to 20th August; grouse, 10th December to 12th
                    August; bustard, 1st March to 1st September; and the possession of such game
                    after 10 days in dealers, and 40 days in other persons, from the expiration of
                    the season is made illegal. The Act makes no difference in the effect of a game
                    certificate (now “game licence”); that is to say, the licence authorizes the
                    holder to kill game, subject to the law of trespass as modified by this Act. A
                    temporary section reversed, as to all existing leases, the presumption of law
                    that the game, unless specially reserved, belongs to the tenant; but the
                    presumption remains as to all future leases. But when the game has been reserved
                    to the landlord, or any assignee of his, then the occupier shall be punished for
                    killing it, or for authorizing any other person to do so. This section no doubt
                    was rendered necessary by the fact that the law of trespass, which is the pivot
                    of the Game Act, could not be made to include the case of a farmer shooting game
                    on his own ground; but it is open to the remark that in effect it converts a
                    mere breach of contract into a crime. Persons holding game certificates
                    (licences) may sell game to persons licensed to deal therein. Various sections
                    of the Act define the penalties to which persons killing or selling game without
                    a licence shall be subject, and it should be noticed that it is a punishable
                    offence even to buy game except from a licensed dealer.</p>
                <p>The section relating to trespass (§30 of the Game Act) enacts that, “if any
                    person whatsoever shall commit any trespass by entering or being in the day time
                    upon any land in search or pursuit of game, or woodcocks, snipes, quails,
                    landrails, or conies,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>These animals, although not included in the statutory definition of game,
                    are by this section partially admitted to the benefit of the Act.</p></note>
                    such person shall, on conviction thereof before a justice of the peace, forfeit
                    and pay such sum of money, not exceeding two pounds, as to the justice shall
                    seem meet, together with the costs of the conviction;” and that if any persons,
                    to the number of five or more together, shall commit any trespass by entering or
                    being in the day time upon any land in search of or pursuit of game or
                    woodcocks, &amp;c, “each shall, on conviction, forfeit a sum not exceeding five
                    pounds. The leave of the occupier shall be no defence when the game belongs to
                    the landlord or other persons; and by § 31, trespassers in pursuit of game,
                    &lt;fcc., may be required to leave the land, to tell their names and abodes, and
                    if they refuse may be arrested. The owner of the right of shooting may take from
                    them any game found· in their possession. The sections against trespassers,
                    however, do not include any person hunting or coursing upon any land with hounds
                    or greyhounds.” This act applies only to England.</p>
                <p>The Poaching Acts are still more severe. The Night Poaching Act enacts that, “if
                    any person shall, after the passing of this Act, by night unlawfully take or
                    destroy any game or rabbits in any land, whether open or enclosed, or shall by
                    night unlawfully enter or be on any land, whether open or enclosed, with any
                    gun, net, engine, or other instrument for the purpose of destroying game, such
                    offender shall, upon conviction thereof before two justices of the peace, be
                    committed for the first offence to the common gaol or house of correction for
                    any period not exceeding three calendar months, there to be kept to hard labour,
                    and at the expiration of such period shall find sureties” for his not so
                    offending again. For a second offence the punishment is six months with hard
                    labour, &amp;c., with one year’s further imprisonment in default of sureties; a
                    third offence is a misdemeanour, and the punishment is penal servitude for not
                    more than seven years, or imprisonment for not more than two years. A later Act,
                    7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 29, §1, applies the penalties to the unlawful taking or
                    destroying game on a highway by night. “Night” is declared to commence at the
                    expiration of the first hour after sunset and to conclude at the beginning of
                    the last hour before sunrise. Finally, the Poaching Prevention Act (25 &amp; 26
                    Vict. c. 114) gives power to a constable, “on any highway, street, or public
                    place, to search any person whom he may have good cause to suspect of coming
                    from any land where he shall have been unlawfully in search or pursuit of game,
                    or any persons aiding or abetting such person, and having in his possession any
                    game unlawfully obtained, or any gun, part of gun, or nets or engines used for
                    the killing or taking game; and also to stop and search any cart or pther
                    conveyance in or upon which such constable or peace officer shall have good
                    cause to suspect that any such game, or any such article or thing, is being
                    carried by any such person.” If any such thing be found the constable is to
                    detain it, and apply for a summons against the offender, summoning him to appear
                    before two justices, where, on conviction, he may be fined not more than <hi
                    rend="italic">£5,</hi> and shall forfeit the game, guns, &amp;c., found in his
                    possession. This Act is available by night as well as day. It should be noted in
                    all cases where the unlawful taking or destroying of game is mentioned, that
                    such taking is made unlawful only by the provisions of the Acts relating to
                    certificates, or by the law relating to trespass. A person provided with a
                    certificate can still kill game where he pleases, unless he commits a
                    trespass—the only exception being that of the tenant whose landlord has reserved
                    the game in his lands. Thus it may be inferred that a poacher provided with a
                    certificate could not be brought within the limits of the Act relating to
                    poaching on highways.</p>
                <p>Game certificates are now regulated by 23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. 90. Section 4 enacts
                    that “any person, before he shall in Great Britain take, kill, or pursue, or aid
                    or assist in any manner in the taking, killing, or pursuing, by any means
                    whatever, or use any dog, gun, net, or other engine for the purpose of taking,
                    killing, or pursuing any game, or any woodcock, snipe, quail, landrail, or any
                    coney, or any deer, shall take out a proper licence to kill game under this Act
                    ”—subject to a penalty of £20. There are, however, certain exceptions and
                    exemptions. As to licences to deal in game, any person who shall have obtained a
                    licence to deal in game from the justice.? of the peace under the provisions of
                    1 &amp; 2 Will. IV. c. 32, and 2 ώ 3 Vict. c. 35, shall annually and during the
                    continuance of such licence, and before he shall be empowered to deal in game
                    under such licence, obtain a further licence to deal in game under this Act, and
                    only those who have obtained licence from the justices shall be licensed under
                    the Act, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by the Inland Revenue. By 11 &amp; 12
                    Vict. c. 29 any occupier or owner having the right of killing game may, by
                    himself or by any person authorized by him in writing, kill hares without paying
                    duty or taking out licence.</p>
                <p>Most of the Acts cited above apply to Scotland as well as England, and when they
                    do not there are special enactments for Scotland having substantially the same
                    effect. The more important statutes specially affecting Scotland are the 13 Geo.
                    III. c. 54, which fixes a close time for killing, selling, buying, &amp;c.,
                    muirfowl, heathfowl, partridge, and pheasant; the 2 &amp; 3 Will. IV. c. 68 (the
                    Trespass Act); the 11 &amp; 12 Vict. c. 30 (Hares Killing Act); and the 40 &amp;
                    41 Vict. c. 28. The last is to some extent a departure from the general policy
                    of the game laws, being an attempt to provide compensation to tenants for damage
                    caused by game. In effect it will be found to belong to the class of
                    “permissive” statutes. The important section is the 4th <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n72/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0072-0063"/> “Where, under any lease made subsequently to the
                    commencement of this Act, or where, by presumption of common law, upon any land
                    occupied under a lease made subsequently to the commencement of this Act, the
                    lessor shall reserve or retain the sole right of hunting, killing, or taking
                    rabbits, hares, or other game, or any of them, the lessee shall be entitled to
                    compensation for the damage done to his crops in each year by the rabbits and
                    hares, or other game, to which the lessor may have reserved or retained the
                    whole right, in excess of such sum as may have been set forth in the lease as
                    the amount of annual damage for which it is agreed no compensation shall be due;
                    and if no such sum shall be set forth, then in excess of the sum of forty
                    shillings.”</p>
                <p>Scotch law, differing in this respect from English law, infers that, when the
                    lease contains no stipulations as to game, the landlord reserves the right of
                    killing game to himself, The Act contains provisions for settling claims of
                    damage either by arbitration or by action at law. Leases made before the Act are
                    not to be affected thereby. The old Act of 1621, “anent hunting and haulking,”
                    is cited in the schedule of the last-mentioned Act; it “ordaines that no mln
                    hunt nor haulk at any time hereafter who hath not a plough of land in heritage,
                    under the pain of £100.” It is, of course, practically obsolete. <hi
