                    otherwise John Charlier of Gerson, Johannes Gersonus, John de Gersone, J.
                    Jarson, De Jarsone, or Gersen, the famous chancellor of the university of Paris,
                    and the ruling spirit in the oecumenical councils of Pisa and Constance, was
                    born at the village of Gerson, in the bishopric of Rheims and department of
                    Ardennes, on December 14, 1363. We learn a good many details about his family
                    and early upbringing from allusions in some of his devotional tracts. His
                    parents, Arnulph Charlier and Elizabeth de la Chardenière, “a second Monica,”
                    belonged to the peasant class, were of eminent piety, and rejoiced to see seven
                    of their twelve children, four daughters and three sons, devoting themselves to
                    a religious life. Young Gerson was sent to Paris to the famous college of
                    Navarre when fourteen years of age. After a five years’ course he obtained the
                    degree of licentiate of arts, and then began his theological studies under two
                    very celebrated teachers, Giles Des Champs (Aegidius Campensis) and Peter
                    D’Ailly (Petrus de Alliaco), rector of the college of Navarre, chancellor of the
                    university, and afterwards bishop of Puy, archbishop of Cambray, and cardinal.
                    D’Ailly remained his life-long friend, and in later life the pupil seems to have
                    become the teacher (see pref, to <hi rend="italic">Liber de Vita Spir.
                        Animce).</hi> Gerson very soon attracted the notice of the university. He
                    was elected procurator for the French nation in 1383, when barely twenty years
                    of age, and re-elected the year afterwards. In 1384 he took the degree of
                    bachelor of theology. Three years later a still higher honour was bestowed upon
                    him; he was sent along with the chancellor and others to represent the
                    university in a case of appeal taken to the pope. Dr John Montson had been
                    condemned by the faculty of theology because he had taught that the Virgin Mary,
                    like other ordinary descendants of Adam, was born in original sin; and the
                    Dominicans, who were fierce opponents of the doctrine of the immaculate
                    conception, were expelled the university. Montson appealed to Pope Clement VII.
                    at Avignon, and D’Ailly, Gerson, and the other university delegates, while they
                    personally supported the doctrine of the immaculate conception, were content to
                    rest their case upon the legal rights of the university to test in its own way
                    its theological teachers. Gerson’s biographers have compared his journey to
                    Avignon with Luther’s visit to Rome. It is certain that from this time onwards
                    he was zealous in his endeavours to spiritualize the universities, to reform the
                    morals of the clergy, and to put an end to the schism which then divided the
                    church. In 1392 Gerson became doctor of theology, and in 1395, when D’Ailly was
                    made bishop of Puy, he was, at the early age of thirty-two, elected chancellor
                    of the university of Paris, and made a canon of Notre Dame. This great
                    university was then at the height of its fame, and its chancellor was
                    necessarily a man prominent not only in France but in Europe, sworn to maintain
                    the rights of his university against both king and pope, and entrusted with the
                    conduct and studies of a vast crowd of students attracted from almost every
                    country in Europe. Gerson’s writings bear witness to his deep sense of the
                    responsibilities, anxieties, and troubles of his position. He was all his days a
                    man of letters, and an analysis of his writings is his best biography. His work
                    has three periods, in which he was engaged in reforming the university studies,
                    maturing plans for overcoming the schism (a task which after 1404 absorbed all
                    his energies), and in the evening of his life writing books of devotion.</p>
                <p>Gerson wished to banish scholastic subtleties from the studies of the university,
                    and at the same time to put some evangelical warmth into them. He was called at
                    this period of his life Doctor Christianissimus; later his devotional works
                    brought him the title Doctor Consolatorius. His plan was to make theology plain
                    and simple by founding it on the philosophical principles of nominalism. His
                    method was a clear exposition of the principles of theology where clearness was
                    possible, with a due recognition of the place of mystery in the Christian system
                    of doctrine. Like the great nominalist William of Occam, he saved himself from
                    rationalism by laying hold on mysticism—the Christian mysticism of the school of
                    St Victor. He thought that in this way he would equally guard against the folly
                    of the old scholastic and the seductions of such Averroistic pantheism as was
                    preached by heretics like Amalric of Bena. His plans for the reformation of
                    university studies may be learned from his <hi rend="italic">Tract, de</hi><hi

                    (iii. 297) he warns young men against the evil consequences of mediaeval
                    romance-reading. He was oftentimes weary of the chancellorship,—it involved him
                    in strife, and in money difficulties; he grew tired of public life, and longed
                    for learned leisure. To obtain it he accepted the deanery of Bruges from the
                    duke of Burgundy, but after a short sojourn he returned to Paris and to the
                    chancellorship.</p>
                <p>Gerson’s chief work was what he did to destroy the great schism. Gregory XL had
                    died in 1378, one year after Gerson went to the college of Navarre, and since
                    his death the church had had two popes. To the mediaeval mind, imaginatively
                    apprehending great thoughts in picture-representations, two popes meant two
                    churches and a divided Christ. The spiritual unity of the church, which is
                    founded on the spiritual union of all believers to Christ, was unintelligible to
                    it. Gerson and his contemporaries could not disentangle the invisible from the
                    visible, and if daring spirits like Wickliffe and Huss declared that the elect
                    were the tnιe church, the practical consequences which they drew from this
                    showed that they also were unable to escape from the confusion. The schism had
                    practically been brought about by France. The popes had been under French
                    influence so long that it appeared to France a political necessity to have her
                    own pope, and pious Frenchmen felt themselves somewhat responsible for the sins
                    and scandals of the schism. Hence the melancholy piety of Gerson, D’Ailly, and
                    their companions, and the energy with which they strove to bring the schism to
                    an end. During the lifetime of Clement the university of Paris, led by D’Ailly,
                    Gerson, and Nicholas Clamenges, met in deliberation about the state of
                    Christendom, and resolved that the schism could be ended in three ways,—by
                    cession, if both popes renounced the tiara unconditionally, by arbitration, or
                    by a general council. Clement died. The king of France, urged by the university,
                    sent orders that no new pope should be elected. The cardinals first elected, and
                    then opened the letter. In the new elections, however, both at Rome and Avignon,
                    the influence of Paris was so much felt that each of the neλv popes swore to
                    “cede” if his rival would do so also.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n567/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0567-0550"/>
                <p>Meanwhile in 1395 the national assembly of France and the French clergy adopted
                    the programme of the university—cession or a general council. The movement
                    gathered strength. In 1398 most of the cardinals and most of the crowned heads
                    in Europe had given their adhesion to the plan. During this period Gerson s
                    literary activity was untiring, and the throb of public expectancy, of hope and
                    fear, is revealed in his mιdtitude of pamphlets. At first there were hopes of a
                    settlement by way of cession. These come out in Protest, super statum ccclesüc
                    (ii. 1), Tract, de mοdο habendi se tempore schismatis, De Schismate, &amp;c. But
                    soou the conduct of the popes made Europe impatient, and the desire for a
                    general council grew strong—see De Concilio generali unius obedi-entiae (ii.
                    24). The council was resolved upon. It was to meet at Pisa, and Gerson poured
                    forth tract after tract for its guidance. The most important are—Trilogies in
                    materia Schismatis (ii. 83), and Dc unitate Ecclesiae (ii. 113), in which,
                    following D’Ailly (see Tsehaekert’s Peter v. Ailli, p. 153), Gerson demonstrates
                    that the ideal unity of the church, based upon Christ, destroyed by the popes,
                    can only be restored by a general council, supreme and legitimate, though
                    unsummoned by a pope. The council met, deposed both anti-popes, and elected
                    Alexander V. Gerson was chosen to address the new pope on the duties of his
                    office. He did so in his Sermo coram Alexandro Papa in die ascensionis in
                    concilio Pisano (ii. 131). All hopes of reformation, however, were quenched by
                    the conduct of the new pope. He had been a Franciscan, and loved his order above
                    measure. He issued a bull which laid the parish clergy and the universities at
                    the mercy of the mendicants. The great university of Paris rose in revolt,
                    headed by her chancellor, who wrote a fierce pamphlet—Censura professorum in
                    theologia circa bullam Alexandri V. (ii. 442). The pope died soon after, and one
                    of the most profligate men of that time, Pope John XXIII. (Balthasar Cossa) λvas
                    elected his successor. The council of Pisa had not brought peace; it had only
                    added a third pope. D’Ailly despaired of general councils (see his De
                    difficultate reformationis in concilio universali), but Gerson struggled on.
                    Another matter too had roused him. The feuds between the houses of orleans and
                    Burgundy had long distracted France. The duke of Orleans had been foully and
                    treacherously murdered by the followers of the duke of Burgundy, and a
                    theologian, John Petit, had publicly and unambiguously justified the murder. His
                    eight verities, as he called them—his apologies for the murder—had been, mainly
                    through the influence of Gerson, condemned by the university of Paris, and by
                    the archbishop and grand inquisitor, and his book had been publicly burned
                    before the cathedral of Notre Dame. Gerson wished a council to confirm this
                    sentence. His literary labours were as untiring as ever. He maintained in a
                    series of tracts that a general council could depose a pope; he drew up
                    indictments against the reigning pontiffs, reiterated the charges against John
                    Petit, and exposed the sin of schism—in short, he did all he could to direct the
                    public mind towards the evils in the church and the way to heal them. His
                    efforts λvere powerfully seconded by the emperor Sigismund, and the result was
                    the council of Constance. This council, unlike its predecessor at Pisa, was
                    summoned by a pope—Pope John XXIII. Sigismund was present, resolutely determined
                    to unite and reform the church, and guided by Cardinals D’Ailly and Zarabella,
                    and above all by Gerson. Gerson indeed practically ruled the council up to the
                    election of a new pope. It was he that dictated the form of submission and
                    cession made by John XXIII., and directed the process against Huss. Many of
                    Gerson’s biographers have found it difficult to reconcile his proceedings
                    against Huss with his own opinions upon the supremacy of the pope; but the
                    difficulty has arisen partly from misunderstanding Gerson’s position, partly
                    from supposing him to be the author of a famous tract—Dc modis uniendi ac
                    reformandi ecclesiam in concilio universali. All Gerson’s high-sounding phrases
                    about the supremacy of a council were meant to apply to some time of emergency.
                    He was essentially a trimmer, and can scarcely be called a reformer. He never
                    wrote the bold tract of Abbot Andrew of Randolf (c∕. Schwabe, Johannes Gerson,
                    p. 483-491), and he hated Huss with all the hatred the trimmer has of the
                    reformer. The council of Constance, which revealed the eminence of Gerson,
                    became in the end the cause of his downfall. He was the prosecutor in the case
                    of John Petit, and the council, overawed by the duke of Burgundy, would not
                    affirm the censure of the university and archbishop of Paris. Petit’s
                    justification of murder was declared to be only a moral and philosophical
                    opinion, not of faith. Theutmost length the council would go was to condemn one
                    proposition, and even this censure was annulled by the new pope, Martin V., on a
                    formal pretext. Gerson dared not return to France, where, in the disturbed state
                    of the kingdom, the duke of Burgundy was in power. He lay hid for a time in
                    Germany, and then returned to France, to Lyons, where his brother was prior of
                    the Celestines. It is said that he taught a school of boys and girls in Lyons,
                    and that the only fee he exacted was to make the children promise to repeat the
                    prayer, “Lord, have mercy on thy poor servant Gerson.’’ His later years were
                    spent in writing books of mystical devotion and hymns. He died at Lyons on July
                    12, 1429. Tradition declares that during his sojourn there he translated or
                    adapted from the Latin a work upon eternal consolation, which afterwards became
                    very famous under the title of The Imitation of Christ, and was attributed to
                    Thomas à Kempis. Recent researches, however, have proved beyond a doubt that the
                    famous Imitatio Christi was really written by Thomas, and not by John Gerson or
                    the Abbot Gersen.</p>
