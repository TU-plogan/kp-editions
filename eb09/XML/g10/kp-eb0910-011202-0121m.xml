                    country “of sugar”), a term which was applied to a large part of modern Bengal,
                    and specifically to that part in which these remains lie. We have the names of
                    dynasties, and partial lists of the kings of these dynasties, which bore the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Gaureshara,</hi> lord of Gaur, or Gauda, before the
                    first Mahometan invasion. The last of these dynasties, that of the Senas, or of
                    the Vaidyas, superseded its predecessor, the dynasty of the Pâlas, about the
                    middle of the 11th century. The most eminent of this dynasty, by name
                    Lakshmanasena, who flourished at the end of the century, is alleged in
                    inscriptions to have extended his conquests to Kanauj (in the Doab), to Nepaul,
                    and to the shores of Orissa; and this king is said by tradition to have founded
                    the royal city in Gauda which in later days reverted to a form of this ancient
                    name (Gaur), but which the founder called after his own name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lakshmanavati,</hi> or as it sounded in the popular speech <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lakhnaoti.</hi> The fifth from this king, according to Lassen’s (more or less
                    imperfect) list, Laksh-maniya (c. 1160-1198), transferred the royal residence to
                    Navadvipa, <hi rend="italic">hod.</hi> Nadiya (on the Hoogly river 70 miles
                    above Calcutta), possibly from apprehension of the rising tide of the Mahometan
                    power; but here it overtook him. Nadiya was taken about 1198-99 (the precise
                    date is disputed) by Mahommed Bakhtiyâr Khilji, the general of the slave king
                    Kutbuddin Aibak of Delhi, who became established as governor of Bengal, and
                    fixed his capital at Lakhnaoti. Here he and his captains are said to have
                    founded mosques, colleges, and monasteries. Lakhnaoti continued for the most
                    part to be the seat of the rulers who governed Bengal and Behar, sometimes as
                    confessed delegates of the Delhi sovereigns, sometimes as practically
                    independent kings, during the next 140 years. From about the year 1338, with the
                    waning power of the Delhi dynasties, the kingdom of Bengal acquired a
                    substantive independence which it retained for more than two centuries. One of
                    the earliest of the kings during this period, by name Iliyâs (Elias) Shâh, whose
                    descendants reigned in Bengal with brief interruptions for nearly 150 years,
                    transferred the seat of government to Pandua <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi> 1350), a
                    place about 16 miles N. by E. of Gaur, and to the neighbouring fortress of
                    Ekdâla, a place often named in Mahometan notices of the history of Bengal down
                    to the 16th century. At Pandua several kings in succession built mosques and
                    shrines, which still exhibit architecture of an importance <pb break="no"

                    oscillation the residence was again (c. 1446) transferred to Gaur, by which name
                    the city is generally known thenceforward, that of Lakhnaoti disappearing from
                    history. The 24th and last of those whom history recognizes as independent kings
                    of Bengal was Mahmùd Shâh (1533-4 to 1538-9). In his time the city more than
                    once changed hands, during the struggles between the Afghan Sher Shâh and the
                    (so-called) <hi rend="superscript"> fc</hi> Great Moghul” Humayùn, son of Bâber;
                    and on one occasion (1537-8), when Sher Shâh was operating against Gaur, we
                    first hear of the Portuguese in the inner waters of Bengal. A party of that
                    nation, who had been sent with presents to the court of Gaur, had been detained
                    as prisoners by the suspicious Mahmιid. But in the straits arising during his
                    resistance to Sher Shâh, the Frank prisoners were able to render him good
                    service.</p>
                <p>Mahmud was followed by several Pathân adventurers, who temporarily held the
                    provinces of the delta with more or less assertion of royal authority. One of
                    these, Suleimân Kirâni (1564-5), abandoned Gaur for Tanda, a place somewhat
                    nearer the Ganges. It is mentioned by Ralph Fitch, the earliest of English
                    travellers in India, who calls it “Tanda in the land of Gouren,” standing a
                    league from the Ganges. Mu’nim Khân, Khânkhânân, a general of Akbar’s, when
                    reducing these provinces in 1575, was attracted by the old site, and resolved to
                    re-adopt it as the seat of local government. But a great pestilence (probably
                    cholera) broke out at Gaur, and swept away thousands, the generalin-chief being
                    himself among the victims. On his death the deprived Pathân prince, Dâùd, set up
                    his standard again. But he was defeated by the forces of Akbar in a battle at
                    Rajmahl, and taken prisoner. After him no other assumed the style of king of
                    Bengal. Tanda continued for a short time to be the residence of the governors
                    under the “Great Moghuls,” but this was transferred successively to Rajmahl and
                    Dacca, in repeated alternation, and finally to Moorshedabad. Gaur cannot have
                    been entirely deserted, for the Nawab Shùjâ-uddïn, who governed Bengal 1725-
                    1739, built a new gate to the citadel. But in history Gaur is no longer heard
                    of, till its extensive remains attracted the curiosity of the English,—the more
                    readily as the northern end of the site approaches within 4 miles of the
                    important factory that was known as English Bazar (among the natives as
                    Angrezâbâd), which is said to have been built of bricks from the ruins, and
                    which is now the nucleus of the civil station of Maida.</p>
                <p>The first specific notice of the city of Gaur, from actual knowledge, is
                    contained in the Persian history called <hi rend="italic">Tabaqàt-i-Nàsirî,</hi>
                    which has been partially translated in Elliot’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                    India</hi> (ed. by Dowson), and is in course of complete translation by Major H.
                    G. Raverty. The author, Minhâj-i-Sarâj, visited Lakhnaoti in 1243, but the only
                    particular regarding the city that he mentions is that Ghiyâs-uddin ’Iwaz, the
                    fourth Mahometan ruler of Lakhnaoti (who called himself sultan, and according to
                    this writer, struck coin in his own name), besides founding mosques, &amp;c.,
                    carried embanked roads across the low country east and west of the city for a
                    space of ten days’ journey. These works in part still exist. “Radiating north,
                    south, and east of the city, .... embankments are to be traced running through
                    the suburbs, and extending in certain directions for 30 or 40 miles” (Ravenshaw,
                    p. 3).</p>
                <p>The extent of ground over which the remains of Gaur are spread is astonishing;
                    and a large part of it would appear to be still, as when described a century
                    ago, covered with dense wood or with rank jungle of grass and reeds, though in
                    later years cultivation has somewhat extended over the site. What may be called
                    the site of Gaur proper is a space of an oblong form, extending from north to
                    south 7∣ miles, with a breadth varying from 1∣ to 2 miles. This area is washed
                    on one of its long sides (the western) by a stream called the Bhagirathi, which
                    undoubtedly occupies a former bed of the Ganges (not to be confounded with the
                    Bhagirathi further south, contributing to form the Hoogly on which Calcutta
                    stands). Roughly parallel to the eastern side, but at a distance varying from 2
                    to 6 miles, runs the river Mahânanda, whilst extensive swamps and sheets of
                    water are interposed between this river and the city. The extensive area of
                    which we speak has been defended on north, west,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tlιis was so according to Buchanan; but Mr
                    Ravenshaw says “the western face is now open, and probably always was so, having
                    been well protected by the Ganges .... which ran under its walls.” The plans <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> show an <hi rend="italic">embankment</hi> on this side,
                    and Creighton gives a section of it, 30 feet high.</p></note> and south, by a
                    rampart and ditch, whilst on the east side there is a double embankment of great
                    size, with two ditches of immense width, and in some parts three. It is not
                    quite clear from the descriptions in what degree these latter great works were
                    intended respectively for defence or for protection from floods; but the latter
                    must have been the main purpose. The Ain-i-Akbari (c. 1590) alludes to the fact
                    that “if the earthen embankment broke, the town was under water.” The position
                    of the city, midway between two rivers of deltaic character, is low, and any
                    rise in those rivers would raise the level of the marshes. Still the mass of
                    these banks, as much as 200 feet thick at base, and 40 feet in height, is
                    greater than any present exposure to flood seems sufficient to explain. It has
                    sometimes been supposed that the Ganges, since the foundation of Gaur <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> has flowed to the eastward, in what is now the bed of
                    the Mahânanda. If thi3 were so, the massive character of the embankments would
                    be more intelligible. It would appear, however, that the positive testimony to
                    this circumstance, which was at one time supposed to exist, depended on a
                    mistaken reading of the passage, referred to above, of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tabaqat-i-Ndsim.</hi></p>

                <p>These great embankments have been originally faced throughout with masonry,
                    whilst the crest shows numerous traces of edifices; but the whole of the
                    earthworks are now overgrown with dense jungle. The Ganges now flows at a
                    distauce varying between 5 and 12 miles to the west of the enclosed area of the
                    city, but there seems to be no doubt that in the earlier centuries of its
                    occupation the great river washed its western wall, where now the Bhagirathi
                    flows.</p>
                <p>On this side, near the southern end, stood the citadel or royal fortress,
                    stretching for a mile along the river bank, and marked out by the remains of a
                    huge rampart of irregular trace, 180 feet wide at the base, and once faced with
                    masonry, with numerous circular bastions. Shapeless masses of ruin fill the
                    interior. The palace itself formed a rectangular inner enclosure of 2100 feet by
                    750, girt by a splendid brick wall, 18 feet thick at bottom, 8⅛ feet thick at
                    top, and 42 feet in height. To the northward the western embankment is prolonged
                    far beyond the northern limit of the city, and about 3 miles north of the latter
                    we encounter a vast line of earthwork stretching from the prolongation just
                    mentioned, in an irregular curve eastward and then south-eastward to the
                    vicinity of the Mahânanda river, in all for more than 6 miles. This also was
                    probably intended chiefly as a defence against inundation of the suburbs. A huge
                    excrescence protruding from the line, and overgrown with forest trees, encloses
                    an area of nearly a square mile, which tradition points out as the palace of one
                    of the Sena kings. Still north of this, and extending to the banks of the
                    Kalindri river, some 3 miles further, are found traces of ancient Hindu
                    buildings.</p>
                <p>Turning again to the southern extremity of Gaur, for 6 or 7 miles to the south of
                    the city there seems to have extended, still under the protection of a western
                    embankment, a continuous chain of suburbs. In the northern portion, at least, of
                    these, “prostrate domes, mingled with carved lintels and innumerable bricks, are
                    seen lying in confusion on all sides, and show how dense has been the
                    population” (Ravenshaw, p. 26). Thus from north to south, the whole extent of
                    ground bearing indications of urban occupancy is hardly less than 20 miles. We
                    may, however, feel confident that, as in the case of Delhi, these traces
                    comprehend a space within which the royal city occupied various localities in
                    various ages. Traditions, collected by Dr Francis Buchanan, placed the residence
                    of the older Sena kings on the sites at the extreme north near the Kalindri. The
                    southern part of the fortified area of Gaur, with the citadel and palace, was
                    evidently, as we shall see from the dates of the buildings, the seat of the
                    later kings who immediately preceded the absorption of Bengal into the Moghul
                    empire in the last half of the 16th century. The exact site occupied by Mahommed
                    Bakhtiyâr Khilji and his successors does not seem to have been determined.</p>
                <p>Throughout the interior length of Gaur run embanked roads, whilst the whole area
                    is thickly dotted with excavated tanks of all sises, up to the great <hi
                    rend="italic">Sagar</hi><hi rend="italic">Dighî</hi> (or “Ocean Tank ”), a
                    rectangular sheet of water measuring little short of a mile by half a mile. This
                    vast work is probably to be referred to the Hindu age. The former existence of
                    six ghauts of masonry can be traced on its banks, which are densely wooded to
                    the water’s edge. Numerous excavated channeh also run in every direction, the
                    earth from which appears to have served to raise the inhabited surface. The
                    remaining buildings of importance are scattered at wide intervals over the area,
                    but the soil is throughout covered with fragments o <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi>
                    f brick, &amp;c., in a manner which leaves no doubt of the former density of
                    population. But Gaur has repeatedly been a quarry of building material. The old
                    Lakhnaoti was robbed to build the mediaeval capital of Pandua, and the later
                    Gaur probably to build Rajmahl, whilst in more recent times their brick and
                    stone were transported as merchandise to Maida, Moorshedabad, Hoogly, Rungpore,
                    and even (as regards the more valuable kinds of stone) to Calcutta. In the
                    revenue returns of Bengal, at the time of its transfer to the Company, there was
                    an entry of an annual levy of 8000 rupees, as “Gaur brick royalty,” from
                    landholders in the neighbourhood of Gaur who had the exclusive right of
                    dismantling its remains. The bricks of Gaur, Rennell says, are of extraordinary
                    solidity of texture and sharpness of edge. The facilities which the site affords
                    for water carriage during the rainy season greatly aided this systematic
                    spoliation. That no Hindu buildings remain from the earlier cities is probably
                    to be accounted for by this process of destruction.</p>
                <p>We have quoted a Mahometan visitor to Gaur in the middle of the 13th century. The
                    next such mention perhaps occurs in the travels of the Venetian Nicolo Conti,
                    who somewhat early in the 14th century ascended the Ganges 15 days’ voyage to a
                    city of great size and wealth called <hi rend="italic">Cernove.</hi> On both
                    banks of the stream were most charming villas, and plantations, and gardens. The

                    Gaur. A more detailed and certain account is given by De Barros, when describing
                    the adventures of the Portuguese party in 1537-38, to which allusion has been
                    made above (dec. iv. liv. ix. cap. i.):—</p>

                    the landward faces a wall of stone and lime of great height, besides having,
                    where the river comes not, a great ditch full of water, in which great boats can
                    swim. The streets are broad and straight, and the main streets have trees
                    planted in rows along the walls, to give shade to the passengers. And the
                    population is so great, and the streets so thronged with the concourse and
                    traffic of people, especially of such as come to present themselves at the
                    king’s court, that they cannot force their way past one another, and thus such
                    as hap to fall among the horsemen, or among the elephants which are ridden by
                    the lords and noblemen, are often killed on the spot, and crashed under the feet
                    of those beasts. A great part of the houses of this city are stately and well
                    wrought buildings.”</p>
                <p>The earliest detailed notice of the ruins that we hear of is a MS. one, by Mr
                    Reuben Burrows, the mathematician (1787), which is quoted by the editor of
                    Creighton’s drawings as being in the India Library. Rennell gives some account
                    of the ruins in his <hi rend="italic">Metnoir of a Map of Hindustan</hi> (1788),
                    and the plan of them is roughly laid down, on a small scale, in his Bengal Atlas
                    (No. 15). Mr Henry Creighton, who for many years managed an indigo factory among
                    the ruins (1786-1806), made many drawings of them, with notes and a detailed
                    map, on a large scale. Dr Buchanan states that engravings from Creighton’s
                    drawings had been published by a Mr Moffat in Calcutta before the compilation of
                    his own statistical work. Of this we have seen no copy. It is probably the same
                    as “the set of eight views of the ruins of Gour and Rajmehal,” which is
                    advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Calcutta Gazette,</hi> 6th December 1798
                    (see Seton-Karr’s <hi rend="italic">Selections,</hi> vol. iii. p. 529). A work,
                    however, was published in London in 1817, from the materials left by Mr
                    Creighton, called the <hi rend="italic">Ruins ofGour Described,</hi> Ac.; and
                    this contained the most accessible data on the subject till Mr Ravenshaws work.
                    There is in the India Office a MS. volume (1810) by Major William Francklin of
                    the Bengal army, containing notices of the remains and translations of a good
                    many <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n124/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0124-0115"/> inscriptions. The MS. purports to have been
                    accompanied by maps and drawings, but these are not now forthcoming. Dr Francis
                    Buchanan has described the remains, with his usual somewhat dry precision, in
                    his statistical survey of northern Bengal and Behar, executed between 1809 and
                    1816, but only published, with a title-page that bears the name of Montgomery
                    Martin, and no reference to the real .author, in 1838 <hi rend="italic">(Pastern
                    India,</hi> &amp;c., vol. iii. pp. 68 <hi rend="italic">s&lt;p).</hi> Mr James
                    Fergusson has a short chapter, containing the only critical account of the
                    architecture of Gaur, in his <hi rend="italic">History of Indian
                    Architecture.</hi> Lastly, since the greater part of this article was compiled,
                    there has been published a splendid volume <hi rend="italic">(Gaur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">: its Ruins and Inscriptions,</hi> 4to) from the photographs and
                    notes of the late J. A. Ravenshaw of the Bengal Civil Service.</p>
                <p>Before concluding we may indicate a few of the most notable remaining
                    buildings.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">1. J3πq</hi> of the most pleasing remains, as regards
                    architectural desig⅛, is a minaret or tower of stone and brick, standing
                    immediately west of the citadel. It is 84 feet in height and 21 in diameter at
                    the base. For two-thirds of the height the form is that of a 12-sided polygon,
                    and above that circular, the two forms being divided by a bold cornice. There is
                    now no inscription attached, but tradition assigns it to Firoz Shah, and a
                    native history of Bengal compiled in the last century attributes it specifically
                    to a king of that name, who reigned 1488-1490. Mr Fergusson indeed considers the
                    architecture to belong to an earlier period; and it is remarkable that the
                    researches of Mr E. Thomas in coins, and of the late Mr Henry Blochιnann in
                    lapidary inscriptions, have recently established the existence of a King
                    Shamsuddin Firoz, whose coinage at Lakhnaoti shows his reign to have extended
                    from 1302 to 1318. Ifthework be really due to this prince, it is by much the
                    oldest building of importance now remaining at Gaur. But the point is very
                    doubtful.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Bdkhil Dαrwdzα,</hi> or Gate of Entrance, is the
                    northern gate of the citadel. It is a noble structure, though entirely built of
                    small bricks. The tunnel under the rampart is 112 feet long by 14 wide, and the
                    height of the archway is 34 feet. An inscription copied by Francklin ascribes
                    the work to Barbak Shah, and the erection to 1466. The grandiose palace wall is
                    believed to be of the same period.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Lattaη{l),</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Painted
                    Masjid,</hi> a quadrangular edifice in the southern part of the city, cased
                    inside and out with bricks beautifully enamelled in blue, green, and white. It
                    is covered by one large dome. The work is ascribed to 1470-1481.</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">Tdnti-Pdra Masjid,</hi> or Mosque of the Weaver’s
                    Quarter. This is now much dilapidated, but Ravenshaw’s photograph indicates it
                    to have been one of the most beautiful buildings in Gaur. The niched panels in
                    carved brickwork which adorn its piers are very rich and delicate. It is also,
                    if an inscription given by Francklin be justly assigned to it, the work of Yùsuf
                    Shah, 1475-76.</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">Sοna Masjid,</hi> or Golden Mosque. This is probably the
                    most important structure remaining at Gaur. It stands in the city to the north
                    of the citadel, within a spacious court enclosed by a stone wall. The material
                    is described as a dark grey stone, approaching to black, with sculpture in
                    beautiful flower-work. The mosque measures 180 feet by 80, and the interior
                    architecture consists of massive intersecting arcades, each intersection being
                    covered by a dome, of which domes there were 44 altogether. In spite of the
                    extraordinary solidity of the building it appears to have suffered greatly since
                    Francklin described it in 1810. The date is fixed by an inscription which
                    existed in his time to 1525.</p>
                <p>6. Tombs of Shah Husain (d. 1521), and of his son Nasrat Shah, the builder of No.
                    5 (d. 1533-34). Of the tombs themselves nothing remains, and their materials are
                    said to have been carried to Fort William in the last century. In Creighton’s
                    time, though the tomb of Husain Shah was already gone, there remained a
                    beautiful edifice which had formed the gateway of the enclosure, faced with
                    brick-work richly moulded, and glazed with blue and white. Of Shah Husain
                    (reigned 1494-1521) Dr Blochmann says, “Whilst the names of other Bengal kings
                    scarcely ever occur in legends, and remain even unrecognized in the geographical
                    names of the country, the name of ‘ Husain Shah the Good ’ is still remembered
                    from the frontier of Orisa to the Brahmaputra” <hi rend="italic">(Proc. As. Soc.
                    Bengal,</hi> 1873, p. 291).</p>
                <p>7. The mosque of the <hi rend="italic">Qadam Rasdl,</hi> or Footstep of the
                    Prophet, so named from a representation of Mahomet’s footmark in stone which was
                    formerly enshrined there. The work of Nasrat Shah, 1530.</p>
                <p>We thus see that all the buildings, with the very doubtful exception of the
                    minaret, go back no further than the last half of the 15th century. If the age
                    of the architecture is disappointing, the better knowledge of details which we
                    derive from Mr Ravenshaw’s book enhances our appreciation of it. The buildings
                    are in brick, in stone, and in both combined. Excepting the great gateways, they
                    lack height enough for stateliness; the character is rather decorated solidity.
                    The façades generally present a series of pointed arches, with very massive
                    piers between, which are sometimes complicated polygons, but more usually
                    rectangular; the mouldings have little relief, but the surfaces are adorned with
                    panels filled with beautiful “embossed brick-work.” These seem to be rich floral
                    patterns moulded in terra cotta, and probably finished with the chisel. The
                    curvilinear roof, imitated from the use of the bamboo, of which Mr Fergusson
                    speaks as an unpleasing characteristic of architecture in Bengal, is little seeD
                    in Gaur,—almost the only indication of it being a slight upward camber in the
                    upper lines of the façade, in which the versed-sine is about A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th of the chord. In some of the buildings great
                    brilliance has been produced by the profuse use of encaustic tiles in bright
                    colours. The art of making these exists now in India nowhere nearer than in
                    Sind; but indeed the manufacture of terra cotta, or of ordinary brick of the
                    superior character which Rennell attributes to Gaur, is equally a lost art in
                    Bengal. Where the facing is entirely of stone, as in the Great Golden Mosque,
                    and in a smaller one bearing the same name, the ornamentation seems imitated
                    from the terra-cotta work; the relief, however, is much less, owing probably to
                    the hardness of the material. What this material is, or whence, is not quite
                    clear. The older accounts speak of black and other marbles; Buchanan and later
                    writers of “black hornblende,” “potstone,” and what not; Mr Ravenshaw, in the
                    case of one building, of “granite and marbles.’’ The black stone is probably
                    basalt from the Raj mahl hills, but more precise information is desirable.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, we may notice briefly the other neighbouring sites occupied as
                    capitals, which may be regarded as appendages of Gaur.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">PanduM,</hi> commonly called <hi rend="italic">Parruah</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Porruah,</hi> was so occupied, with occasional intervals, for
                    nearly a century. Its ruins and tanks extend over a narrow area of nearly 6
                    miles in length, which is now more of a wilderness than even the site of Gaur.
                    The high road from Maida to Dinajpore passes through it from end to end, but the
                    forest which besets the ruins is so dense on both sides, and so infested with
                    tigers, that single travellers shun the road by night. Mr Ravenshaw employed a
                    gang of 200 men to clear the jungle for his photographs, but even then could
                    only get partial views. The buildings exhibit the same general character as at
                    Gaur, but most of them are older, and seem (for most of them are absolutely
                    overgrown and penetrated by jungle-growth) to show the style in afreer and purer
                    form. Many of them also contain fragments of older Hindu buildings, very
                    probably pillaged from old Lakhnaoti. By far the finest and most important
                    building in the whole Gaur group of cities, and indeed in Bengal, is the Adιna
                    mosque at Pandua, standing close to the highroad. It is a quadrangular cloister
                    of two stories, measuring externally 500 feet by 300, of brickwork faced
                    throughout with <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> ‘ black hornblende.” The
                    cloisters are divided by pillars into intersecting aisles, and each intersection
                    has been covered by a dome. Of these domes there have been originally 375, but
                    most have fallen. According to Buchanan’s description the carved windows have
                    been borrowed from Buddhist structures, but judging from the poordraw-ingswhich
                    he gives,and from the photographsof Mr Ravenshawmade under great difficulties,
                    the combination has been carried out with good artistic effect. The edifice must
                    no doubt be monotonous, but from what we can see is far from deserving the
                    condemnation which Buchanan passes on it. The Adina is the work of Sikandar
                    Shah, the son of Iliyas (1358-1390), and his tomb is in an adjunct of the
                    mosque. There is a curious notice of it in Valentijn’s (Dutch) <hi rend="italic"

                    ruled at Pandua, has been lately identified by Mr E. V. Westmaeott as still
                    bearing the name, near Chiramon, in the Dinajpore district, about 20 miles north
                    of Pandua. It stands on high ground rising like an island out of the inundated
                    plain; it exhibits traces of embankments and buildings, and is about 5 miles
                    distant from one of the ancient embanked roads running towards Pandua and Gam·.
