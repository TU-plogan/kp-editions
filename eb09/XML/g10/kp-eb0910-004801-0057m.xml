                    fifty of these pages being occupied by researches on the resolubility of
                    algebraic equations by radicals. But these researches, crowning as it were the
                    previous labours of Lagrange, Gauss, and Abel, have in a signal manner advanced
                    the theory, and it is not too much to say that they are the foundation of all
                    that has since been done, or is doing, in the subject. The fundamental notion
                    consists in the establishment of a group of permutations of the roots of an
                    equation, such that every function of the roots invariable by the substitutions
                    of the group is rationally known, and reciprocally that every rationally
                    determinable function of the roots is invariable by the substitutions of the
                    groups; some further explanation of the theorem, and in connexion with it an
                    explanation of the notion of an adjoint radical, is given under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Equation,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">No.</hi> 32. As part of the
                    theory (but the investigation has a very high independent value as regards the
                    Theory of Numbers, to which it properly belongs), Galois introduces the notion
                    of the imaginary roots of an irreducible congruence of a degree superior to
                    unity; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> such a congruence, F(a;) = 0 (mod. a prime
                    number <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">),</hi> has no integer root; but what is done is to introduce a
                    quantity <hi rend="italic">i</hi> subjected to the condition of verifying the
                    congruence in question, F(t)≡l (mod. <hi rend="italic">ρ),</hi> which quantity
                    <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is an imaginary of an entirely new kind, occupying in
                    the theory of numbers a position analogous to that of - √TT in algebra.</p>
                <p>G ALU PPI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Baldassarre</hi> (1706-1785), a musical composer,
                    was born in 1706, in the island of Burano, near Venice. His father, a barber by
                    profession, was a musical amateur, and prepared his son for the music school of
                    Venice called Conservatorio degi’ Incurabili, where the great Lotti became hi3
                    master. His first opera, written at the age cf sixteen, was a failure; but his
                    comic opera named <hi rend="italic">Dorvnda,</hi> produced seven years later,
                    was a great success, and laid the foundation of the youthful composer’s fame. He
                    was a prolific writer, and no less than seventy of his operas are enumerated,
                    none of which, however, have kept the stage. Some of these were written for
                    London, where Galuppi resided between 1741 and 1744, but his masterpiece in
                    tragic opera was produced at St Petersburg in 1766. The composer had been
                    induced by liberal offers to accept a position as imperial conductor of music,
                    and to leave his native country for Russia, where he lived in high honour at the
                    court of the czar, and is said to have in return done much for the progress of
                    his art in Russia by introducing amongst other things Italian church-music. In
                    1768 he left Russia, and resumed his position as organist of the cathedral of St
                    Mark at Venice, to which he had been appointed in 1762, and which had been kept
                    open for him during his absence. He died in 1785, and left 50,000 lire to the
                    poor of Venice. His best comic opera bears the title <hi rend="italic">II mondo
                    della luna.</hi> The libraries of Dresden and Vienna preserve several of his
                    operas in MS. At Vienna also some of his works of sacred music may be found.
                    Others are in Paris and Rome.</p>
