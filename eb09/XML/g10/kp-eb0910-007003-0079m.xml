                    type="authorial"><p>The phrase <hi rend="italic">ganotes boe8</hi> (Gannet’s
                    bath), a periphrasis for the sea, occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Saxon
                    Chronicle,</hi> in reference to events which took place 975 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a,d.,</hi> as pointed, out by Prof. Cunningham, whose learned treatise on this
                    bird <hi rend="italic">Cbis,</hi> 1866, p. 1) nearly exhausts all that can be
                    said of its history and habits. A few pages further on (p. 13) this writer
                    remarks :—“The name Gannet is intimately connected with our modern English
                    Gander, both words being modifications of the ancient British " <hi
                    rend="superscript"> k</hi> gan ’ or ‘ gans, ’ which is the same word with the
                    modem German ‘Gans,’ which in its turn corresponds with the old High German ‘
                    Kans,’ the Greek χ¼, the Latin <hi rend="italic">anser,</hi> and the Sanskrit ‘
                    hansa, ’ all of which possess the same signification, viz., a Goose. The origin
                    of the names Solan or Soland, Sulan, Sula, and Haf-sula, which are evidently all
                    closely related, is not so obvious. Martin <hi rend="italic">[Voy. St.
                    Hilda]</hi> informs us that ‘ some imagine that the word Solan comes from the
                    Irish Souler, corrupted and adapted to the Scottish language, <hi rend="italic"
                    >qui oculis irretortis e longinquo respiciat</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >proedarn.'</hi> The earlier writers in general derive the word from the Latin
                    <hi rend="italic">solea,</hi> in consequence of the bird’s supposed habit of
                    hatching its egg with its foot; and in a note intercalated into Ray’s
                    description of the Solan Goose in the edition of his Itineraries published by
                    the Ray Society, and edited by Dr Lankester, we are told, though no authority
                    for the statement is given, that ‘ the Gannet, <hi rend="italic">Sιιla
                    alba,</hi> should be written Solent Goose, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a
                    channel goose.’” Hereon an editorial note remarks that this last statement
                    appears to have been a suggestion of YarrelΓs, and that it seems at least as
                    possible that the “Solent” took its name from the bird.</p></note> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pelecanus</hi><hi rend="italic">bassanus</hi> of Linnaeus and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sula bassanα</hi> of modern ornithologists, a large sea-fowl
                    long known as a numerous visitor, for the purpose of breeding, to the Bass Rock
                    at the entrance of the Firth of Forth, and to certain other islands off the
                    coast of Britain, of which four are in Scottish waters—namely, Ailsa Craig, at
                    the mouth of the Firth of Clyde; the group known collectively as St Kilda;
                    Suleskerry, some 40 miles north-east of the Butt of Lewis; and the Stack and
                    Skerry, about the same distance westward of Stromness. It appears also to have
                    two stations off the coast of Ireland, the Skellig Islands and the Stags of
                    Broadhaven, and it resorts besides to Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel—its
                    only English breeding-place. Further to the northward its settlements are
                    Myggenaes, the most westerly of the Faroes, and various small islands off the
                    coast of Iceland, of which the Vestmannaeyjar, the Reykjanes Fuglaskér, and
                    Grimsey are the chief. On the western side of the Atlantic it appears to have
                    but five stations, one in the Bay of Fundy, and four rocks in the Gulf of St
                    Lawrence. On all these seventeen places the bird arrives about the end of March
                    or in April and departs in autumn when its young are ready to fly; but even
                    during the breeding-season many of the adults may be seen on their fishing
                    excursions at a vast distance from their home, while at other times of the year
                    their range is greater still, for they not only frequent the North Sea and the
                    English Channel, but stray to the Baltic, and, in winter, extend their flight to
                    the Madeiras, while the members of the species of American birth traverse the
                    ocean from the shores of Greenland to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
                <p>Apparently as bulky as a Goose, and with longer wings and tail, the Gannet weighs
                    considerably less. The plumage of the adult is white, tinged on the head and
                    neck with buff, while the outer edge and principal quills of the wing are black,
                    and some bare spaces round the eyes and on the throat reveal a dark blue skin.
                    The first plumage of the young is of a deep brown above, but paler beneath, and
                    each feather is tipped with a triangular white spot. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n80/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0080-0071"/> nest is a shallow depression, either on the
                    ground itself or on a pile of turf, grass, and seaweed—which last is often
                    conveyed from a great distance. The single egg it contains has a white shell of
                    the same chalky character as a Cormorant’s (vol. vi, p. 407). The young are
                    hatched blind and naked, but the slate-coloured skin with which their body is
                    covered is soon clothed with white down, replaced in due time by true feathers
                    of the dark colour already mentioned. The mature plumage is believed not to be
                    attained for some three years. Towards the end of summer the majority of
                    Gannets, both old and young, leave the neighbourhood of their breeding-place,
                    and, betaking themselves to the open sea, follow the shoals of herrings and
                    other fishes (the presence of which they are most useful in indicating to
                    fishermen) to a great distance from land. Their prey is almost invariably
                    captured by plunging upon it from, a height, and a company of Gannets fishing
                    presents a curious and interesting spectacle. Flying in a line, each bird, when
                    it comes over the shoal, closes its wings and dashes perpendicularly into the
                    waves, whence it emerges after a few seconds, and, shaking the water from its
                    feathers, mounts in a wide curve, and orderly takes its place in the rear of the
                    string, to repeat its headlong plunge so soon as it again finds itself above its
                    prey.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The large number
                    of Gannets, and the vast quantity of fish they take, lias been frequently
                    animadverted upon, but the computations on this last point are perhaps
                    fallacious. It seems to be certain that in former days fishes, and herrings in
                    particular, were at least as plentiful as now, if not more so, notwithstanding
                    that Gannets were more numerous. Those frequenting the Bass were reckoned by
                    Macgillivray at 20,000 in 1831, while in 1869 they were computed at 12,000,
                    showing a decrease of two-fifths in 38 years. On Ailsa in 1869 there were
                    supposed to be as many as on the Bass, but their number was estimated at 10,000
                    in 1877 <hi rend="italic">(Report on the Herring Fisheries of Scotland,</hi>
                    1878, pp. xxv. and 171),—being a diminution of one-sixth in eight years, or
                    nearly twice as great as on the Bass.</p></note></p>
                <p>Structurally the Gannet presents many points worthy of note, such as its closed
                    nostrils, its aborted tongue, and its toes all connected by a web—characters
                    which it possesses in common with most of the other members of the group of
                    birds <hi rend="italic">(Steganopodes)</hi> to which it belongs. But more
                    remarkable still is the system of subcutaneous air-cells, some of large size,
                    ’pervading almost the whole surface of the body, communicating with the lungs,
                    and capable of being inflated or emptied at the will of the bird. This
                    peculiarity has attracted the attention of several writers— Montagu, Professor
                    Owen <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Soc.,</hi> 1831, p. 90), and Macgillivray;
                    but a full and particular account of the anatomy of the Gannet is still to be
                    desired.</p>
                <p>In the southern hemisphere the Gannet is represented by two nearly allied but
                    somewhat smaller forms—one, <hi rend="italic">Sula capensis,</hi> inhabiting the
                    coast of South Africa, and the other, <hi rend="italic">S.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >serrator,</hi> the Australian seas. Both much resemble the northern bird, but
                    the former seems to have a permanently black tail, and the latter a tail the
                    four middle feathers of which are blackish-brown with white shafts.</p>
                <p>Apparently inseparable from the Gannets generically are the smaller birds well
                    known to sailors as Boobies from the extraordinary stupidity they commonly
                    display. They differ, however, in having no median stripe of bare skin down the
                    front of the throat; they almost invariably breed upon trees, and are
                    inhabitants of warmer climates. One of them, <hi rend="italic">S. cyanops,</hi>
                    when adult has much of the aspect of a Gannet, but <hi rend="italic">S.
                    piscator</hi> is readily distinguishable by its red legs, and £ <hi
                    rend="italic">leucogaster</hi> by its upper plumage and neck of deep brown.
                    These three are widely distributed within the tropics, and are in some places
                    exceedingly abundant. The fourth, N. <hi rend="italic">variegata,</hi> which
                    seems to preserve throughout its life the spotted suit characteristic of the
                    immature <hi rend="italic">S. bassana,</hi> has a much more limited range, being
                    as yet only known from the coast of Peru, where it is one of the birds which
                    contribute to the formation of guano. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
