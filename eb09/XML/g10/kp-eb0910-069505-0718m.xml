                <p><label type="entry">GLUTEN</label>, a tough, tenacious, ductile, somewhat
                    elastic, nearly tasteless, and greyish-yellow albuminous substance, obtained
                    from the flour of wheat by washing in water, in which it is insoluble. In
                    Martin’s apparatus for the preparation of gluten on the large scale, balls of
                    dough are worked backwards and forwards in troughs by means of cylinders, whilst
                    water plays upon them in fine jets delivered by copper pipes. A sack of flouι∙
                    may be thus made to yield about 110 lb of moist gluten, and twice that quantity
                    of dry starch. Good samples of white English wheat contain some 10 or 11 per
                    cent, of gluten; from hard Venezuela wheat as much as 22 ’ 75 per cent, has been
                    procured. The outer and inner coats of wheat, separated from it as bran, contain
                    respectively 4 or 5 and 14 to 20 per cent, of gluten. Gluten, when dried, loses
                    about two-thirds of its weight, becomingbrittle and semi-transparent; when
                    strongly heated it crackles and swells, and burns like feather or horn. It is
                    soluble in strong acetic acid, and in caustic alkalies, which latter may be used
                    for the purification of starch in which it is present. When treated with ’ 1 to
                    ’ 2 per cent, solution of hydrochloric acid it swells up, and at length forms a
                    liquid resembling a solution of albumin, and laevorotatory as regards polarized
                    light. Moistened with water and exposed to the air gluten putrefies, and evolves
                    carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and sulphuretted hydrogen, and in the end is almost
                    entirely resolved into a liquid, which contains leucin and ammonium phosphate
                    and acetate. On analysis gluten shows a composition of about 53 per cent, of
                    carbon, 7 per cent, of hydrogen, and nitrogen 15 to 18 per cent., besides
                    oxygen, and about 1 per cent, of sulphur, and a small quantity of inorganic
                    matter. It is uot a <pb break="no"

                    >glutin</hi> or vegetable gelatin, and <hi rend="italic">mucedin,</hi> which are
                    all closely allied to one another in chemical composition. It is the gliadin
                    which confers upon gluten its capacity of cohering to form elastic masses, and
                    of separating readily from associated starch. Iu the so-called gluten of the
                    flour of barley, rye, and maize, this body is absent (Kreusler and Ritthausen).
                    The gluten yielded by wheat which has undergone fermentation or has begun to
                    sprout is devoid of toughness and elasticity. These qualities can be restored to
                    it by kneading with salt, lime-water, or alum. Koopmans found that a larger
                    amount of raw gluten was digested in a relatively dilute than in a strong
                    artificial gastric juice, the reverse holding good of albumin. From experiments
                    on six pigs and three dogs, he came to the conclusion that the digestive fluid
                    in the stomachs of living animals, even of the same species, dissolves unlike
                    quantities of albumin and gluten, so that if much albumin be digested the loss
                    of weight of gluten present with it is but small, and <hi rend="italic">vice

                    biscuits for the diabetic (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Diabetes,</hi> vol. vii. p.
                    148), and of chocolate, and also in the adulteration of tea and coffee. For
                    making bread it must be used fresh, as otherwise it decomposes, and does not
                    knead well. Granulated gluten is a kind of vermicelli, made in some starch
                    manufactories by mixing fresh gluten with twice its weight of flour, and
                    granulating by means of a cylinder and contained stirrer, each armed with
                    spikes, and revolving in •opposite directions. The process is <hi
