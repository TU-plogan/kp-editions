                    Leontes, the extreme length being about 60 miles, the extreme breadth 30, and
                    the area 1000 square miles. The Galilee thus defined, however, though doubtless
                    the Galilee of Herod’s tetrarchy and of later centuries, was hardly that of
                    ordinary parlance at the beginning of the Christian era. Josephus himself, while
                    substantially giving these boundaries <hi rend="italic">(B. J.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic                     subscript"> i</hi> iii. 3, 1, and elsewhere),
                    yet incidentally in one place speaks of Upper Galilee as constituting the whole
                    of Galilee proper <hi rend="italic">(Ant. XX.</hi> 6, 1), and elsewhere in
                    giving Xaloth (Iksal) and Dabaratta (Debûrieh) as boundary towns, seems to
                    exclude from Galilee the plain of Esdraelon. In the early period of the history
                    of Israel, the word ½⅜ or Γ⅛*⅛ meaning a circle, was hardly a proper name at
                    all, but was applied to several districts with considerable generality. Thus in
                    Josh, xiii. 2 and Joel iv. 4 reference is made to the “borders” or “coasts”
                    (Geliloth) of the Philistines. In Josh. xxii. 10, 11, however, the “Geliloth” of
                    Jordan means the plain of Jordan referred to in Ezekiel xlvii. 8 as “the eastern
                    Gelilah” (compare Josh, xviii. <hi rend="italic">7);</hi> while in Josh. XX. 7,
                    xxi. 32, hag-Galil denotes the north portion of the territory of Naphtali
                    westward of Merom, where Kadesh, one of the six cities of refuge, lay. Here were
                    situated the twenty “worthless” cities which Solomon gave to Hiram (1 Kings ix.
                    11; 2 Chr. viii. <hi rend="italic">2);</hi> and here, notwithstanding the
                    conquests made successively by Joshua, several of the judges, David, and
                    Solomon, the population seems to have retained a prevailingly ethnic character;
                    for even in Isaiah’s time “the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali” is
                    called “Galilee of the Gentiles” (Isa. ix. 1). After the deportation by Tiglath
                    Pileser (2 Kings XV. 29), in which it is to be presumed that chiefly Israelites
                    were carried away, this ethnic character would most probably be intensified and
                    extended rather than diminished either in area or in amount; and already in the
                    time of the Maccabees, accordingly, we find the word apparently used in a
                    considerably wider sense than in earlier times (1 Macc. v. 14, 15, x. 30; <hi
                    rend="italic">cf.</hi> Tob. i. 2). The later extension of the designation cannot
                    be more particularly traced, but we know with considerable exactness what the
                    limits were at the time 'of the Talmudists. The southern boundary was defined by
                    the towns of Bethshean (Beisân), Ginaea (Jenîn), Caphar Utheni (Kefr Adân), and
                    by the ridge of Carmel; on the east the Jordan formed the limit; while on the
                    west and north the line ran from Carmel to Accho (Akka), and thence ascended
                    eastwards by a great valley just south of Achzib (ez Zib) extending 8 miles,
                    past Kabartha (el Kâbry), Gathin (J’athûn), and Beth Zanita (Zueinita), to
                    Gelila (Jelil), where it turned north near M’alia, probably the Melloth which
                    Josephus notices as on his boundary (Ae «Λ, iii. 3, 1). From Melloth it ran 12
                    miles north to Kania and Aiya (probably Kânah and ’ Aiya), and then appears to
                    have run east along a high ridge by Berii and Tirii (Beriâs and Tireh), and
                    thence, after a course of 5 miles, it trended north-east by Tifni (Tibnin),
                    Sifneta (Safed el Battîkh), Ailshitha (’Atshith), and Aulam (Almôn), arriving
                    thus at the deep gorge of the Leontes. Turning east it passed Migdol Kherub (el
                    Khurbeh) and the “hollow of Ayun” (Merj ’Ayûn), past Takra (unknown) to Tortalga
                    (“the snowy mountain,” or Hermon), and to Kisrin and the bounds of Iitir—that
                    is, to Caesarea Philippi (now Bânias), and thus to beyond Jordan. The boundary
                    between Upper and Lower Galilee was natural, being marked on the east by the
                    town of Caphar Hananya (Kefr ’Anân), situated at the foot of the high ridge
                    which formed the actual line; Bersobe, on the same boundary (Josephus, <hi
                    rend="italic">B. J.,</hi> iii. 3, 1), is not as yet known.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lower Galilee.—</hi> The whole of Galilee presents country more
                    or less disturbed by volcanic action. In the lower division the hills are all
                    tilted up towards the east, and broad streams of lava have flowed over the
                    plateau above the sea of Galilee. In this district the highest hills are only
                    about 1800 feet above the sea. The ridge of Nazareth rises north of the great
                    plain of Esdraelon, and north of this again is the fertile basin of the Buttauf,
                    separated from the seacoast plains by low hills. East of the Buttauf extends the
                    basaltic plateau called el Ahma (“the inaccessible ”), rising 1700 feet above
                    the sea of Galilee. North of the Buttauf is a confused hill country, the spurs
                    falling towards a broad valley which lies at the foot of the mountains of Upper
                    Galilee. This broad valley, running westwards to the coast, is the old boundary
                    of Zebulun—the valley of Jiphthah-el (Josh. xix. 14). The great plain of
                    Esdraelon is of triangular form, bounded by Gilboa on the east and by the ridge
                    which runs to Carmel on the west. It is 14 miles long from Jenin to the Nazareth
                    hills, and has a mean measurement of 9 miles east and west. It rises 200 feet
                    above the sea, the hills on both sides being some 1500 feet higher. The whole
                    drainage is collected by the Kishon, which runs through a narrow gorge at the
                    north-west corner of the plain, descending beside the ridge of Carmel to the
                    sea. The broad valley of Jezreel on the east, descending towards the Jordan
                    valley, forms the gate by which Palestine is entered from beyond Jordan. Mount
                    Tabor stands isolated <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n37/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0037-0028"/> in the plain at the north-east corner, and rather
                    further south the conical hill called Neby Duhy rises between Tabor and Gilboa.
                    The whole of Lower Galilee is well watered. The Kishon is fed by springs from
                    near Tabor and from a copious stream from the west side of the plain of
                    Esdraelon. North-west of Nazareth is Wâdy el Melek, an open valley full of
                    springs. The river Belus, just south of Acre, rising in the sea-coast marshes,
                    drains the whole valley of Jiphthah-el. On the east the broad valley of Jezreel
                    is full of magnificent springs, many of which are thermal. The plains of
                    Esdraelon, and the Buttauf, and the plateau of el Ahma, are all remarkable for
                    the rich basaltic soil which covers them, in which corn, cotton, maize, sesame,
                    tobacco, millet, and various kinds of vegetable are grown, while indigo and
                    sugar-cane were cultivated in former times. The Nazareth hills and Gilboa are
                    bare and white, but west of Nazareth is a fine oak wood, and another thick wood
                    spreads over the northern slopes of Tabor. The hills west of the great plain are
                    partly of bare white chalk, partly covered with dense thickets. The mountains
                    north of the Buttauf are rugged and covered with scrub, except near the
                    villages, where fine olive groves exist. The principal places of importance in
                    Lower Galilee are Nazareth (10,000 inhabitants), Sepphoris (now Seffûrieh), a
                    large village standing above the Buttauf on the spurs of the southern hills, and
                    Jenîn (En Gannim), a flourishing village, with a palm garden (3000 inhabitants).
                    The ancient capital, Jezreel (Zerin), is now a miserable village on a
                    precipitous spur of Gilboa; north of this are the small mud hamlets, Solam
                    (Shunem), Endûr (Endor), Nein (Nain); on the west side of the plain is the ruin
                    of Lejjûn (the Legio of the 4th century, which was then a place of importance).
                    In the hills north of the Buttauf is Jefât, situated on a steep hilltop, and
                    representing the Jotapata defended by Josephus. Kefr Kenna, now a flourishing
                    Christian village at the foot of the Nazareth hills, south of the Buttauf,
                    represents the probable site of Cana of Galilee, and the ruin Kâna, on the north
                    side of the same plain, represents the site pointed out to the pilgrims of the
                    12th and 13th centuries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Upper Galilee.—</hi> The mountains are tilted up towards the
                    sea of Galilee, and the drainage of the district is towards the north-west. On
                    the south the rocky range of Jebel Jermûk rises to 4000 feet above the sea; on
                    the east a narrow ridge 2800 feet high forms the watershed, with steep eastern
                    slopes falling towards Jordan. Immediately west of the watershed are two small
                    plateaus, covered with basaltic debris, near el Jish and Kades. On the west are
                    rugged mountains with deep intricate valleys. The main drains of the country
                    are—first, Wâdy el ’Ayûn, rising north of Jebel Jermûk, and running north-west
                    as an open valley, and secondly, Wâdy el Ahjâr, a rugged precipitous gorge
                    running north to join the Leontes. The district is well provided with springs
                    throughout, and the valleys are full of water in the spring time. Though rocky
                    and difficult, Upper Galilee is not barren, the soil of the plateaus is rich,
                    and the vine flourishes in the higher hills, especially in the neighbourhood of
                    Kefr Birim. The principal town is Safed, perched on a white mountain 2700 feet
                    above the sea. It has a population of about 9000, including Jews, Christians,
                    and Moslems. It is one of the four sacred cities in Palestine revered by the
                    Jews, to which nationality the majority of the inhabitants belong. Among the
                    smaller towns we may notice Meirûn, near Safed, a place also much revered by the
                    Jews as containing the tombs of Hillel, Shammai, and Simon bar Jochai. A yearly
                    festival of most curious character is here celebrated in honour of these rabbis.
                    The site of Hazor, one of the chief towns of Galilee in Bible times, has also
                    been lately recovered. It was situated, according to Josephus, above the Lake
                    Semechonitis (Bahr el Hûleh), and the name Hudîreh, identical with the Hebrew
                    Hazor, has been found by the survey party in 1877 applying to a mountain and
                    plain, near an ancient ruin, in the required position. The little village of
                    Kades represents the once important town of Kadesh Naphtali (Josh. xix. 37). The
                    ruins are here extensive and interesting, but belong apparently to the Greek
                    period.</p>
                <p>The population of Galilee is mixed. In Lower Galilee the peasants are principally
                    Moslem, with a sprinkling of Greek Christians round Nazareth, which is a
                    Christian town. In Upper Galilee, however, there is a mixture of Jews and
                    Maronites, Druses and Moslems (natives or Algerine settlers), while the slopes
                    above the Jordan are inhabited by wandering Arabs. The Jews are engagedin trade,
                    and the Christians, Druses, and Moslems in agriculture; and the Arabs are an
                    entirely pastoral people.</p>
                <p>The principal products of the country are corn, wine, oil, and soap (from the
                    olives), with every species of pulse and gourd.</p>
                <p>The antiquities of Galilee include cromlechs and rude stone monuments, rock-cut
                    tombs, and wine-presses, with numerous remains of Byzantine monasteries and fine
                    churches of the time of the crusades. There are also remains of Greek
                    architecture in various places, but the most interesting buildings are the
                    ancient synagogues. These have not been found in other parts of Palestine, but
                    in Galilee eleven examples are now known. They are rectangular, with the door to
                    the south, and three rows of columns forming four aisles east and west. The
                    architecture is a peculiar and debased imitation of classic style, attributed by
                    architects to the 2d century of our era. The builder of the examples at Kefr
                    Birim, el Jish, and Meirûn is known to have been the famous Simeon bar Jochai,
                    who lived about 150 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and built 24 synagogues in
                    Galilee. The similarity of style renders it probable that the other examples at
                    Tell Hûm, Kerâzeli, Nebartein, Umm el ’ Amed, and Sufsâf were also his work.
                    Both at el Jish and at Kefr Birim there are two synagogues, large and small.
                    A&lt;, Irbid, above Tiberias, is another synagogue of rather different
                    character, which is said to have been built by Rabbi Nitai. Traces of synagogues
                    have also been found on Carmel, and at Tireh, west of Nazareth. It is curious to
                    find the representation of various animals in relief on the lintels of these
                    buildings. Hebrew inscriptions also occur, and the carved work of the cornice3
                    and capitals is very rich. These synagogues were erected at a time when the
                    Galilean Jews were flourishing under the Roman empire, and when Tiberias was the
                    central seat of Jewish learning and of the Sanhedrin.</p>
                <p>In the 12th century Galilee was the outpost of the Christian kingdom of
                    Jerusalem, and its borders were strongly protected by fortresses, the
                    magnificent remains of which still crown the most important strategical points.
                    Toron (now Tibnιn) was built in 1104, the first fortress erected by the
                    crusaders, and standing on the summit of the mountains of Upper Galilee.
                    Beauvoir (Kaukab, built in 1182) stood on a precipice above Jordan south-¼ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> est of the Sea of Galilee, and guarded the advance by
                    the valley of Jezreel; and about the same time Château Neuf (Hunîn) was erected
                    above the Hûleh lake. Belfort (esh Shukif), on the north bank of the Leontes,
                    the finest and most important, dates somewhat earlier; and Montfort (Kalat el
                    Kurn) stood on a narrow spur north-east of Acre, completing the chain of
                    frontier fortresses. The town of Bânias, with its castle, formed also a strong
                    outpost against Damascus, and was the scene, in common with the other
                    strongholds, of many desperate encounters between Moslems and Christians. Lower
                    Galilee was the last remaining portion of the Holy Land held by the Christians.
                    In 1250 the knights of the Teutonic order owned lands extending round Acre as
                    far east as the Sea of Galilee, and including Safed. These possessions were lost
                    in 1291, on the fall of Acre. (c. <hi rend="smallcaps">r. c.)</hi><pb break="no"
