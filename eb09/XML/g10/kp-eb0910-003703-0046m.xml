                    for some time in making a catalogue of the Oriental manuscripts at the Sorbonne,
                    he was, in 1670, attached to the French embassy at Constantinople; and in 1673
                    he also accompanied his chief (De Nointel) to Syria and the Levant, where he
                    availed himself of the opportunity to copy a great number of inscriptions, and
                    also to sketch, in some cases even to remove, historical monuments. After a
                    brief visit to France, where his collection of antiquities attracted some
                    attention, Galland returned to the Levant in 1676; and in 1679 he undertook a
                    third voyage, being commissioned by the French East India Company to collect for
                    the cabinet of Colbert; on the expiry of this commission he was instructed by
                    the Government to continue his researches, and had the title of “antiquary to
                    the king” conferred upon him. During his prolonged residences abroad he acquired
                    a thorough knowledge of the Arabic, Turkish, and Persian languages and
                    literatures, which, on his final return to France, enabled him to render
                    valuable assistance to Thevenot, the keeper of the royal library, and to
                    D’Herbelot. After their deaths he lived for some time at Caen under the roof of
                    Foucault the intendant, himself no mean archaeologist; and there he began the
                    publication (1704-17) of <hi rend="italic">Les Mille et Une Nuits,</hi> a
                    translation which excited immense interest during the time of its appearance,
                    and which is still the standard French translation (last edition 1872). In 1701
                    Galland had been admitted into the Academy of Inscriptions, and in 1709 he was
                    appointed to the chair of Arabic in the Collège de France. He continued to
                    discharge the duties of this post until his death, which took place February 17,
                    1715, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n47/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0047-0038"/> Besides a number of meritorious archaeological
                    work⅛, especially iu the department of numismatics, he also published a
                    compilation from the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paroles</hi><hi rend="italic">remarquables, bons mots et maximes des
                    Orientaux</hi> (1694), and a translation from an Arabie manuscript, <hi
                    rend="italic">Be</hi><hi rend="italic">l’origine et du progrès du Caffé</hi>
                    (1699). The former of these works appeared in an English translation in 1795.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Contes ct Fables</hi><hi rend="italic">Indiennes de Bidpaï
                    et de</hi><hi rend="italic">Lokman</hi> was published after his death (1724).
                    Among his numerous unpublished manuscripts are said to be included a translation
                    of the Koran and a Turkish dictionary.</p>
