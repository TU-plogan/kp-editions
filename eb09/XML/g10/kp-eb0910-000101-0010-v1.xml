                <p>G represents the sound of Gamma, the third letter of the</p>
                <p>Greek alphabet; but in the Latin alphabet, and in the alphabets derived from the
                    Latin (including our own), it holds the place which Z held in the different
                    Greek alphabets. The history of this remarkable change is well known. It has
                    been already stated (see letter C) that in the 5th century before our era, the
                    distinction between the ½-sound and the &lt;7-s0und became lost at Rome:
                    apparently the surviving sound was <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi> but, at all events, the symbol K went out of use, being retained
                    only in a few familiar abbreviations, and C (which was the Latinized form of the
                    Greek Γ) remained. Thus in the column of Duillius we find C representing the
                    original surd in <hi rend="italic">castreis, cepet, &amp;c.,</hi> but the sonant
                    in <hi rend="italic">macistratos, leciones, ceset (i.e.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >gessit),</hi> &lt;tc. When, in the 3d century, the two sounds were again
                    distinguished, two symbols were again required; but the K was not taken again to
                    represent the surd; C, the old symbol for the sonant, was put to that use. A new
                    symbol was therefore necessary for the sonant 5r-s0und, and it was found by
                    modifying C into G. This G should then have replaced C as the third letter of
                    the alphabet, where it would have stood, as before, between B and D, the sonants
                    of the labial and dental classes respectively. But this was not done. The symbol
                    C was left in its old place with its new value of <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> The
                    new symbol G was set in the seventh place of the alphabet, which had been
                    vacated by Z, the representative of a sound not used by the Romans of that day.
                    G is found for the first time in the inscription on the tomb of Scipio Barbatus.
                    Its invention is attributed to Spurius Carvilius.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the sound of G in Latin, as of Γ in Greek, was always
                    the sonant guttural—which we hear in <hi rend="italic">gate,</hi> &amp;c. It was
                    not the sonant palatal, which it represents in <hi rend="italic">gem</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">gin.</hi> This sound began to supplant it about the 6th
                    century of our era, but only when it preceded <hi rend="italic">e</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">i—</hi> the two vowels which require a position of the tongue
                    nearer to the palatal than to the guttural consonants. We find this change of
                    sound in French and in Italian. In the Latin part of our vocabulary there is
                    naturally the same weakening; whereas, in words of English origin, the original
                    guttural is generally preserved, even before <hi rend="italic">e</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">i,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">get</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >give.</hi> Sometimes it has been weakened at the end of a word, as in <hi
                        rend="italic">bridge</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ridge,</hi> which were
                    originally <hi rend="italic">brigg</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rigg,</hi> and are
                    still so in the north of England.</p>
                <p>It is noteworthy how a &lt;7-s0und made it≡ appearance in <hi rend="superscript">
                        1</hi> French at the beginning of words which originally began with the
                    w-sound. An example is <hi rend="italic">guerre,</hi> a borrowed word from the
                    Teutonic; we see it in Old High German as <hi rend="italic">werra,</hi> a
                    quarrel. The Gauls apparently found a difficulty in producing the initial German
                    sound, and (there being no difference in the position of the back of the mouth
                    for <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> except that the
                    passage between the back-palate and the tongue is entirely closed for <hi
                        rend="italic">g,</hi> but left slightly open for <hi rend="italic">w)</hi>
                    they did not keep the <hi rend="italic">w</hi> pure, but sounded a <hi
                        rend="italic">g</hi> before it by unintentionally elosing the oral passage
                    for a moment. The same thing is seen in <hi rend="italic">guerir,</hi> which
                    corresponds to Gothic <hi rend="italic">varjan',</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                        >garant,</hi> which we have in English <hi rend="italic">zνar-rant;</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">garnir</hi> corresponds to Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic"
                        >warniaη.</hi> In a few instances the word so modified seems to have been
                    originally Latin, as <hi rend="italic">gaine,</hi> a sheath, the Latin <hi
                        rend="italic">vagina.</hi></p>
                <p>This French change has led to a curious result in England. Many words were
                    introduced by the Normans into England in their French form, which were already
                    existent there in their Teutonic form. Thus we have such pairs as <hi
                        rend="italic">wile</hi> and <hi rend="italic">guile, wise</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">guise, warranty</hi> and <hi rend="italic">guarantee,
                        wager</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gage,</hi> and many others. It is strange
                    that in so many cases each of the pair of words should have remained in use, and
                    with so little change of meaning.</p>
