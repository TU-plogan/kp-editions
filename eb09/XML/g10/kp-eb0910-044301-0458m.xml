                    fifteenth year, during a dangerous illness, he came under the personal influence
                    of Johann Arndt, author of <hi rend="italic">Das Wahre</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Christenthτnn,</hi> and resolved to study for the church. Soon after entering
                    the university of Wittenberg, however, in 1599, he began to waver in this
                    determination, and ultimately gave himself for two years to the study of
                    medicine, but in 1603 resumed his theological reading at Jena, and in the
                    following year received a new impulse from Winkelmann and Mentzer at Marburg.
                    Having graduated and begun to give lectures at Jena in 1605, he in 1606 received
                    and accepted the duke of Coburg’s invitation to the superintendency of Heldburg
                    and mastership of the gymnasium; soon afterwards he became general
                    superintendent of the duchy, in which capacity he was much and usefully engaged
                    in the practical work of ecclesiastical organization until 1616, when he found a
                    more congenial sphere in the senior theological chair at Jena, where the
                    remainder of his life was spent. Though still comparatively young, Gerhard had
                    already come to be regarded as the greatest living theologian of Protestant
                    Germany; in the numerous “disputations” which characterized that period he was
                    always protagonist, while on all public and domestic questions touching on
                    religion or morals his advice was eagerly sought on all hands and by every
                    class. It is recorded that during the course of his lifetime he had received
                    repeated calls to almost every university in Germany, as well as to Upsala in
                    Sweden. He died on the 20th August 1637. Personally he is said to have exhibited
                    a rare combination of all the best elements of the Christian character; the only
                    failing imputed to him by any one decidedly leans to virtue’s side—an excessive
                    love of peace.</p>
                <p>His writings are very numerous, alike in exegetical, polemical, dogmatic, and.
                    practical theology. To the first category belong the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentarius</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">harmoniam</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">historiae evangelicae de</hi><hi rend="italic">passione</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Christi</hi> (1617), the <hi rend="italic">Comment, super</hi><hi

                    >Epistolam</hi> (1611), and also his commentaries on Genesis (1637) and on
                    Deuteronomy (1658). Of a controversial character are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confessio Catholica</hi> (1634-68), an extensive work which seeks to prove the
                    evangelical and catholic character of the doctrine of the Augsburg Confession
                    from the writings of approved Roman Catholic authors; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Loci</hi><hi rend="italic">theologici</hi> (1629),∙ his principal contribution
                    to science, in which Lutheranism is expounded “nervose, solide, et copiose,” in
                    fact with a fulness of learning, a force of logic, and a minuteness of detail
                    that had never before been approached. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meditationes</hi><hi rend="italic">sacrae</hi> (1621), a work expressly devoted
                    to the uses of Christian edification, has been frequently reprinted in Latin and
                    has been translated into most of the European languages, including Greek. The
                    English translation by R. Winterton (1631) has passed through at least nineteen
                    editions. There is also an edition by W. Papillon in English blank verse (1801).
                    A <hi rend="italic">Vita Joh.</hi><hi rend="italic">Gerhardt</hi> was published
                    by E. R. Fischer in 1723.</p>
