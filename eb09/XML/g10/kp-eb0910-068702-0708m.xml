                <p><label type="entry">GLOUCESTER</label>, a county in the west midland district of
                    England, bounded on the N. by Worcester and Warwick, on the S. by Somerset, on
                    the E. by Oxford and Wilts, and on the W. by Hereford and Monmouth. The river
                    Wye forms the western boundary line, the Stratford Avon part of the northern,
                    the Bristol Avon the south-western, and the Thames for some miles the
                    south-eastern. The shape of the county is irregularly elliptical, its greatest
                    length in direct line from Bristol to Clifford Chambers (N.E.) being 54 miles,
                    its greatest width from Down Ampney to Preston, near Ledbury, at right angles,
                    33 miles. The area, according to the tithe surveys—deducting 3000 acres of
                    detached land incorporated by an Act of 1844 with the counties of Worcester,
                    Warwick, and Wilts, by which they were surrounded, and 17,688 acres of
                    water—amounts to 805,102 acres, mostly cultivable. The county contains 29
                    hundreds, among which are grouped 351 parishes, 227 tithings, liberties, and
                    hamlets; and the parishes are arranged in 17 poor law unions for the relief of
                    the poor, and 21 petty sessional divisions for the administration of justice and
                    sanitary purposes. Electorally Gloucestershire is divided into the two divisions
                    of East and West Gloucestershire, each returning two members. The latter
                    comprises Dean Forest to the Severn bank (the “Eye between Severn and Wye” of
                    the local proverb), and the country S. of the former river to S.E. and N.E. of
                    Dursley, the chief polling place of the division. East Gloucestershire,
                    comprehending the rest of the county, has its chief polling places at Gloucester
                    and Cheltenham, and besides these boroughs, the former of which returns two
                    members and the latter one, has within its limits the boroughs of Stroud with
                    two members, and Tewkesbury and Cirencester with one each. West Gloucestershire,
                    sharing with North Somerset the city of Bristol, sends two more members to
                    parliament, so that the total representation of the county is 13 members.
                    Gloucestershire contains 28 market-towns and 2 cities.</p>
                <p>The population of the county in 1851 was 458,805 (218,187 males and 240,618
                    females); in 1861 it was 485,770 (229,009 males and 256,761 females); and in
                    1871 it had increased to 534,320 (251,943 males and 282,377 females). Since the
                    first census in 1801 the population has increased by 283,917 persons, or 113 per
                    cent.</p>
                <p>The population of the principal towns at the census of 1871 was as follows :—</p>

                <p>The county has three natural divisions, the hill, the vale, and the forest,
                    parallel to each other north and south. (1.) The hill country, which, except the
                    high ground of the Forest of Dean, consists wholly of the Coteswolds, a range
                    extending from Broadway near Chipping-Campden on the north to Bath on the south,
                    and from Birdlip hills on the west to Burford on the east, and traversing the
                    eastern side of the county at an average elevation of 700 feet, though in parts,
                    as at Cleeve Hill near Prestbury, it is 1134 feet above the level of the sea. It
                    covers nearly 300,000 acres of undulating table-land, locally subdivided into
                    the Southwolds betwixt Bath and Badminton, the Stroudwater hills betw ixt
                    Tetbury and Woodchester, and the Coteswolds proper, or the rest of the hill
                    country northward. (2.) The Vale, or that level tract extending from the base of
                    the Coteswolds to the east bank of the Severn, the upper or northern part of
                    which expanse is known as the vale of Gloucester, and embraces Gloucester,
                    Cheltenham, Tewkesbury, and some 50,000 acres; whilst the lower is the vale of
                    Berkeley, a tract of similar area reaching from Aust Cliff on the Severn
                    opposite the mouth of the Wye to Robin’s Wood hill, two miles south-east of
                    Gloucester. The vale of Gloucester· is a continuation of the vale of Evesham.
                    (3.) The Forest division is the peninsula lying between the Wye and the Severn,
                    in modern times limited to the Forest of Dean, but anciently occupying all
                    Gloucestershire west of Severn, and covering some 43,000 acres. The area of the
                    present forest is 23,015 acres, 11,000 of which are enclosed. Its length from
                    north to south is 20 miles, its breadth (east to west) 10 miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> Though the igneous rocks are little developed,
                    the great variety of sedimentary deposits makes Gloucestershire a rich field for
                    the geologist. At <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n709/mode/1up"

                    greenstone, the cause of the upheaval of the Upper Silurian basin of Tortworth,
                    in which are the oldest stratified rocks of the county. Of these the Upper
                    Llandovery is the dominant stratum, exposed near Damory mill, Micklewood chase,
                    and Purton passage, wrapping round the base of May and Huntley hills, and
                    reappearing in the vale of Woolhope. The Wenlock limestone is exposed at
                    Falfield mill and Whitfield, and quarried for burning at May hill. The Lower
                    Ludlow shales or mudstones are seen at Berkeley and Purton, where the upper part
                    is probably Aymestry limestone. The series of sandy shales and sandstones which,
                    as Downton sandstones and Ledbury shales, form a transition to the Old Red
                    Sandstone, are quarried at Dymock. The “Old Red” itself occurs at Berkeley,
                    Tortworth Green, Thornbury, and several places in the Bristol coal-field, in
                    anticlinal folds forming hills. It forms also the great basin extending from
                    Ross to Monmouth and from Dymock to Mitcheldean, Abenhall, Blakeney, &lt;kc.,
                    within which is the Carboniferous basin of the Forest. It is cut through by the
                    Wye from Monmouth to Woolaston. This formation is over 8000 feet thick in the
                    Forest of Dean. The Bristol and Forest Carboniferous basins lie within the
                    synclinal folds of the Old Red Sandstone; and though the seams of coal have not
                    yet been correlated, they must have been once continuous, as further appears
                    from the existence of an intermediate basin, recently pierced, under the Severn.
                    The lower limestone shales are 500 feet thick in the Bristol area, and only 165
                    in the Forest, richly fossiliferous, and famous for their bone bed. The great
                    marine series known as the Mountain Limestone, forming the walls of the grand
                    gorges of the Wye and Avon, are over 2000 feet thick in the latter district,
                    only 480 in the former, where it yields the brown hematite so largely worked for
                    iron even from Roman times. It is much used too for lime and road metaL Above
                    this comes the Millstone Grit, well seen at Brandon hill, where it is 1000 feet
                    in thickness, though but 455 in the forest. On this rest the Coal-measures,
                    consisting in the Bristol field of two great series, the lower 2000 feet thick
                    with 36 seams, the upper 3000 feet with 22 seams, 9 of which reach 2 feet in
                    thickness. These two series are divided by over 1700 feet of hard sandstone
                    (Pennant Grit), containing only 5 coal-seams. In the Forest coal-field the whole
                    series is not 3000 feet thick, with but 15 seams. At Durdham Down a Dolomitic
                    conglomerate, of the age known as Keuper or Upper Trias, rests unconformably on
                    the edges of the Palaeozoic rocks, and is evidently a shore deposit, yielding
                    dinosaurian remains. Above the Keuper clays come the Penarth beds, of which
                    classical sections occur at Westbury, Aust, &amp;c. The series consists of grey
                    marls, black paper shale3 containing much pyrites and a celebrated bone bed, the
                    Cotham landscape marble, and the white Lias limestone, yielding <hi
                    rend="italic">Ostrea</hi><hi rend="italic">Liassica</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cardium Phoeti-cum.</hi> The district of Over Severn is mainly of Keuper marls.
                    The whole Vale of Gloucester is occupied by the next formation, the Lias, a warm
                    sea deposit of clays and clayey limestones, characterized by ammonites,
                    belemnites, and gigantic saurians. At its base is the insect limestone bed. The
                    pastures producing Gloucester cheese arc on the clays of the Lower Lias. The
                    more calcareous Middle Lias or marlstone forms hillocks flanking the Oolite
                    escarpment of the Coteswolds, as at Wotton-under-Edge, and Churchdown. The
                    Coteswolds consist of the great limestone series of the Lower Oolite. At the
                    base is a transition series of sands, 30 to 40 feet thick, well developed at
                    Nails-worth and Frocester, Leckhampton hill is a typical section of the Lower
                    Oolite, where the sands are capped by 40 feet of a remarkable pea grit. Above
                    this are 147 feet of freestone, 7 feet of oolite marl, 34 feet of upper
                    freestone, and 38 feet of ragstone. The Painswick stone belongs to lower
                    freestone. Resting on the Inferior Oolite, and dipping with it to S.E., is the
                    “fuller’s earth,” a rubbly limestone about 100 feet thick, throwing out many of
                    the springs which form the head waters of the Thames. Next comes the Great or
                    Bath Oolite, at the base of which are the Stonesfield “slate” beds, quarried for
                    roofing, paling, &lt;fcc., at Sevenhampton and elsewhere. From the Great Oolite
                    Minchinhampton stone is obtained, and at its top is about 40 feet of flaggy
                    Oolite with bands of clay known as the Forest Marble. Ripple marks are abundant
                    on the flags; in fact all the Oolites seem to have been near shore or in shallow
                    water, much of the limestone being merely comminuted coral. The highest bed of
                    the Lower Oolite is the Cornbrash, about 40 feet of rubble, productive in corn,
                    forming a narrow belt from Siddington to Fairford. Near the latter town and
                    Lechlade is a small tract of blue Oxford Clay of the Middle Oolite. The county
                    has no higher Secondary or Tertiary rocks; but the Quaternary series is
                    represented by much northern drift gravel in the Vale and Over Severn, by
                    accumulations of Oolitic detritus, including pυst-Glacial extinct mammalian
                    remains on the flanks of the Coteswolds, and by submerged forests extending from
                    Sharpness to Gloucester.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> In the soil of the hill country is so much lime
                    that a liberal supply of manure is required. This is provided by folding sheep,
                    and by paring and burning the turf and strewing the ashes on the surface. Good
                    crops of barley and oats are thus obtained, and even of wheat, if the soil is
                    mixed with clay. But the poorest land of the hill country affords excellent
                    pasturage for sheep, the staple commodity of the district; and the sainfoin,
                    which grows wild, yields abundantly under cultivation. The Coteswolds have been
                    famous for the breed of sheep named from them since the early part of the 15th
                    century,—a breed hardy and prolific, with lambs that quickly put on fleece, and
                    become attempered to the bracing cold of the hills, where vegetation is a month
                    later than in the vale. Improved of late years by judicious crossing with the
                    Leicester sheep, the modern Coteswold has attained high perfection of weight,
                    shape, fleece, and quality, The ewes are good mothers; the wool produce, of
                    which the staple is long and mellow to the hand though rather coarse in quality,
                    is an important item, averaging from 7 to 8 tt&gt; a head in a Coteswold flock.
                    An impulse has been given to Coteswold farming since the chartering in 1845 of
                    the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester, to instruct young men in farming
                    and the kindred sciences. The pupils engage in the cultivation of a farm of 700
                    acres attached to the college, a Gothic structure near Cirencester, which has
                    hitherto accommodated on an average 100 inmates. Yet, despite the march of
                    improvement, the aspect of the district is somewhat barren, owing to the absence
                    of trees and hedgerows in the so-called “stone wall” country, and to the size of
                    the farms, sometimes exceeding 1000 acres. Cattle are kept for home needs and to
                    improve the soil. Oats and barley are the chief grain crops. In the Vale the
                    deep rich black and red loamy soil is well adapted for cattle, and a moist mild
                    climate favours the growth of grasses and root crops. A great proportion of the
                    Vale is in permanent pasture, and its farmers look largely to hay as the winter
                    food of their stock. The cattle, save on the frontier of Herefordshire, are
                    mostly shorthorns, of which <pb break="no"

                    kept for dairy purposes. The rich grazing tract of the Vale of Berkeley is said
                    to produce annually 1200 tons of the famous double Gloucester cheeses, and the
                    Vale in general has long been celebrated for its cheese and butter. The Vale of
                    Gloucester is the chief corn district. Its aspect is generally pastoral,
                    characterized by grass-lands hemmed in with hedgerows and hedgerow timber, and
                    dotted with apples, pears, and orchard fruit as if to compensate for the
                    comparative barrenness of the Coteswolds. The Vale, from its position and
                    climate, is subject to violent storms of wind and rain.</p>

                <p>According to the Owners and Heritages Return 1872-73, the county was divided
                    among 37,705 proprietors, holding land whose acreage was 733,640, and whose
                    gross estimated rental was £2,556,543. The estimated extent of commons and waste
                    lands was 7429 acres. Of the owners 76 per cent, possessed less than one acre,
                    and the average value all over was £3, 8s. 11^d. There were 10 proprietors who
                    possessed upwards of 5000 acres, viz. :—Lord Fitzhardinge, 18,264; Duke of
                    Beaufort, 16,610; Lord Sherborne, 15,773; Earl Bathurst, 9967; Crown Property,

                    agreeably undulating to the height of from 120 to 1000 feet, and its sandy peat
                    soil renders it most suitable for the growth of timber, which is the cause of
                    its having been a royal forest from time immemorial. John Evelyn records that
                    the commanders of the Armada had orders not to leave in it a tree standing. In
                    the reign of Charles I. the Forest contained 105,537 trees, and, straitened for
                    money, he granted it to Sir John Wyntour for £10,000, and a fee farm rent of
                    £2000. The grant was cancelled by Cromwell; but at the Restoration only 30,000
                    were left, and Wyntour, having got another grant, destroyed all but 200 trees
                    fit for navy timber. In 1680 an Act was passed to enclose 11,000 acres and plant
                    with oak and beech for supply of the dockyards; and the present forest, though
                    not containing very many gigantic oaks, has six “walks” covered with timber in
                    various stages of growth. The two finest oaks of the Forest are a headless giant
                    45 feet in girth just outside the village of Newland, to the left of the road
                    from Coleford to Monmouth, and “Jack of the Yat,” with 19 feet of girth, on the
                    right of the roadside from Coleford to Mitcheldean.<note anchored="true"

                    the deer in 1850, is almost purely honorary. From time immemorial all persons

                    formations, is extremely rich. Its distinct forms of phanerogams number more
                    than half the British flora. But there is little bog land in the county, and no

                    in the cider orchards of the Vale is another botanical feature of the county, a
                    parasite occurring on other trees also, notably on the Badham Court oak, Sedbury
                    Park, Chepstow, and on the Frampton-on-Severn oak. The elm, used at Bristol for
                    shipbuilding, the willow, and the maple form the chief hedge timber of the Vale,

                    Gloucestershire is, in virtue of its two city ports, Bristol and Gloucester, a
                    maritime county. The approach to the first is by the Somerset Avon, to the
                    second by the Severn, or, more strictly, by the Gloucester and Berkeley canal,
                    for which, owing to the dangerous navigation of the Severn, an Act was obtained
                    in 1793, though the works were not completed and opened for traffic till 1827.
                    They consisted of a small tidal basin and lock at Sharpness Point, on the
                    Severn, near Berkeley, connecting the estuary of the river by a ship canal 16
                    miles long with the city of Gloucester, where there was a suitable discharging
                    dock, and where the canal was again connected with the river Severn by a lock.
                    The gradual extension of the trade necessitated a corresponding extension of the
                    works, and in 1869 a new and enlarged entrance, half a mile further down the
                    liver, was projected, with suitable discharging and repairing docks, which last
                    form one large sheet of water on the same level as the old canal connecting them
                    also with Gloucester. These were completed and opened in 1874. Through the river
                    Severn from Gloucester to Worcester and Stourport the port is brought into
                    direct communication with the great system of internal canals throughout the
                    kingdom, and both at Sharpness docks and Gloucester is in direct communication
                    with the Midland and Great Western railway systems. The following are the trade
                    statistics of the year ending September 25, 1878.</p>

                    with the Midland, thus forming a long-needed connexion between the two sides of
                    the river, and shortening the distances from South Wales to London by 14 miles,
                    and from South Wales to Bristol by 20.</p>

                <p>Its great local importance consists in providing a communication from South Wales
                    and Dean Forest and their coal-fields to the Berkeley new docks and the south of
                    England, and is evidenced by the various competing schemes introduced in the
                    same session of 1872 for bridges having the kame object. The great iron bridge
                    itself consists of girders constructed on a modification of the bowstring
                    principle, and rests on piers composed of cast iron cylinders sunk down in the
                    rock and filled with concrete. Commencing with the Lydney shore, the spans are
                    as follows :—one of 134 feet, two of 327, Ave of 171 feet, thirteen of 134, and
                    one of 196 feet (inclusive of swing bridge over canal), making in all 22. The
                    width of the river is 1186 yards, and the total length of the bridge, including
                    the masonry viaduct and swing span, 1387 yards. While the main object of this
                    stupendous undertaking is the transit of coal, arrangements are also
                    contemplated for passenger traffic across the river.</p>
                <p>Another canal, once of great importance to the commerce of Gloucestershire, is
                    the Thames and Severn canal, connecting the navigation of these two great
                    rivers, the first of which rises at the back of Leckhampton Hill, at Seven
                    Springs. The Thames and Severn canal begins at Lechlade on the former river, and
                    joining the Stroudwater canal, which crosses the Gloucester and Berkeley, enters
                    the Severn at Framilode. But this canal, though of considerable engineering
                    skill, is now but little used, the Great Western railway having almost entirely
                    superseded it; and it is the same With another canal running from the Severn at
                    Gloucester to Newent and Ledbury.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> Gloucestershire is also an important
                    manufacturing county. In the time of Edward III. the manufacture of woollen
                    cloth was introduced into its hill country by the Flemings, attracted probably
                    by the facilities offered for felting by the numerous streams of water flowing
                    from the Coteswolds. The manufacture gradually increased in spite of vexatious
                    legislation, enacted with the view of encouraging native industry, but really
                    tending to hamper the trade. Cirencester is mentioned as its seat in Henry IV.’s
                    reign, and Stroud in 1553. The raw material for the manufacture was long
                    obtained from the produce of English flocks, but afterwards a better description
                    of wool was imported from Spain, and towards the close of the last century a
                    still finer quality was got from Germany. The main supply is now obtained from
                    the British colonies in the southern hemisphere. The description of cloth for
                    which Gloucestershire and the west of England have been and still are most
                    famous is broad-cloth, dressed with teazles to produce a short close nap on the
                    face, and made of all shades of colour, but chiefly black, blue, and scarlet.
                    The most prosperous time of the Gloucestershire woollen trade was from 1800 to
                    1820, during which period the water-power of the various streams was keenly
                    utilized, and a very large proportion of the population was engaged early and
                    late on the several processes, either in their cottages or at the mills. The
                    commercial crisis of 1825 very seriously crippled the trade; and though it
                    afterwards recovered, it is probable that fewer persons have since been employed
                    in it. The further introduction of machinery, enabling manufacturers to dispense
                    with much manual labour, the passing of the factory laws, and the increased
                    facilities of obtaining education, have greatly improved the social habits of
                    the manufacturing population.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Gloucestershire has not been unnoted in the
                    annals of England. At Gloucester Henry III. was crowned; at Berkeley Castle
                    Edward II. was murdered; the Wars of the Roses were ended at the battle of
                    Tewkesbury, where in May 1471 Queen Margaret and Prince Edward were taken
                    prisoners; the repulse which Charles I. sustained at Gloucester, when the earl
                    of Essex compelled him to raise the siege, was the climax of his fortunes. The
                    county is strewn with relics of antiquity. Four Roman roads intersect it; Roman
                    pavements and vestiges are found at Cirencester, Gloucester, Woodchester, and
                    Lydney, and camps—British, Saxon, Danish, and Roman—in numerous places, with
                    many interesting relics of the Middle Ages. Among these are the restored castle
                    of Sudeley, near Winchcombe, a manor house before the Conquest, a baronial
                    castle in the days of Stephen, and the home in succession of the Botelers,
                    Seymours, Queen Katherine Parr, and the Chandos family; Thornbury Castle, an
                    interesting ruin instead of a castellated palace, as it would have been had not
                    its pretensions provoked the jealousy of Wolsey against its builder, Edward
                    Stafford, duke of Buckingham, who was beheaded in 1521; St BriaveΓs Castle, to
                    the south of the Forest of Dean, an ancient seat of the Norman kings, if not the
                    Saxon, which became the residence of the chief officer of the Forest, and
                    retains in its ruined state a decorated chimney shaft surmounted by a horn, the
                    warder’s badge. Berkeley Castle, built prior to Henry II., is an almost unique
                    specimen of a feudal residence in the actual occupation of a descendant of its
                    founder, Baron Fitzharding. Edward II. was murdered in a detached upper chamber
                    of the square tower. The chief mansions of the county are Badminton House (Duke
                    of Beaufort); Oakley Park, Stroud (Earl Bathurst); Tortworth Park, with a
                    chestnut measuring 52 feet, a boundary tree in King Stephen’s reign (Earl
                    Ducie); Sherborne Park, Northleach (Lord Sherborne); Clearwell Court, Coleford
                    (Earl of Dunraven); Highnam Court (T. Gambier Parry); Sudeley Castle (J. Coucher
                    Dent); Southam House, the oldest residential house in the county, built in the
                    time of Henry VII., a timber and stone mansion of two stories (Earl of
                    Ellenborough); and Prinknash Park, a 15th century residence of the abbots of
                    Gloucester (B. St John Ackers). Besides these there are various other seats of
                    somewhat lesser size. Among the eminent persons born in the county are the
                    chronicler Robert of Gloucester, Sebastian Cabot, William Cartwright the poet,
                    Thomas Chatterton, Robert Southey, the Rev. John Eagles, and George
                    Whitfield.</p>

                    public elementary schools for the year ending 31st August 1876, there were in
                    Gloucestershire 408 day schools, 34 of which were also used as night schools. Of
                    these schools 314 were in connexion with the Church of England, or the National
                    Society or parochial; 15 were board schools, 9 Roman Catholic, 36 British and
                    Foreign, and 13 Wesleyan Methodist Conference schools.</p>

                    county of itself, 114 miles from London by railway, derives its name from the
                    British Caer-Gloui, near which at Kings-holm the Romans formed their camp of
                    Glevum, vestiges of which remain in four principal streets running N., S., E.,
                    and W., and crossing at the centre, as well as in Roman pavements, altars,
                    coins, and pottery. Λ Roman station under Aulus Plautius, it became a city of
                    Mercia, by name Gleauanceastre, under the Saxons, and is named by Bede as one of
                    the noblest cities in the land. A monastery was founded here in G79, in which in
                    1022 Bishop Wulstan of Worcester established the Benedictine rule. In the 8th
                    century the city was repeatedly ravaged and burnt by the Danish invaders, and
                    endured ruinous conflicts up to the time of the settlement between Canute and
                    Edmund Ironside. The abbey throve from the time of Canute, the foundations of
                    the present church having been laid by</p>
                <p>Abbot Serio (1072-1104), and Walter Frocester, its historian, becoming its first
                    mitred abbot in 1381. Edward the Confessor often resided at Gloucester, and it
                    was a favourite resort of the Norman kings, of whom Henry I. met with his death
                    from a surfeit of lampreys, for which he acquired a taste there. Henry II. held
                    a great council there (1175), and Henry III. was crowned in the abbey, and
                    “loved Gloucester better than London.” The “statute of Gloucester” was passed
                    (1278) in one of several parliaments held there; but the tide of royal favour
                    experienced an ebb when Charles I. subjected the city, garrisoned by the
                    Parliamentarians, to a critical siege, which was eventually raised in September
                    1643 by the earl of Essex. Until 1541 the whole of Gloucestershire lay in
                    Worcester diocese, but in that year it was constituted the see of Gloucester,
                    with the abbey church for its cathedral, and John Wakeman, last abbot of
                    Tewkesbury, for its first bishop. The cathedral<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0714-0691"/> may be succinctly described as “a Norman
                    carcase,” altered by additions in every style of Gothic architecture. It is 420
                    feet long, and 144 broad, with a beautiful central tower rising to the height of
                    225 feet, and topped by four graceful pinnacles. The nave is massive Norman with
                    Early English roof; the crypt also, under the choir, aisles, and chapels, is
                    Norman, as is also the chapter house. The south porch is Perpendicular, with
                    fan-tracery roof, as also is the north transept, the south being transitional
                    Decorated. The choir has Perpendicular tracery and an apsidal chapel on each
                    side, and the triforium carried under the east window in a curve, so as to form
                    a whispering gallery, is very noteworthy. Between the apsidal chapels is a cross
                    ladychapel, and north of the nave are the cloisters with very early example of
                    fan-tracery, the carols or stalls for the monks’ study and writing lying to the
                    south. The beautiful tower is 15th century work. For several years an extensive
                    process of restoration has been in progress. The finest monument is the canopied
                    shrine of Edward II., who was brought hither from Berkeley. By the visits of
                    pilgrims to this the building and sanctuary were enriched. In a side-chapel,
                    too, is a monument in coloured bog oak of Robert Curthose, a great benefactor to
                    the abbey, the eldest son of the Conqueror, who was interred there; and those of
                    Bishop Warburton and Dr Edward Jenner are also worthy of special mention. One of
                    the oldest houses in the city is the “New Inn in the Northgate Street,” a strong
                    and massive timbered house with external galleries and court yards, built in
                    1450 for the pilgrims to Edward II.’s shrine, by Abbot Sebroke, a traditional
                    subterranean passage leading thence to the cathedral. The timber is principally
                    chestnut.</p>
                <p>Gloucester is situated on a gentle eminence overlooking the Severn, and sheltered
                    by the Coteswolds on the east, while the Malverns rise prominently to the west.
                    The Tolsey or town-hall stands at the cross, the point of intersection of the
                    four principal streets, in each of which are various quaintly gabled and
                    timbered houses, helping to preserve the ancient aspect of the city. The most
                    modern quarter of it is in and south of the region of the spa, where a
                    chalybeate spring was discovered in 1814. The principal public buildings are the
                    shire hall, the town hall or Tolsey (occupying the site of the ancient Roman
                    capitol), the county gaol and penitientiary, the East-gate market, the corn
                    market, the infirmary, the lunatic asylum, and the hospital erected in 1861 in
                    place of the four old almshouses. There are 14 churches and several dissenting
                    chapels, and it may have been the olden proverb, “as sure as God’s in
                    Gloucester,” which provoked Oliver Cromwell to declare that the city had “more
                    churches than godliness.” Of the churches four are of special interest: St Mary
                    de Lode, with a very old chancel, and a monument of Bishop Hooper; St Mary de
                    Crypt, a cruciform structure of the 12th century, with a beautiful and lofty
                    tower; the church of St Michael, said to have been connected with the ancient
                    abbey of St Peter, and from whose tower the curfew bell is still rung every
                    evening; and St Nicholas church, originally of Norman erection, and possessing a
                    tower and other portions of later date. A new episcopal palace was erected in
                    1862. There are three endowed schools: the College school, re-founded by Henry
                    VIII., as part of the cathedral establishment; the Crypt school, founded by Dame
                    Joan Cooke in the same reign; and Sir Thomas Rich’s Blue Coat Hospital for 34
                    boys (1666). The first Sunday school was held in Gloucester, being originated by
                    Robert Raikes. Gloucester has returned two members to parliament since the 23d
                    year of Edward I. The city was chartered by Richard III., and is now governed by
                    a mayor, nine aidermen, and twenty-seven burgesses. Its ancient industries were
                    iron-founding, cloth-making, pin-making, and bellfounding, but the last two have
                    been for some time discontinued. It now possesses match works, foundries, marble
                    and slate works, saw-mills, chemical works, rope works, flourmills,
                    manufactories of railway waggons, engines, and agricultural implements, and boat
                    and ship-building yards. In 1877 the number of British ships that entered the
                    port was 3762, with a tonnage of 272,391, and of foreign ships 549, with a
                    tonnage of 167,200; the number of British ships that cleared was 3992, with a
                    tonnage of 278,773, and of foreign ships 488, with a tonnage of 144,581. The
                    principal imports are timber, corn, wine, and spirits, and the principal exports
                    iron, coals, malt, salt, bricks, and pottery. The town is celebrated for its
                    Severn salmon and lampreys. Near the canals and docks are the remains (a gateway
                    and some walls) of Llanthony Priory, a cell of the mother abbey in the vale of
                    Ewyas, Monmouthshire, which in the reign of Edward IV. had become the secondary
                    establishment. The famous bore of the Severn attains its great height just below
                    Gloucester. The area of the municipal borough is 415 acres, and of the
                    parliamentary borough 1606 acres. The population of the municipal and
                    parliamentary borough in 1861 was 16,512; that of the municipal borough in 1871
                    was 18,330, and of the parliamentary borough (extended since 1861) 31,804. The
                    municipal and parliamentary boroughs now coincide.</p>
