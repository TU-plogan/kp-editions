                    &amp;c.) is the name of a territory in Asia, and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ghuki</hi><hi rend="italic">(Ghori, Ghoory,</hi> &amp;c.) that of a dynasty
                    deriving its origin from that territory.</p>
                <p>The name of Ghιir was, in the Middle Ages, and, indeed, locally still is, applied
                    to the highlands east of Herat, and extending eastward to the upper Helmand
                    valley, or nearly so. There is hardly any region of Asia regarding which we
                    continue to be more in the dark than about this. Ghιir is the southern portion
                    of that great peninsula of strong mountain country which forms the western part
                    of modern Afghanistan, and which may be taken in a general way to represent the
                    Paropamisu3 of the ancients. The northern portion of the said peninsula was in
                    the Middle Ages comprehended under the names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gharjistdn</hi> (on the west), and <hi rend="italic">Juzjand</hi> (on the
                    east), whilst the basin of the Herat river, and all south of it, constituted
                    Gluir. The name as now used does not perhaps include the valley of the Herat
                    river; on the south the limit seems to be the declivity of the higher mountains
                    (about 32° 45 ’ N. lat.) dominating the descent to the lower Helmand, and the
                    road from Farrah to Kandahar. It is in Ghùr that rise all those affluents of the
                    closed basin of Seistân, the Hardt, the Farrah-rιid, the Khâsh-rùd (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Afghanistan),</hi> besides other considerable streams joining
                    the Helmand above Girishk.</p>
                <p>Ghιir is mentioned in the Shahnamah of Firdousi (1010 A.D.), and in the Arab
                    geographers of that time, though these latter fail in details almost as much as
                    we moderns, thus indicating how little accessible the country has been through
                    all ages. Ibn Haukal’s map of Khorasan (c. 976) shows <hi rend="italic">Jibal
                    al-Gkdr, “</hi> the hill-country of Ghùr,” as a circle ring-fenced with
                    mountains. His brief description speaks of it as a land fruitful in crops,
                    cattle, and flocks, inhabited by infidels, except a few who passed for
                    Mahometans, and indicates that, like other pagan countries surrounded by Moslem
                    populations, it was regarded as a store of slaves for the faithful. The boundary
                    of Ghιir in ascending the valley of the Hari-πid was six and a half easy marches
                    from Herat, at Chist, two marches above Obah (both of which are still in our
                    maps).</p>
                <p>The chief part of the present population of Ghιir are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taimûnis</hi> belonging to the class of nomad or semi-nomad clans called <hi
                    rend="italic">Eimciks</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Afghanistan,</hi> vol. i.
                    p. 235). There are also, according to Ferrier, <hi rend="italic">Suris,</hi> who
                    were formerly the main part of the population, apparently the same as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zoorees</hi> of Elphinstone <hi rend="italic">(Caubul,</hi> ii.
                    204), another of the Eimâk clans; and in the north of Ghùr Ferrier mentions
                    Mongols. Camels are kept in great numbers by the Eimâks, chiefly for their wool.
                    Though the country is very mountainous, there are fruitful valleys of
                    considerable width. But our knowledge is too slight for us to say more.</p>
                <p>The people and princes of Ghur first become known to us in connexion with the
                    Ghaznevid dynasty, and the early mediaeval histories of Ghιir and Ghazni are so
                    intertwined that little need be added on that subject towhat will be found under
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Ghazni</hi> (g ’.ι∙.). What we read of Ghùr shows it as a
                    country of lofty mountains and fruitful valleys, and of numerous strongholds
                    held by a variety of hill-chieftains ruling warlike clans whose habits were rife
                    with feuds and turbulence,—indeed, in character strongly resembling the tribes
                    of modern Afghanistan, though there seems no good reason to believe that they
                    were of Afghan race. It is probable that they were of old Persian blood, like
                    the older of those tribes which still occupy the country. It is possibly a
                    corroboration of this that, in the 14th century, when one of the Ghιiri kings,
                    of the Kurt dynasty reigning in Herat, had taken to himself some of the insignia
                    of independent sovereignty, an incensed Mongol prince is said to have reviled
                    him as “an insolent Tajik” (Journal Asiat., ser. v. tom. xvii. p. 509).
                    Sabuktigin of Ghazni, and his famous son Mahmιid, repeatedly invaded the
                    mountain country which so nearly adjoined their capital, subduing its chiefs for
                    the moment, and exacting tribute; but when the immediate pressure was withdrawn,
                    the yoke was thrown off, and the tribute withheld. In 1020 Masa ’ ud, the son of
                    Mahmùd, being then governor of Khorasan, made a systematic invasion of Ghιir
                    from the side of Herat, laying siege to its strongholds one after the other, and
                    subduing the country more effectually than ever before. About a century later
                    one of the princely families of Ghιir, deriving the appellation of Shansabi, or
                    Shansabaιriah, from a certain ancestor Shansab, of local fame, and of alleged
                    descent from Zohâk, acquired predominance in all the country, and at the time
                    mentioned Malik ’ Izzuddin al Husain of this family came to be recognized as
                    lord of Ghùr. He was known afterwards as “the Father of Kings,” from the further
                    honour to which several of his seven sons rose. Three of these (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ghazni)</hi> were—(1) Amir Kutbuddin Mahommed, called the lord
                    of the Jibal or mountains; (2) Sultan Saifuddin Sιiri, for a brief period master
                    of Ghazni,—both of whom were put to death by Bahram the Ghaznevid; and (3)
                    Sultan Alauddin Jahansoz, who wreaked such terrible vengeance upon Ghazni.
                    Alauddin began the conquests which were afterwards immensely extended both in
                    India and in the west by his nephews Ghiyassuddin Mahommed ibn Sam and
                    Muizuddi'n Mahommed Sam (the Shahâbuddin Ghûri of the historians), and for a
                    brief period during their rule it was boasted, with no great exaggeration, that
                    the public prayer was read in the name of the Ghιirι from the extremity of India
                    to the borders of Babylonia, and from the Oxus to the Straits of Ormus. After
                    the death of Muizuddi'n (alias Shahâbuddin), Mahmùd the son of Ghiyassuddin was
                    proclaimed sovereign (1206) throughout the territories of Ghι'tr, Ghazni, and
                    Hindustan. But the Indian dominion, from his uncle’s death, became entirely
                    independent, and his actual authority was confined to Ghùr, Seistân, and Herat.
                    The whole kingdom fell to pieces before the power of Mahommed Shah of Khwarazm
                    and his son Jalâluddin (c. 1214—1215), a power in its turn to be speedily
                    shattered by the Mongol flood (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ghazni).</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the thrones of Ghùr and Ghazni, the Shansabaniah family, in the person of
                    Fakhruddin, the eldest of the seven sons of Malek ’ Izzuddin, founded a kingdom
                    in the Oxus basin, having its seat at <hi rend="smallcaps">Bamian</hi> (q.v.),
                    which endured for two or three generations, till extinguished by the power of
                    Khwarazm (1214). And tfie great Mussulman empire of Delhi was based on the
                    conquests of Muizuddi'n the Ghurian, carried out and consolidated by his Turki
                    freedmen, Kutbuddin Aibak and his successors. The princes of Ghùr experienced,
                    about the middle of the 13th century, a revival of power, which endured for 140
                    years. This later dynasty bore the name of Kurt or Kart. The first of historical
                    prominence was Malik Shamsuddin Kurt, descended, by his mother from the great
                    king Ghiyassuddin Ghιiri, whilst his other grandfather was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n587/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0587-0570"/> that prince’s favourite minister. In 1245
                    Shamsuddin held the lordship of Ghιir in some kind of alliance with, or
                    subordination to, the Mongols, who had not yet definitively established
                    themselves in Persia, and in 1248 he received from the Great Khan Mangu an
                    investiture of all the provinces from Merv to the Indus, including by name
                    Sijistan (or Seistân), Cabul, Tirah (adjoining the Khaibar pass), and
                    Afghanistan (a very early occurrence of this name), which he ruled, from Herat.
                    He stood well with Hulaku, and for a long time with his son Abaka, but at last
                    incurred the latter’s jealousy, and was poisoned when on a visit to the court at
                    Tabriz (1276). His son Ruknuddin Kurt was, however, invested with the government
                    of Khorasan (1278), but after some years, mistrusting his Tartar suzerains, he
                    withdrew into Ghιir, and abode in his strong fortress of Kaissar till his death
                    there in 1305. The family held on through a succession of eight kings in all,
                    sometimes submissive to the Mongol, sometimes aiming at independence, sometimes
                    for a series of prosperous years adding to the strength and splendour of Herat,
                    and sometimes sorely buffeted by the hosts of masterless Tartar brigands that
                    tore Khorasan and Persia in the decline of the dynasties of Hulakιi and
                    Chagatai. It is possible that the Kurts night have established a lasting Tajik
                    kingdom at Herat, but in the time of the last of the dynasty, Ghiyassuddin
                    Pir-’Ali, Tartar-dom, reorganized and re-embodied in the person of Timur, came
                    against Herat, and carried away the king and the treasures of his dynasty
                    (1380). A revolt and massacre of his garrison provoked Timur’s vengeance; he put
                    the captive king to death, came against the city a second time, and showed it no
                    mercy (1383). Ghùr has since been as obscure in history as it is in its
                    topography.</p>
                <p>The proper capital of the kingdom of Ghur when its princes were rising to
                    dominion in the 12th century was Finiz-Koh, where a city and fortress were
                    founded by Saifuddin Suri. The true position of Firuz-Koh does not seem to have
                    been determined, out It was probably on or near the upper waters of the Hari-rud
                    or river of Herat; and it is possible that it may be represented by Shahrak, a
                    place in that valley (about 65° 30' E. long.), once a populous and flourishing
                    town, which was described to Ferrier, who passed not far from it, as having been
                    anciently the capital of Ghùr. The name of Firûz-Kohis has been appropriated to
                    one of the most numerous of the nomad tribes occupying the upper part of the
                    Hari-πid and part of the Murghab, but it is doubtful if this has to do with thç
                    Ghιir capital, as the name is otherwise explained. Other places claim to have
                    been the old capital. Thus Karrukh, a place visited by Khanikoff in 1858, in a
                    rapid excursion from Herat, and lying on the north side of the valley, is one.
                    But this seems too near Herat (only 30 miles distant). Ferrier, again, describes
                    as the ancient capital a place, which he reached in his journey, called Zarni,
                    about 150 miles by road from Herat towards the S.E. The population did not
                    exceed 1200, belonging to the Sûri and Taimιini tribes. The peak of Chalap
                    Dalan, “one of the highest in the world,” rose before Zarai in imposing majesty.
                    The mountain, at half its height, has a compass of some 40 miles; the sides are
                    covered with forests and pastures, villages and tents, and also exhibit
                    naturally impregnable positions where successive chiefs have built strongholds.
                    Ferrier, in accompanying the Afghan governor, who lived at Zarni, saw three
                    ancient towns on the skirts of this mountain, all large and fortified, viz.,
                    Kala’ Kaissar, Kala’ Sangi, and Fakhrabad. These are described as only a
                    fewfarsakhs, or hours’ march, north-east of Teivereh, which last is in some of
                    our maps. Doubts have indeed been cast on the authenticity of this part of
                    Ferrier’s book, chiefly on account of the extreme brevity of the time which he
                    allows. But the professed journal was probably, under the circumstances, only an
                    expansion from memory of the merest jottings; and several things are in favour
                    of authenticity. His notices of the country, slight as they are, correspond
                    notably in the impression conveyed with those of the Tabakdti-i-Ndsiri(see
                    below). Kaissar, which he mentions, is a place that has already been referred to
                    as the stronghold of Ruknuddin Kurt. Zarni, as roughly located by him,
                    corresponds fairly with what was told Conolly on his journey between Herat and
                    Kandahar, of the position and character of “the old city of Ghore .... now a
                    ruinous, ill-inhabited town, the capital of a petty province, governed by one of
                    Shah Kamran’s sons, who has his residence there” CJoumey, vol. ii. p. 61). Zami
                    is mentioned by Major Leech in connexion with Taiwara (Teivereh of Ferrier) and
                    other places in the south of the Ghùr country, but not so as to determine its
                    position. In some other points, moreover, as to names of chiefs, &amp;c.,
                    Ferrier’s statements agree with Leech’s.</p>
