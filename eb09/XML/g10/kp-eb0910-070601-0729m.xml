                    between 73° 45' and 74° 26 E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the river Tirakul
                    or Auraundem, separating it from SAwant WAri State, on the E. by the Western
                    GhAts, on the S. by Kanara district, and on the W. by the Arabian Sea. Total
                    area, 1062 square miles; population, 392,234.</p>
                <p>This settlement forms a patch of foreign territory on the east of the Bombay
                    coast, and is surrounded on all sides, except to the seaward, by British
                    districts. Goa is a hilly country, especially the recently acquired portion
                    known as the Novas Conquistas. Its distinguishing feature is the Sahyadri
                    Mountains, which after skirting a considerable portion of the north-eastern and
                    south-eastern boundary, branch off westwards across the territory with numerous
                    spurs and ridge3. The plains are well watered by large navigable rivers. The
                    most important is the Mandavi river, on whose banks both the ancient and modern
                    cities of Goa stand, with a fine harbour formed by the promontories of Bardez
                    and Salsette. The port of New Goa or Panjim is divided into two anchorages by
                    the projection of the <hi rend="italic">cabo</hi> (cape) from the island of Goa,
                    both capable of safely accommodating the largest shipping.</p>
                <p>Goa ranks high as regards its early importance among the cities of western India.
                    It emerges very distinctly in the 14th century, and was visited by the famous
                    traveller Ibn Batuta. In the 15th century it formed the chief emporium of trade
                    on the western side of India. Caravans of merchants brought down its products to
                    the coast, and it was the only city in western India which enjoyed at this
                    period a revenue of £10,000. Its wealth and advantageous situation attracted the
                    Mahometan princes of the Deccan, and in 1469 it was taken by the BAhmani king. A
                    fleet of 120 ships operated from the sea; the BAhmani troops forced their way
                    down the passes of the Ghâts; and Goa capitulated. It next passed under the
                    BijApur dynasty, and on the arrival of Albuquerque, at the beginning of the 16th
                    century, its military and commercial capabilities at once struck his mind. In
                    1510 the fleet of Albuquerque, consisting of 20 sail of the line, with a few
                    small vessels and 1200 fighting men, hove in sight off the harbour. A holy
                    mendicant or <hi rend="italic">joyi</hi> had lately foretold its conquest by a
                    foreign people from a distant land, and the disheartened citizens rendered up
                    the town to the strangers. Eight leading men presented the keys of the gates to
                    Albuquerque on their knees, together with a large banner which was usually
                    unfurled on state occasions. Mounted on a richly caparisoned steed, Albuquerque
                    entered the city in a triumphal procession, with the Portuguese banners carried
                    by the flower of the Lisbon nobility and clergy amidst the acclamations of an
                    immense multitude, who showered upon the conqueror filigree flowers of silver
                    and gold. Albuquerque behaved well to the inhabitants, but was shortly
                    afterwards expelled by the BijApur king. However, he returned a few months later
                    with a fleet of 28 ships carrying 1700 men, and after a bloody attack, in which
                    2000 Mussulmans fell, forced his way into the town. For three days the miserable
                    citizens were subjected to every atrocity. The fifth part of the plunder,
                    reserved for the Portuguese crown, amounted to £20,000.</p>
                <p>The conquest of Goa illustrates the essentially military basis on which the
                    Portuguese power in India rested. The subsequent history of the town has been
                    one of luxury, ostentation, and decay. After bearing a siege by the king of
                    Bijapur, and suffering from a terrible epidemic, Goa reached the summit of its
                    prosperity at the end of the 16th century, during the very years when the
                    English Company was struggling into existence under Elizabeth. “Goa Dourada,” or
                    Golden Goa, seemed a place of fabulous wealth to the plain merchants who were
                    destined to be the founders of British India. “Whoever has seen Goa need not see
                    Lisbon,” said a proverb of that day. Indeed, if the accounts of travellers are
                    to be trusted, Goa presented a scene of military, ecclesiastical, and commercial
                    magnificence, such as has had no parallel in the European capitals of India. The
                    brilliant pomp and picturesque display of Goa were due to the fact that it was
                    not only a flourishing harbour, but the centre of a great military and
                    ecclesiastical power. The Portuguese based their dominion in India on conquest
                    by the sword. They laboured to consolidate it by a proselytizing organization
                    which throws all other missionary efforts in India into the shade.</p>
                <p>Goa reached its climax of pomp and power about the year 1600. Immediately
                    afterwards commenced the long struggle with the Dutch, which before the end of
                    the century had stripped Portugal of its fairest possessions in the East. In
                    1603 the Dutch blockaded Goa, but had to raise the siege. In 1635 the old
                    epidemic fever which had afflicted Goa in the preceding century again broke out,
                    and raged for five years. In 1639 the Dutch once more blockaded Goa, but found
                    their meagre force of twelve ships insufficient for its capture. In 1666 luxury
                    and the plague and the Dutch privateers had effectually crippled the commerce of
                    Goa. Thevenot in that year drew a powerful picture of the decayed city. In 1675
                    Dr John Fryer described the city as in a ruinous state, whilst the inhabitants
                    still made pitiful attempts at display in spite of their increasing misery. In
                    1683 Goa narrowly escaped falling into the hands of the Marhatta hordes under
                    Sambâji. Before 1687 the abandonment of Old Goa had taken place. ‘‘ Many
                    streets,” says an official document of that year, “have now become lonely and
                    uninhabited.’’ The river had silted opposite its quays, ships could no longer
                    approach the city, the fever had again broken out, and the population had moved
                    out to suburbs nearer the mouth of the river. In 1695 only 20,000 inhabitants
                    remained. In 1739 the whole territory was attacked by the Marhattas, and only
                    saved by the unexpected appearance of a new viceroy with a fleet. Various
                    attempts were made in vain to rebuild Old Goa, and by the middle of the 18th
                    century “this fairest but poorest settlement had become a burden to the
                    Portuguese Home Government, costing no less than 300,000 piastres a year.”</p>
                <p>In 1759 further attempts to rebuild Old Goa were given up, and the governor
                    changed Ins residence to Panjim or New Goa, the present city, at the mouth of
                    the river. In 17/5 the population was reduced to about 1600 souls, of whom 1198
                    were Christians, almost entirely half-castes and native converts. In 1759 also
                    the Jesuits were expelled. They had got into their hands what little commerce
                    remained, and the last touch was put to the ruin of Old Goa. “The river washes
                    the remains of a great city,—an arsenal in ruins, palaces in ruins, quay walls
                    in ruins, churches in ruins,— all in ruins. We looked and saw the site of the
                    Inquisition, the bishop’s prison, a grand cathedral, great churches, chapels,
                    convents, religious houses, on knolls surrounded by jungle and trees <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n730/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0730-0707"/> scattered all over the country. We saw the
                    crumbling masonry which once marked the lines of streets and enclosures of
                    palaces, dockyards filled with weeds and obsolete cranes.’’</p>
                <p>Γanjim or New Goa lies in lat. 15° 30' N., long. 75° 53' E., at the mouth of the
                    river Mandavi, and is a modern town with few pretensions to architectural
                    beauty. Ships of the largest tonnage can lie out in the harbour, but only
                    vessels of moderate size can be brought alongside of the city. The population is
                    estimated at 15,000. Panjim was the residence of the viceroy from 1759, and in
                    1843 was ranked the capital of the Portuguese possessions in India.</p>
                <p>The territory of Goa, including the two cities of Old Goa and Panjim with the
                    adjoining country under Portuguese rule, amounts, as already stated, to 1062
                    square miles. Of the total population, namely, 392,234, nearly two-thirds or
                    232,089 are Roman Catholics, 128,824 are Hindus, and 2775 Mahometans. The Roman
                    Catholics are subject in spiritual matters to an archbishop, who has the title
                    of primate of the East. The Hindus and Mahometans enjoy perfect liberty in their
                    religious affairs, and have their own places of worship. Agriculture forms the
                    chief industry of the country. The total area under cultivation is 234,754
                    acres. Rice is the staple produce; next is the cocoa-nut, which is deemed
                    important from the variety of uses to which the products are applied. The chief
                    exports are cocoa-nuts, betel-nuts, mangoes, water-melons, cinnamon, pepper,
                    salt fish, gum, firewood, and salt; and the chief imports rice, cloth, sugar,
                    wines, tobacco, glassware, and hardware. The district seldom suffers from great
                    floods. Some parts are subjected to inundations during heavy rains, but little
                    damage is done to the crops. The high-lying town of Panjim takes its name from
                    the native word <hi rend="italic">Ponji,</hi> meaning “arable land that cannot
                    be inundated.” The total revenue in 1873-74 was £108,148; the expenditure,
                    £107,145. The police force numbers 919 men. In 1869-70 there were 137 lower
                    schools, and 25 higher schools, including a National Lyceum with 2433 pupils.
                    There are also medical and chemistry schools, and since 1870 a college for the
                    study of practical sciences has been established. The prevailing endemic
                    diseases are intermittent and remittent fevers, diarrhoea, and dysentery. The
                    average annual rainfall for the three years ending 1875 was 100 <hi
