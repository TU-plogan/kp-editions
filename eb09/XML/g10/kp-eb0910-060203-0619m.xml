                <p><label type="entry">GIN</label>, the name commonly given to an aromatized spirit
                    for drinking, varieties of which are also known as Geneva, Hollands, and
                    Schiedam. Gin is an abbreviation of Geneva, both being primarily derived from
                    the French <hi rend="italic">genièvre</hi> (juniper), from the fact that the
                    characteristic flavouring ingredient of the spirit is juniper berries. Gin was
                    originally and is still largely a Dutch compounded liquor, but it has long been
                    a favourite stimulant beverage with the lower orders in London and other large
                    English towns; and it is manufactured on a great scale by English rectifiers. As
                    each separate distiller varies to some extent the materials and proportions of
                    ingredients used in the preparation of gin, the varieties of the beverage are
                    numerous; but generally a clear distinction exists between Hollands or Dutch gin
                    and English gin. In the manufacture of Hollands a mash is prepared consisting of
                    say 112 lb of malted here or bigg and 228 lb of rye meal, with 460 gallons of
                    water, at 162° Fahr. After infusion a proportion of cold water is added; and
                    when the heat is reduced to about 80°, the whole, about 500 gallons, is run into
                    the fermenting vat, to which about half a gallon of yeast is added. Fermentation
                    speedily ensues, and in about two days the attenuation is complete, although at
                    this stage nearly one-third of the saccharine matter in the liquor is
                    undecomposed. The special features of the fermentation are the small proportion
                    of yeast employed and the imperfect attenuation of the worts. The wash so
                    obtained is distilled, and the resulting low wine is redistilled, with the
                    addition of juniper berries and a little salt, sometimes with the addition of
                    hops. Dutch gins vary much one from another, but generally they are much purer
                    and mellower liquors than the more highly flavoured and frequently adulterated
                    British gins. Good qualities of the latter have as their basis plain grain
                    spirit from the ordinary whisky distilleries, the following being an example of
                    a mixture for distillation :—</p>

                <p>There is, however, much variation in the ingredients employed, and several other
                    flavouring substances—notably cardamoms and cassia or cinnamon—are freely
                    employed. A kind of gin is also prepared by mixing proportions of essential oils
                    by agitation with plain spirits without any redistillation, and much inferior
                    liquor is said to be made with oil of turpentine and aromatic substances without
                    the use of juniper berries at all. To prevent the cloudiness or turbidity that
                    would arise in these inferior beverages when mixed with water, they are fined
                    with alum, potassium carbonate, acetate of lead, or sulphate of zinc. To give
                    factitious pungency and mellowness to such drinks, grains of paradise and
                    Cayenne pepper are freely used, and the absence of spirit is also covered by the
                    use of sugar. What is known as cordial gin is usually more highly aromatized
                    than the other varieties, and sweetened so that it really ought to be classed as
                    a coarse liqueur. In thirty-eight specimens of gin examined by Dr Hassall, the
                    alcoholic strength of which ranged from 22 ’ 35 to 48 ’ 80 degrees, and the
                    sugar present varied between 2 ’ 43 and 9 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 38 per
                    cent., seven were found to contain Cayenne pepper, two had cinnamon or cassia
                    oil, and nearly all contained sulphates. From the fact that the essential oil of
                    juniper is the most powerful of all diuretics, gin is frequently prescribed in
                    diseases of the urinary organs. Its beneficial effects in such cases is most
                    marked; but, on the other hand, the grossly sophisticated liquors which are
                    largely consumed under the name of gin are most detrimental in their effects. In
                    the early part of the 18th century gin-shops multiplied with great rapidity in
                    London, and the use of the beverage increased to an extent so demoralizing that
                    retailers actually exhibited placards in their windows intimating that there
                    people might get drunk for Id., and that clean straw in comfortable cellars
                    would be provided for customers. The legislature was obliged to interfere in
                    order to try to curb the tide of debauchery, and what is known as the Gin Act
                    was passed in 1736, under the provisions of which, dealers were prohibited from
                    selling gin and other spirits in quantities less than 2 gallons without a
                    licence of £50, and an excise duty of 20s. was charged on each gallon. The
                    operation of the Act, however, gave rise to much confusion, to illicit trade,
                    and to gin riots, and after a lapse of seven years the statute was repealed.</p>
