                    (1552-1608), may fairly be called the founder of the science of international
                    law. He was the second son of Matteo Gentili, a physician of noble family and
                    scientific eminence, and was born 14th January 1552’ at Sanginesio,.a small town
                    of the march of Ancona which looks down from the slopes of the Apennines upon
                    the distant Adriatic. After taking the degree of doctor of law at the university
                    of Perugia, and holding a judicial office at Ascoli, he returned to his native
                    city, and was entrusted with the task of recasting its statutes, but, sharing
                    the Protestant opinions of his father, shared also his flight to Carniola, where
                    Matteo was appointed physician to the duchy. The Inquisition condemned the
                    fugitives as contumacious, and they soon received orders to quit the dominions
                    of Austria. Alberico set out for England, travelling by way of Tübingen and
                    Heidelberg, and everywhere<pb break="no"

                    high reputation entitled him. He arrived at Oxford in the autumn of 1580, with a
                    commendatory letter from the earl of Leicester, at that time chancellor of the
                    university, and was shortly afterwards qualified to teach by being admitted to
                    the same degree which he had taken at Perugia. His lectures on Roman law soon
                    became famous, and the dialogues, disputations, and commentaries, which he
                    published henceforth in rapid succession, established his position as an
                    accomplished civilian, of the older and severer type, and secured his
                    appointment in 1587 to the regius professorship of civil law. It was, however,
                    rather by an application of the old learning to the new questions suggested by
                    the modern relations of states that his labours have produced their most lasting
                    result. In 1584 he was consulted by Government as to the proper course to be
                    pursued with Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador, who had been detected in plotting
                    against Elizabeth. He chose the topic to which his attention had thus been
                    directed as a subject for a disputation when Leicester and Sir Philip Sidney
                    visited the schools at Oxford in the same year; and this was six months later
                    expanded into a book, the <hi rend="italic">De legationιbzιs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">libri tres.</hi> In 1588 Alberico selected the law of war as the
                    subject of the law disputations at the annual “Act” which took place in July;
                    and in the autumn published in London the <hi rend="italic">De Jure
                    Belli</hi><hi rend="italic">commentatio</hi><hi rend="italic">prima.</hi> A
                    second and a third <hi rend="italic">Commentatio</hi> followed, and the whole
                    matter, with large additions and improvements, appeared at Hanau, in 1598, as
                    the <hi rend="italic">De Jure Belli</hi><hi rend="italic">libri</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">1res.</hi> It was doubtless in consequence of the reputation
                    gained by these works that Gentili became henceforth more and more engaged in
                    forensic practice, and resided chiefly in London, leaving his Oxford work to be
                    partly discharged by a deputy. In 1600 he was admitted to beamember of Gray’s
                    Inn, and in 1605 was appointed standing counsel to the king of Spain. He died
                    19th June 1608, and was buried, by the side of Dr Matteo Gentili, who had
                    followed his son to England, in the churchyard of St Helen’s, Bishopsgate. By
                    his wife, Hester de Peigni, he left two sons and a daughter. His notes of the
                    cases in which he was engaged for the Spaniards were posthumously published in
                    1613 at Hanau, as 2‰ <hi rend="italic">panicoe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >advocationis</hi><hi rend="italic">libri</hi><hi rend="italic">duo.</hi> This
                    was in accordance with his last wishes; but his direction that the remainder of
                    his MSS. should be burnt was not complied with, since fifteen volumes of them
                    found their way, at the beginning of this century, from Amsterdam to the
                    Bodleian library.</p>
                <p>The true history of Gentili and of his principal writings has only been
                    ascertained quite recently, in consequence of a revived appreciation of the
                    services which he rendered to international law. The movement to do him honour,
                    which originated four or five years since, has in spreading through Europe
                    encountered two curious cross-currents of opinion,—one the ultra-Catholic, which
                    three centuries ago ordered his name to be erased from all public documents and
                    placed his works in the <hi rend="italic">Index·,</hi> another the
                    narrowly-Dutcb, which is, it seems, needlessly careful of the supremacy of
                    Grotius. Preceding writers had dealt with various international questions, but
                    they dealt with them singly, and with a servile submission to the decisions of
                    the church. It was left to Gentili to grasp as a whole the relations of states
                    one to another, to distinguish international questions from questions with which
                    they are more, or less intimately connected, and to attempt their solution by
                    principles entirely independent of the authority of Rome. He uses, without
                    yielding to them implicit deference, the reasonings of the civil and even the
                    canon law, but he proclaims as his real guide the <hi rend="italic">Jus
                    Haturce,</hi> the highest common sense of mankind, by which historical
                    precedents are to be criticized, and, if necessary, set aside.</p>
                <p>His faults are not few. His style is prolix, obscure, and to the modern reader
                    pedantic enough; but a comparison of his greatest work with what had been
                    written upon the same subject by, for instance, Belli, or Soto, or even Ayala,
                    will show that he greatly improved upon his predecessors, not only by the
                    fulness with which he has worked out points of detail, but also by clearly
                    separating the law of war from martial law, and by placing the subject once for
                    all upon a non-theological basis. If, on the other hand, the same work be
                    compared with <hi rend="italic">De Jure Belli</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    Pacis</hi> of Grotius, it is at once evident that the later writer is indebted
                    to the earlier, not only for a large portion of his illustrative erudition, but
                    also for all that is commendable in the method and arrangement of the
                    treatise.</p>

                    volumes were lost “pessimo pontificiorum facinore,” meaning probably that they
                    were left behind in his flight to Carniola.</p>
