                    repeated in the Roman <hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum,</hi> and in the Spanish
                    breviary, was born in Cappadocia of noble Christian parents, from whom he
                    received a careful religious training. Having embraced the profession of a
                    soldier, he rapidly rose under Diocletian to high military rank. When that
                    emperor had begun to manifest a pronounced hostility towards Christianity George
                    sought a personal interview with him, in which he made deliberate profession of
                    his faith, and, earnestly remonstrating against the persecution which had begun,
                    resigned his commission. He was immediately laid under arrest, and after various
                    tortures, finally put to death at Nicomedia (or, according to other accounts, at
                    Lydda) April 23, 303. His festival is observed on that anniversary by the entire
                    Roman Church as a semi-duplex, and by the Spanish Catholics as a duplex of the
                    first class with an octave. The day is also celebrated as a principal feast in
                    the Greek Church, where the saint is distinguished by the titles <hi
                    rend="italic">μeγaλoμapτυp</hi> and <hi rend="italic">τpoπaιoφ0poς.</hi></p>
                <p>In the canon of Pope Gelasius (494) George is mentioned among the martyrs whom
                    the Roman Church venerates, but whose gesta it does not read.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The full text of this canon
                    is given by Heylin, p. ii. c. 9.</p></note> The language implies that even at
                    that date much had been written concerning him, but little that the Catholic
                    Church could accept as trustworthy. Numerous traits from the biography of the
                    heretical archbishop had already crept, it would seem, into the acta of the
                    orthodox soldier; and it was feared that any vigorous attempt to eliminate these
                    would leave but a small residue of fact. Modern investigation has proved that
                    apprehension to have been well-founded, for even on the Catholic side in the
                    controversy regarding the existence and character of St George, the chief
                    contention is simply the improbability that within the space of 150 years a
                    turbulent and unscrupulous Arian ecclesiastic should have come to be reputed a
                    holy martyr for the Catholic faith. The caution displayed with regard to St
                    George in the 5th century was not long preserved; Gregory of Tours, for example,
                    asserts that his relics actually existed in the French village of Le Maine,
                    where many miracles were wrought by means of them; and the Venerable Bede, while
                    still explaining that the gesta of St George are reckoned apocryphal, commits
                    himself to the statement that the martyr was beheaded under Dacian, king of
                    Persia, whose wife Alexandra, however, adhered to the Catholic faith. The dragon
                    was a still later introduction into the legend, which, as given by Jacobus de
                    Voragine and later writers, ceases to represent the hero as in any sense a
                    sufferer. In its current popular form the story of his successful conflict is
                    probably a mere modification of the old Aryan my thus, to which many
                    interpreters are now disposed to attach a solar interpretation.</p>
                <p>The popularity of the name of St George in England dates from the time of Richard
                    Coeur de Lion, who, it was said, had successfully invoked his aid during the
                    first crusade; but it was not till the time of Edward III. that he was made
                    patron of the kingdom, although at the council of Oxford in 1222 it had already
                    been ordered that his feast should be kept as a national festival. The republics
                    of Genoa and Venice were also under his protection; and his name is much revered
                    in all the Oriental churches.</p>
