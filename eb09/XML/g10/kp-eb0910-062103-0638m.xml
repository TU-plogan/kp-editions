                    never practised at the bar. During the reign of Charles X. he obtained several
                    Academy prizes, and a mastership at the Lycée Louis le Grand, though his liberal
                    principles stood a little in his way. In 1828 he began to contribute to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Débats,</hi> on the staff of
                    which he remained for nearly half a century. At the accession of Louis Philippe
                    he was appointed professor of history at the Sorbonne and master of requests.
                    Soon afterwards he exchanged his chair of history for one of literature,
                    continuing to contribute political articles to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Débats,</hi> and sitting as deputy in the chamber from 1835 to 1848. As a
                    professor he directed his efforts chiefly against the clerical reaction. In 1844
                    he was elected a member of the Academy. During the revolution of February 1848
                    Girardin was for a moment a minister, but after the establishment of the
                    republic he was not re-elected deputy, nor did he take any prominent part in
                    politics during the second empire save with his pen. In the capacity of
                    journalist he continued to be active, and interested himself not merely in
                    moderate opposition to the Government at home but also in foreign politics,
                    especially in the affairs of Syria, Greece, and Turkey. After the war of 1870 he
                    was returned to the Bordeaux assembly by his old <pb break="no"

                    tendencies and his objections to the republic were strong, and though he at
                    first supported Thiers, he afterwards became a leader öf the opposition to the
                    president He died, however, before Thiers wa's actually driven from power.
                    Saint-Marc Girardin was one of the most distinguished of the many writers whose
                    political and literary activities combined have raised them to distinction in
                    France during this century, but to whom there cannot be assigned the highest
                    rank either as politicians or as littérateurs. His political claims were not
                    above those of a vigorous and intelligent journalist. His professorial lectures
                    were popular and well attended; his literary knowledge was wide, and included
                    German and Italian; his criticisms, on which his claims as a man of letters
                    rest, were acute and well expressed, but not remarkable for great subtlety or
                    novelty of thought or style.</p>
                <p>His chief work is his Cours de littérature dramatique (1843- 1863), a series of
                    lectures the delivery and publication of which lasted for over twenty years.
                    This λvork has for second title De Γ Usage des Passions dans le Drame, which
                    describes it more accurately. The author goes through the list of the various
                    passions, and. of the chief situations which call them out, discussing at the
                    same time the mode in which they are treated in the most celebrated dι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> amas of ancient and modern times. The source of these
                    illustrations is not indeed limited to drama, and the lecturer takes a wide
                    range over the fields of poetry and romance. The result was doubtless as a
                    course of lectures interesting and stimulating; as a book it is somewhat
                    desultory. Among his other works may be noticed Essais de Littérature (1844, 2
                    vols.), made up chiefly of contributions to the Débats, his Notices sur T
                    Allemagne (1834), and many volumes of collected Soxιυenirs, Reflexions, &amp;c.,
                    on foreign countries and passing events. His latest works of literary importance
                    were La Fontaine et les Fabulistes (1867) and an Étude sur J. J. Rousseaι&lt;,
                    (1870) which had appeared in the Revue des Deux Mondes.</p>
