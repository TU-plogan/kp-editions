                    1778. His father, Antoine Gay, who was procureur du roi and judge at
                    Pont-de-Noblac, had added to the common family name the distinctive title
                    Lussac, from a small property he had in the neighbourhood of St Léonard. The
                    family consisted of two sons, of whom Joseph Louis was the elder, and three
                    daughters. Intended for the bar, young Gay-Lussac prosecuted his early studies
                    in Latin, and other elementary subjects at home, under the superintendence of
                    the Abbé Bourdeix and other masters, until 1794, when he was sent to Paris,
                    where he worked very hard for three years preparing for admission to the École
                    Polytechnique. After a brilliant examination he was received into this
                    institution on December 27, 1797, whence on the 22d of November 1800 he was
                    transferred to the school Des Ponts et Chaussées. Shortly afterwards he
                    wasassigned to Berthollet, whohadreturned from Napoleon’s Egyptian expedition,
                    and who was desirous of having an able student from the École Polytechnique to
                    aid him in his researches. The results expected by the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Statique Chimique</hi> were not verified by his assistant’s
                    experiments, which seem to have been recorded without any consideration of the
                    theorizer’s feelings. It was on this occasion, according to Arago, that
                    Berthollet, at first nettled to find that his ideas were not confirmed,
                    delivered himself as follows: “Young man, it is your destiny to make
                    discoveries. You shall be henceforth my companion. I wish—it is a title of which
                    I am sure I shall have cause some day to be proud—I wish to be your father in
                    science.”</p>
                <p>Gay-Lussac accordingly entered on a long series of researches upon certain
                    physical phenomena, which though of constant recurrence in experimental
                    inquiries, had up to this time been very imperfectly examined. In his first
                    memoir <hi rend="italic">{Ann.</hi><hi rend="italic">de Chimie,</hi> t. xliii.,
                    1802) he shows that different gases are dilated in the same proportion when
                    heated from 0° to 80° (Réaumur). He does not seem to have been aware of Dalton’s
                    experiments on this subject, which were indeed very far from being accurate; but
                    he states in a footnote that “le cit. Charles<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The inventor of the “Charlière,” or hydrogen
                    balloon.</p></note> avait remarqué depuis 15 ans la même propriété dans ces gaz;
                    mais, n’ayant jamais publié ses résultats, c’est par le plus grand hasard que je
                    les ai connus.” In return for his having thus rescued from oblivion the remark
                    which his fellowcitizen, probably wisely, did not think worth recording, some
                    recent authors have changed the title of the law from that of Gay-Lussac to that
                    of Charles. The investigations recorded in this memoir were followed by
                    experiments on the improvements of thermometersand barometers, on the tension of
                    vapours, their mixture with gases, and the determination of their density,
                    evaporation, hygrometry, and capillarity. In course of these researches, which
                    engaged him for a couple of years, he acquired not only dexterity in
                    manipulation and the contrivance of experiments, but a great deal of valuable
                    knowledge of physics. During the interval, in the year 1802, he had been
                    nominated Fourcroy’s demonstrator at the École Polytechnique, and as he had in
                    this capacity to .lecture frequently for the professor, he was beginning to
                    acquire reputation as a teacher and expounder of chemistry and physics, by the
                    clearness, precision, and care which his lectures evinced. In 1803-4 certain
                    results respecting terrestrial magnetism had been obtained during two balloon
                    ascents, which appeared of so much interest that the French Academy was desirous
                    of having them repeated. Through Berthollet and Chaptai the balloon which had
                    been used in Egypt was obtained, and fitted up with various instruments; the
                    observations were entrusted to Gay-Lussac and Biot, <pb break="no"

                    the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, on August 24, 1804. In this ascent an
                    altitude of 4000 metres was attained, but unexpected difficulties were
                    encountered, and the results were not decisive. Not satisfied with the
                    expedition, Gay-Lussac got a larger balloon provided with every requisite, and
                    made an ascent by himself on September 16 of the same year. On this occasion the
                    balloon rose to a height of 7016 metres, an altitude greater than any which had
                    been formerly reached, and surpassed only by a few later ascents. At this great
                    elevation of nearly 23,000 feet, and with the thermometer at 9⅜ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> C. below freezing, Gay-Lussac remained for a
                    considerable time making observations on temperature, on the moisture of the
                    air, on magnetism, and other points. He observed particularly that he had
                    considerable difficulty in breathing, that his pulse was quickened, and that by
                    the absence of moisture in the air his mouth and throat became so parched that
                    it was painful to swallow even a piece of bread. The experiments on magnetism
                    for which the ascent was primarily made were imperfect, but they led him to the
                    conclusion that the magnetic effect at all attainable elevations above the
                    earth’s surface remains constant.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Having collected samples of air at different elevations he, on his return to
                    Paris, proceeded to analyse them; and in conjunction with Alexander von
                    Humboldt, whom he had associated with himself in this investigation, he
                    published several papers on eudiometric analysis and related topics. The memoir,
                    which was read to the Institute on October 1, 1804, contained the germ of what
                    was afterwards Gay-Lussac’s most important generalization. The authors observed
                    that when oxygen and hydrogen combine together by volume, it is in the
                    proportion of one volume of the former to two volumes of the latter. Prior to
                    this the numerous experiments on the volume composition of water had always
                    brought out various complicated ratios, though approaching the simple one more
                    or less closely. It was not, however, till 1808, that Gay-Lussac announced the
                    law of combination by volume in its general form. Shortly after these
                    investigations were completed, Gay-Lussac got leave of absence to accompany Von
                    Humboldt on a scientific journey to Switzerland, Italy, and Germany. Provided
                    with physical and meteorological instruments, they left Paris March 12,1805, and
                    travelled by Lyons, Chambery, and Mont Cenis to Genoa, and thence to Rome, where
                    they arrived on July 5. After a short stay at Rome in the residence of William
                    von Humboldt, during which Gay-Lussac made a few chemical analyses, they
                    departed for Naples in company with Leopold von Buch, afterwards so eminent as a
                    geologist. During this visit Gay-Lussac had the opportunity of studying on the
                    spot volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Vesuvius, which was in violent action,
                    he ascended six times. After this the party went back to Rome, and then started
                    for Florence on September 17, 1805. A few days having been spent there, they
                    went on to Bologna and thence to Milan, which they reached on October I, and
                    there they had the pleasure of meeting Volta. The party crossed the St Gotthard
                    on October 14-15, in the midst of a βtorm which prevented their seeing anything,
                    and after some delay reached Göttingen, where they were received with much
                    attention by Blumenbach, the famous naturalist. On November 16 they arrived at
                    Berlin, where the winter and the following springwere spent. In this way
                    Gay-Lussac became acquainted with the best society in Berlin, and was especially
                    intimate with Klaproth and Erman. In spring he hurriedly returned to Paris. The
                    death of an Academician had left a vacant place, and he was hopeful that he
                    might be elected to fill it. Arago remarks that it is curious that Gay-Lussac
                    should have found it necessary to be on the spot to ensure success. What he had
                    already done for science might have been considered sufficient, apart from
                    personal considerations, but there were prejudices which might have acted
                    unfavourably, if he had not been present to meet them. These were, however,
                    successfully overcome, and he entered the Academy in 1806. In the following year
                    was inaugurated the Société d’Arcueil, a small group of scientific men who used
                    to assmble at Berthollet’s house. Gay-Lussac was an original member of this
                    society, which is of interest chiefly on account of its having been the means of
                    publishing some papers which have since proved of great historical interest. The
                    results of his magnetic observations made along with Humboldt were published in
                    vol. i. of its <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> (1807); and vol. ii. (1809)
                    contains the important memoir on gaseous combination, in which he pointed out
                    that, when gases combine with one another by volume or by measure, they do so in
                    the very simplest proportions, 1 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and so on, and that the
                    volume of the product in the gaseous state bears a very simple ratio to that of
                    the constituents. This law, which, along with Humboldt, he had shown to be true
                    of water, he extended to several other gases, and he even deduced from the
                    vapour density of compounds that of certain elements, more particularly, carbon,
                    mercury, and iodine, which had not been ascertained by direct experiment.</p>
                <p>It would take too much space to give in detail the criticism which the
                    enunciation of the principle evoked, more particularly from Dalton, who would
                    not accept Gay-Lussac’s position, and affirmed his belief that “gases do not
                    unite in equal or exact measures in any one instance; when they appear to do so,
                    it is owing to the inaccuracy of our experiments.”<note anchored="true"

                    time the difficulty that the specific gravity of gases and vapours had been
                    imperfectly determined, and the necessary consequence of Gay-Lussac’s law, that
                    the specific gravity and combining weight of elements should be expressed by the
                    same number, could not be experimentally confirmed. Moreover, Dalton rested
                    combination on atomic and not on combining weights, and the numbers he employed
                    were in almost every instance very different from those which more accurate
                    analysis has since determined. But the imperfect character of the then available
                    data, and the amount of seemingly adverse experimental evidence, only throw a
                    stronger light on the genius of Gay-Lussac in divining a law which, as science
                    has progressed, has been duly confirmed, and which not only forms the most
                    important control of the combining weight of chemical substances, but, when
                    interpreted by the kinetic theory of gases, shows that the physical molecules
                    (that is to say, the portions of the substance which are not broken up into
                    smaller -parts during the motion which we call heat) exist in equal numbers in
                    equal volumes of different gases at the same temperature and pressure. This law,
                    which has as high a claim as the other to bear the name of Gay-Lussac, is also
                    sometimes deprived of that honour, and called the law of Avogadro, who, long
                    afterwards, by his more extended researches, caused the importance of the law to
                    be recognized by chemists.</p>
                <p>The next events in Gay-Lussac’s scientific career are connected with what may be
                    called his rivalry with Davy, who in matter of age (b. December 17,1778) was
                    almost exactly his contemporary. In 1808 when Davy, having isolated potassium
                    and sodium, was awarded Napoleon’s prize for the most important discovery in
                    voltaic electricity, the emperor is said to have asked how it was that these
                    discoveries were made abroad and French prizes were carried away. Having <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0132-0123"/> been informed that there was no battery of power
                    equal to that used by Davy, he caused a very large one to be made, and presented
                    it to the École Polytechnique. While waiting for it, Gay-Lussac and Thénard
                    succeeded in preparing potassium by a direct chemical action, in which fused
                    potash was brought in contact with red-hot iron. This method enabled chemists to
                    prepare the alkali metals in quantity, and Gay-Lussac and Thénard availed
                    themselves of it to examine the properties of potassium very completely, and not
                    only so, but also to use it as a means of decomposing other substances. It was
                    in this way that they separated boron from boracic acid, an element which was
                    also prepared by Davy with the same materials. It is worth notice that Davy
                    admitted the advantage of the method of Gay-Lussac and Thénard, though he seems
                    to have subsequently regarded their appropriation of the newly-discovered metal
                    as not altogether warranted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Gay-Lussac and Thénard made no claim, of course, to the
                    discovery of potassium and sodium, though several important discoveries followed
                    from their experiments. Thus, in addition to boron, they got also the fluoride
                    of boron; and by the rapid combustion of the alkali metals in dry oxygen they
                    got their peroxides, by means of which Thénard subsequently prepared the
                    peroxide of hydrogen. At first, however, they seem to have thought that the
                    alkali metals contained hydrogen, and it was not for a couple of years that they
                    accepted Davy’s view of their simplicity. Indeed, about this time there appears
                    to have been considerable uncertainty about the elemental character of the
                    metals, it being thought that they contained hydrogen, an idea which, on account
                    of its retrograde nature, was criticized by I)avy as a kind of phlogistic
                    revival.</p></note> The researches with the great battery'after it was made did
                    not come up to their expectations; the power fell far short of what had been
                    anticipated, and they confined themselves rather to an examination of the
                    phenomena presented by the apparatus itself, than to using it as an engine for
                    effecting important decompositions.</p>
                <p>In 1809 was published the second investigation parallel to one by Davy, namely,
                    upon hydrochloric (or, as it was then called, muriatic) acid, and chlorine, then
                    called oxymuriatic acid. This memoir was read to the Institute, and was also
                    published in the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(ΓArcueil.</hi> Gay-Lussac and Thénard describe a crowd of
                    reactions they had tried for determining the characters of these bodies. They
                    pointed ont differences between the muriatic and other acids, and indicated that
                    the anomalies which it presented were explicable either on the hypothesis of
                    water being an essential constituent of the acid, or on that of the oxymuriatic
                    acid being a simple gas. At the end of their memoir, however, they decided in
                    favour of oxymuriatic acid being compound, although they had failed to get
                    oxygen from it by heating it with carbon. The explanation of this decision seems
                    to be that, while they themselves were influenced to some extent by Lavoisier’s
                    oxygen theory of acids, some of the other members of the Arcueil Society, such
                    as Laplace and Berthollet, were keen Lavoisierians, and were prepared to oppose
                    any criticism which might lead to a modification of the great Frenchman’s
                    opinion on so vital a point. To admit the existence of an acid without oxygen
                    might have led to a loss of the whole scientific position which France had
                    gained by Lavoisier’s defeat of phlogiston. Davy, who was not under the same
                    influence, declared, as the result of his inquiries, that oxymuriatic acid gas
                    was simple, and that therefore there may be acids without oxgyen. Sometime
                    after, Gay-Lussac and Thénard agreed with this view, which they could do with
                    less hesitation, as they had themselves indicated it in their own memoir.</p>
                <p>Among the investigations which Gay-Lussac undertook with Thénard in the years
                    1810-1811, and which ultimately yielded most valuable results, must be mentioned
                    those upon organic chemistry, and especially upon the analysis of fixed organic
                    compounds. Before this time the only way of determining the composition of
                    organic substances was to explode them with oxygen, and as this method was
                    practicable only in the case of bodies which were gaseous, or could be readily
                    volatilized, the great majority of fixed organic substances still remained
                    unexamined. Gay-Lussac and Thénard introduced the plan of adding some oxidizing
                    agent to the substance and burning it in a tube. They used chlorate of
                    potassium, and the products of combustion were collected over mercury. The
                    results obtained were in some cases very accurate, but the process was difficult
                    of execution, and it is singular that the authors should have preferred it to
                    combustion with oxide of copper, which they also tried. In 1815, however,
                    Gay-Lussac employed the latter agent for the examination of cyanogen, and the
                    other method was abandoned. The final improvements were made some years later by
                    Liebig, when working in Gay-Lussac’s laboratory. By their original method
                    Gay-Lussac and Thénard determined the composition of'fifteen organic substances,
                    including sugar, starch, gum, wax, oil, various woods, resin; mucic, oxalic,
                    tartaric, citric, and acetic acids; and albumen, fibrin, gelatin, and casein.
                    Gay-Lussac succeeded also, in 1811, in obtaining pure hydrocyanic acid. He
                    described its physical properties, but did not announce anything about its
                    composition till 1815, when he published his celebrated memoir in which he
                    described cyanogen as a compound radical, prussic acid as a compound of this
                    radical with hydrogen alone, and the prussiates as compounds of the radical with
                    metals. He also showed how to prepare free cyanogen, and explained Berthollet’s
                    oxyprussic acid to be really chloride of cyanogen. The proof that prussic acid
                    contains hydrogen and no oxygen was a most important support to the hydrogen
                    acid theory, while the isolation of the radical cyanogen was of equal importance
                    for the subsequent epoch of compound radicals in organic chemistry.</p>
                <p>In 1813-14 Gay-Lussac published his memoirs on iodine. This was the third
                    investigation which involved a rivalry with Davy, and it was also that about
                    which there was most feeling. Courtois had discovered the substance in 1811, and
                    had given some of it for examination to Clément-Désormes. He had only published
                    a brief notice of it when Davy arrived in Paris, having obtained express
                    permission of Napoleon to pass through France on his way to Italy. Davy got a
                    few fragments of this curious substance, and after a brief examination with a
                    very limited portable laboratory which he had with him, perceived its analogy to
                    chlorine, and drew the conclusion that it must be a simple body of similar
                    character. Gay-Lussac, it is said, having heard of Davy’s making experiments
                    with it, went off to Courtois, got a specimen, and proceeded to examine it. He
                    also saw its likeness to chlorine, but his previous decision respecting that
                    body hampered him, and it was with some hesitation that he ultimately
                    acknowledged its elemental character. Whether or not Gay-Lussac was actuated by
                    the motive ascribed to him by Arago—that it would be a reflexion on French
                    science were the settlement of the characters of this substance to be left to a
                    foreigner visiting Paris—it is not necessary to enquire; but Davy seems to have
                    felt that Gay-Lussac was competing, and not altogether fairly, with him. In a
                    letter to Clément he gives a brief account of his work, and lays claim to the
                    first revelation of the elemental character of iodine, and again in a subsequent
                    letter to his brother, which contains a short review of the Parisian chemists
                    and their reception of him, the only complaint he makes is that Gay-Lussac had
                    played him a trick in trying to appropriate the discovery of the character of
                    iodine and of hydriodic acid. Quite apart, however, from this claim on
                    Gay-Lussac’s part, the memoirs remain models of investigation and description.
                    Davy quite freely admitted that full licht might be expected on the subject from
                    its <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n133/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0133-0124"/> having been taken in hand by so able and accurate
                    a chemist as Gay-Lussac.</p>
                <p>The year 1815 saw the completion of the research on cyanogen already referred to,
                    and with it concludes the period of Gay-Lussac’s most important discoveries.
                    Having now attained a leading if not the foremost place among the scientific men
                    in the French capital, his advice was often required on important questions. His
                    attention was thus turned in part from purely scientific subjects to points of
                    practical interest. In these new fields, however, he displayed the same powers
                    which he had exercised so sedulously in the pursuit of scientific truth; in fact
                    he was now to introduce and establish scientific accuracy where there had been
                    previously only practical approximations. The most important of these later
                    discoveries were the method of estimating the amount of real alkali in potash
                    and soda by the volume of standard acid required for neutralization; the method
                    of estimating the amount of available chlorine in bleaching powder by a solution
                    of arsenious acid; directions for the use of the centesimal alcoholometer,
                    published in 1824, and specially commended by the commission of the Institute
                    appointed to report on it, as displaying all the accuracy and exhaustive
                    treatment of the author; and lastly, the perfecting of the method of assaying
                    silver by a standard solution of common salt, a volume on which was published in
                    1833. This last has superseded the old method of assaying silver by cupellation,
                    as being more rapid, more accurate, and easier of execution; and indeed all
                    these processes are so complete and satisfactory, and are besides so identified
                    with their author’s name, that his reputation is secured by them, quite
                    independently of his earlier work. In what has been said above, only the more
                    important of Gay-Lussac’s discoveries have been alluded to. To enter into an
                    account, however brief, of all his labours, would occupy more space than can be
                    allowed here. Indeed the list of his papers in the Royal Society’s catalogue
                    amounts to 148, besides those of which he was joint-author with Von Humboldt,
                    Thénard, Welter, and Liebig; and they embrace every department of the science as
                    cultivated fifty years ago. Among his later researches may be mentioned those on
                    fermentation, and those executed by Liebig in conjunction with him, after the
                    young German chemist had gained the coveted admission to Gay-Lussac’s private
                    laboratory during the years 1823- 24. The latter include improvements on organic
                    analysis, and the examination of fulminic acid. Gay-Lussac continued his work,
                    and published the results in the <hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie,</hi> of
                    which he had been joint-editor for some thirty years, up till almost his death,
                    which took place at Paris on May 9, 1850.</p>
                <p>Some of the appointments he held have been already referred to. After having
                    acted as Fourcroy’s demonstrator, he was made professor of chemistry at the
                    École Polytechnique. From 1808 to 1832 he was professor of physics at the
                    Sorbonne, and he only resigned that office when he was made professor of
                    chemistry at the Jardin des Plantes. Besides being on the commission of arts and
                    manufactures, and the “administration” of gunpowder and nitre, he was appointed
                    assayer for the mint in 1829. In 1831 he was elected to the chamber of deputies
                    as member for Haute Vienne, and finally, in 1839, entered the chamber of
                    peers.</p>
                <p>Gay-Lussac’s scientific work is remarkable not only for its range but for its
                    intrinsic worth, its accuracy of detail, its experimental ingenuity, its
                    descriptive clearness, and the soundness of its inferences. He did not hesitate
                    to criticize his own results, and replace them by others more accurate either of
                    his own or of another’s discovery; he improved and invented physical and
                    chemical apparatus: the barometer, thermometer, cathetometer alcoholometer, and
                    the burette, which still bears his name, all bear witness to his ingenuity and
                    practical skill. He devised new analytical methods; he discovered new
                    substances, such as fluoride of boron, and iodic, hydrosulphocyanic, dithionic,
                    and hyposulphurous acids; he enlarged and corrected the knowledge of those
                    already discovered; he examined the physical conditions of chemical action; he
                    searched into the causes of chemical combination and chemical change. That he
                    had the power of grasping the law underlying a few facts is nowhere more evident
                    than in the memoir on gaseous combination, his most important contribution to
                    science. That he missed the opportunity of assigning the chief limit to
                    Lavoisier’s hypothesis, must be ascribed partly at least to the influence of
                    others. Authority decided it, perhaps against his secret convictions.</p>
                <p>From Arago’s and other notices one gathers that Gay-Lussac was reticent, patient,
                    persevering, accurate to punctiliousness, perhaps a little cold and reserved,
                    and not unaware of his great ability. But he was also bold and energetic, not
                    only in his work, but equally so in defence and support of his friends. His
                    earliest childish adventures, as told by Arago, herald the fearless aeronaut and
                    undaunted investigator of volcanic eruptions. The endurance he exhibited under
                    the laboratory accidents which befell him shows the power of will with which he
                    could face the prospect of becoming blind and useless for the prosecution of the
                    science which was his very life, and of which he is one of the most
                    distinguished ornaments. It was only at the very end, when the disease from
                    which he suffered left him no hope, that he complained with some bitterness of
                    the hardship of leaving this world when so many discoveries were making, and
                    when so many more were likely to be made.</p>
                <p>The more important of Gay-Lussac’s papers are scattered through journals
                    difficult of access. The most complete list of them is contained in the Royal
                    Society’s catalogue of scientific papers; lists are also given at the end of
