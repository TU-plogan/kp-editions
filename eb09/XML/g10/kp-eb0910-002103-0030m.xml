                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0031-0022"/> their independence. As Tacitus justly remarks,
                    the death of Nero divulged that secret of the empire, that emperors could be
                    made elsewhere than at Rome. From the little we know of his earlier years he
                    appears as a young man of remarkable gifts and even fascination—a strange
                    contrast to his weak and unlovable old age. His biographer, Suetonius, relates
                    that both Augustus and Tiberius prophesied to him his future rise. The story is
                    improbable, though in part borne out by Tacitus, and rests on the authority of a
                    credulous gossip, who inserts au omen or a prodigy at every turn of his hero’s
                    fortunes'; but it helps to show, what we learn from other sources, that while
                    still a youth he was regarded as one who was capable of great thiugs. He
                    resisted the solicitations of the empress Agrippina, and refused the rich legacy
                    of Livia Augusta. Rising through the various grades of office to the consulship
                    iu 33 A.D., he acquired a high and well-merited reputation both as a general aud
                    an administrator in the provinces of Gaul, of Africa, and of Spain, which he
                    successively held. For the first half of Nero’s reign he lived in retirement,
                    till, in 61, the emperor bestowed on him the province of Hispania
                    Tarraconensis.</p>
                <p>The first years of his rule were marked by rigorous discipline and strict
                    justice, which sometimes degenerated into cruelty. We are told how he nailed the
                    hand of a cheating money-changer to his bench, and how, when a guardian who had
                    murdered his ward appealed to his Roman citizenship, he allowed him the honour
                    of a higher gallows. It is true that during the later period of his
                    administration he was indolent and apathetic, whether it was that he sought to
                    elude the jealousy of Nero, or, as is more probable, felt the growing
                    infirmities of age. Yet his career, taken as a whole, shows the justice of the
                    common judgment, as reported by Tacitus, that all would have pronounced him fit
                    for empire had he not been emperor indeed. In the spring of 68 Galba was holding
                    an assembly at New Carthage when the news reached him of the insurrection in
                    Gaul. The appeal of Vindex urging him to assume the championship of the
                    oppressed human race placed Galba in an awkward dilemma, and his decision was
                    prompted not so much by ambition as by fear of Nero, whom he knew to be plotting
                    his death. The fall and suicide of Vindex renewed his hesitation, when the news
                    that Nymphidius Sabinus, the prefect of the praetorians,-had declared in his
                    favour, and by large promises in his name carried the troops with him, revived
                    his spirits. Before, he had only dared to call himself the minister of the
                    senate and Roman people; he now assumed the title of Caesar, and marched
                    straight for Rome.</p>
                <p>At first he was welcomed by the senate and the party of order, but he was never
                    popular with the soldiers or the people, and he soon forfeited the regard even
                    of his few supporters. He was ruined by his virtues no less than by his vices.
                    To the praetorians who claimed their promised largess he replied that he chose
                    his soldiers aud would not buy them. The mob was disgusted at the moroseness and
                    niggardliness of a prince who hated all display, and rewarded a popular singer
                    with a paltry present of five denarii. But the respectable classes had graver
                    causes of discontent. They soon found that the government was wholly in the
                    hands of three favourites—two of them officers, and one a freedman who had
                    followed Galba from Spain. Thus the worst abuses of the last reign were revived,
                    without any of its brilliance and gaiety.</p>
                <p>Galba was first made aware of the general discontent by an outbreak among the
                    legions of Germany. He sought to avert the rising storm by an act which, if
                    better timed and performed in a more popular way, might have saved him. He
                    adopted as his coadjutor and successor Piso Frugi Licinianus, a man in every way
                    worthy of the honour. The speech in which he announced to Piso his election has
                    a genuine ring, and convinces us that his choice was wise and patriotic; but by
                    the populace it was attributed solely to fear, and the praetoriaus were
                    indignant at it because unaccompanied with the usual donative. When the elements
                    of a revolution are all in train a leader is not far to seek. Salvius Otho, a
                    disappointed candidate for the office of Piso, eutered into communication with
                    the discontented praetorians, and was by them adopted as their emperor. Two
                    soldiers from the ranks undertook to transfer the empire of Rome, and actually
                    transferred it. Galba, on his way to meet the rebels, was met by a troop of
                    cavalry and butchered near the Lacus Curtius. A common slave severed the bald
                    head from the body, and thrusting it inside his toga presented the bloody
                    offering to Otho. Thus perished, unwept and unpitied, a man who, had he died a
                    proconsul instead of an emperor, would have left as fair a fame as any Roman of
                    the first century.</p>
