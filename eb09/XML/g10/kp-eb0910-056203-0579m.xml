                    city of Belgium, at the head of the province of East Flanders, is situated about
                    30 miles to the west of Antwerp on the Scheldt and the Lys. The two streams
                    branch out to such an extent as to partition the town into 26 islands, which are
                    connected by about 270 bridges, 42 being of stone, and 28 of the others being
                    wooden structures of considerable size. In general Ghent is well built, and,
                    though the older portion has narrow and gloomy lanes, it occupies as a whole a
                    larger area than most European towns in proportion to the population<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0580-0563"/> and the number of houses. A striking and pleasing
                    feature is the number of promenades, the most noteworthy being the Coupure or
                    “Cutting,” so called from the branch of the Bruges canal constructed in 1758.
                    Gardens, orchards, and corn-fields are enclosed within the ancient boundaries of
                    the walls, which extended nearly 8 miles in circumference. An excellent view of
                    the city and its environs is obtained from the belfry of the grand old
                    watch-tower erected by the men of Ghent between 1183 and 1339, from whose summit
                    the voice of the famous bell Roland called the burghers together for fire or
                    fray. The present spire of cast iron dates from 1854, but it is still surmounted
                    by the golden dragon brought to Ghent from the church of St Sophia in
                    Constantinople, not long after the conquest of that city by the crusaders.
                    Roland was removed by Charles V., and its place is now supplied by a chime of 44
                    bells.</p>
                <p>Almost all the houses of the wealthier classes of Ghent are constructed after the
                    Italian fashion, with wide portes-cochères, spacious courtyards, and lofty
                    staircases; but along the quays and in the older streets there are still
                    numerous specimens of the quainter and grander architecture of the 16th and 17th
                    centuries. The industrial classes live for the most part in long monotonous rows
                    of poor-looking houses. Among the public squares the most noteworthy are the
                    Friday Market <hi rend="italic">(Marche du Vendredi),</hi> where in former days
                    the counts of Flanders were inaugurated and the trades unions used to assemble;
                    the <hi rend="italic">Kauter</hi> (the word in Flemish means field), which
                    became the Place d’Armes in 1812, and is. the favourite rendezvous of the
                    fashionable world; the Plaine de St Pierre, especially used for military
                    reviews; the Corn Market, which is one of the busiest spots in the town; and the
                    Place Sainte Pharailde, which contains the façade of the fish-market and the
                    gate of the Counts’ Castle, and is annually the scene of the so-called Fair of
                    the Little Presents <hi rend="italic">(Preseηtjesmarkt).</hi> The Plaine des
                    Recollets, which takes its name from the convent of the Reformed Franciscans
                    (1225-1796), was in 1836 chosen as the site of the new court-house. Near the
                    Friday Market is an enormous cannon, 18 feet long, 10 feet in girth, and nearly
                    3 feet wide at the mouth, formed in the same fashion as “Mons Meg” in Edinburgh
                    Castle, and surnamed <hi rend="italic">Dulle</hi><hi rend="italic">Gτiete,</hi>
                    or “Mad Meg or Margaret.”</p>
                <p>The cathedral of St Bavon (Flem. <hi rend="italic">Baefs)</hi> ranks as one of
                    the most splendid of the churches of Belgium. Though the original foundation
                    dates from the 9th or 10th century, the crypt and choir of the actual edifice
                    have no higher antiquity than the 13th century, and the other parts were not
                    completed till the 16th. The roof of the nave has been erected since the
                    destructive fire of 1822. Originally dedicated to St John, the church received
                    its present name only in 1540, when Charles V. made it the seat of the
                    collegiate chapter of the abbey of St Bavon; and it was not till 1559 that it
                    was constituted a cathedral at the request of Philip II. of Spain. In its
                    exterior St Bavon’s is rather heavy in style, but it is surmounted by a fine
                    octagonal tower, which, before the destruction of the spire by lightning in
                    1603, had a height of 360 feet, and still reaches 270 feet. The interior is
                    remarkable for the richness and variety of its decorations. The choir and
                    transepts are lined with black marble, and the balustrades are of white or
                    variegated marble. A statue of St Bavon in his ducal robes adorn3 the high
                    altar, and in front are four tall copper candlesticks which belonged to Charles
                    I., and bear the royal arms of England. Beneath the windows of the choir are
                    affixed the arms of the knights of the golden fleece, whose last chapter was
                    held by Philip II. in St Bavon’s in 1559. The chapels are twenty-four in number;
                    their gates are of brass, and almost every available spot has its painting or
                    statue. The eleventh is known as the Chapel of the Lamb, as it contains the
                    central and principal portion of the famous Adoration of the Lamb painted by
                    John Van Eyck in 1432. Hubert Van Eyck, his brother and compeer, and Margaret,
                    his sister, lie buried in the crypt. The church of St Nicholas—an early Gothic
                    structure, with a great tower of the 15th century and a modern portico—has the
                    credit of being the oldest in the town; and St Michael’s, dating from about
                    1450, but frequently restored, is memorable as the scene of the worship of
                    reason during the French Revolution. Previous to the Revolution there existed in
                    Ghent a large number of convents and monasteries (thirtyseven establishments of
                    this class, with 1122 inmates, are recorded in 1781); and one of its most famous
                    institutions at the present day is the Béguinage of St Elizabeth, a community of
                    about 600 or 700 nuns, who inhabit a separate quarter of the town, consisting of
                    little brick-built cottages arranged in streets and squares within a common
                    wall.</p>
                <p>Among the secular buildings of Ghent one of the finest is the Hôtel de Ville, its
                    northern façade being an exceptionally rich example of flamboyant Gothic of the
                    15th century, and its eastern façade presenting a curious contrast, with its
                    rows of Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns after the style of the Italian
                    Renaissance. The court-house or palais de justice is a heavy but imposing
                    structure in the Romanesque manner, erected between 1835 and 1843 by the
                    architect Roelandt at the common expense of the state, the province, and the
                    town. The minor apartments of the lower floor have been all more or less
                    sacrificed to the great Hall of the Lost Footsteps, which is 240 feet long and
                    70 feet wide. About the same time the same architect was entrusted with the
                    designs for the casino, a building adapted <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n581/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0581-0564"/> for the flower-shows of the Botanical Society and
                    the concerts of the choral union of St Cecilia. The so-called Government house,
                    which is partly occupied by the provincial administration and partly by the
                    governor as his residence, was assigned by Charles V. to the provost of St
                    Bavon, became in 1581 the property of William of Orange (the Silent), at a later
                    date served as episcopal palace, and in the time of Napoleon was the prefecture.
                    The present episcopal palace was built in 1845 as an appendage to the
                    cathedral.</p>
                <p>With benevolent institutions of various kinds Ghent is abundautly supplied. A
                    lunatic asylum, the Hospital of the Byloque, founded as early as 1225, a
                    maternity hospital dating from 1827, a blind asylum (1854) due to the beneficent
                    bequests of L. Van Caneghem, a deaf and dumb institution (1822), and an <hi
                    rend="italic">atelier</hi><hi rend="italic">de charité,</hi> or establishment
                    for giving work to the unemployed, which has been in operation since 1817, are
                    worthy of special mention. It would be less of a paradox than might be supposed
                    if the great penitentiary (Rasphuis, or Maison de Force) had been included in
                    the list; for it is remarkable, not only for the sumptuous style of its
                    buildings, but for the philanthropic character of its administration. It was
                    erected between 1772 and 1825 at a cost of 2,150,000 francs, and can accommodate
                    2600 prisoners.</p>
                <p>The spacious university buildings were erected between 1819 and 1826, at the
                    expense of the city, under the auspices of William I., king of Holland. They
                    were designed by Roelandt in the Greek style, and one of the principal features
                    is a portico after the model of the Pantheon at Rome. The university library,
                    containing upwards of 100,000 volumes, and reckoned one of the most valuable in
                    Belgium, was formerly the property of the town. Along with the royal athenaeum
                    or high school, it occupies the old abbey of Baudeloo, founded by Baldwin of
                    Constantinople in 1199. The abbey gardens were transformed in 1797 into a
                    botanical garden, which now ranks as one of the finest in Europe. A royal
                    academy for the encouragement of art, founded in 1751 by Charles Marissal, and a
                    musical conservatory originated by the communal council in 1835 are both
                    flourishing institutions; and the technical school with about 800 pupils is one
                    of the very best in Belgium. The Natural History Society, dating from 1851, has
                    established a zoological garden.</p>
                <p>Though Ghent has no longer the industrial pre-eminence that it enjoyed in the
                    14th and 15th centuries, it is still the principal seat of the cotton and
                    leather manufactures of Belgium. Flax-spinning, calico-printing, and
                    sugar-refining are also extensively carried on, and there are engineering works,
                    chemical works, iron-foundries, soapworks, paper-mills, and breweries. No fewer
                    than sixty considerable firms, trading with Germany, France, Italy, and Russia,
                    are engaged in commercial floriculture; and, as a consequence, the flower-shows
                    of Ghent, as they were perhaps the earliest, are still among the finest
                    exhibitions of the kind in Europe. The trade of the town, which deals mainly
                    with the products and raw materials of the industries, is fostered by a good
                    railway system and numerous canals. There is direct communication with the sea
                    by a grand canal, which, however, unfortunately for the Belgians, enters the sea
                    at Terneuse in Dutch territory. The harbour, completed in 1828, is capable of
                    accommodating 400 vessels, and vessels drawing 17 feet of water can unload under
                    the walls of the town. At Sas van Gend, 15 miles north of the city, on the
                    frontier of Holland, there are sluices by which the district can be laid under
                    water.</p>
                <p>In 1812 Ghent had no more than 55,161 inhabitants; by 1856 they had increased to
                    109,668, and by 1869 to 121,469. The census of 1876 gave 127,653. Among the
                    celebrities born in the city are Henry Goethals, distinctively Henry of Ghent, a
                    famous theologian and member of the Sorbonne (d. 1295); Philippe Mouskes, the
                    chronicler; P. Vanderberghe or Montanus, the geographer; Daniel Heinsius;
                    Jacques van Zevecote,one of the principal Flemish poets; Lauren Delvaux, a
                    sculptor; C. L. Diericx, the local historian; and J. Guislain, the lunacy
                    physician.</p>
                <p>The investigations of local antiquaries leave it still doubtful whether Ghent had
                    a Roman origin, as Petrarch supposed (Gαndαvum Caesare conditore superbum').
                    That there was a military fortress on the spot in the 7th century, is proved by
                    Baudemont’s life of St Amand, the first missionary of Christianity in the
                    district {Acta Sanctorum vol. i.). Of the two monasteries founded by the saint
                    in honour of St Peter, the one near the Antwerp gate was richly endowed by St
                    Bavon, and his name became attached, not only to the building, but to the part
                    of the city. About the year 1000 Baldwin Ironarm, first count of Flanders, took
                    possession of Ghent, and a few years after he erected the Gravensteen or Counts’
                    Castle. Trade and manufactures, especially of linen and woollen, were encouraged
                    by Baldwin and his successors, and by the close of the 12th century the men of
                    Ghent were able to purchase commercial and political privileges, and to
                    establish a form of municipal government. They established a court of justice,
                    elected sheriffs, joined the association of the Hanse Towns, and obtained the
                    free navigation of the Rhine from the emperor Frederick I. By the charter of
                    1192 they obtained the right of fortifying their city, and the first
                    circumvallation carried out between that date and 1214 had a development of 6560
                    feet. By the end of the 13th century Ghent was a greater city than Paris. In the
                    14th, under the leadership of the famous Jacob van Artevelde and his son Philip
                    (1332-1382), it raised frequent insurrections against the counts of Flanders,
                    and took a prominent part in the political movements of the Low Countries. In
                    1385 it was obliged to submit to the duke of Burgundy, but its rights and
                    privileges were left uninjured. At the commencement of the 15th century it had
                    upwards of 40,000 men employed in the woollen manufactures alone, and was able
                    to place in the field from 18,000 to 20,000 men-of-arms. When in 1452 the duke
                    of Burgundy, Philip the Good, imposed a tax on salt and grain, it rose in
                    rebellion, but after a few years’ conflict the defeat at Gaveren left it at the
                    duke’s mercy. The independence of the burghers was far from being crushed. 'Γhey
                    showed themselves as turbulent as ever under Mary of Burgundy, who made the city
                    her principal residence; and when she made certain unpopular concessions to
                    Louis XL, they took the law into their hands, andon April 3, 1477, put to death
                    in her presence the two councillors Hugonet and Himber-Court, whom she had
                    intrusted with the mission. After her marriage at Ghent (August 17) with
                    Maximilian of Austria, matters were more peaceful. On Mary’s death in 1482 the
                    discontent of the people again broke out. In 1488 they restored their ancient
                    form of government, and held out against the emperor Frederick, who led an army
                    against them in person, but at length in 1492 they came to terms. In 1500
                    Charles V. was born in the palace at Ghent, the site of which is now occupied by
                    the street called the Cour des Princes. His reign was a critical one for the
                    city, for though it had a population of 175,000, it was but a drop in the bucket
                    of his vast dominions, and he treated it with but little consideration. When in
                    1536 his sister Maria, at that time in command of the Netherlands, demanded the
                    extraordinary subsidy of 1,200,000gold florins from Flanders, the citizens
                    refused to contribute, and in 1539 they took arms in self defence. Charles
                    himself appeared on the scene in 1540, forced them to submission, deprived them
                    of their privileges, executed 26 of the principal leaders of the revolt,
                    confiscated the public buildings, and erected a citadel at a total expense of
                    411,334 livres, the greater part of which had to be defrayed by Ghent itself.
                    Even this did not crush the spirit of the city. It was by the pacification of
                    Ghent, signed in the town-hall Nov. 8, 1578, that Holland and Zeeland, and the
                    southern states of the Netherlands, formed an alliance against the Spanish
                    supremacy, and three days after the Spanish garrison capitulated to the
                    citizens. In 1584, however, the duke of Parma captured the town for Philip, and
                    the citadel, which had been almost completely demolished, was restored. The
                    attempts of the French in 1641 and 1642 to get possession of Ghent were
                    frustrated by laying the country under water; but in 1678, though in the
                    meanwhile the fortifications had been considerably extended, the feeble garrison
                    under Don Francisco de Pardo was unable to defend the place against Marshals
                    Humières, Luxembourg, Schomberg, and Vauban. Ghent continued in French hands
                    till the peace of Nimwegen. It played an important part in the war of the
                    Spanish succession, being captured in 1706 by Marlborough, recovered in 1708 by
                    the French Marquis de Grimaldi, and again captured by Marlborough in 1709. In
                    the war of the Austrian succession, Louis XV. made his entry into the city on
                    25th July 1745, and remained in possession till the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in
                    1748. By order of Joseph II. in 1781, the citadel and fortifications were
                    dismantled, and the grounds on which they were built were sold. Under the regime
                    of the French Revolution the city was made the chief town of the department of
                    the Scheldt.</p>

                    active part in the movement for the separation of the two kingdoms, and after

                    agitation of the Orange party. On the recommendation of the duke of Wellington,
                    who visited the town in 1821 to give his opinion on the plans, a new citadel was
                    erected according to the designs of Μ. Gey van Pittius (1822-1830).</p>
