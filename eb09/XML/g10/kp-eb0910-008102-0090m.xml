                    resemblance of its granular varieties to the seeds of that fruit. Several sorts
                    of garnets, with other stones, seem to have been included under the terms

                    in the compact cryptocrystalline varieties, tough. Before the blowpipe it gives
                    a brown, green, or black (often magnetic) glass, which hydrochloric acid
                    decomposes, with the separation of gelatinous silica. Previous to melting, the
                    mineral is but little affected by the acid. The least fusible forms are the
                    lime-iron garnets. It has been shown by Professor Church that, although
                    unaffected by exposure to a full red heat for a quarter of an hour, iron garnet
                    may by fusion have its specific gravity lowered from 4Ό59 to 3 <hi

                    alumina, iron, and chrome garnets, which have the general formula R" <hi

                    mineral, with a resinous lustre, commonly considered to be a lime-iron garnet,
                    according to Wichmann and Des-Cloiseaux must be regarded as for the most part
                    granular vesuvian.</p>
                <p>Garnet is a wide-spread mineral, and is found in micaceous, talcose, chloritic,
                    and hornblendic schists, and in syenitic gneiss, syenite, granite, dolomite, and
                    crystalline limestone; sometimes as pyrope, in serpentine; also in
                    felspar-porphyry, and in volcanic rocks. In Cornwall it is met with chiefly in
                    greenstone, or in close proximity thereto. It is an essential ingredient of the
                    rock βklogite. Grossularite, a greenish to grey-green garnet, is found at
                    I’ezbanya in Hungary, and the ΛVilui river, Siberia; topazolite and essonite at
                    Mussa, Piedmont, the latter also in Ceylon, Piedmont, and Elba; pyrope in
                    Bohemia, and at Zoblitz in Saxony; and almandite in Ceylon, Pegu, Brazil, and
                    Greenland. Spessartite is obtained at Haddam, Ct., and elsewhere; melanite in
                    Vesuvian and other lavas; aplome at Breitenbrunn and Schwarzenberg in Saxony;
                    the fine green garnet ouvarovite chiefly at Saranovskaja, 14 versts from
                    Bissersk in the Urals, and at New Idria in California; and white garnet in the
                    Urals. Numerous other localities for garnet might be mentioned. Precious garnet,
                    almandite or almandine (so termed, it is said, from being cut at Alabanda in
                    Caria, whence the appellation <hi rend="italic">alabamlicus</hi> employed by
                    Pliny), essonite •or cinnamon-stone, grossularite, grossularia, or gooseberry
                    stone, and pyrope or Bohemian garnet are the varieties of the mineral employed
                    as gems. They are shaped by means of garnet powder or emery on a copper wheel,
                    and polished on lead with tripoli. Carbuncles are almadine garnets cut <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">cabochon</hi>; when of large size, and
                    free from black spots, they may be worth as much as £20 apiece. The deep red or
                    precious garnet often has a density close to that of the ruby, for which stone
                    it has been sold. The Syriaιn or Pegu garnets, possibly the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ameihystizontas</hi> of Pliny (Λ <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> αi. <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> xxxvii. 25), commonly designated amethystine or
                    oriental garnets, vary in colour from a deep red to a violet-purple, and may
                    occur 3 inches in diameter. They are usually cut with four large and four small
                    facets, and may fetch very high prices, a single specimen, of a fiery-red hue,
                    measuring 1 inch by <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ inch, having been sold for
                    £40, and another, of octagonal form, for £140. Pyrope is a dark hyacinth-red to
                    blood-red gem, much esteemed in Austria, Transylvania, and Tuιkey. Viewed by
                    transmitted light it appears of a yellowish-red tint, more especially at the
                    edges. Essonite, yellow to hyacinth-red in colour, is a softer and more fusible
                    garnet than the other kinds used in jewellery. It is commonly called hyacinth,
                    and has frequently been mistaken, as also sold, for true hyacinth or jacinth,
                    which is a zirconium silicate, and may be distinguished by its density of 4
                    05-475, that of essonite being about 3 ’ 60-3∙66. The garnet was much used as a
                    jewel in ancient times. Antique intaglios on garnet are recognized by their
                    usually fragmentary condition, due to their brittleness, and by a softness of
                    colour, imparted to them by time, which defies imitation by even the ablest
                    artists (Castellani). The bust of Hadrian in the Odescalchi museum, the Venus
                    Genetrix in the cabinet of Abbé Pullini at Turin, and the representation of
                    Sirius on the celebrated Marlborough stone, arc among the finer examples of
                    engraving in garnet. Garnet, where abundant, has been used in the smelting of
                    iron ores. For polishing purposes it is sometimes substituted for emery. The
                    large dull-coloured “carbunculus of India,” according to Pliny (Z.c.), used to
                    be hollowed out into vessels that would hold as much as a pint. Garnet has been
                    obtained as a furnace-product, and otherwise artificially. What is known as
                    “white garnet” is the mineral leucite.</p>
