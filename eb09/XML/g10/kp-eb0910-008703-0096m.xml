                <p><label type="entry">GAS AND GAS-LIGHTING</label></p>
                <p>ALL artificial light is obtained as a result either of combustion or of
                    incandescence; or it might be more accurate to classify illuminating agents as
                    those which emit light as a result of chemical action, and those which glow,
                    from the presence of a large amount of heat, without thereby giving rise to any
                    ehemical change. The materials whence artificial light of the nature of flame
                    has been derived are principally bodies rich in carbon and hydrogen. Wax, fats,
                    and oils, on exposure to a certain amount of heat, undergo destructive
                    distillation, evolving inflammable gases; and it is really such gases that are
                    consumed in the burning of lamps and candles, the wicks bringing small
                    proportions of the substances into a sufficient heat.</p>
                <p>Wood and coal also, when distilled, give off combustible gases; and ordinary
                    gas-lighting only differs from illumination by candles and lamps in the gas
                    being stored up and consumed at a distance from the point where it is
                    generated.</p>
                <p>Inflammable gas is formed in great abundance within the earth in connexion with
                    carbonaceous deposits, such as coal and petroleum; and similar accumulations not
                    unfrequently occur in connexion with deposits of rock-salt; the gases from any
                    of these sources, escaping by means of fissures or seams to the open air, may be
                    collected and burned in suitable arrangements. Thus the “eternal fires” of Baku,
                    on the shores of the Caspian Sea, which have been known as burning from remote
                    ages, are due to gaseous <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0097-0088"/> hydrocarbons issuing from and through petroleum
                    deposits. In the province of Szechuen in China, gas is obtained from beds of
                    rock-salt at a depth of 1500 or 1600 feet: being brought to the surface, it is
                    conveyed in bamboo tubes and used for lighting as well as for evaporating brine;
                    and it is asserted that the Chinese used this naturally evolved gas as an
                    illuminant long before gas-lighting was introduced among European nations. At a
                    salt mine in the comitat of Marmaro in Hungary, gas is obtained at a depth of
                    about 120 feet, and is used for illuminating the works of the mine. Again at
                    Fredonia (New York State) a natural emission of gas was discovered in a
                    bituminous limestone, over the orifice of which a gasholder has been erected,
                    and thus about 1000 cubic feet of a gas composed of marsh gas and hydride of
                    ethyl has been made available for illumination. In the city of Erie (Pa.) there
                    are 13 gas-wells, each yielding from 10,000 to 30,000 feet per day, the gas
                    escaping from one of them at a pressure of 200 lb per square inch. At
                    Bloomfield, Ontario co., New York, there is a spring which yields daily no less
                    than 800,000 feet of gas of an illumin- -ating power equal to 14∣ candlβ3. The
                    city of East Liverpool (Ohio) is entirefy illuminated, and to a large extent
                    heated, by gas-wells which exist in and around the town. The light is of
                    extraordinary brilliancy, and is so abundant and free that the street lamps are
                    never extinguished, and much of the manufacturing steam-power of the town, which
                    embraces 22 potteries, giving employment to 2000 hands, is derived from the gas.
                    The first “well,” 450 feet deep, was opened in 1859, and up to the present year
                    (1879) neither it nor any of those tapped at later dates show any sign of
                    failing. In many other parts of America similar gas-wells exist; and several
                    such natural jets of gas have been observed in England.</p>
                <p>By general consent the merit of the discovery and application of artificial gas
                    belongs to Great Britain, and the name most honourably connected with the
                    beginning and early stages of gas-lighting is that of a Scotchman—William
                    Murdoch. But previous to Murdoch’s time there occur numerous suggestive
                    observations and experiments as to inflammable air and its sources. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> of the Royal Society for 1667 the
                    existence of a “burning spring” in the coal district of Wigan is noticed by
                    Thomas Shirley, who traced its origin to the underlying coal. In the same <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions</hi> for 1739 is printed a letter addressed to the
                    Hon. Robert Boyle, who died in 1691, in which the Rev. John Clayton details a
                    series of experiments he made in distilling coal in a retort, showing, not only
                    that he had observed the inflammable gases evolved, but that he collected and
                    stored them for some time in bladders. In Dr Stephen Hales’s work on <hi
                    rend="italic">Vegetable Stαticks,</hi> published in 1726, more precise
                    statements are made as to the distillation of coal, he having obtained from 158
                    grains of Newcastle coal 180 inches of inflammable air. In 1787 Lord Dundonald,
                    in working a patented process for obtaining coal-tar, experimented with the gas
                    evolved in the process, and occasionally used it for lighting up the hall of
                    Culross Abbey. None of these observations, however, led to distinct practical
                    results; and it was not till the year 1792 that William Murdoch, then residing
                    at Redruth in Cornwall, began the investigations into the properties of gases
                    given off by various substances which eventuated in the establishment of
                    coal-gas as an illuminating agent. In 1797 he publicly showed the system he had
                    matured, and in 1798, being then employed in the famous Soho (Birmingham)
                    workshop of Boulton &amp; Watt, he fitted up an apparatus for the manufacture of
                    gas in that establishment, with which it was partly lighted. Thereafter the
                    apparatus was extended, and the gas manufactured by it was introduced to other
                    neighbouring workshops and factories. Among others who helped most materially to
                    develop the infant art in England were Dr Henry of Manchester, and Mr Clegg,
                    who, succeeding Mr Murdoch at Boulton &amp; Watt’s, introduced many improvements
                    in gas manufacture, and ultimately became the most skilful and famous gas
                    engineer in the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>In 1801 Μ. Lebon introduced gas distilled from wood into his own house in Paris,
                    and the success of his experiment attracted so much notice and comment as to
                    give rise to an impression that he is entitled to the credit of the invention.
                    Lebon’s experiment came under the notice of Mr F. A. Winsor, who took up the
                    subject with a zeal and unwearying patience which led to a recognition of the
                    advantages of the system, and the breaking down of the powerful prejudice which
                    existed in England against the innovation. In 1803, through Winsor’s efforts,
                    the Lyceum Theatre was lighted with gas; but it was not till 1810 that he
                    succeeded in forming a public company for manufacturing gas, and in obtaining an
                    Act of Parliament for the Gas-Light and Coke Company. In 1813 Westminster Bridge
                    was first lighted with gas, and in the following year the streets of Westminster
                    were thus illuminated, and in 1816 gas became common in London. So rapid was the
                    progress of this new mode of illumination that in the course of a few years
                    after its introduction it was adopted by all the principal towns in the kingdom,
                    for lighting streets as well as shops and public edifices. In private houses it
                    found its way more slowly, partly from an apprehension of danger attending its
                    use, and partly from the annoyance which was experienced in many cases through
                    the careless and imperfect manner in which the service-pipes were at first
                    fitted up.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sources of Gas.</hi></p>
                <p>Artificial gas is now distilled from a variety of substances, among which are
                    coal, shale, lignite, petroleum, turf, wood, resins, oils, and fats; and it is
                    also prepared by carburetting or impregnating with volatile hydrocarbons other
                    non-luminiferous gases. Of the very numerous systems of gasmaking which have
                    been proposed since the early part of the century, none can compete for general
                    purposes with the ordinary coal-gas process, when a supply of the raw material
                    can be obtained at a moderate expense.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coal-Gas.—</hi> Coals, varying greatly as they do in chemical
                    constitution, differ also, as might be expected, as widely in their value and
                    applicability for the manufacture of gas. Taking the leading varieties of coal
                    to be included under anthracite, bituminous coal, and lignite or brown coal, we
                    find that it is the class bituminous coal alone that yields varieties really
                    serviceable for gas-making. Anthracite may be regarded as a natural coke from
                    which the volatile constituents have been already driven off, and the more
                    anthracitic any coal is, the less is it capable of yielding gas. Lignite also is
                    rarely used for distillation, owing to the large proportion of oxygen and the
                    amount of water in its composition. Of the bituminous coals again, it is only
                    the caking or pitch coals, and the cannel or parrot coals, that are in practice
                    used in gas-works. These also vary within very wide limits in their gas-making
                    value, not only from the great difference among them in yield of gas, but also
                    in the illuminating value of the gas they evolve. As a rule the coals which
                    yield the largest percentage produce also the most highly illuminating qualities
                    of gas. The cannel coals, which are specially recognized as “gas-coal,” are most
                    abundantly developed in Scotland and in Lancashire, and the fact of the
                    unequalled qualities of Scotch cannel and of the allied substance, bituminous
                    shale, for gasmaking, has had the effect of rendering illumination by gas much
                    more general and satisfactory in Scotland than in any other country. It is only
                    a very imperfect valuation of any <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n98/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0098-0089"/> gas-coal that can be made from chemical analysis,
                    the really satisfactory test being actual experiment. According to H. Fleck, the
                    coal most available for gas-making should contain to every 100 parts of carbon 6
                    parts of hydrogen, of which 4 parts are available for forming hydrocarbon
                    compounds. It is desirable that coal used for distillation in gas retorts should
                    be as far as possible free from sulphur, that in the case of coking coal the
                    amount of ash should be small, and the proportion of oxygen should also be low,
                    since that element abstracts hydrogen to form injurious watery vapour. The
                    amount of ash present, however, in the best forms of Scotch cannel is large; and
                    consequently the resulting coke, if the residue can be so called, is of
                    comparatively little value. Unless coal can be stored in sheds which protect it
                    from the weather, it ought to be used as soon as possible after being raised,
                    rain and sunshine being detrimental to its gas-making qualities. The following
                    table exhibits the chemical analysis and gas-yielding properties of a few of the
                    principal and typical examples of coal for gas-making :—·</p>

                <p>When the bowl of an ordinary clay pipe is filled with small fragments of
                    bituminous coal, luted over with clay and placed in a bright fire, immediately
                    smoke is seen to issue from the stalk which projects beyond the fire. The smoke
                    soon ceases, and if a light is then applied to the orifice of the stalk, the
                    issuing gas burns with a bright, steady flame, while a proportion of a black,
                    thin, tarry liquid oozes out from the stalk. After the combustion ceases there
                    is left in the bowl of the pipe a quantity of char or coke. This simple
                    operation is, on a small scale, an exact counterpart of the process by which the
                    destructive distillation of coal is accomplished in the manufacture of gas. The
                    products of the distillatory process classed in the gas-works as gas, tar, and
                    ammoniacal liquor, with a solid residue of coke, are in themselves mixtures of
                    various definite chemical compounds; and as may be evident from the following
                    list, these substances are very numerous and complex:—</p>

                <p>The proportions, however, and even the nature of these products of distillation
                    are greatly modified by the temperature at which the distillation is effected, a
                    low red heat yielding a small proportion of non-condensible gas but a large
                    amount of heavy hydrocarbon oils, whence the distillation of shales and coal in
                    the paraffin manufacture is conducted at a low red heat. By excessive heat, on
                    the other hand, the compounds evolved become simpler in their chemical
                    constitution, carbon is deposited, pure hydrogen is given off, and the gain in
                    amount of gas produced is more than counterbalanced by its poverty in
                    illuminating properties.</p>
                <p>Of the gases and vapours which pass out of the retorts in a highly heated
                    condition, some portion, consisting of tarry matter and ammoniacal liquor,
                    precipitates almost immediately by simple cooling, and other injurious
                    constituents must be removed by a system of purification to which the gaseous
                    products are submitted. What thereafter passes on as ordinary gas for
                    consumption still contains some percentage of incombustible matters—aqueous
                    vapour, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid. The combustible portion also is
                    separable into two classes, viz., non-luminous supporters of combustion, and the
                    luminiferous constituents,—the former embracing hydrogen, marsh gas (light
                    carburetted hydrogen), and carbonic oxide, while the latter includes the
                    hydrocarbon gases acetylene, ethylene (olefiant gas or heavy carburetted
                    hydrogen), propylene, butylene, and vapours of the benzol and naphthalin
                    series.</p>
                <p>Formerly it was the habit to regard the proportion of heavy carburetted hydrogen
                    (ethylene and its homologues) as the measure of the illuminating power of a gas.
                    It has, however, been pointed out by Berthelot that the proportion of such
                    compounds in some gas of good luminous qualities is exceedingly small; and in
                    particular he cites the case of Paris gas, which, according to his analysis,
                    contains only a mere trace of acetylene, ethylene, and other hydrocarbons, with
                    3 to 3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 per cent, of benzol vapours. Subsequent
                    experiments of Dittmar have proved that a mixture of pure ethylene and hydrogen
                    burnt in the proportion of 3 volumes of hydrogen to 1 of ethylene yields little
                    more light than ordinary marsh gas, while benzol vapour to the extent of only 3
                    per cent, in hydrogen, gives a brilliantly luminous flame. Frankland and Thorne
                    have more recently determined the illuminating power of a cubic foot of benzol
                    vapour burnt for 1 hour in various combinations, with the following results

                <p>Thus it is highly probable that the illuminating value of coal-gas depends much
                    more on the presence of benzol vapour than on the proportion of the heavy
                    gaseous hydrocarbons,, and the estimation of benzol in the gas is a point which
                    has hitherto been comparatively neglected. In view of the inference that the
                    presence of benzol vapour is so intimately related to illuminating power, the
                    fact observed by Dittmar that water readily and largely dissolves it out of any
                    gas mixture is of great consequence. When ben-zolated hydrogen containing 6 per
                    cent, of benzol vapour was shaken up with water, the percentage of the vapour
                    was found on analysis to be reduced to less than 2.</p>

                <p>The series of operations connected with the preparation and distribution of

                    burners and other arrangements for lighting are the most important
                    considerations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Site and Arrangement of Works.—</hi> The choice of a site for a
                    gas establishment is necessarily conditioned by local circumstances; but the
                    facts that a considerable area is required, and that, at best, the works do not
                    improve the amenity of any neighbourhood, are important considerations. A
                    central position with respect to the area to be supplied is certainly desirable,
                    but iu the circumstances it is seldom to be obtained. Of even greater
                    consequence for a large work is ready access to a railway or other means of
                    transport; and most of the great establishments are now connected by. sidings
                    with lines of railway, whereby coals, àc., are delivered direct from the waggons
                    to the store or retorthouse, and in the same way the coke and residual products
                    are removed. Where the arrangement is practicable, it is also desirable that the
                    works should be erected at the lowest level of the area to be supplied, since
                    coal-gas, being specifically lighter than atmospheric air, acquires a certain
                    amount of pressure as it rises in pipes, which pressure facilitates its
                    distribution, and it is much easier to control than to beget pressure. In the
                    planning of works, regard must be given to economy of space and to labour-saving
                    arrangements, so that the cost of manual labour may be minimized, and operations
                    proceed in an orderly, methodical, and easily-controlled manner. The
                    accompanying ground plan of gas-works (fig. 1) has been kindly furnished by Mr
                    James Hislop of Glasgow, a gas engineer of known skill and experience; and while
                    it shows arrangements of the most approved character, it will also enable the
                    reader to recognize the position of the various erections and apparatus as they
                    follow each other, and as they will now be described.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Retorts.—</hi> Retorts for destructive distillation of coal are
                    formed of cast iron, clay, brick, or wrought iron. Various shapes have been
                    adopted in the construction of these vessels; nor have their forms been more
                    varied than the modes in which they have been disposed in the furnaces. In many
                    instances they have been constructed of a cylindrical shape varying in length
                    and diameter. Those first employed were of iron, with the axis vertical, but
                    experience βoon showed that this position was extremely inconvenient, on account
                    of the difficulty which it occasioned in removing the coke.</p>
                <p>The retorts were therefore next placed in a horizontal position, as being not
                    only more favourable to the most economical distribution of the heat, but better
                    adapted to the introduction of the coal and the subsequent removal of the coke.
                    At first the heat was applied directly to the lower part of the retort; but it
                    was soon observed that the high temperature to which it was necessary to expose
                    it, for the perfect decomposition of the coal, proved destructive to the lower
                    side, and rendered it useless long before the upper part had sustained much
                    injury. The next improvement was, accordingly, to interpose an arch of brickwork
                    between it and the furnace, and to compensate for the diminished intensity of
                    the heat by a more equally diffused distribution of it over the surface of the
                    retort. This was effected by causing the flue of the furnace to return towards
                    the mouth of the retort, and again conducting it in an opposite direction, till
                    the heated air finally escaped into the chimney. This arrangement was continued
                    so long as iron retorts were in use, but on the general adoption of clay retorts
                    the furnaces were constructed to allow the fire to play freely around them.</p>

                <p>The cylindrical form of retort <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (fig. 2) was long in
                    favour on account of its great durability, but it is not so well fitted for
                    rapid decomposition of the. coal as the elliptical. δ, or the flat-bottomed or
                    D-shaped retorts <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> which are now principally in use.
                    Retorts are also made of a rectangular section with the corners rounded and the
                    roof arched. Elliptical retorts are varied into what are called ear-shaped or
                    kidney-shaped <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and it is not unusual to set retorts of
                    different forms in the same bench, for the convenience of filling up the
                    haunches of the arch which encloses them.</p>
                <p>The length of single retorts varies from 6 to 9 feet, but they are now in some
                    cases made 19∣ feet in length and 12⅛ inches in internal diameter, these being
                    charged from both end*.</p>
                <p>Every retort is furnished with a separate mouthpiece, usually of cast iron, with

                    with the edge of the mouthpiece has applied to it a lute of lime mortar and fire
                    clay, and when the lid is screwed up, a portion of this lute oozes out round the
                    edges and forms a gas-tight joint.</p>
                <p>Except for small works, where the manufacture is intermittent, and where,
                    consequently, the retort heat has to be got up frequently, iron retorts are now
                    little used. Clay retorts, which at present are in most general use, wear out
                    quickly; they very frequently crack so seriously on the first application of
                    heat that they must be removed from the bench before being used at all, and in
                    scarcely any case are they in action perfectly free from cracks. Numerous
                    attempts have been made to introduce retorts built of brick; but the difficulty
                    of making and keeping the joints airtight has proved a serious obstacle to their
                    use. In the brick retort made of Glenboig Star fire-clay, according to the plan
                    of Mr James Hislop, it is claimed that the difficulty is surmounted, and that
                    both the retort and its setting present great advantage and economy. These brick
                    retorts (fig. 4) are Q-shaped, 9 feet long and with diameters of 22 and 13 J
                    inches, set four in an oven to one unarched furnace, as in fig. 7. Each retort
                    will, it is affirmed, carbonize 500 tons cannel coal, or 2000 tons per oven of
                    four, without any repairs whatever. Decayed bricks may be removed from these
                    retorts and new ones inserted, and when thoroughly repaired they are again equal
                    to new. Thus the durability of each retort is so great that they are calculated
                    to cost about ⅜th of a penny per 1000 cubic feet of gas generated, as against
                    Id. in the case of moulded retorts, and 7d. with iron retorts, for the same
                    production of gas. In the Hislop retort the arched bricks are made plain,
                    without groove or rebate joints—being thus stronger, more readily put together,
                    and also cheaper. Carbon does not collect so rapidly on brick retorts as on
                    those of clay, the bricks being harder pressed and better burned. On first
                    lighting brick retorts, a charge of coke, breeze, and tar mixed makes them
                    perfectly gas-tight.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Retort Setting.—</hi> A furnace or bed of retorts is composed
                    of a group or setting, heated by a separate fire. The furnace is lined with the
                    most refractory fire-bricks, and while the whole brickwork is made of such
                    strength and solidity as ensures the safety of the retorts, the internal
                    construction is so planned that the heat has the utmost possible amount of
                    direct play on the retorts. The number of retorts to one furnace varies from 1
                    to 15, from 4 to 7 being the number most commonly adopted; and these are
                    variously arranged to bring them all as close to the furnace heat as
                    practicable. In some retort-houses the furnaces are built in two stages or
                    stories, from the upper of which the retorts are charged and drawn, while at the
                    lower level the glowing coke is removed and quenched. The whole range of
                    furnaces constitutes the retort bench, having a common flue which leads to the
                    chimney shaft by which the products of combustion are carried away. The gas-coal
                    for charging the retorts is broken into fragments about 1 lb in weight or
                    thereby. Figs. 5 (elevation) and 6 (section) illustrate the retort setting and
                    arrangement of furnace and flues adopted by Mr Hislop for his brick retorts, in
                    which, by the nsej&gt;f centre blocks, as seen in the open front illustration
                    (fig. 7), the necessity for internal arching is avoided.</p>
                <p>Retort furnaces are commonly fired or heated with a portion of the coke which
                    forms one of the bye-products of <pb break="no"

                    rich cannel coals are distilled, common coal must be used in the furnaces. At
                    the Ivry Gas Works of the <hi rend="italic">Compagnie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Parisienne</hi><hi rend="italic">T Éclairage et de Chauffage par le Gaz,</hi>
                    the retorts are heated by gas on a method modified from the Siemens regenerative
                    gas furnace. Sectional illustra tions of a retort setting on this plan, and a
                    description of the various arrangements connected with the regenerators and the
                    controlling of the air and gas currents, will be found in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Furnace,</hi> vol. ix. pp. 846, 847.</p>
                <p>Ordinarily the work of charging and drawing the retorts is accomplished by manual
                    labour, by means simply of shovels for charging, and long iron rakes for drawing
                    the spent charge. In the larger works it is usual to charge the retorts with a
                    scoop semi-cylindrical in form, made a little shorter than the retort, and of
                    such a diameter that it can with ease be pushed in and overturned within the
                    retort. The scoop deposits the coal neatly over the sole of the retort, and of
                    course the lid is much more quickly replaced than can be done with shovel
                    charging. Numerous attempts have been made to introduce purely mechanical means
                    of feeding retorts, hitherto with indifferent success,— such devices as a
                    travelling endless sole and a rotating sole having been tried without good
                    effect. A charging machine and a drawing machine, worked by hydraulic power,
                    have been introduced by Mr Foulis, the engineer of the Glasgow Corporation Gas
                    Works, but after prolonged trial both in Glasgow and in Manchester, these have
                    not yet proved satisfactory in action. In West’s patent the charging is effected
                    by the introduction of a small waggon within the retort, which distributes the
                    charge evenly and uniformly Neither has it, however, met general acceptance.</p>
                <p>The retorts are kept at a bright red heat, and for coal with a high percentage of
                    volatile matter a higher temperature is requisite than is needed for coal less
                    rich in gas. As the retorts in one setting are necessarily subject to somewhat
                    different amounts of heat, the charges in those nearest the furnace fire, and
                    consequently most highly heated, must be drawn more frequently than the others,
                    as otherwise the quality of the gas would be deteriorated, and a large
                    proportion of sulphur compounds would be given off from the overburnt coke.</p>
                <p>In drawing a charge the lid is first slightly opened and the escaping gas
                    lighted, to prevent an explosion or “rap” that would otherwise ensue. The gas is
                    prevented from escaping outward by the ascension pipe dipping into the hydraulic
                    main as afterwards explained; but in some cases special valves are fitted on the
                    ascension pipe to prevent a back rushing of the gas. A carbonaceous deposit
                    forms on the sides of the retorts, which requires to be periodically removed by
                    “scurfing” with chisels, or burning it off with free admission of air or
                    steam.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Hydraulic Main.—</hi> From the retorts the gas, after its
                    production, ascends by means of pipes called ascensionpipes B (figs. 5 and 6)
                    into what is termed the condensing or hydraulic main HH, which is a large pipe
                    or long reservoir placed in a horizontal position, and supported by columns in
                    front of the brick-work which contains the retorts A. This part of a gas
                    apparatus is intended to serve a twofold purpose :—first, to condense the tar
                    and some ammoniacal liquor, and secondly, to allow each of the retorts to be
                    charged singly without permitting the gas produced from the others, at the time
                    that operation is going on, to make its escape. To accomplish these objects one
                    end of the hydraulic main is closed by a flange; and the other, where it is
                    connected with the pipes for conducting the gas towards the tar vessel and
                    purifying apparatus, has, crossing it in the inside, a partition occupying the
                    lower half of the area of the section, by which the condensing vessel is always
                    kept half full of liquid matter. The stand-pipes are connected by a flange with
                    a dip-pipe C, arising from the upper side of the condensing main HH, and as the
                    lower end of it dips about 2 inches below the level of the liquid matter, it is
                    evident that no gas can return and escape when the mouthpiece on the retort is
                    removed, until it has forced the liquid matter over the bend, a result which is
                    easily prevented by making it of a suitable length. The tar which is deposited
                    in the hydraulic main overflows at the partition, aud is carried by a pipe to
                    the tar well.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Condensation.—</hi> The gas as it passes on from the hydraulic
                    main is still of a temperature from 130° to 140° Fahr., and consequently carries
                    with it heavy hydrocarbons, which, as its temperature falls, would be deposited.
                    It is therefore a first consideration in ordinary working to have these
                    condensable vapours at once separated, and the object of the condenser is to
                    cool the gas down to a temperature <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n102/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0102-0093"/> nearly that of the surrounding atmosphere. The
                    first contrivances employed for the purpose of condensation were all constructed
                    on the supposition that the object would be best attained by causing the gas to
                    travel through a great extent of pipes surrounded by cold water, and winding
                    through it like the worm of a still, or ascending upwards and downwards in a
                    circuitous manner. An improvement τm this form of condenser, and one now in
                    general use, is represented in fig. 8. It consists of a series of upright pipes
                    connected in pairs at the top by semicircular pipes <hi rend="italic">e, e,</hi>
                    and terminating at the bottom in a trough X Y containing water, and divided by
                    means of partitions in such a way that, as the gas enters the trough from one
                    pipe, it passes up the next pipe and down into the next partition, and so on to
                    the end of the condenser. The cooling power of this air condenser, as it is
                    called, is sometimes assisted by allowing cold water to trickle over the outer
                    surface of the pipes. Annulur tubes for condensing are also used, in which the
                    gas is exposed to a much greater cooling surface, and in some large works the
                    condensers are cooled by a current of water. In passing through the pipes the
                    gas is considerably reduced in temperature, and the tar and ammoniacal liquor
                    condense, the tar subsiding to the bottom of the troughs, and the ammoniacal
                    liquor floating on the surface. In course of time the water in the trough is
                    entirely displaced by these two gaseous products, and as they accumulate they
                    pass off into the tar-tank, from which either liquor can be removed by means of
                    a pump adapted to the purpose. The New York Gas Lighting Company employ a
                    multitubular condenser, consisting of two sets of eight boxes, each containing
                    100 tubes 3 inches diameter by 15 feet long. Through each set of tubes, up one
                    and down another, the gas travels, cooled by an external stream of water, while
                    it traverses the 240 feet of piping in the condenser.</p>
                <p>The practice of condensation and separation of tarry matter by rapid cooling is
                    condemned by Mr Bowditch and many eminent authorities, on the ground that
                    thereby a proportion of light hydrocarbons are thrown down with the heavier
                    deposit, which on another method of treatment would form part of the permanent
                    gas and materially enrich its quality. A system of treating gas has accordingly
                    been introduced by Messrs Aitken &amp; Young, in which the gas, kept at a high
                    temperature, is carried from the retorts into an apparatus termed an analyser,
                    which consists of an enclosed series of trays and chambers arranged in vertical
                    series, in principle like a Coffey still, the lower portion of which is
                    artificially heated. In action the analyser separates the heavier carbonaceous
                    part of the tarry matter in the lower part or chambers, and as the gas gradually
                    ascends from one tray or tier to another, it is at once cooling and depositing
                    increasingly lighter fluids, while it is meeting and being subjected to the
                    purifying action of the light hydrocarbons already deposited. Thus on entering
                    the analyser it meets, at a high temperature, heavy tar deposits, and it passes
                    out of the apparatus cooled down to nearly atmospheric temperature after being
                    in contact with the lightest fluid hydrocarbons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Exhaustion.—</hi> To the subsequent progress of the gas
                    considerable obstructions are interposed in connexion with its further
                    purification and storing in the gas-holders, and the result of which would be
                    that, were it not artificially propelled, there would be a pressure in the
                    retort equal to the amount of the resistance the gas meets with in its onward
                    progress. The relief of this back pressure not only improves the quality of the
                    gas, but also increases its amount by about 10 per cent. Among the numerous
                    methods of exhaustion which have been proposed since the operation was first
                    introduced in 1839, there are several rotary exhausters, having more or less of
                    a fan action, and recently an apparatus on the principle of a Giffard’s injector
                    has been introduced, chiefly in Continental works. A most efficient form is
                    found in the piston exhauster, a kind of pumping engine with slide valves, which
                    exhausts the gas in both the upward and the downward strokes of its piston. The
                    action of the exhauster is controlled by a governor, which passes back a
                    proportion of the gas when the apparatus is working too fast for the rate of
                    production in the retorts; and “pass by” valves are arranged to carry the gas
                    onward without passing through the exhauster should it cease to work from
                    accident or any other cause.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Purification.—</hi> The operations embraced under this head
                    have for their object the removal from the gas of ammonia, sulphuretted
                    hydrogen, and carbonic acid as the main impurities, with smaller proportions of
                    other sulphuric and of cyanogen compounds.</p>
                <p>The agencies adopted are partly mechanical and partly chemical, the separation of
                    the ammonia being first effected in the “scrubber,” from which the gas passes on
                    to complete its purification in the “purifiers.” In early times the purifying
                    was performed in a single operation by the use of milk of lime in the wet
                    purifier, a form of apparatus still in use where wet purifying is
                    permissible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Wet Purifier.—</hi> This apparatus was supplied with a
                    cream of lime and water, but, although it was a most efficient purifying agent,
                    the ammonia now of so much value was lost by its use, and the “blue billy,” as
                    the saturated liquid holding the impurities was termed, created an intolerable
                    nuisance, and could be in no harmless way got rid of. Except in small works, wet
                    purifying is not now practised.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Scrubber.—</hi> The object sought in an ordinary scrubber
                    is to cause a large amount of gas to come in contact with the smallest possible
                    quantity of water, so as at once to dissolve out ammoniacal gases, which are
                    exceedingly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n103/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0103-0094"/> soluble in water, to obtain a strong ammoniacal
                    liquor from the scrubber, and at the same time, as far as possible, to prevent
                    the heavy hydrocarbons from being acted on,—they being also soluble in water.
                    The ordinary form of scrubber consists of a tower or hollow column, vertically
                    divided into two, and filled with coke, &amp;c. The gas passes up one side and
                    down the other, and from the top a constant small stream of weak ammoniacal
                    liquor trickles down. Such a scrubber, it is stated, is subject to clogging by
                    deposits of tar, and equally efficient work is done without that drawback by an
                    apparatus in which perforated iron plates occupy the place of the coke, and in
                    the Livesey scrubber layers of thin deal boards are employed. These boards are
                    set in tiers perpendicularly, slightly crossing each other, with about ⅜ of an
                    inch between each tier. Anderson’s washer is a form of scrubber recently
                    introduced, in which the interior is occupied with a series of rotating
                    whalebone brushes, which dip into troughs of ammoniacal liquor, and in their
                    revolution meet and agitate the gas in its passage upwards through the tower or
                    column. The scrubber shown in section and plan in figs. 9 and 10 is a form
                    introduced by Mr James Hislop. It contains 10 tiers of trays of cast iron,
                    perforated with ⅞-inch holes at a distance of 2 inches from centre to centre.
                    The gas passes upwards through these, meeting in its course a shower of
                    ammoniacal liquor pumped up and distributed by the rose arrangement shown in
                    fig. 9. The bottom part of the scrubber, to the height of the first course of
                    plates, is filled with liquor, which is repumped till it reaches the strength
                    desired for the manufacturer of ammonia sulphate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Purifiers.—</hi> The ordinary lime purifier, by which
                    sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid are abstracted from the gas, consists of
                    a large rectangular vessel seen in section in fig. 11. Internally it is occupied
                    with ranges of wooden trays or sieves A, made in the form of grids of ^-inch
                    wood, with about half an inch between the bars. These are covered with slightly
                    moistened slaked lime B to the depth of about 6 inches, and from three to six
                    tiers of such sieves are ranged in each purifier. The gas enters at the bottom
                    by a tube C, the mouth or inlet being protected from lime falling into it by a
                    cover D, and it forces its way upward through all the trays till, reaching the
                    lid or cover E, it descends by an internal pocket F to the exit tube G, which
                    leads to the next purifier. The edges of the lid dip into an external water seal
                    or lute H whereby the gas is prevented from escaping. The purifiers are
                    generally arranged in sets of four, three being in use, through which the gas
                    passes in succession while the fourth is being renewed; and to control the
                    course of the gas current among the purifiers, the following ingenious
                    arrangement of centre valves and pipes was devised by Mr Malam (fig· 12).</p>
                <p>It has a cover fitting within it in such a way as to communicate with the pipe
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and either of the four inlet pipes, and also to
                    communicate between one of the outlet pipes and the pipe <hi rend="italic"
                    >h,</hi> which carries off the purified gas. The inlet pipes, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b, d, f,</hi> admit the gas from the central case to the bottom of the
                    purifiers; and the outlet pipes, <hi rend="italic">c, e, g,</hi> return the gas
                    from the purifiers back to the case, after it lias passed up through the layers
                    of lime, and descended at the back of a partition plate in each purifier to the
                    outlet pipes at the bottom, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the main inlet pipe for
                    conveying the gas fro·rn the scrubber or the condenser, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> is the main outlet pipe for conveying the gas to the gasholder. The
                    central cylinder contains water to the depth of 10 inches, and the ten pipes
                    rise up through the bottom to the height of 12 inches, so that the mouth of each
                    is <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n104/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0104-0095"/> 2 inches above the surface of the water. The
                    cover which fits into the cylinder is 4 feet 3 inches in diameter, and is
                    divided into five parts, the first of which, 1, fits over the inlet pipe α, and
                    over either of the inlet pipes leading to the purifiers. The partitions 2,</p>
                <p>3, and 5 fit each over an inlet and an outlet pipe, while one partition, 4, fits
                    over one outlet pipe from one purifier, and over the pipe <hi rend="italic"
                    >h,</hi> which leads to the gas-holder. In fig. 12 the arrangement is such as to
                    open a communication between the inlet pipe <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and the
                    purifier A. Now supposing the gas to have passed from the scrubber into the
                    centre of the cylinder, its only means of escape is to pass down the pipe <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> into the purifier A, where it ascends through the layers of
                    lime, and passing over the top of a dividing plate, descends and escapes from
                    the bottom of the purifier by the pipe c back to the cylinder. Here its only
                    means of escape is by the pipe <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> which conducts it to
                    the purifier B, in which it ascends and descends as before, returning by the
                    pipe <hi rend="italic">c</hi> to the cylinder, whence it proceeds by the
                    pipe/into the purifier C, then along the pipe <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> which is
                    shut off from communication with any pipe except <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> by
                    which it is conveyed away to the gas-holder. By this arrangement the three
                    purifiers ABC are being worked, while a fourth purifier D is being emptied and
                    recharged with lime. When it is found, on testing the gas, that the lime is
                    unfit for its office, the purifier A is thrown out of work, and D is brought in.
                    The frame is then shifted so as to bring the triangular division 1 over <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> by which means BCD will be the working purifiers, and A
                    will be thrown out of use. In this way, by shifting the frame round its centre
                    over each ©f the four outlet pipes, any three of the purifiers can be brought
                    into action.</p>
                <p>The “oxide” method of purifying the gas, originally introduced by M. Laming, and
                    shortly afterwards patented by Mr Hills, is now largely used in ordinary
                    gas-works. It is based upon the property of the hydrated oxide of iron to
                    decompose sulphuretted hydrogen, a portion of the sulphur forming a sulphide
                    with the iron. Quicklime is also used to separate carbonic acid, and the oxide
                    of iron is mixed with sawdust or cinders (breeze) for the purpose of increasing
                    the surfaces of contact, and this mixture is placed in the purifiers. When a
                    sufficient quantity of gas has passed through it, the purifiers are opened, and
                    the mixture is exposed to the air, under which new condition it combines with
                    oxygen, and again becomes fitted for use in the purifiers. The chemical changes
                    which occur in these operations are thus stated. The mixture of hydrated oxide
                    of iron, &amp;c., absorbs sulphuretted hydrogen, forming ferrous sulphide and
                    water, and liberating sulphur, thus :— Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 3H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S = 2FeS + S + 3H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. The ferrous sulphide, by exposure to the air,
                    absorbs oxygen, and its sulphur is separated in an uncombined form, 2FeS + 30 =
                    Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 2S. The mixed
                    material can be again employed in the purification of the gas, and the process
                    may be repeated until the accumulation of sulphur mechanically impairs the
                    absorbent powers of the mixture. The sulphocyanogen which accompanies the gas is
                    retained by the oxide of iron, and gradually accumulates in the mixture. For the
                    separation of the carbonic acid, which is unaffected by this treatment, the gas
                    next passes on to a dry lime purifier.</p>
                <p>The gas is now ready for use, and it is passed on through the station meter to
                    register the amount made and stored in the gas-holders. At this stage it may be
                    interesting to compare the composition of the gas as it exists at different
                    stages of the manufacture, as these show the result of the successive purifying
                    processes. Taking 1000 cubic feet, the figures are—</p>

                    Gas-holder.—</hi> This, which is frequently designated the gasometer, though
                    incorrectly, since it does not in any way measure gas, but simply stores it for
                    consumption, consists of two portions—the “tank” T (fig. 13) and the “holder” G.
                    The tank is a cylindrical pit, surrounding a central core, which is usually
                    covered with concrete <hi rend="italic">c</hi> at top, and has its sides built
                    of masonry or brick-work, <hi rend="italic">p, b.</hi> The tank is water-tight,
                    and is filled to a high level with water, above which project two tubes <hi

                    leads to the main governor.</p>
                <p>Formerly gas-holders were made of heavy plate iron, strengthened by angle-iron
                    and stays, and of so great a weight as to require a complex system of
                    equilibrium chains and counterbalancing weight3 to relieve the gas from the
                    great pressure to which it would otherwise be subjected. They are now made so
                    light that they require to be loaded <pb break="no"

                    their rise and fall are regulated by means of guide-rods <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi><hi rend="italic">i</hi> round the tank. For economy of space holders in
                    which different segments “telescope” over each other are now much employed. This
                    form of holder consists of two or even three separate parts,—the upper having
                    the form of the common gasholder, and the other being open at the top as well as
                    the bottom. They are connected by the recurved upper edge of the lower fitting
                    into a channel which runs round the bottom of the upper, whereby the entire
                    structure is rendered airtight at the line of junction. Holders of great
                    capacity are now erected in connexion with large works. The Imperial Company in
                    London possesses two, at Bromley and Hackney, telescopic in form,—the outer
                    segment measuring 200 fset in diameter by 35 feet deep, and the inner 197 feet
                    by 35. These holders are each capable of storing 2 million cubic feet of gas,
                    which at sp. gr. 480 would'weigh 73 tons. A still larger holder is at the Fulham
                    station of the Gas Light Company, it being 223 feet in diameter and rising 66
                    feet, with a capacity equal to 3 million cubic feet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Governor.—</hi> An efficient control of the pressure of the
                    gas, along its whole course from the gas-holder to the point of consumption, is
                    an object of great importance for the avoiding of leakage, for equal
                    distribution, and for supplying the burners at that pressure which yields the
                    largest illuminating effect. Uncontrolled pressure may supply certain levels in
                    a proper manner, but will leave low-lying districts insufficiently supplied,
                    while the <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> pressure in high districts will be
                    excessive. The variations from simple difference of level may be very great.
                    Thus, with a pressure of 1*7 inch at the Leith works, the gas would be delivered
                    in some parts of Edinburgh at a pressure of 4 ’ 5 inches. The varying
                    consumption from dusk onwards also greatly affects unregulated pressure. To
                    control and correct these and other irregularities and disturbances governors
                    are now used,—at the works or station for delivering the gas to the mains, in
                    districts to correct variations owing to level, and beyond the consumers’ meters
                    for controlling house supply; while in certain forms of burners a regulating
                    apparatus is also inserted. The principle on which all governors are based
                    consists in causing the gas by its own pressure to act on some form of sensitive
                    surface which opens or closes a valve or aperture in proportion to the
                    variations of pressure exerted on it. Fig. 14 is a diagrammatic section of the
                    common form of station governor.</p>
                <p>The course of the gas is indicated by arrows, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> being the
                    inlet and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> the outlet pipe; c is a valve of conical form
                    fitted to the seat » and raised or depressed by the weight/ working by a cord
                    over a pulley; <hi rend="italic">bb</hi> is the bell or holder,—a cylindrical
                    vessel of sheet iron which rises and falls in the exterior vessel <hi
                    rend="italic">aa,</hi> in which water is contained to the level represented. The
                    gas, entering at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> passes through the valve, fills the
                    upper part of the inverted vessel <hi rend="italic">bb,</hi> which it thus
                    partially raises, and escapes by <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> If the pressure from
                    the holder be unduly increased or diminished, the buoyancy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >bb</hi> will be increased or diminished in like proportion, and the valve being
                    by this means more or less closed, the quantity of gas escaping at <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> will be unaltered. And not only will the governor
                    accommodate itself to the varying pressure of the holder, but also to the
                    varying quantities of gas required to escape at <hi rend="italic">e</hi> for the
                    supply of the burners. Thus, if it were necessary that less gas⅛hould pass
                    through <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> in consequence of the extinction of a portion
                    of the lights, the increased pressure thus produced at the holder would raise
                    the governor, and partially shut the valve, leaving just sufficient aperture for
                    the requisite supply of gas.</p>
                <p>Numerous improvements have been made on the ordinary station governor. In the
                    form invented and manufactured by D. Bruce Peebles, the bell or holder is
                    enclosed in a gas-tight case or chamber, and a small portion of the inlet gas
                    flows in and out of this chamber above the holder. The pressure of this small
                    quantity of gas is regulated by passing it through a small separate governor;
                    and, acting on the outer surface of the holder, this, in a very delicate and
                    sensitive manner, performs the duty of weights in the older forms of governor.
                    An arrangement similar in principle is applied to the district governor by Bruce
                    Peebles, the minimum day pressure being secured by means of a stopcock or
                    screw-valve on the apparatus, and the maximum night pressure is controlled by a
                    small subsidiary governor. The principle of the small governor, which thus plays
                    an important part in regulating large flows of gas, will be explained under
                    consumers’ governors, the apparatus being shown in section in fig. 18 below.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Supply Pipes.—</hi> The street main and service pipes are tubes
                    of malleable or of cast iron, the gauge of which must be arranged according to
                    the quantity of gas to be supplied, the length it has to travel, and the
                    pressure under which it is carried forward. Practical gas-engineers possess
                    elaborated tables of data for the regulation of the size of their various supply
                    pipes. Notwithstanding the utmost care and accuracy in the laying and fitting of
                    street mains, leakage at joints is a constant source of annoyance. Under the
                    most favourable conditions there is a discrepancy of from 7 to 8 per cent,
                    between the gas made and the amount accounted for by consumption, and the
                    greater part of that loss is due to leakage in street pipes. To convey the gas
                    from the main pipes and distribute it in houses, pipes of lead or of block tin
                    are generally used.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Consumers’ Meters.—</hi> Of these there are twoforms in actual
                    use, the “wet” and the “dry.” The former, the invention of Mr Clegg, is
                    represented in the two sections (figs. 15 and 16), where <hi rend="italic"
                    >cc</hi> represents the outside case, having the form of a flat cyclinder; <hi

                    >g, g</hi> are two pivots, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> a toothed wheel fixed
                    upon the pivots and connected with a train of wheel-work to register its
                    revolutions. The pivots are fixed to and support a cylindrical drum-shaped
                    vessel <hi rend="italic">ddd</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> having
                    openings <hi rend="italic">e, e, e, e,</hi> internal partitions <hi
                    rend="italic">ef ef ef ef</hi> and a centre piece <hi rend="italic">ffff.</hi>
                    The machine is filled with water, which is poured in at <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    up to the level of <hi rend="italic">i∙,</hi> and, on gas being admitted under a
                    small pressure at α, it enters into the upper part of the contre piece, and
                    forces its way through such of the openings / as are from time to time above the
                    surface of the water. By its action upon the partition which curves over the
                    opening α, a rotatory motion is communicated to the cylinder,—the gas from the
                    opposite chamber being at the same time expelled by one of the openings <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> and afterwards escaping at δ, as already mentioned. Wet
                    meters work easily, and, when well set and properly supplied with water, measure
                    the gas with much accuracy. But excess or deficiency <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0106-0097"/> of water impairs their measuring power, which may
                    also be affected by the meter being lifted off the level. The freezing of the
                    water also frequently occasions trouble, and the action of the water on the gas
                    passing through it by dissolving out part of the valuable illuminating
                    hydrocarbons on the one hand, and diffusing watery vapour through it on the
                    other, doubly affects its illuminating power.</p>
                <p>•The dry meter is free from the defects just mentioned, but does not pass the gas
                    with such steadiness as the wet meter. The ordinary dry meter consists of an
                    oblong box enclosing two measuring cylinders, with leather sides which contract
                    and expand as they are being emptied and filled, on the principle of ordinary
                    bellows. The pressure of the gas entering this meter is sufficient to keep it in
                    operation, and by a system of valves the one cylinder is in process of filling
                    as the other is being emptied through the service pipe. The chambers communicate
                    by means of lever arms with ⅛crank which turns a train of wheels in connexion
                    with the indicator dials on the face of the machine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Consumers' Governor.—</hi> In order to consume gas in a
                    perfectly uniform and economical manner, it is essential that the pressure at
                    the burners should be always invariably the same. That pressure is liable,
                    however, to variation from a number of causes, such as fluctuation in the number
                    of lights in use, either in the house or in the neighbourhood, or the
                    application or withdrawal of pressure at the works’ governor. And as all good
                    burners are fitted with regard to a fixed standard quality and pressure of gas
                    to be consumed, if this is not maintained the conditions of maximum illuminating
                    power are lost. A consumers’ governor secures uniformity of pressure at all the
                    burners supplied by the pipe on which it is placed. The principle of the
                    governor is identical with that of the station governor already described,
                    increased pressure in both cases causing the orifice through which the gas
                    escapes to be contracted. The mechanical arrangements by which this contraction
                    of orifice is effected are various. In some instances they are in direct contact
                    with the separate burners, while other governors are applied to the supply pipes
                    of a whole establishment. They are separable into pressure governors, which,
                    like the station governors, give a constant or uniform pressure under all
                    variations of consumption, and volumetric governors which pass a constant volume
                    or amount of gas under all variations of pressure.</p>
                <p>Of pressure governors the forms devised by Sugg and Bruce Peebles are in
                    extensive use, the latter especially being much applied to street lamps. In
                    Sugg’s consumers’ governor (fig. 17) the gas enters at the inlet, and, following
                    the course indicated by the arrows, passes through the regulating plate of the
                    governor into the gas-holder, and thence, by the opening provided for it, it
                    reaches the outlet. The gas-holder has suspended from a disc in the crown a
                    half-ball valve, λvhich closes or opens the opening in the regulating plate as
                    the gas-holder rises or falls. A weight placed on the top of the holder fixes
                    the pressure required to raise it. As a consequence, if the pressure of the gas
                    on the inlet is greater than that required to lift the holder, then the latter
                    rises, carrying the half-ball valve with it, till such time as the opening left
                    between the sides of the valve of the regulating plate is sufficient to allow
                    the passage of the necessary quantitv of gas to balance the holder. On the other
                    hand, if the pressure at the inlet falls below that required to lift the holder,
                    the full opening of the regulating plate allows all the gas there is to pass
                    through the governor to the burners. Where a very perfect control is desirable,
                    the parts of the governor are made in duplicate, and a double control is thus
                    established. With certain structural differences the action of the Bruce Peebles
                    governor (fig. 18) is the same. The gas enters at 1, and passes out at 2 into
                    the pipe leading to the burners. To adjust the governor the brass cap 3 is
                    unscrewed, and the weights 4 taken off or put on until the desired pressure, of
                    say 5-tenths, at the burners is obtained, when the brass cap is again screwed to
                    its place. The weights now keep the valve 6 open so long as 5-tenths pressure is
                    not exceeded in the main; but any variations in the main above that pressure act
                    at once on the diaphragm 5, and partly close or open the valve, thus maintaining
                    under all circumstances a steady outlet pressure.</p>
                <p>Of volumetric governors the best known is Giroud’s glycerin rheometer, which
                    consists of a closed cylindrical casing containing a very light metal dome or
                    ball dipping into a circular channel filled with glycerin. In the upper part of
                    the dome is a small orifice through which the gas passes, and on its top is
                    fixed a conical valve which works in a seat at the top of the casing. As the
                    pressure from the supply side rises or falls, the bell responsively moves up or
                    down, opening or closing by the conical valve the orifice by which the gas
                    passes outward; and so delicately is this compensation adjusted that the gas
                    passed is the same in amount however different the pressure. Brufce Peebles has
                    invented a simple and inexpensive form of volumetric governor (fig. 19), in
                    which the use of glycerin is dispensed with. It consists of a conical dome
                    resting on a needle-pointed stud, the cone having an orifice at C, and there is
                    besides a variable consumption channel at the side ABA, which can be controlled
                    by the external screw. As soon as the stopcock is opened the gas fills the
                    interior of the cone, and momentarily closes the valve; but, finding its way by
                    the vertical passage, or through the hole C, in the cone, it reaches the chamber
                    above the cone. The cone is therefore now surrounded by gas at the same
                    pressure, and, having nothing to support it, falls, and lets gas pass to the
                    burner. But this only takes place to an extent that allows a differential
                    pressure to be established sufficient to support the cone, which is then
                    equilibriated between two pressures; and the difference between these two
                    pressures remains constant, however much the initial pressure of the gas may
                    vary, unless, of course, it gets so low as not to be able to raise the cone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Burners.—</hi> The question of the arrangements by which the
                    maximum illuminating power may be developed in the consumption of gas, being one
                    which principally affects individual consumers, has not received the attention
                    which their importance merits. As a' rule, gas-fitters are ignorant of the
                    principles involved in the economical use of gas, and are often prejudiced by
                    the assertions of certain inventors; and thus it happens that, owing to
                    defective fitting3, unregulated pressure, and imperfect burners, an enormous
                    loss of illuminating power is suffered. In their report to the Board of Trade in
                    1869, the referees under the City of London Gas Act state, of a large number of
                    burners examined by them, that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n107/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0107-0098"/> “The diversity as to illuminating power was
                    surprisingly great, and such as will appear incredible to any one who has not
                    ascertained the facts by careful experiment. They also found the kinds of
                    burners in common use are extremely defective, thereby entailing u]κm the public
                    a heavy pecuniary loss, as well as other disadvantages. In order to examine this
                    important matter more fully, the referees, with the ready permission of the
                    proprietors, inspected several large establishments in the city, where, owing to
                    the prevalence of night work, an unusually large amount of gas was consumed. The
                    inspection in every case confirmed the apprehensions which the referees nad
                    formed from their examination of the burners which they had procured from the
                    leading gas-fitting establishments. In the offices of two of the leading daily
                    newspapers (establishments which consume more gas than any other), they found
                    that the burners principally in use gave only 55 per cent, of light compared
                    with the Sugg-Letheby burner, or with Leoni’s Albert Crutch burner, and yet the
                    price of the last-named burner is almost identical with that of the very bad
                    burners employed in these offices. Tested by the Bengel burner, or by Sugg’s new
                    burner, the amount of light given by these imperfect burners is only between 47
                    and 49 per cent, of what is obtainable from the gas.”</p>
                <p>In a communication to the Philosophical Society of Glasgow in 1874 Dr Wallace,
                    the official gas examiner of that city, dealing with the rich cannel gas of a
                    minimum illuminating power of 25 candles there supplied, estimated that there is
                    in ordinary consumption a loss of 40 per cent, of illuminating power which,
                    under favourable circumstances, might be obtained, and that in practice, while
                    not more than 16- candle power is procured, from 20 to 23-candle illumination
                    ought to be readily obtainable.</p>
                <p>This universal wasteful misuse of gas is not merely a question of economy,
                    although the aggregate pecuniary loss must be very great. It affects in no small
                    degree the health and comfort of the consumers of gas; the products •of
                    combustion of the purest gas vitiate the atmosphere, and overheat the apartments
                    in which it is burned. Moreover, the light from gas properly burned is much
                    steadier and purer, and less trying to the eyesight, than that wastefully
                    consumed.</p>
                <p>The principal circumstances which demand attention in the fitting of burners are
                    the average pressure and illuminating power of the gas to be consumed. How
                    pressure may be controlled has already been shown in connexion with governors.
                    The quality or illuminating power of gas has a most important bearing on the
                    nature of burners proper for use, so that a clear distinction must be drawn
                    between common coal-gas and cannel-gas, the burners for the one kind being quite
                    unsuited for the other variety. The maximum amount of light is obtained from any
                    gas just at that point where the flame is on the verge of smoking, and the
                    conditions under which 14-candle gas would be perfectly consumed would, with 26
                    or 30-candle gas, produce a large amount of smoke. Indeed, the richer gas is,
                    the greater is the difficulty in developing its full illuminating power, and at
                    all times it must be burned in a much thinner sheet or stream than is proper in
                    the case of poor gas, which requires less access of air for its complete
                    luminiferous combustion. The opening or slit in burners used for common gas is
                    therefore much larger than in those devoted to the consumption of
                    cannel-gas.</p>
                <p>There are two principal kinds of burners in use—Argand and flat-flame burners.
                    The Argand burner in its usual form is useful only for common or low
                    illuminating power gas, and it has, in the hands of various inventors,
                    especially by Mr vVilliam Sugg of London, been so improved that for amount and
                    steadiness of light it leaves little further improvement to be hoped for. The
                    common Argand consists of an annular tube with a circle of small holes pierced
                    in the end of the ring. It thus produces a circular or tubular flame, which
                    requires to be protected with a glass chimney, by which the admission of air is
                    regulated. The burner made by Sugg in 1869, known as the Sugg-Letheby, or Sugg’s
                    No. 1, is the standard burner adopted for the United Kingdom in Acts of
                    Parliament, and the same standard has been adopted in the United States, in
                    Canada, and in various European states. At the time it was made, the Sugg No. 1
                    was esteemed the best known burner, but since that time Mr Sugg has perfected
                    his London Argand, whereby with London gas results equal to about 2 candles
                    better than the standard are obtained. Fig. 20 is a sectional view of Sugg’s
                    London Argand with the latest improvements.</p>
                <p>At the point at which the gas enters is a brass nose-piece A, screwed to fit the
                    usual three-eighth thread, intended by the manufacturers of all kinds of gas
                    fittings to receive the burner. This is drilled through its length, and slightly
                    trumpeted at the top so as to fit the cone-shaped piece of metal projecting from
                    the roof of the inlet chamber B. The outside of the upper portion of the
                    nose-piece A is screwed to fit the inside of the inlet chamber B, and thus, by
                    an adjustment of this screw by means of paper washers put on the shoulder at AB,
                    it is possible to enlarge or decrease the area of the passage through which the
                    gas has to pass in ordeι ’ to supply three tubes (two of which, C and D, only
                    are shown in the drawing), by which it is further conducted to the combustion
                    chamber E. This chamber is made of steatite, a material which is capable of
                    resisting the corroding action of heat or damp, and is a good non-conductor of
                    heat. It is pierced with a number of holes, so arranged as regards size and
                    number that the quantity of gas the burner is required to consume shall pass out
                    at an inappreciable or the least possible pressure. This is in order that the
                    oxygen of the atmosphere, slowly ascending through the centre opening F, the
                    annulus formed by the edge of the air cone G, and the outside of the combustion
                    chamber E, shall combine with the burning gas by natural affinity only, leaving
                    the nitrogen to pass freely out at the top of the flame. H is one of the three
                    springs which are intended to keep the chimney glass steady in its place. J J
                    are two of three stubs or rests for a screen, globe, or moon; and K is a peg to
                    steady the current of air which passes up the centre opening F.</p>
                <p>With the view of competing in illuminating power with the electric light, Mr Sugg
                    has recently devised a modified form of Argand burner calculated to yield a
                    large illuminating power by increased but still economical consumption of gas.
                    These burners are made of two or more concentric Argand rings, the outer being
                    of large diameter, and irt operation they give out a large solid, white, steady
                    flame. With London gas, a two-ring burner consuming 19 feet per hour yields
                    80-candle light; 3-ring burners which consume 23 feet give 100 candles; 4-ring
                    burners fed with 45 feet of gas gave an illumination equal to 200 candles.</p>
                <p>As regular pressure is essential for the proper use of these burners, a
                    self-acting governor is frequently fitted to them. The pressure at which the
                    best results are obtained with London gas is about ’ 7 inch. In a series of
                    experiments with Argand burners made by Mr John Pattinson of Newcastle-on-Tyne
                    the following results were obtained:—</p>

                <p>Flat-flame burners, or burners which spread their flame in a broad thin sheet,
                    are of two principal kinds known respectively as “fishtail” (fig. 21) and
                    “batwing” (fig. 22) burners. The fishtail or union burner has two orifices
                    drilled in its surface, <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> —</p>

                    best forms of all kinds of burners now in use steatite or adaπfl⅛ (pottery) tops
                    are employed. In Sugg’s Christiania burner the slit is circular, and the light
                    issues in two thin sheets which coalesce in their upper luminiferous part,
                    producing a most beneficial result when common gas is consumed. The common metal
                    and steatite-tipped burners in use permit the current of gas to strike against
                    their orifices without any control or regulation, but in the numerous patented
                    forms of both fishtail and bat wing jets certain mechanical obstructions, or
                    small governors, are inserted, which break or retard the current. Screws, wire
                    gauze, calico, cotton wool, iron filings, and constriction of the lower part of
                    the burner are all devices in use. Of all these one of the simplest and most
                    effective is the plan on which the Brönner burner is constructed, which is
                    simply to have the opening at the lower part of the burner smaller than the
                    upper orifice. For different qualities and pressures of gas the Brönner burner
                    presents a great variety of combinations by having several distinct sizes of
                    lower constriction which can be adjusted to a large number of tip orifices.
                    Thus, with six distinct openings at each end, 36 combinations can be made. As
                    Argand burners are not suited for measuring the illuminating power of rich
                    cannel-gas, flat flame-burners have to be employed; and in the Act of Parliament
                    under which the Glasgow Corporation supplies gas, it is provided that “all the
                    gas supplied by the corporation shall be at least of such quality as to produce
                    from a union jet burner, capable of consuming 5 cubic feet of gas per hour under
                    a pressure equal to a column of water ’ 5 of an inch in height, a light equal in
                    intensity to the light produced by 25 sperm candles of 6 in the pound, burning
                    120 grains per hour.”</p>

                    rend="italic">(Proc. Phil. Soc. Glasgow,</hi> vol. ix.), tabulates an extensive
                    series of experiments made with flat-flame burners of various sizes with about
                    28-candle gas at different degrees of pressure. The general result of these
                    experiments shows that, to obtain the highest luminiferous effect with burners
                    of small aperture, a low pressure of gas (not more than,’5 inch) must be
                    maintained, although, as the size of the jet increases within certain limits,
                    the pressure may be increased with favourable results. With 9 sizes of Bray’s
                    regulator fishtail (a burner having an obstruction consisting of a double fold
                    of cotton cloth) Dr Wallace obtained the following results, calculated to 5
                    cubic feet per hour :—</p>

                <p>From these experiments it appears that there are burners in common use which,
                    consuming the same amount of gas, differ in lightgiving effect from 3 <hi
                    rend="italic">'75</hi> to 12 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 62-candles, one
                    giving more than three times as much light as the other; and if we take the best
                    Argand burner into account, the range of variation is from 3 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 75 to 17’80, or as one to five nearly. Another
                    important deduction from these observations is that large-sized burners as a
                    rule give much more illuminating power than the smaller sizes. Thus a burner
                    passing 7 feet of gas per hour will almost invariably distribute more light than
                    two each burning 3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 feet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cas</hi><hi rend="italic">Testing.—</hi> The universally
                    recognized and practised method of valuing gas is by comparing its light with
                    that yielded by a standard light, which can be obtained as nearly as possible of
                    an unvarying intensity. In making such a photometric, comparison it is essential
                    that the conditions under which the lights to be compared are burned shall be
                    uniform, and that the materials be consumed at a definite rate. The standard
                    recognized by legislative authority in Great Britain and America is the burning
                    of a sperm candle 6 to the fi&gt;. consuming at the rate of 120 grains of sperm
                    per hour, compared with gas burning at the rate of 5 cubic feet per hour. The
                    burner prescribed for common gas is the Sugg-Letheby-Argand, in Acts of
                    Parliament defined as a 15-holed Argand with a 7-inch glass chimney; and for
                    rich cannel-gas a union or fishtail jet passing 5 feet per', hour is employed.
                    The apparatus employed for making the comparison is generally the Bunsen
                    photometer, or some modification of that instrument; and the ratio of
                    comparative illumination is established by the well-known principle that the
                    intensity of light diminishes in inverse proportion to the square of the
                    distance from its source. The Bunsen photometer consists of a bar of wood 98
                    inches long, with a candle holder at one end and at the other the standard gas
                    burner. A balance for weighing the candlè as it burns, an indexed meter for the
                    gas, and a clock are also provided. The bar is graduated from the centre to each
                    end, and on it is set a sliding holder into which a screen of prepared paper is
                    placed. The screen is so prepared that a spot or disc is more opaque than the
                    remainder of the paper, so that when light passes through it from one side, that
                    particular spot is seen distinctly darker than the rest. When, however, equal
                    amounts of light fall on it from both sides the spot disappears, and the whole
                    surface presents a uniform appearance. Therefore, with both candle and gas
                    burning under the stipulated conditions in a darkened chamber, by moving the
                    screen on the graduated bar from the one light and towards the other till the
                    dark spot on the paper disappears, the comparative illuminating power of the
                    light is ascertained by the position of the screen on the graduated bar, or by a
                    simple arithmetical calculation. Thus, the lights being 100 inches apart, if at
                    the conclusion of the experiment the screen is 20 inches from the candle and 80
                    from the gas jet, since 80 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> is 16 times 20 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, the gas is 16- candle power.</p>

                <p>Comparisons of the quality of gas are also made by the jet photometer, an
                    apparatus which depends on the principle that gas of uniform quality burned at
                    invariable pressure, through a small orifice, yields a flame of uniform height
                    If the flame is to be maintained at a uniform height the pressure in the pipes
                    must increase as the quality of the gas decreases. The jet photometer forms a
                    ready and convenient means of ascertaining any variations in the quality of gas
                    supply; but it is not available for purposes of comparison.</p>
                <p>Analysis of gas does not yield so satisfactory evidence of its illuminating value
                    as photometric comparisons, but various methods of ascertaining the proportion
                    of luminiferous olefines contained in any gas are occasionally practised. The
                    absorption of the heavy hydrocarbons by chlorine or by bromine, and Dr Fyfe’s
                    durability test, are of theoretical rather than practical importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Residual Products.—</hi> Under this term are embraced coke,
                    ammoniacal liquor, and gas-tar, all of which are sources of income in the gas
                    manufacture. Indeed the value of these products has increased so rapidly of late
                    years, and they now form the basis of manufactures of such consequence, that the
                    residual products can scarcely be regarded as of secondary importance, and they
                    will certainly play no small part in determining the future maintenance of
                    gas-lighting in the face of other competing systems. The change in the valuation
                    of ammonia and tar liquors is well illustrated by the circumstance that, during
                    the year 1878, the corporation of Bradford was offered £10,000 per annum for
                    these products, which about eight years previously had been disposed of for a
                    yearly payment of £800.</p>
                <p>Coke is a substance which varies much in value, according to local circumstances,
                    and the nature of the coal distilled. When shale is used, there remains in the
                    retorts an ashy residue which is absolutely worthless; and the coke of cannel
                    coal is also comparatively of little value, owing to the amount of ash it
                    yields. Indeed, in Scotch works where ashy cannel alone is distilled, the
                    retorts have to be partly fired with common coal. The coke obtained from the
                    distillation of caking coal, on the other hand, is of high value, and after a
                    supply is set aside for heating the retorts there generally remains from 65 to
                    85 per cent, of the whole amount to be disposed of by sale.</p>
                <p>Ammoniacal liquor is more abundantly produced by the distillation of cannel than
                    by common coal, from 18 to 22 B&gt; of ammonia, as sulphate, being obtained from
                    each ton of cannel distilled, as against about 16 lb derived from ordinary coal.
                    Gas liquor is now almost the sole source of ammonia, which, among other
                    purposes, is very largely employed as an agricultural fertilizer.</p>
                <p>Tar liquor yields by destructive distillation a wide range of products possessing
                    a great and increasing industrial value. The cannel coals, and other varieties
                    rich in volatile matter, are also the kinds which yield the largest proportion
                    of tar. In the distillation of coal-tar, after some ammoniacal and watery
                    vapours have been given off, there is distilled over a proportion of highly
                    volatile fluid hydrocarbons which consist principally of benzol; and afterwards
                    a large amount of a light oil, known as coal naphtha (also a mixture of various
                    hydrocarbons), is obtained. At this point the residue in the retort is called
                    artificial asphalt, and as such is a commercial article; but if the heat is
                    forced, and the distillation continued, a large amount of “heavy” or “dead oils”
                    is obtained, and the mass left in the still is “hard pitch.” The heavy oils are
                    a mixture of naphthalin, phenol (carbolic acid), cresol (cresylic acid), and
                    anthracene, &amp;c. The benzol obtained in the first stage of the distillation
                    is the basis of aniline and its various dyes; naphtha is used as a solvent, and
                    for lighting and other purposes; carbolic acid, in addition to its employment as
                    an antiseptic, is the basis of many valuable dyes; anthracene forms the source
                    of the now most important dye, artificial alizarin; and most of the substances
                    have other applications of minor importance.</p>

                    >Petroleum-Gas.—</hi> Petroleum being a substance obtained in great abundance,
                    notably in America, is used, not only directly as an illuminating agent, but
                    also for the production of gas; and as an enricher of common coal-gas it is
                    applied at several works in New York and Brooklyn. Its preparation is effected
                    by distilling it first at a low temperature into a rich vapour, which, when
                    passed into highly heated retorts, is converted into permanent gas of an
                    illuminating power about five times greater than common gas, and which is,
                    moreover, absolutely free from ammonia, sulphur compounds, and carbonic acid. On
                    account of its great richness, petroleum-gas must be consumed in special burners
                    of very fine aperture, at a rate varying from 5 to 2 feet per hour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Oil-Gas.—</hi> In the early stages of gas manufacture many
                    attempts were made to substitute gas distilled from inferior oils for coal-gas.
                    The oil was distilled by allowing it to percolate into highly heated retorts, in
                    which a quantity of coke or a like porous solid was placed, and the distillate
                    was a richly luminiferous gas free from hurtful impurities. Although oil in this
                    form yields a convenient and powerful illuminant, its direct combustion is much
                    more economical; and as all oils and fats are highly valuable for many purposes
                    besides illumination, they cannot compete with gas coal as a source of gas.
                    Nevertheless the New York Gas Light Company manufactured oil-gas exclusively
                    from 1824 till 1828, and sold their product at $10 per 1000 feet. The
                    distillation of suint from wool washing, and of recovered spent soap, are
                    examples of the application of oleaginous substances for gas-making.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Resin-Gas.—</hi> In its treatment and results resin, as a
                    source of gas, is very similar to oil. It yields a pure gas of great
                    illuminating power, and for twenty years (1828-48) it was supplied in New York
                    at $7 per 1000 feet. Previous to the.civil war of 1861—65 it was a good deal
                    used on the European continent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wood-Gas.—</hi> The original experiments of Lebon, it will be
                    remembered, were made with wood-gas, but he failed to obtain from his product an
                    illuminating power that would compare with that of coal-gas. Lebon’s failure was
                    in later years shown to arise from distilling at a temperature which gave off
                    chiefly carbonic acid with non-luminous carbonic oxide and light carburetted
                    hydrogen, leaving in the retort a tar which the application of a higher heat
                    would have resolved into highly luminiferous gases and vapours. Pettenkofer, who
                    pointed out the fact, devised a system of wood-gas making in which the products
                    of the low-heat <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n110/mode/1up"

                    a range of red-hot pipes; but now it is found that ordinary retorts, properly
                    heated and fed with small charges, answer perfectly well for the operation.
                    Wood-gas, owing to its high specific gravity and the proportion of carbonic
                    oxide it contains, must be burned at considerable pressure, in specially
                    constructed burners with a large orifice. It is largely used in Germany,
                    Switzerland, and Russia, where wood is more easily obtained than coal. It was
                    used at Philadelphia gasworks in 1856, where it was affirmed to be cheaper and
                    of greater luminosity than coal-gas.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Peat-Gas</hi> is evolved under circumstances the same as occur
                    in connexion with the wood-gas manufacture, but the amount of moisture contained
                    in peat is a serious obstacle to its successful use in this as in most other
                    directions. Earnest and persistent efforts have been made to use peat as a
                    source of gas, but these have met but little commercial success. To a limited
                    extent it is used in various German factories which happen to be situated in the
                    immediate neighbourhood of extensive peat deposits.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Carburetted Gas.—</hi> Under this head may be embraced all the
                    methods for impregnating gaseous bodies with vapours of fluid or solid
                    hydrocarbons. The objects aimed at in the carburetting processes are—(1) to
                    increase the illuminating power of ordinary coal-gas; (2) to render non-luminous
                    combustible gases, such as water-gas, luminiferous; and (3) so to load
                    non-combustible gases with hydrocarbon vapour as to make the combination at once
                    luminiferous and a supporter of combustion. The plans which have been proposed,
                    and the patents which have been secured for processes of carburetting, coming
                    under one or other of these heads, have been almost endless; and while the
                    greater part of them have failed to obtain commercial success, they are
                    sufficient to indicate that there is still a possibility of doing much to
                    increase the effect and cheapen the cost of production of gas. Further, although
                    for extensive use none of the gas-making plans can compete with coal-gas
                    manufacture, some of them are of much value for private establishments, country
                    houses, factories, and similar places, where connexion with coal-gas works
                    cannot be obtained.</p>
                <p>The carburetting of common coal-gas with the vapour of benzol obtained by the
                    distillation of gas-tar was originally suggested by Lowe as early as 1832, and
                    subsequently by the late Charles Mansfield, who showed that by passing gas over
                    sponge saturated with benzol a very great addition was made to the illuminating
                    power; and he introduced an apparatus by which common gas could thus be
                    benzolized at a point very near the burner. The facts, however, that benzol is a
                    highly inflammable liquid, that the benzolized gas varied in richness owing to
                    the gas taking up much more benzol when the carburetter was newly charged than
                    it did afterwards, and consequently that it often produced a smoky flame, and
                    that sulphur compounds accumulated in the carburetter, as well as the trouble
                    connected with charging the apparatus, all combined to prevent the extensive
                    introduction of the process. In later times the value of benzol for aniline
                    manufacture and other purposes would have been a serious bar to its use. Mr
                    Bowditch introduced the use of a heavier hydrocarbon—a mixture of naphthalin
                    with cymol—which he called carbolin, and which possesses the advantage of giving
                    off no inflammable vapour at ordinary temperatures, and is, moreover, a
                    substance for which no commercial demand exists. The carburetting appliance had
                    to be placed in immediate proximity to the burners, and either heated by them
                    direct, or by a small subsidiary jet, as the vapour of naphthalin solidifies on
                    a very small fall of temperature and chokes up pipes. Carburetting by means of a
                    solid block of naphthalin introduced into a gas-tight box, and partly
                    volatilized by a strip of copper passing from the burner flame into the box, has
                    recently been proposed, and is now being carried into effect with every prospect
                    of great increase of illuminating power, and consequent economy, by the
                    Albo-Carbon Light Company.</p>
                <p>The efforts to introduce carburetted water-gas have been numerous and persistent;
                    and the sanguine statements of the various inventors have led to the loss of
                    much capital through experiments undertaken on a great scale which have always
                    resulted unfavourably. The whole of the proposed processes depended on the
                    decomposition of water by passing it over highly-heated surfaces in presence of
                    glowing charcoal, whereby free hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and carbonic acid gases
                    are produced, the carbonic acid being eliminated by a subsequent process of
                    purification. The combustible gas so obtained was in earlier experiments charged
                    with luminiferous hydrocarbons by being passed into a retort in which coal,
                    resin, or oil was being distilled, a.3 in Selligue’s and other processes; or, as
                    in White’s hydrocarbon process, both steam and coal were treated together in a
                    special form of retort. Since the introduction of American petroleum, however,
                    most methods of carburetting water-gas have been by impregnating it with the
                    vapour of gasolin, the highly volatile portion of petroleum which comes over
                    first in its distillation for the preparation of “kerosene” lamp oil. Water-gas
                    has been proposed, not only as an illuminating agent, but at least as much as a
                    source of heat; but the heat expended in the decomposition of water is much
                    greater than can in practice be given out by the resulting gases.</p>
                <p>Several of the processes introduced for rendering ordinary atmospheric air at
                    once combustible and luminiferous, by saturating it with the vapour of gasolin,
                    have been so satisfactory that this air-gas is now largely used both in America
                    and Europe for lighting mansions, churches, factories, and small rural
                    districts. The general principle of the airmachines will be understood from the
                    following description of the “sun auto-pneumatic” apparatus (Hearson’s patent),
                    which is in extensive use throughout Great Britain. Hearson’s machine is
                    cylindrical in form (fig. 23), and is surmounted by two turrets. Internally the
                    cylinder is divided into two compartments by a transverse portion, one being
                    occupied by a rotary blower, an apparatus similar in construction to the drum of
                    a water-meter, and the other by an elevator or dipper wheel, the function of
                    which is to raise gasolin into the blower chamber, where the gasolin must be
                    maintained at a constant level. The blower and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n111/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0111-0102"/> the elevator mechanism are set in operation by
                    being mounted on a spindle which passes through and outside the cylinder, aud is
                    turned either by a weight attached to a length of steel wire or, where
                    convenient, by hydraulic power. The turrets contain (1) a gas-holder which
                    supplies gas while the machine is being wound up, should any light be then
                    burning, and (2) a governor to regulate the pressure of the issuing gas. The
                    apparatus works only when gas is being burned, and moves in proportion to the
                    demand on it up to its limit of production. There is therefore no necessity for
                    storing, as indeed would be impracticable with this form of carburetted gas. The
                    function of the blower is not only, by its revolution, to press forward the gas
                    into the supply pipes, but also to carburet the air by exposing continually
                    renewed thin films of the liquids to its influence on the moist metallic
                    surfaces. The revolution of the blower, moreover, maintains an unceasing
                    agitation in the gasolin, vaporizes the liquid in an equal and uniform manner,
                    and keeps the entire volume at the same temperature throughout. The quantity of
                    gasolin operated on being comparatively large, the temperature of the liquid
                    decreases only slowly, and is in ordinary conditions sufficiently recouped from
                    the external air to keep it in good working order throughout any length of
                    time.</p>
                <p>M. Tessie du Motay, who for many years advocated a modified system of lime-light,
                    latterly abandoned that system in favour of a form of carburetted gas. His
                    system necessitates two sets of pipes and a special form of burner,— one pipe
                    supplying ordinary coal-gas or highly carburetted hydrogen, and the other
                    leading in a supply of oxygen, whereby a powerful, steady, white light is
                    maintained at the burner. Philipps of Cologne has also utilized oxygen in a
                    comparatively pure state for burning in a lamp with a wick a mixture of heavy
                    hydrocarbons, which in common air would burn with a very smoky flame.</p>
                <p>Other sources of gas, such as tar, and even faecal matters, have been proposed;
                    and many modified forms of gaseous illumination have been brought forward which,
                    even to name here, would occupy space out of proportion to their importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Future of Coal-Gas.</hi></p>
                <p>The processes involved in the preparation, distribution, and consumption of
                    coal-gas still remain essentially the same as when the system was first
                    elaborated; but in all details of tbe industry numerous improvements have been
                    introduced, resulting in marked economy and efficiency of the system. In the
                    meantime new applications of importance have been found for coal-gas in
                    connexion with heating and cooking, and as a motive power in gas-engines.
                    Further, collateral industries have been superadded to the gas manufacture,
                    which in themselves are of such value and importance that, were the distillation
                    of coal as a source of artificial light to cease, it would certainly continue to
                    be practised as a source of the raw materials of the coal-tar colours, and of
                    carbolic acid, &amp;c. Were coal-gas to cease to be made primarily and
                    principally for artificial illumination, and to become more a heating and
                    cooking agent, or were it to fall into the position of being a mere collateral
                    product of the manufacture of tar, it is certain that the manufacturing
                    processes would be very materially modified. Costly cannel-gas, with its high
                    illuminating power, is no better suited for a gas engine than common gas; and
                    for heating purposes a much greater yield of gas might be obtained, which, in
                    burning, would evolve more heat than is sought in making illuminating gas. But
                    as matters now stand, the fact that illumination, heat, motive power, and
                    dye-stuffs are all obtained by means of the manufacture as at present conducted
                    is a consideration of much weight in dealing with rival systems of artificial
                    lighting.</p>
                <p>Throughout the whole experience of gas manufacture the efforts of inventors have
                    been directed, not only to improve the manufacture of coal-gas, but also to
                    supersede its ordinary processes, and to supplant it by gas yielded by other raw
                    materials or by new systems bf illumination. The persistent efforts which have
                    been made to improve coal-gas, and the success which many of tho plans exhibit
                    in their experimental stage, warrant the conclusion that the processes and
                    results of the manufacture are still susceptible of much improvement. When it is
                    considered how exceedingly small is the total proportion of illuminants in
                    coal-gas to the bulk of the materials dealt with, it is not difficult to imagine
                    that modifications of processes may be devised whereby a great increase of
                    lighting effect might be practically available, and at the same time a greater
                    percentage of the total heat-giving power of the coal secured for domestic and
                    manufacturing purposes. Notwithstanding the confessed imperfections of the
                    system of coal gas-making,—the evil odours which attach to the works, the yet
                    more offensive exhalations given off from streets through which the main-pipes
                    are led, the destructive accidents which occasionally occur from gas explosions,
                    and the heat and sulphurous fumes evolved during its combustion,—not one of the
                    numerous substitutes which have been proposed has been able to stand in
                    competition against it in any large town or city where coal is a marketable
                    commodity. As against the system of electric lighting, which is now being
                    brought into competition with it, the ultimate fate of gas may be different. It
                    may be regarded as already demonstrated that for busy thoroughfares—almost, it
                    may be said, for open-air lighting generally—and for large halls and enclosed
                    spaces, electric lighting will, in the near future, supersede gas. The
                    advantages of the electric light for such positions in brilliancy, penetration,
                    and purity are so manifest that its use must ultimately prevail, irrespective of
                    the question of comparative cost, and of the fact that municipalities and
                    wealthy corporations have an enormous pecuniary stake in gasproperty. That the
                    electric light will be equally available for domestic illumination is, however,
                    not yet so certain; and until it is demonstrated that a current may be
                    subdivided practically without limit, that the supply can adapt itself to the
                    demand with the same ease that the pressure of gas is regulated, and that the
                    lights can be raised and lowered equally with gas-lights—till these and other
                    conditions are satisfied, the disuse of gas-lighting is still out of sight.
                    Should these conditions, however, be satisfied, there can be little doubt that
                    gas-lighting will enter on a period of severe competition and struggle for
                    existence; and in the end the material which at one time was regarded as a most
                    troublesome and annoying waste— the gas-tar—will, in all probability, exercise a
                    decisive influence on the continuance of the gas manufacture.</p>
