                        >geant,</hi> derived through French and Latin from Greek <hi rend="italic"
                        >gigas (gigant).</hi> The idea conveyed by the word in classic mythology is
                    that of beings more or less manlike, but monstrous in size and strength. Figures
                    like the Titans and the Giants whose birth from Heaven and Earth is sung by
                    Hesiod in the <hi rend="italic">Theogony,</hi> such as can heap up mountains to
                    scale the sky, and war beside or against the gods, must be treated, with other
                    like monstrous figures of the wonder-tales of the world, as belonging altogether
                    to the realms of mythology. But there also appear in the legends of giants some
                    with historic significance. The ancient and commonly-repeated explanation of the
                    Greek word γiγας, as connected with or derived from <hi rend="italic"
                        >γηγενής,</hi> or “earth-born,” seems by no means sound as a matter of
                    etymology, but at any rate the idea conveyed by it was familiar to the ancient
                    Greeks, that the giants were earth-born or indigenous races (see Weicker, <hi
                        rend="italic">Griechische Götterlehre,</hi> vol. i. p. 787). The Bible (the
                    English reader must be cautioned that the word giant has been there used
                    ambiguously, from the Septuagint downwards) touches the present matter in so far
                    as it records the traditions of the Israelites of fighting in Palestine with
                    tall races of the land such as the Anakiιn (Numb. xiii. 33; Deut. ii. 10, iii.
                    11; 1 Sam. xvii. 4). When reading in Homer of “the Cyclopes and the wild tribes
                    of the Giants,” or of the adventures of Odysseus in the cave of Polyphemus
                    (Homer, <hi rend="italic">Odyss.,</hi> vii. 206; ix.), we seem to come into view
                    of dim traditions, exaggerated through the mist of ages, of pre-Hellenic
                    barbarians, godless, cannibal, skin-clothed, hurling huge stones in their rude
                    warfare. Giant-legends of this class are common in Europe and Asia, where the
                    big and stupid giants have often every token of uncouth native barbarians,
                    exaggerated into monsters in the legends of the later tribes who dispossessed
                    and slew them.</p>
                <p>Besides the conception of giants as special races distinct from mankind, it was a
                    common opinion of the ancients that the human race had itself degenerated, the
                    men of primeval ages having been of so far greater stature and strength as to be
                    in fact gigantic. This, for example, is received by Pliny <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Hist. Nat.,</hi> vii, c. 16), and it becomes a common doctrine of
                    theologians such as Augustine <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Civitate</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei,</hi> XV. 9), lasting on into times so
                    modern that it may be found in Cruden’s <hi rend="italic">Concordance.</hi> Yet
                    so far as can be judged from actual remains, it does not appear that giants, in
                    the sense of tribes of altogether superhuman stature, ever existed, or that the
                    men of ancient time were on the whole taller than those now living. It is now
                    usual to apply the word giant to beings not superhuman in their height, but
                    merely the tallest men and women of our nations. In every race of mankind the
                    great mass of individuals do not depart far from a certain mean or average
                    height, while the very tall or very short men become less and less numerous as
                    they depart from the mean standard, till the utmost divergence is reached in a
                    very few giants on the one hand, and a very few dwarfs on the other. At both
                    ends of the scale, the body is markedly out of the ordinary proportions; thus a
                    giant’s head is smaller and a dwarf’s head larger than it would be if an average
                    man had been magnified or diminished. The principle of the distribution of
                    individuals of different sizes in a race or nation has been ably set forth by
                    Quetelet <hi rend="italic">(Physique</hi><hi rend="italic">Sociale,</hi> vol.
                    ii.; <hi rend="italic">Anthropométrie,</hi> books iii. and iv.). Had this
                    principle been understood formerly, we might have been spared the pains of
                    criticizing assertions as to giants 20 feet high, or even more, appearing among
                    mankind. The appearance of an individual man 20 feet high involves the existence
                    of the race he is an extreme member of, whose mean stature would be at least 12
                    to 14 feet, which is a height no human being has been proved on sufficient
                    evidence to have approached <hi rend="italic">(Anthropom.,</hi> p. 302). In
                    fact, Quetelet considers the tallest man whose stature has been authentically
                    recorded to have been Frederick the Great’s Scottish giant, who was not quite 8
                    feet 3 inches. Modern statisticians, though admitting that this may not be the
                    extreme limit of human stature, cannot accept the loose conclusion in Buffon <hi
                        rend="italic">(Hist. Nat..</hi> ed. Sonnini, vol. iv. p. 134), that there is
                    no doubt of giants having been 10, 12, and perhaps 15 feet high. Confidence is
                    not even to be placed in ancient asserted measurements, as where Pliny gives to
                    one Gabbaras, an Arabian, the stature of 9 feet 9 inches (about 9 feet 5⅜ in.
                    English), capping this with the mention of Posio and Sec-undilla, who were half
                    a foot higher. That two persons should be described as both having this same
                    extraordinary measure suggests to the modern critic the notion of a note jotted
                    down on the philosopher’s tablets, and never tested afterwards.</p>
                <p>Under these circumstances, it is worth while to ask how it is that legend and
                    history so abound in mentions of giants outside all probable dimensions of the
                    human frame. Ore cause is that, when the story-teller is asked the actual
                    stature cf the huge men who figure in his tales, he is not sparing of his inches
                    and feet. What exaggeration can do in this way may be judged from the fact that
                    the Patagonians, whose average height (5 feet 11 inches) is really about that of
                    the Chirnside men in Berwickshire, are described in Pigafetta’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Voyage round the World</hi> as so monstrous that the
                    Spaniards’ heads hardly reached their waists. It is reasonable to suppose, with
                    Professor Nilsson <hi rend="italic">(Primitive Inhabitants of Scandinavia,</hi>
                    chap, vi.), that in the traditions of early Europe tribes of savages may have
                    thus, if really tall, expanded into giants, or, if short, dwindled into dwarfs.
                    Another cause which is clearly proved to have given rise to giant-myths of yet
                    more monstrous type, has been the discovery of great fossil bones, as of mammoth
                    or mastodon, which have from early ages been supposed to be bones of giants, and
                    have given rise to a whole class of giant-myths (see Tylor, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Early History of Mankind,</hi> chap. xi.; <hi rend="italic">Primitive
                        Culture,</hi> chap. x.). Such anatomical inferences from the leg-bone or
                    tooth of some <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n589/mode/1up"

                    the ingenuity of natives of America, or of barbarians of the Old World; but
                    their late continuance in the midst of European culture shows how recently the
                    principles of comparative anatomy obtained their present hold on the public
                    mind. A tooth weighing 4∣ ft&gt;, and a thigh-bone 17 feet long, having been
                    found in New England in 1712 (they were probably mastodon), Dr Increase Mather
                    thereupon communicated to the Royal Society of London his confirmation from them
                    of the existence of men of prodigious stature in the antediluvian world (see the
                        <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> vol. xxiv, p. 85; D.
                    Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Prehistoric Man,</hi> vol. i. p. 54). The giants in
                    the streets of Basel and supporting the arms of Lucerne appear to have
                    originated from certain fossil bones found in 1577, examined by the physician
                    Felix Plater, and pronounced to have belonged to a giant some 16 or 19 feet
                    high. These bones have since been referred to a very different geological genus,
                    but within the present century Plater’s giant skeleton was accepted as a genuine
                    relic of the giants who once inhabited the earth. See the dissertation of Le
                    Cat, cited in the 5th edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia
                        Britannica</hi> (1817). <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.</hi> B. τ.)</p>
