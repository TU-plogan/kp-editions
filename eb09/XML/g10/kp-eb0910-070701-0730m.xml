                    been introduced about the year 1852. In 1875 it was shown by Dr Lima that the
                    substance had been exported from Bahia to Portugal, whence it found its way to
                    the Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. The tree which yields it belongs to

                    >Leguminosoe,</hi> and has been named <hi rend="italic">A. Araroba.</hi> It is
                    met with in great abundance in certain forests in the province of Bahia,
                    preferring as a rule low and humid spots. The tree is from 80 to 100 feet high,
                    and is furnished with imparipinnate leaves, the leaflets of which are oblong,
                    about 1 √ inch long and ∣ inch broad, and somewhat truncate at the apex. The
                    flowers are papilionaceous, of a purple colour, and arranged in panicles. The
                    Goa powder or araroba is contained in the trunk, filling crevices in the
                    heartwood. To obtain it, the oldest trees are selected as containing a larger
                    quantity, and after being cut down are sawn transversely into logs, which are
                    then split longitudinally, and the araroba chipped or scraped off with the axe.
                    During this process the workmen feel a bitter taste in the mouth; and great care
                    has to be taken to prevent injury from the irritating action of the powder on
                    the eyes. In this state, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> mixed with fragments of
                    wood, the Goa powder is exported in casks.</p>
                <p>In India Goa powder has been used in the form of a paste, made by mixmg the
                    powder with vinegar or lime juice, as a local application tor the cure of Indian
                    ringworm. It appears to be one of the best remedies for that obstinate disease;
                    and so highly is it valued that its price in Bombay averages £3, 12s. per lb.
                    Its use in chloasma, intertrigo, and psoriasis, as well as in various other skin
                    diseases, has also been attended with considerable success. The only
                    disadvantages attending its use are—that it leaves a stain which is difficult to
                    remove, and that the powder is apt to set up severe irritation of the eyes, if
                    it come in contact with the conjunctiva. On this account Mr Balmanno Squire
                    prefers to use it in the form of ointment. When given internally it has been
                    found to act as an emetic and purgative. In England it is now regarded as one of
                    the most efficacious remedies in intractable cases of ringworm.</p>
