                    was born at Strasburg, August 21, 1816, and died there August 19, 1856. After
                    his school years spent at home and in Carlsruhe, where his taste for chemistry
                    was awakened, he was sent to Leipsic to learn business, but he attended
                    Erdmann’s lectures on chemistry as well. Returning home he very soon found that
                    a commercial life was not to his taste, so, after a sharp dispute with a
                    disappointed father, he enlisted in a cavalry regiment. In a few months a
                    military career also became intolerable, and, being bought off by a friend, he
                    went to Giessen to study under Liebig. There he remained eighteen months,
                    displaying such entire devotion to chemistry that he found himself unable to
                    obtain the customary degree. He again thought of entering trade, but Liebig
                    persuaded him to go to Paris, where he arrived in 1838. His good appearance and
                    address recommended him to Dumas and other chemists, and in a short time along
                    with Cahours, who became his intimate friend, he published an important memoir
                    on essential oils, distinguished especially by the new views it contained. He
                    soon after left Pans and went to Montpellier, where he was professor in the
                    faculty of science till 1848. He then returned to Paris and opened a school for
                    chemistry, which, however, was not commercially a success. From 1848 to 1855 he
                    resided at Paris, and it was during this time that he published the memoirs and
                    carried on the controversies which have been of such importance in the
                    development of scientific chemistry. In 1855 he was appointed professor at
                    Strasburg, his native place; but he had held the office for but a short time
                    when he died, after two days’ illness. Gerhardt’s contributions to chemistry are
                    less discoveries of new facts, than of new ideas which organized and vitalized
                    an inert accumulation of facts. He developed the notion of types of structure
                    and reaction; he discovered the order of organic compounds, which led him to the
                    doctrine of homologous and other series; and on theoretical grounds he
                    remodelled the whole character of the combining weights upon the two-volume
                    molecular basis. The bare statement, however, of his results gives no idea of
                    the lucidity, the wealth of thought, the grasp of the entire subject which his
                    memoirs and his longer works display. It was by his writings especially that
                    Gerhardt’s influence was felt. Although a thorough enthusiast in his subject,
                    clear in his exposition, earnest in his work, weighty in his delivery, he seems
                    to have wanted the qualities of a successful teacher. Nothing is heard of his
                    lectures, or of his influence as a professor,—such influence as drew students
                    round Liebig and other great masters. None the less, however, did he stir the
                    thoughts of other chemists to the very depths; and although the unitary system
                    has had its day, yet, in substance at least, if no longer in name, chemistry is
                    still Gerhardt’s, and it is not impossible that chemists may return to some of
                    his views which at present are not acceptable.</p>
