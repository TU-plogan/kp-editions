                        >Glück),</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Christopher Willibald</hi> (1714-1787), a
                    celebrated operatic composer, was born at Heidenwang, near Neumarkt, in the
                    Upper Palatinate, on July 2, 1714. He belonged to the lower middle class, his
                    father being gamekeeper to Prince Lobkowitz; but the boy’s education was not
                    neglected on that account. From his twelfth to his eighteenth year he frequented
                    the Jesuit school of Kommotow in the neighbourhood of Prince Lobkowitz’s estate
                    in Bohemia, where he not only received a good general education, but also had
                    lessons in music. At the age of eighteen Gluck went to Prague, where he
                    continued his musical studies under Czernhorsky, and maintained himself by the
                    exercise of his art, sometimes in the very humble capacity of fiddler at village
                    fairs and dances. Through the introduction of Prince Lobkowitz, however, he soon
                    gained access to the best families of the Austrian nobility, and when in 1736 he
                    proceeded to Vienna, he was hospitably received at his protector’s palace. Here
                    he met Prince Melzi, an ardent lover of music, who invited Gluck to accompany
                    him to Milan, where the young musician continued his education under Giovanni
                    Battista San Martini, an interesting composer who, although self-taught, was one
                    of the most accomplished musicians of the 18th century, and has been called the
                    model of Haydn. His works belong chiefly to the class of chamber music. In this
                    respect, however, the master’s example was not followed by the pupil. Gluck’s
                    dramatic instinct was irrepressible, and soon we fiud him producing operas at
                    the rapid rate necessitated by the omnivorous taste of the Italian public in
                    those days. Eight of these works were produced at various Italian theatres
                    between 1741 and 1745. Although favourably received, they were not much above
                    the ordinary operatic level of the day, and it would be needless even to give
                    their names. Only the first may be mentioned here, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Artaserse,</hi> libretto by Metastasio, first performed at Milan in 1741.
                    To the reputation thus acquired Gluck owed an invitation to London, where in
                    1745 he became composer for the opera house in the Haymarket. The first opera
                    produced there was called <hi rend="italic">La Cadutα</hi><hi rend="italic">dei
                        Giganti</hi> (1746, words by Metastasio), followed by one of his earlier
                    operas, re-written for the purpose. It is stated that he also appeared as a
                    performer on the musical glasses. The success of the two operas, as well as that
                    of a so-called <hi rend="italic">p&gt;asticcio,</hi> or dramatic medley entitled
                        <hi rend="italic">Pirarno e Tisbe,</hi> was anything but brilliant, and
                    Gluck accordingly left London. But his stay in England, although not accompanied
                    by immediate success, was not without important consequences for his subsequent
                    career. Gluck at this time was neither more nor less than an ordinary producer
                    of Italian opera. Handel’s well-known saying that Gluck knew no more
                    counterpoint than his (Handel’s) cook, whether true or not, was unfair, for the
                    reason that, if Gluck had known as much counterpoint as the author of <hi
                        rend="italic">Israel in Egypt</hi> himself, it would have been difficult to
                    make use of it in the style cf music <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0717-0694"/> then exclusively cultivated by him. Had the
                    young composer been successful in the ordinary <hi rend="italic">opera</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">seria,</hi> there is every reason to fear that the great
                    dramatic reform, initiated by him, would never have taken place. The critical
                    temper of the London public fortunately averted this calamity. It may also be
                    assumed that the musical atmosphere of the English capital, and especially the
                    great works of Handel, were not without beneficial influence upon the young
                    compter. But of still greater importance in this respect was a short trip to
                    Paris, where Gluck became for the first time acquainted with the classic
                    traditions and the declamatory style of the French opera—the future scene of his
                    own triumphs. Of these great issues little trace, however, is to be found in the
                    works produced by Gluck during the fifteen years after his return from England.
                    His first opera written for Vienna, called <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Semiramide</hi><hi rend="italic">reconosciuta</hi> (1748), is
                    again an opera seria of the ordinary kind, and little more can be said of <hi
                        rend="italic">Telemacco</hi> (Rome, 1749), <hi rend="italic">La Clemenza di
                        Tito</hi> (Naples, 1751), and numerous occasional pieces of a more or less
                    serious kind written for the court at Vienna, where Gluck settled permanently in
                    1756, having two years previously been appointed court chapel-master, with a
                    salary of 2000 florins, by the empress Maria Theresa. On a previous occasion he
                    had received the order of knighthood from the pope, consequent upon the
                    successful production of two of his works in Rome. During the long interval from
                    1756 (the date of his opera <hi rend="italic">ll Re Pastore)</hi> to 1762, Gluck
                    seems to have matured his plans for the reform of the opera; and, barring a
                    ballet named, like Mozart’s opera, <hi rend="italic">Don Giovanni,</hi> and some
                        <hi rend="italic">airs</hi><hi rend="italic">nouveaux</hi> to French words
                    with pianoforte accompaniment, no compositions of any importance have to be
                    recorded. His <hi rend="italic">piece d' occasion, Il Trioηfο di Clβlia,</hi>
                    produced at Bologna in 1762, is still written in the old manner. But his <hi
                        rend="italic">Orfeo ed Euridice,</hi> played in October of the same year at
                    Vienna, shows that the composer had entered upon a new career. It is significant
                    that in the original score the work is described as a “dramrna per musica” or
                    music-drama, the title opera seria being avoided. Gluck also for the first time
                    had deserted Metastasio, and Raniero Calzabigi furnished the highly dramatic
                    book of <hi rend="italic">Orpheus.</hi> Quite apart from its significance in the
                    history of dramatic music, <hi rend="italic">Orpheus</hi> is a work which, by
                    its intrinsic beauty, commands the highest admiration, and does not fail to
                    impress an audience, even now, wherever an adequate representative of the
                    title-part can be found. Orpheus’s air, “Che faro,” is known to everyone; but
                    finer even is the great <hi rend="italic">scena</hi> in which the poet’s song
                    softens even the <hi rend="italic">ombre sdeynose</hi> of Tartarus. The
                    ascending passion of the entries of the solo (Deh! placatevi; Mille pene; Men
                    tiranne), interrupted by the harsh but gradually-softening exclamations of the
                    Furies, is of the highest dramatic effect. These melodies, moreover, as well as
                    every declamatory passage assigned to Orpheus, are made subservient to the
                    purposes of dramatic characterization; that is, they could not possibly be
                    assigned to any other person in the drama, any more than Hamlet’s monologue
                    could be spoken by Polonius. It is in this power of musically realizing a
                    character—a power all but unknown in the opera of his day—that Gluck’s genius as
                    a dramatic composer is chiefly shown. After a short relapse into his earlier
                    manner, Gluck followed up his <hi rend="italic">Orpheus</hi> by a second
                    classical music-drama named <hi rend="italic">Alceste,</hi> and first produced
                    in December 1767 at Vienna. In his dedication of the score to the grand-duke of
                    Tuscany, Gluck has fully expressed his aims, as well as the reasons for his
                    total breach with the old traditions. “I shall try,” he writes, “to reduce music
                    to its real function, that of seconding poetry by intensifying the expression of
                    sentiments and the interest of situations without interrupting the action by
                    needless ornament. I have accordingly taken care not to interrupt the singer in
                    the heat of the dialogue, to wait for a tedious <hi rend="italic">ritοmel,</hi>
                    nor do I allow him to stop on a sonorous vowel, in the middle of a phrase, in
                    order to show the nimbleness of a beautiful voice in a long <hi rend="italic"
                        >cadenza''</hi> Such theories, and the stern consistency with which they
                    were carried out, were little to the taste of the pleasure-loving Viennese; and
                    the success of <hi rend="italic">Alceste,</hi> as well as that of <hi
                        rend="italic">Paris and Helena,</hi> which followed two years later, was not
                    such as Gluck had desired and expected. He therefore eagerly accepted the chance
                    of finding a home for his art in the centre of intellectual and more especially
                    dramatic life, Paris. Such a chance was opened to him through M. Bailli du
                    Rollet, attaché of the French embassy at Vienna, aud a musical amateur who
                    entered into Gluck’s ideas with enthusiasm. A classic opera for the Paris stage
                    was accordingly projected, and the friends fixed upon Racine’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Iphiyenie</hi><hi rend="italic">en Aulide.</hi> After some difficulties,
                    overcome chiefly by the intervention of Gluck’s former pupil the dauphiness
                    Marie Antoinette, the opera was at last accepted and performed at the Académie
                    de Musique, on April 19, 1774. The great importance of the new work was at once
                    perceived by the musical amateurs of the French capital, and a hot controversy
                    on the merits of <hi rend="italic">Iphiyenie</hi> ensued, in which some of the
                    leading literary men of France took part. Amongst Gluck’s opponents were not
                    only the admirers of Italian vocalization and sweetness, but also the adherents
                    of the earlier French school, who refused to see in Gluck the legitimate
                    successor of Lulli and Rameau. Marmontel, Laharpe, and D’Alembert were
                    opponents, the Abbé Arnaud and others the enthusiastic friends of the German
                    master. Rousseau took a peculiar position in the struggle. In his early writings
                    he is a violent partisan of Italian music, but when Gluck himself appeared as
                    the French champion, he willingly acknowledged the great composer’s genius. In a
                    letter to Dr Burney, written shortly before his death, Rousseau gives a close
                    and appreciative analysis of the <hi rend="italic">Alceste,</hi> the first
                    Italian version of which Gluck had submitted to him for suggestions; and when,
                    on the first performance of the piece not being received favourably by the
                    Parisian audience, the composer exclaimed, “<hi rend="italic">Alceste</hi> est
                    tombée,” Rousseau is said to have comforted him with the flattering <hi
                        rend="italic">bon-mot,</hi> “Oui, mais elle est tombée du ciel.” The contest
                    received a still more personal character when Piccini, a celebrated and by no
                    means incapable composer, came to Paris as the champion of the Italian party.
                    Into the details of the historic battle between Gluckists and Piccinists this is
                    not the place to enter. Volumes have been written on the subject, and the whole
                    affair has been denounced as a sign of the frivolity of the eighteenth century.
                    But to those interested in music and in the drama, the question whether the
                    vocal virtuoso or the true dramatic artist should reign on the lyrical stage is
                    by no means without importance; although, perhaps, the gentlemen of the queen’s
                    court, and their friends who applauded her countryman and protege Gluck from “le
                    coin de la reine,” hardly looked upon the matter in so serious a light. The
                    victory at last remained, by common consent (including, it is said, Piccini’s
                    own), with Gluck. The succession of the operas written for Paris is the
                    following :— <hi rend="italic">Orphee</hi><hi rend="italic">et Eurydice</hi>
                    (the <hi rend="italic">Orfeo</hi> rewritten), 1774; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Alceste</hi> (also an adaptation of the earlier work, 1776); <hi
                        rend="italic">Armide,</hi> 1777; <hi rend="italic">Iphiyenie</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">en Tauride,</hi> 1779. Some minor compositions, written partly
                    by desire of the queen for the court festivals, it would be needless to mention.
                    Gluck was engaged upon an opera <hi rend="italic">Les</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Danaides</hi> when an attack of apoplexy compelled him to relinquish all
                    thoughts of work. He left Paris for Vienna, where he lived for several years in
                    dignified leisure, disturbed only by his declining health. He died on November
                    18, 1787.</p>
                <p>To the general character of Gluck’s music some allusion has already been made. He
                    was essentially a dramatic <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n718/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0718-0695"/> composer, and no notice need be taken of the
                    few works belonging to a different sphere. In connexion with its dramatic
                    purpose his music ought always to be judged. He never was a great contrapuntist
                    in the sense that Bach and Handel were. But neither was there much room for
                    polyphonous display in the music-drama as he understood it. The chorus of
                    Scythians in the second <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia</hi> (“Il nous falloit du
                    sang ”) would not gain in effect if it contained an elaborate fugue. This and
                    other choruses in the same great work at the same time illustrate Gluck’s power
                    of rendering musically national as well as individual characteristics. As a
                    masterly trait of psychological characterization may further be cited the
                    accompaniment to Orestes’s air, also in <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">en Tauride</hi> (“Le calme rentre dans mon coeur ”), where the
                    unfortunate man in vain tries to find relief from the pangs of conscience,
                    distinctly heard in the unceasing semiquavers of the orchestral accompaniment.
                    The severe censure passed on Gluck for drowning the voices by the instruments
                    posterity has converted into one of the composer’s highest claims to fame. Not
                    only has Gluck developed the orchestra as regards mere beauty and volume of
                    sound, but he also has made it an important factor in the dramatic organism.
                    Instances from the second <hi rend="italic">Iphigénie</hi> alone might again be
                    multiplied. The savage Scythians, for instance, are characterized by the noise
                    of brass and percussion; while Iphigénie’s simple prayer is accompanied by the
                    strings and two oboes. The care bestowed by Gluck upon a correct and emphatic
                    declamation of the words is another important point in his dramatic reform.
                    Readers interested in the matter will have noticed the striking parallelism
                    between the views and aims advocated by Gluck in the 18th century and by Wagner
                    in the 19th century—a parallelism which may be extended to the bitter
                    animadversions evoked by these theories amongst contemporary critics. The means,
                    however, by which the theories were to be realized are very different in the two
                    cases. Gluck’s reform is essentially directed against the encroachments of the
                    singer; Wagner’s against those of the composer as an independent artist. Gluck,
                    it is true, felt the necessity of a perfect unity between music and poetry, but
                    he never intended to bring about this desirable effect by surrendering any of
                    the strict forms of his own art. The consequence was that the poet was more than
                    ever bound to adapt his work to the demands of the composer, and that the latter
                    remained practically the omnipotent ruler on the operatic stage. Wagner at last
                    has made dramatic purpose the supreme consideration to which the forms of music,
                    as a separate art, have to submit.</p>
                <p>An altogether satisfactory biography of Gluck remains still to be written. With
                    regard to the life, Anton Schmid’s <hi rend="italic">Chr. IV. Ritter von
                        Gluck</hi> may be consulted. Herr Marx, in his <hi rend="italic">Gluck
                        und</hi><hi rend="italic">dic</hi><hi rend="italic">Opera,</hi> has
                    attempted to define the composer’s position in the history of dramatic music. Μ.
                    Desnoiresterres’s <hi rend="italic">Gluck et</hi><hi rend="italic">Piccini</hi>
                    refers to the most important portion of the composer’s career. For it must
                    always be remembered that Gluck, although a German by birth, belongs as an
                    artist to France rather than to his native country. His works form as it were
                    the musical complement to the tragedy of Corneille and Racine. In France he was
                    first appreciated, and in France also his traditions were continued by a school
                    of highly gifted composers. (F. H.)</p>
