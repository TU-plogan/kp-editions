                    >Glück),</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Christopher Willibald</hi> (1714-1787), a
                    celebrated operatic composer, was born at Heidenwang, near Neumarkt, in the
                    Upper Palatinate, on July 2, 1714. He belonged to the lower middle class, his
                    father being gamekeeper to Prince Lobkowitz; but the boy’s education was not
                    neglected on that account. From his twelfth to his eighteenth year he frequented
                    the Jesuit school of Kommotow in the neighbourhood of Prince Lobkowitz’s estate
                    in Bohemia, where he not only received a good general education, but also had
                    lessons in music. At the age of eighteen Gluck went to Prague, where he
                    continued his musical studies under Czernhorsky, and maintained himself by the
                    exercise of his art, sometimes in the very humble capacity of fiddler at village
                    fairs and dances. Through the introduction of Prince Lobkowitz, however, he soon
                    gained access to the best families of the Austrian nobility, and when in 1736 he
                    proceeded to Vienna, he was hospitably received at his protector’s palace. Here
                    he met Prince Melzi, an ardent lover of music, who invited Gluck to accompany
                    him to Milan, where the young musician continued his education under Giovanni
                    Battista San Martini, an interesting composer who, although self-taught, was one
                    of the most accomplished musicians of the 18th century, and has been called the
                    model of Haydn. His works belong chiefly to the class of chamber music. In this
                    respect, however, the master’s example was not followed by the pupil. Gluck’s
                    dramatic instinct was irrepressible, and soon we fiud him producing operas at
                    the rapid rate necessitated by the omnivorous taste of the Italian public in
                    those days. Eight of these works were produced at various Italian theatres
                    between 1741 and 1745. Although favourably received, they were not much above
                    the ordinary operatic level of the day, and it would be needless even to give
                    their names. Only the first may be mentioned here, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Artaserse,</hi> libretto by Metastasio, first performed at Milan in 1741. To
                    the reputation thus acquired Gluck owed an invitation to London, where in 1745
                    he became composer for the opera house in the Haymarket. The first opera
                    produced there was called <hi rend="italic">La Cadutα</hi><hi rend="italic">dei
                    Giganti</hi> (1746, words by Metastasio), followed by one of his earlier operas,
                    re-written for the purpose. It is stated that he also appeared as a performer on
                    the musical glasses. The success of the two operas, as well as that of a
                    so-called <hi rend="italic">p&gt;asticcio,</hi> or dramatic medley entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Pirarno e Tisbe,</hi> was anything but brilliant, and Gluck
                    accordingly left London. But his stay in England, although not accompanied by
                    immediate success, was not without important consequences for his subsequent
                    career. Gluck at this time was neither more nor less than an ordinary producer
                    of Italian opera. Handel’s well-known saying that Gluck knew no more
                    counterpoint than his (Handel’s) cook, whether true or not, was unfair, for the
                    reason that, if Gluck had known as much counterpoint as the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Israel in Egypt</hi> himself, it would have been difficult to make
                    use of it in the style cf music <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0717-0694"/> then exclusively cultivated by him. Had the young
                    composer been successful in the ordinary <hi rend="italic">opera</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seria,</hi> there is every reason to fear that the great dramatic
                    reform, initiated by him, would never have taken place. The critical temper of
                    the London public fortunately averted this calamity. It may also be assumed that
                    the musical atmosphere of the English capital, and especially the great works of
                    Handel, were not without beneficial influence upon the young compter. But of
                    still greater importance in this respect was a short trip to Paris, where Gluck
                    became for the first time acquainted with the classic traditions and the
                    declamatory style of the French opera—the future scene of his own triumphs. Of
                    these great issues little trace, however, is to be found in the works produced
                    by Gluck during the fifteen years after his return from England. His first opera
                    written for Vienna, called <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Semiramide</hi><hi rend="italic">reconosciuta</hi> (1748), is again an opera
                    seria of the ordinary kind, and little more can be said of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Telemacco</hi> (Rome, 1749), <hi rend="italic">La Clemenza di Tito</hi>
                    (Naples, 1751), and numerous occasional pieces of a more or less serious kind
                    written for the court at Vienna, where Gluck settled permanently in 1756, having
                    two years previously been appointed court chapel-master, with a salary of 2000
                    florins, by the empress Maria Theresa. On a previous occasion he had received
                    the order of knighthood from the pope, consequent upon the successful production
                    of two of his works in Rome. During the long interval from 1756 (the date of his
                    opera <hi rend="italic">ll Re Pastore)</hi> to 1762, Gluck seems to have matured
                    his plans for the reform of the opera; and, barring a ballet named, like
                    Mozart’s opera, <hi rend="italic">Don Giovanni,</hi> and some <hi rend="italic"
                    >airs</hi><hi rend="italic">nouveaux</hi> to French words with pianoforte
                    accompaniment, no compositions of any importance have to be recorded. His <hi
                    rend="italic">piece d' occasion, Il Trioηfο di Clβlia,</hi> produced at Bologna
                    in 1762, is still written in the old manner. But his <hi rend="italic">Orfeo ed
                    Euridice,</hi> played in October of the same year at Vienna, shows that the
                    composer had entered upon a new career. It is significant that in the original
                    score the work is described as a “dramrna per musica” or music-drama, the title
                    opera seria being avoided. Gluck also for the first time had deserted
                    Metastasio, and Raniero Calzabigi furnished the highly dramatic book of <hi
                    rend="italic">Orpheus.</hi> Quite apart from its significance in the history of
                    dramatic music, <hi rend="italic">Orpheus</hi> is a work which, by its intrinsic
                    beauty, commands the highest admiration, and does not fail to impress an
                    audience, even now, wherever an adequate representative of the title-part can be
                    found. Orpheus’s air, “Che faro,” is known to everyone; but finer even is the
                    great <hi rend="italic">scena</hi> in which the poet’s song softens even the <hi
                    rend="italic">ombre sdeynose</hi> of Tartarus. The ascending passion of the
                    entries of the solo (Deh! placatevi; Mille pene; Men tiranne), interrupted by
                    the harsh but gradually-softening exclamations of the Furies, is of the highest
                    dramatic effect. These melodies, moreover, as well as every declamatory passage
                    assigned to Orpheus, are made subservient to the purposes of dramatic
                    characterization; that is, they could not possibly be assigned to any other
                    person in the drama, any more than Hamlet’s monologue could be spoken by
                    Polonius. It is in this power of musically realizing a character—a power all but
                    unknown in the opera of his day—that Gluck’s genius as a dramatic composer is
                    chiefly shown. After a short relapse into his earlier manner, Gluck followed up
                    his <hi rend="italic">Orpheus</hi> by a second classical music-drama named <hi
                    rend="italic">Alceste,</hi> and first produced in December 1767 at Vienna. In
                    his dedication of the score to the grand-duke of Tuscany, Gluck has fully
                    expressed his aims, as well as the reasons for his total breach with the old
                    traditions. “I shall try,” he writes, “to reduce music to its real function,
                    that of seconding poetry by intensifying the expression of sentiments and the
                    interest of situations without interrupting the action by needless ornament. I
                    have accordingly taken care not to interrupt the singer in the heat of the
                    dialogue, to wait for a tedious <hi rend="italic">ritοmel,</hi> nor do I allow
                    him to stop on a sonorous vowel, in the middle of a phrase, in order to show the
                    nimbleness of a beautiful voice in a long <hi rend="italic">cadenza''</hi> Such
                    theories, and the stern consistency with which they were carried out, were
                    little to the taste of the pleasure-loving Viennese; and the success of <hi
                    rend="italic">Alceste,</hi> as well as that of <hi rend="italic">Paris and
                    Helena,</hi> which followed two years later, was not such as Gluck had desired
                    and expected. He therefore eagerly accepted the chance of finding a home for his
                    art in the centre of intellectual and more especially dramatic life, Paris. Such
                    a chance was opened to him through M. Bailli du Rollet, attaché of the French
                    embassy at Vienna, aud a musical amateur who entered into Gluck’s ideas with
                    enthusiasm. A classic opera for the Paris stage was accordingly projected, and
                    the friends fixed upon Racine’s <hi rend="italic">Iphiyenie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">en Aulide.</hi> After some difficulties, overcome chiefly by the
                    intervention of Gluck’s former pupil the dauphiness Marie Antoinette, the opera
                    was at last accepted and performed at the Académie de Musique, on April 19,
                    1774. The great importance of the new work was at once perceived by the musical
                    amateurs of the French capital, and a hot controversy on the merits of <hi
                    rend="italic">Iphiyenie</hi> ensued, in which some of the leading literary men
                    of France took part. Amongst Gluck’s opponents were not only the admirers of
                    Italian vocalization and sweetness, but also the adherents of the earlier French
                    school, who refused to see in Gluck the legitimate successor of Lulli and
                    Rameau. Marmontel, Laharpe, and D’Alembert were opponents, the Abbé Arnaud and
                    others the enthusiastic friends of the German master. Rousseau took a peculiar
                    position in the struggle. In his early writings he is a violent partisan of
                    Italian music, but when Gluck himself appeared as the French champion, he
                    willingly acknowledged the great composer’s genius. In a letter to Dr Burney,
                    written shortly before his death, Rousseau gives a close and appreciative
                    analysis of the <hi rend="italic">Alceste,</hi> the first Italian version of
                    which Gluck had submitted to him for suggestions; and when, on the first
                    performance of the piece not being received favourably by the Parisian audience,
                    the composer exclaimed, “<hi rend="italic">Alceste</hi> est tombée,” Rousseau is
                    said to have comforted him with the flattering <hi rend="italic">bon-mot,</hi>
                    “Oui, mais elle est tombée du ciel.” The contest received a still more personal
                    character when Piccini, a celebrated and by no means incapable composer, came to
                    Paris as the champion of the Italian party. Into the details of the historic
                    battle between Gluckists and Piccinists this is not the place to enter. Volumes
                    have been written on the subject, and the whole affair has been denounced as a
                    sign of the frivolity of the eighteenth century. But to those interested in
                    music and in the drama, the question whether the vocal virtuoso or the true
                    dramatic artist should reign on the lyrical stage is by no means without
                    importance; although, perhaps, the gentlemen of the queen’s court, and their
                    friends who applauded her countryman and protege Gluck from “le coin de la
                    reine,” hardly looked upon the matter in so serious a light. The victory at last
                    remained, by common consent (including, it is said, Piccini’s own), with Gluck.
                    The succession of the operas written for Paris is the following :— <hi
                    rend="italic">Orphee</hi><hi rend="italic">et Eurydice</hi> (the <hi
                    rend="italic">Orfeo</hi> rewritten), 1774; <hi rend="italic">Alceste</hi> (also
                    an adaptation of the earlier work, 1776); <hi rend="italic">Armide,</hi> 1777;
                    <hi rend="italic">Iphiyenie</hi><hi rend="italic">en Tauride,</hi> 1779. Some
                    minor compositions, written partly by desire of the queen for the court
                    festivals, it would be needless to mention. Gluck was engaged upon an opera <hi
                    rend="italic">Les</hi><hi rend="italic">Danaides</hi> when an attack of apoplexy
                    compelled him to relinquish all thoughts of work. He left Paris for Vienna,
                    where he lived for several years in dignified leisure, disturbed only by his
                    declining health. He died on November 18, 1787.</p>
                <p>To the general character of Gluck’s music some allusion has already been made. He
                    was essentially a dramatic <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n718/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0718-0695"/> composer, and no notice need be taken of the few
                    works belonging to a different sphere. In connexion with its dramatic purpose
                    his music ought always to be judged. He never was a great contrapuntist in the
                    sense that Bach and Handel were. But neither was there much room for polyphonous
                    display in the music-drama as he understood it. The chorus of Scythians in the
                    second <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia</hi> (“Il nous falloit du sang ”) would not
                    gain in effect if it contained an elaborate fugue. This and other choruses in
                    the same great work at the same time illustrate Gluck’s power of rendering
                    musically national as well as individual characteristics. As a masterly trait of
                    psychological characterization may further be cited the accompaniment to
                    Orestes’s air, also in <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie</hi><hi rend="italic">en
                    Tauride</hi> (“Le calme rentre dans mon coeur ”), where the unfortunate man in
                    vain tries to find relief from the pangs of conscience, distinctly heard in the
                    unceasing semiquavers of the orchestral accompaniment. The severe censure passed
                    on Gluck for drowning the voices by the instruments posterity has converted into
                    one of the composer’s highest claims to fame. Not only has Gluck developed the
                    orchestra as regards mere beauty and volume of sound, but he also has made it an
                    important factor in the dramatic organism. Instances from the second <hi
                    rend="italic">Iphigénie</hi> alone might again be multiplied. The savage
                    Scythians, for instance, are characterized by the noise of brass and percussion;
                    while Iphigénie’s simple prayer is accompanied by the strings and two oboes. The
                    care bestowed by Gluck upon a correct and emphatic declamation of the words is
                    another important point in his dramatic reform. Readers interested in the matter
                    will have noticed the striking parallelism between the views and aims advocated
                    by Gluck in the 18th century and by Wagner in the 19th century—a parallelism
                    which may be extended to the bitter animadversions evoked by these theories
                    amongst contemporary critics. The means, however, by which the theories were to
                    be realized are very different in the two cases. Gluck’s reform is essentially
                    directed against the encroachments of the singer; Wagner’s against those of the
                    composer as an independent artist. Gluck, it is true, felt the necessity of a
                    perfect unity between music and poetry, but he never intended to bring about
                    this desirable effect by surrendering any of the strict forms of his own art.
                    The consequence was that the poet was more than ever bound to adapt his work to
                    the demands of the composer, and that the latter remained practically the
                    omnipotent ruler on the operatic stage. Wagner at last has made dramatic purpose
                    the supreme consideration to which the forms of music, as a separate art, have
                    to submit.</p>
                <p>An altogether satisfactory biography of Gluck remains still to be written. With
                    regard to the life, Anton Schmid’s <hi rend="italic">Chr. IV. Ritter von
                    Gluck</hi> may be consulted. Herr Marx, in his <hi rend="italic">Gluck
                    und</hi><hi rend="italic">dic</hi><hi rend="italic">Opera,</hi> has attempted to
                    define the composer’s position in the history of dramatic music. Μ.
                    Desnoiresterres’s <hi rend="italic">Gluck et</hi><hi rend="italic">Piccini</hi>
                    refers to the most important portion of the composer’s career. For it must
                    always be remembered that Gluck, although a German by birth, belongs as an
                    artist to France rather than to his native country. His works form as it were
                    the musical complement to the tragedy of Corneille and Racine. In France he was
                    first appreciated, and in France also his traditions were continued by a school
                    of highly gifted composers. (F. H.)</p>
