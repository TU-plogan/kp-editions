                <p><label type="entry">GOLDONI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Carlo</hi></label> (1707-1793),
                    the most illustrious of the Italian comedy-writers, and the real founder of
                    modern Italian comedy. His life is known to us from his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires,</hi> which, though they do not reveal a great thinker, are of great
                    value as faithfully representing the Italian society, especially the Venetian
                    society of the 18th century. Goldoni was born at Venice in 1707. in a fine house
                    near St Thomas’s church. His father Giulio was a native of Modena. The first
                    playthings of the future writer were puppets which he made dance; the first
                    books he read were plays,—among others, the comedies of the Florentine
                    Cicognini. Later he received a still stronger impression from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mandragora</hi> of Macchiavelli. At eight years old he had tried
                    to sketch a play. His father, meanwhile, had taken his degree in medicine at
                    Rome and fixed himself at Perugia, where he made his son join him; but, having
                    soon quarrelled with his colleagues in medicine, he departed for Chioggia,
                    leaving his son to the care of a philosopher, Professor Caldini of Rimini. The
                    young Goldoni soon grew tired of his life at Rimini, and ran away with a
                    Venetian company of players. He began to study law at Venice, then went to
                    continue the same pursuit at Pavia, but at that time he was studying the Greek
                    and Latin comic poets much more and much better than books about law. “I have
                    read over again,” he writes in his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> “the Greek
                    and Latin poets, and I have told to myself that I should like to imitate them in
                    their style, their plots, their precision; but I would not be satisfied unless I
                    succeeded in giving more interest to my works, happier issues to my plots,
                    better drawn characters, and more genuine comedy.” For a satire entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">ll</hi><hi rend="italic">Colosso,</hi> which attacked the honour
                    of several families of Pavia, he was driven from that town, and went first to
                    study with the jurisconsult Morelli at Udine, then to take his degree in law at
                    Modena. After having worked some time as clerk in the chanceries of Chioggia and
                    Feltre, his father being dead, he went to Venice, to exercise there his
                    profession as a lawyer. But the wish to write for the stage was always strong in
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n783/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0783-0760"/> him, and he tried to do so; he made, however, a
                    mistake in his choice, and began with a tragedy, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amalasnnta,</hi> which was represented at Milan and proved a failure. In 1734
                    he wrote another tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Belisario,</hi> which though not
                    much better, chanced nevertheless to please the public. This first success
                    encouraged him to write other tragedies, some of which were well received; but
                    the author himself saw clearly that he had not yet found his proper sphere, and
                    that a radical dramatic reform was absolutely necessary for the stage. He wished
                    to create a characteristic comedy in Italy, to follow the example of Molière,
                    and to delineate the realities of social life in as natural a manner as
                    possible. His first essay of this kind was <hi rend="italic">Momolo Cor-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tesan</hi> (Momolo the Courtier), written in the Venetian dialect,
                    and based on his own experience. Other plays followed— some interesting from
                    their subject, others from the characters; the best of that period are— <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">trentadue Dis-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >grazie d'</hi><hi rend="italic">Arlecchino,</hi><hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hotte</hi><hi rend="italic">critica,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >La</hi><hi rend="italic">Bancarotta,</hi><hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Donna di Garbo.</hi> Having, while consul of Genoa at Venice, been
                    cheated by a captain of Ragusa, he founded on this his play <hi rend="italic"
                    >H</hi><hi rend="italic">Impostore.</hi> At Leghorn he made the acquaintance of
                    the comedian Medebac, and followed him to Venice, with his company, for which he
                    began to write his best plays. Once he promised to write sixteen comedies in a
                    year, and kept his word; among the sixteen are some of his very best, such as
                    <hi rend="italic">II Caffe, Il Bugiardo, La Pamela.</hi> When he left the
                    company of Medebac, he passed over to that maintained by the patrician
                    Vendramin, continuing to write with the greatest facility. In 1761 he was called
                    to Paris, and before leaving Venice he wrote <hi rend="italic">Una</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">delle</hi><hi rend="italic">ultime</hi><hi rend="italic">Sere di
                    Carnevale</hi> (One of the Last Nights of Carnival), an allegorical comedy in
                    which he said good-bye to his country. At the end of the representation of this
                    play, the theatre resounded with applause, and with shouts expressive of good
                    wishes. Goldoni, at this proof of public sympathy, wept as a child. At Paris,
                    during two years, he wrote comedies for the Italian actors; then he taught
                    Italian to the royal princesses; and for the wedding of Louis XVI. and of Marie
                    Antoinette he wrote in French one of his best comedies, <hi rend="italic">Le
                    Bourru Bienfaisant,</hi> which was a great success. When he retired from Paris
                    to Versailles, the king made him a gift of 6000 francs, and fixed on him an
                    annual pension of 1200 francs. It was at Versailles he wrote his <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> which occupied him till he reached his eightieth
                    year. The Revolution deprived him all at once of his modest pension, and reduced
                    him to extreme misery; he dragged on his unfortunate existence till 1793, and
                    died on the 6th of February. The day after, on the proposal of André Chénier,
                    the Convention agreed to give the pension back to the poet; and as he had
                    already died, a reduced allowance was granted to his widow.</p>
