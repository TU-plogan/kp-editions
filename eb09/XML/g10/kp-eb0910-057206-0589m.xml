                <p><label type="entry">GIBBON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward</hi></label> (1737-1794),
                    one of the most celebrated historians of any age or country, was also his own
                    historian. He has left us one of the most piquant autobiographies ever written.
                    In the following sketch the chief incidents of his life will be condensed from
                    that authentic source. For more than facts, even for the setting of these, it is
                    needless to say that it would be unwise to trust to any man’s
                    autobiography—though Gibbon’s is as frank as most. There are points on which
                    vanity will say too much, and perhaps others on which modesty will say too
                    little.</p>
                <p>Gibbon was descended, he tells us, from a Kentish family of considerable
                    antiquity; among his remoter ancestors he reckons the Lord High Treasurer
                    Fiennes, Lord Say and Sele, whom Shakespeare has immortalized in his <hi

                <p>His grandfather was a man of ability, an enterprising merchant of London, one of
                    the commissioners of customs under the Tory ministry during the last four years
                    of Queen Anne, and, in the judgment of Lord Bolingbroke, as deeply versed in the
                    “commerce and finances of England” as any man of his time. He was not always
                    wise, however, either for himself or his country; for he became deeply involved
                    in the South Sea Scheme, in the disastrous collapse of which (1720) he lost the
                    ample wealth he had amassed. As a director of the company, moreover, he was
                    suspected of fraudulent complicity, taken into custody, and heavily fined; but
                    .£10,000 was allowed him out of the wreck of his estate, and with this his skill
                    and enterprise soon constructed a second fortune. He died at Putney in 1736,
                    leaving the bulk of his property to his two daughters —nearly disinheriting his
                    only son, the father of the historian, for having married against his wishes.
                    This son (by name Edward) was educated at Westminster<note anchored="true"

                    and Cambridge, but never took a degree, travelled, became member of Parliament,
                    first for Petersfield (1734), then for Southampton (1741), joined the party
                    against Sir Robert Walpole, and (as his son confesses, not much to his father’s
                    honour) was animated in so doing by “private revenge” against the supposed
                    “oppressor” of his family in the South Sea affair. If so, revenge, as usual, was
                    blind <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> Walpole had sought rather to moderate than to
                    inflame public feeling against the projectors.</p>
                <p>The historian was born at Putney, Surrey, April 27 (Old Style), 1737. His mother,
                    Judith Porten, was the daughter of a London merchant. He was the eldest of a
                    family of six sons and a daughter, and the only one who survived childhood; his
                    own life in youth hung by so mere a thread as to be again and again despaired
                    of. His mother, between domestic cares and constant infirmities (which, however,
                    did not prevent an occasional plunge into fashionable dissipation in compliance
                    with her husband’s wishes), did but little for him. The “true mother of his mind
                    as well as of his health” was a maiden aunt—Catherine Porten by name—with
                    respect to whom he expresses himself in language of the most grateful
                    remembrance. “Many anxious and solitary days,” says Gibbon, “did she consume
                    with patient trial of every mode of relief and amusement. Many wakeful nights
                    did she sit by my bedside in trembling expectation that each hour would be my
                    last.” As circumstances allowed, she appears to have taught him reading,
                    writing, and arithmetic—acquisitions made with so little of remembered pain that
                    “were not the error corrected by analogy,” he says, “I should be tempted to
                    conceive them as innate.” At seven he was committed for eighteen months to the
                    care of a private tutor, John Kirk by by name, and the author, among other
                    things, of a “philosophical fiction,” entitled the <hi rend="italic">Life of
                    Automathes.</hi> Of Kirkby, from whom he learned the rudiments of English and
                    Latin grammar, he speaks gratefully, and doubtless truly, so far as he could
                    trust the impressions of childhood. With reference to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Automathes</hi> he is much more reserved in his praise, denying alike its
                    originality, its depth, and its elegance; but, he adds, “the book is not devoid
                    of entertainment or instruction.”</p>
                <p>In his ninth year (1746), during a “lucid interval of comparative health,” he was
                    sent to a school at Kingston-upon-Thames: but his former infirmities soon
                    returned, and his progress, by his own confession, was slow and unsatisfactory.
                    “My timid reserve was astonished by the crowd and tumult of the school; the want
                    of strength and activity disqualified mo for the sports of the play-field</p>
                <p>By the common methods of discipline, at the expense of many tears and some blood,
                    I purchased the knowledge of the Latin syntax,” but manifestly, in his own
                    opinion, the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights,</hi> Pope’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Homer,</hi> and Dryden’s <hi rend="italic">Virgil,</hi> eagerly read, had at
                    this period exercised a much more powerful influence on his intellectual
                    development than Phaedrus and Cornelius Nepos, “painfully construed and darkly
                    understood.”</p>
                <p>In December 1747 his mother died, and he was taken home. After a short time his
                    father removed to the “rustic solitude” of Buriton (Hants), but young Gibbon
                    lived chiefly at the house of his maternal grandfather, at Putney, where, under
                    the care of his devoted aunt, he developed, he tells us, that passionate love of
                    reading “which he would not exchange for all the treasures of India,” and where
                    his mind received its most decided stimulus. Of 1748 he says, “This year, the
                    twelfth of my age, I shall note as the most propitious to the growth of my
                    intellectual stature.” After detailing the circumstances which unlocked for him
                    the door of his grandfather’s “tolerable library,” he says, “I turned over many
                    English pages of poetry and romance, of history and travels. where a title
                    attracted my eye, without fear or awe I snatched the volume from the shelf.” In
                    1749, in his twelfth year, he was sent to Westminster, still residing, however,
                    with his aunt, who, rendered destitute by her father’s bankruptcy, but unwilling
                    to live a life of dependence, had opened a boarding-house for Westminster
                    school. Here in the course of two years (1749-50), interrupted by danger and
                    debility, he “painfully climbed into the third form;” but it was left to his
                    riper age to “acquire the beauties of the Latin and the rudiments of the Greek
                    tongue.” The continual attacks of sickness which had retarded his progress
                    induced his aunt, by medical advice, to take him to Bath; but the mineral waters
                    had no effect. He then resided for a time in the house of a physician at
                    Winchester; the physician did as little as the mineral waters; and, after a
                    further trial of Bath, he once more returned to Putney, and made a last futile
                    attempt to study at Westminster. Finally, it was concluded that he would never
                    be able to encounter the discipline of a school; and casual instructors, at
                    various times and places, were provided for him. Meanwhile his indiscriminate
                    appetite for reading had begun to fix itself more and more decidedly upon
                    history; and the list of historical works devoured by him during this period of
                    chronic ill-health is simply astonishing. It included, besides Hearne’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Ductor</hi><hi rend="italic">Historicus</hi> and the successive
                    volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Universal History,</hi> which was then in
                    course of publication, Littlebury’s <hi rend="italic">Herodotus,</hi> Spelman’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Xenophon,</hi> Gordon’s <hi rend="italic">Tacitus,</hi> an
                    anonymous translation of Procopius; “many crude lumps of Speed, Rapin, Mezeray,
                    Davila, Machiavel, Father Paul, Bower, &lt;fcc., were hastily gulped. I devoured
                    them like so many novels; and I swallowed with the same voracious appetite the
                    descriptions of India and China, of Mexico and Peru.” His first introduction to
                    the historic scenes the study of which afterwards formed the passion of his life
                    took place in 1751, when, while along with his father visiting a friend in
                    Wiltshire, he discovered in the library “a common book, the continuation of
                    Echard’s <hi rend="italic">Homan Hi story T</hi> “To me the reigns of the
                    successors of Constantine were absolutely new; and I was immersed in the passage
                    of the Goths over the Danube, when the summons of the dinner bell reluctantly
                    dragged me from my intellectual feast.” Soon afterwards his fancy kindled with
                    the first glimpses into Oriental history, the wild “barbaric” charm of which he
                    never ceased to feel. Ockley’s book on the Saracens “first opened his eyes” to
                    the striking career of Mahomet and his hordes; and with his characteristic
                    ardour of literary research, after exhausting all that could be learned in
                    English of the Arabs and Persians, the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0591-0574"/> Tartars aud Turks, he forthwith plunged into the
                    French of D’Herbelot, and the Latin of Pocock’s version of Abulfaragius,
                    sometimes understanding them, but oftener only guessing their meaning. He soon
                    learned to call to his aid the subsidiary sciences of geography and chronology,
                    and before he was quite capable of reading them had already attempted to weigh
                    in his childish balance the competing systems of Scaliger and Petavius, of
                    Marsham and Newton. At this early period he seems already to have adopted in
                    some degree the plan of study he followed in after life, aud recommended in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Étude</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> that is, of letting his subject rather than
                    his author determine his course, of suspending the perusal of a book to reflect,
                    and to compare the statements with those of other authors,—so that he often read
                    portions of many volumes while mastering one.</p>
                <p>Towards his sixteenth year he tells us “nature displayed in his favour her
                    mysterious energies,” and all his infirmities suddenly vanished. Thenceforward,
                    while never possessing or abusing the insolence of health, he could say “few
                    persons have been more exempt from real or imaginary ills.” His unexpected
                    recovery revived his father’s hopes for his education, hitherto so much
                    neglected if judged by ordinary standards; and accordingly in January 1752 he
                    was placed at Esher, Surrey, under the care of Dr Francis, the well known
                    translator of Horace. But Gibbon’s friends in a few weeks discovered that the
                    new tutor preferred the pleasures of London to the instruction of his pupils,
                    and in this perplexity decided to send him prematurely to Oxford, where he was
                    matriculated as a gentleman commoner of Magdalen College, 3d April, 1752.
                    According to his own testimony, he arrived at the university “with a stock of
                    information which might have puzzled a doctor, and a degree of ignorance of
                    which a school-boy might be ashamed:” And indeed his huge wallet of scraps stood
                    him in little stead at the trim banquets to which he was invited at Oxford,
                    while the wandering habits by which he had filled it absolutely unfitted him to
                    be a guest. He was not well grounded in any of the elementary branches, which
                    are essential to university studies, and to all success in their prosecution. It
                    was natural therefore that he should dislike the university, and as natural that
                    the university should dislike him. Many of his complaints of the system were
                    certainly just; but it maybe doubted whether any university system would have
                    been profitable to him, considering his antecedents. He complains especially of
                    his tutors, and in one case with abundant reason: but, by his own confession,
                    they might have recriminated with justice, for he indulged in gay society, and
                    kept late hours. His observations, however, on the defects of the English
                    university system, some of which have only very recently been removed, are acute
                    and well worth pondering, however little relevant to his own case. He remained
                    at Magdalen about fourteen months. “To the university of Oxford,” he says, “I
                    acknowledge no obligation; and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son as I
                    am willing to disclaim her for a mother. I spent fourteen months at Magdalen
                    College; they proved the fourteen months the most idle and unprofitable of my
                    whole life.”</p>
                <p>But thus “idle” though he may have been as a “student,” he already meditated
                    authorship. In the first long vacation—during which he, doubtless with some
                    sarcasm, says that “his taste for books began to revive ”—he contemplated a
                    treatise on the age of Sesostris, in which (and it was characteristic) his chief
                    object was to investigate not so much the events as the probable epoch of the
                    reign of that semi-mythical monarch, whom he was inclined to regard as having
                    been contemporary with Solomon. “Unprovided with original learning, unformed in
                    the habits of thinking, unskilled in the arts of composition, I resolved to
                    write a book;” but the discovery of his own weakness, he adds, was the first
                    symptom of taste. On his first return to Oxford the work was “wisely
                    relinquished,” and never afterwards resumed. The most memorable incident,
                    however, in Gibbon’s stay at Oxford w as his temporary conversion to the
                    doctrines of the church of Rome. The bold criticism of Middleton’s recently
                    (1749) published <hi rend="italic">Free Enquiry into the Miraculous Powers which
                    are supposed to have subsisted in the Christian Church,</hi> appears to have
                    given the first shock to his Protestantism, not indeed by destroying his
                    previous belief that the gift of miraculous powers had continued to subsist in
                    the church during the first four or five centuries of Christianity, but by
                    convincing him that within the same period most of the leading doctrines of
                    popery had been already introduced both in theory and in practice. At this stage
                    he was introduced by a friend (Mr Molesworth) to Bossuet’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Variations of Protestantism,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Exposition of Catholic
                    Doctrine</hi> (see Gibbon, <hi rend="italic">Decline and Fall,</hi> c. xv., note
                    79). “These works,” says he, “achieved my conversion, and I surely fell by a
                    noble hand.” In bringing about this “fall,” however, Parsons the Jesuit appears
                    to have had a considerable share; at least Lord Sheffield has recorded that on
                    the only occasion on which Gibbon talked with him on the subject he imputed the
                    change in his religious views principally to that vigorous writer, who, in his
                    opinion, had urged all the best arguments in favour of Roman Catholicism. But be
                    this as it may, he had no sooner adopted his new creed than he resolved to
                    profess it; “a momentary glow of enthusiasm” had raised him above all temporal
                    considerations, and accordingly, on June 8, 1753, he records that having
                    “privately abjured the heresies” of his childhood before a Catholic priest of
                    the name of Baker, a Jesuit, in London, he announced the same to his father in
                    an elaborate controversial epistle which his spiritual adviser much approved,
                    and which he himself afterwards described to Lord Sheffield as having been
                    “written with all the pomp, the dignity, and self-satisfaction of a martyr.”</p>
                <p>The elder Gibbon heard with indignant surprise of this act of juvenile apostasy,
                    and, indiscreetly giving vent to his wrath, precipitated the expulsion of his
                    son from Oxford, a punishment which the culprit, in after years at least, found
                    no cause to deplore. In his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> he speaks of the
                    results of his “childish revolt against the religion of his country” with
                    undisguised self-gratulation. It had delivered him for ever from the “port and
                    prejudice” of the university, and led him into the bright paths of philosophic
                    freedom. That his conversion was sincere at the time, that it marked a real if
                    but a transitory phase of genuine religious conviction, we have no reason to
                    doubt, notwithstanding the scepticism he has himself expressed. “To my present
                    feelings it seems incredible that I should ever believe that I believed in
                    transubstantiation,” he indeed declares; but his incredulous astonishment is not
                    unmixed with undoubting pride. “I could not blush that my tender mind was
                    entangled in the sophistry which had reduced the acute and manly understandings
                    of a Chillingworth or a Bayle.” Nor is the sincerity of the Catholicism he
                    professed in these boyish days in any way discredited by the fact of his
                    subsequent lack of religion. Indeed, as one of the acutest and most sympathetic
                    of his critics has remarked, the deep and settled grudge he has betrayed towards
                    every form of Christian belief, in all the writings of his maturity, may be
                    taken as evidence that he had at one time experienced in his own person at least
                    some of the painful workings of a positive faith.</p>
                <p>But little time was lost by the elder Gibbon in the formation of a new plan of
                    education for his son, and in devising some method which if possible might
                    effect the cure of his “spiritual malady.” The result of deliberation, aided by
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n592/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0592-0575"/> advice and experience of Lord Eliot, was that it
                    was almost immediately decided to fix Gibbon for some years abroad under the
                    roof of M. Pavilliard, a Calvinist minister at Lausanne. In as far as regards
                    the instructor and guide thus selected, a more fortunate choice could scarcely
                    have been made. From the testimony of his pupil, and the still more conclusive
                    evidence of his own correspondence with the father, Pavilliard seems to have
                    been a man of singular good sense, temper, and tact. At the outset, indeed,
                    there was one considerable obstacle to the free intercourse of tutor and pupil:
                    M. Pavilliard appears to have known little of English, and young Gibbon knew
                    practically nothing of French. But this difficulty was soon removed by the
                    pupil’s diligence; the very exigencies of his situation were of service to him
                    in calling forth all his powers, and he studied the language with such success
                    that at the close of his five years’ exile he declares that he “spontaneously
                    thought” in French rather than in English, and that it had become more familiar
                    to “ear, tongue, and pen.” It is well known that in after years he had doubts
                    whether he should not compose his great work ' in French; and it is certain that
                    his familiarity with that language, in spite of considerable efforts to
                    counteract its effects, tinged his style to the last.</p>
                <p>Under the judicious regulations of his new tutor a methodical, course of reading
                    was marked out, and most ardently prosecuted; the pupil’s progress was
                    proportionably rapid. With the systematic study of the Latin, and to a slight
                    extent also of the Greek classics, he conjoined that of logic in the prolix
                    system of Crousaz; and he further invigorated his reasoning powers, as well as
                    enlarged his knowledge of metaphysics and jurisprudence, by tho perusal of
                    Locke, Grotius, and Montesquieu. He also read largely, though somewhat
                    indiscriminately, in French literature, and appears to have been particularly
                    struck with Pascal’s <hi rend="italic">Provincial Letters,</hi> w hich he tells
                    us he reperused almost every year of his subsequent life with new pleasure, and
                    which he particularly mentions as having been, along with Bleterie’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Julian</hi> and Giannone’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Naples,</hi> a book which probably contributed in a special sense to form the
                    historian of the Roman empire. The comprehensive scheme of study included
                    mathematics also, in which he advanced as far as the conic sections in the
                    treatise of L’Hôpital. He assures us that his tutor did not complain of any
                    inaptitude on the pupil’s part, and that the pupil was as happily unconscious of
                    any on his own; but here he broke off. He adds, what is not quite clear from one
                    who so frankly acknowledges his limited acquaintance with the science, that he
                    had reason to congratulate himself that he knew no more. “As soon,” he says, “as
                    I understood the principles, I relinquished for ever the pursuit of the
                    mathematics; nor can I lament that I desisted before my mind was hardened by the
                    habit of rigid demonstration, so destructive of the finer feelings of moral
                    evidence, which must, however, determine the actions and opinions of our
                    lives.”</p>
                <p>Under the new influences which were brought to bear on him, he in less than two
                    years resumed his Protestantism. “He is willing,” he says, to allow M.
                    Pavilliard a “handsome share in his reconversion,” though he maintains, and no
                    doubt rightly, that it was principally due “to his own solitary reflections.” He
                    particularly congratulated himself on having discovered the “philosophical
                    argument” against transubstantiation, “that the text of Scripture which seems to
                    inculcate the real presence is attested only by a single sense—our sight, while
                    the real presence itself is disproved by three of our senses—the sight, the
                    touch, and the taste.” Before a similar mode of reasoning, all the other
                    distinctive articles of the Romish creed “disappeared like a dream”; and “after
                    a full conviction,” on Christmas day, 1754, he received the sacrament in the
                    church of Lausanne. Although, however, he adds that at this point he suspended
                    his religious inquiries, « acquiescing with implicit belief in the tenets and
                    mysteries which are adopted by the general consent of Catholics and
                    Protestants,” his readers will probably do him no great injustice if they assume
                    that even then it was rather to the negations than to the affirmations of
                    Protestantism that he most heartily assented.</p>
                <p>With all his devotion to study at Lausanne<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Journal for 1755 records that during that year, besides
                    writing and translating a great deal in Latin and French, he had read, amongst
                    other works, Cicero’s Epistolae ad Familiares, his Brutus, all his Orations, his
                    dialogues Be Amicitia and Be Senectute, Terence (twice), and Pliny’s Epistles.
                    In January 1756 he says :— “I determined to read over the Latin authors in
                    order, and read this year Virgil, Sallust, Livy, Velleius Paterculus, Valerius
                    Maximus, Tacitus, Suetonius, Quintus Curtins, Justin, Florus, Plautus, Terence,
                    and Lucretius. I also read and meditated Locke Upon the Understanding." Again in
                    January 1757 he writes:—“I began to study algebra under Μ. de Traytorrens, went
                    through the elements of algebra and geometry, and the three first books of the
                    Marquis de ΓHδpitaΓs Conic Sections. I also read Tibullus, Catullus, Propertius,
                    Horace (with Dacier’s and Torrentius’s notes), Virgil, Ovid’s Epistles, with
                    Mezi-riac’s commentary, the Ars Amandi, and the Elegies·, likewise the Augustus
                    and Tiberius of Suetonius, and a Latin translation of Dion Cassius from the
                    death of Julius Caesar to the death of Augustus. I also continued my
                    correspondence, begun last year, with Μ. Allamand of Bex, and the Professor
                    Breitinger of Zürich, and opened a new one with the Professor Gesner of
                    Gottingen. JΓ.B.—Last year and this I read St John’s Gospel, with part of
                    Xenophon’s Cyropwdia, the Iliad, and Herodotus; but, upon the whole, I rather
                    neglected my Greek.”</p></note> (he read ten or twelve hours a day), he still
                    found some time for the acquisition of some of the lighter accomplishments, such
                    as riding, dancing, drawing, and also for mingling in such society as the place
                    had to offer. In September 1755 he writes to his aunt, “I find a great many
                    agreeable people here, see them sometimes, and can say upon the whole, without
                    vanity, that, though I am the Englishman here who spends the least money, I am
                    he who is most generally liked.” Thus his “studious and sedentary life” passed
                    pleasantly enough, interrupted only at rare intervals by boyish excursions of a
                    day or a week in the neighbourhood, and by at least one memorable tour of
                    Switzerland, by Basel, Zürich, Lucerne, and Bern, made along with Pavilliard in
                    the autumn of 1755. The last eighteen months of this residence abroad saw the
                    infusion of two new elements—one of them at least of considerable
                    importance—into his life. In 1757 Voltaire came to reside at Lausanne; and
                    although he took but little notice of the young Englishman of twenty, who
                    eagerly sought and easily obtained an introduction, the establishment of the
                    theatre at Monrepos, where the brilliant versifier himself declaimed before
                    select audiences his own productions on the stage, had no small influence in
                    fortifying Gibbon’s taste for the French theatre, and in at the same time
                    abating that “idolatry for the gigantic genius of Shakespeare which is
                    inculcated from our infancy as the first duty of an Englishman.” In the same
                    year—apparently about June—he saw for the first time, and forthwith loved, the
                    beautiful, intelligent, and accomplished Mademoiselle Susan Curchod, daughter of
                    the pasteur of Crassier. That the passion which she inspired in him was tender,
                    pure, and fitted to raise to a higher level a nature which in some respects was
                    much in need of such elevation will be doubted by none but the hopelessly
                    cynical; and probably there are few readers who can peruse the paragraph in
                    which Gibbon “approaches the delicate subject of his early love” without
                    discerning in it a pathos much deeper than that of which the writer was himself
                    aware. During the remainder of his residence at Lausanne he had good reason to
                    “indulge his dream of felicity”; but on his return to England, “I soon
                    discovered that my father would not hear of this strange alliance, and that
                    without his consent I was myself destitute and helpless.</p>

                <p>After a painful struggle I yielded to my fate; I sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a
                    son; my wound was insensibly healed by time, absence, and the habits of a new
                    life.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The affair,
                    however, was not finally broken off till 1763. Mdlle. Curchod soon afterwards
                    became the wife of Necker, the famous financier; and Gibbon and the Neckeτs
                    frequently afterwards met on terms of mutual friendship and
                    esteem.</p></note></p>
                <p>In 1758 he returned with mingled joy and regret to England, and was kindly
                    received at home. But he found a stepmother there; and this apparition on his
                    father’s hearth at first rather appalled him. The cordial and gentle manners of
                    Mrs Gibbon, however, and her unremitting care for his happiness, won him from
                    his first prejudices, and gave her a permanent place in his esteem and
                    affection. He seems to have been much indulged, and to have led a very pleasant
                    life of it; he pleased himself in moderate excursions, frequented the theatre,
                    mingled, though not very often, in society; was sometimes a little extravagant,
                    and sometimes a little dissipated, but never lost the benefits of his Lausanne
                    exile: and easily settled into a sober, discreet, calculating Epicurean
                    philosopher, who sought the <hi rend="italic">summum bonum</hi> of man in
                    temperate, regulated, and elevated pleasure. The first two years after his
                    return to England he spent principally at his father’s country seat at Buriton,
                    in Hampshire, only nine months being given to the metropolis. He has left an
                    amusing account of his employments in the country, where his love of study was
                    at once inflamed by a large and unwonted command of books and checked by the
                    necessary interruptions of his otherwise happy domestic life. After breakfast
                    “he was expected,” he says, to spend an hour with Mrs Gibbon; after tea his
                    father claimed his conversation; in the midst of an interesting work he was
                    often called down to entertain idle visitors; and, worst of all, he was
                    periodically compelled to return the well-meant compliments. He mentions that he
                    dreaded the “recurrence of the full moon,” which was the period generally
                    selected for the more convenient accomplishment of such formidable
                    excursions.</p>
                <p>His father’s library, though large in comparison with that he commanded at
                    Lausanne, contained, he says, “much trash but a gradual process of
                    reconstruction transformed it at length into that “numerous and select” library
                    which was “the foundation of his works, and the best comfort of his life both at
                    home and abroad.” No sooner had he returned home than he began the work of
                    accumulation, and records that, on the receipt of his first quarter’s allowance,
                    a large share was appropriated to his literary wants. “He could never forget,”
                    he declares, “the joy with which he exchanged a bank note of twenty pounds for
                    the twenty volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> of the Academy of
                    Inscriptions,” an Academy which has been well characterized (by Sainte-Beuve) as
                    Gibbon’s intellectual fatherland. It may not be uninteresting here to note the
                    principles which guided him both now and afterwards in his literary purchases.
                    “I am not conscious,” says he, “of having ever bought a book from a motive of
                    ostentation; every volume, before it was deposited on the shelf, was either read
                    or sufficiently examined”; he also mentions that he soon adopted the tolerating
                    maxim of the elder Pliny, that no book is ever so bad as to be absolutely good
                    for nothing.</p>
                <p>In London he seems to have seen but little select society, —partly from his
                    father’s taste, “which had always preferred the highest and the lowest company,”
                    and partly from his own reserve and timidity, increased by his foreign
                    education, which had made English habits unfamiliar, and the very language in
                    some degree strange. And thus he was led to draw that interesting picture of the
                    literary recluse among the crowds of London: “While coaches were rattling
                    through Bond Street, I have passed many a solitary evening in my lodging with my
                    books. My studies were sometimes interrupted with a sigh, which I breathed
                    towards Lausanne; and on the approach of spring I withdrew without reluctance
                    from the noisy and extensive scene of crowds without company, and dissipation
                    without pleasure.” He renewed former acquaintance, however, with the “poet”
                    Mallet, and through him gained access to Lady Hervey’s circle, where a congenial
                    admiration, not to say affectation, of French manners and literature made him a
                    welcome guest. It ought to be added that in each of the twenty-five years of his
                    subsequent acquaintance with London “the prospect gradually brightened,” and his
                    social as well as his intellectual qualities secured him a wide circle of
                    friends. In one respect Mallet gave him good counsel in those early days. He
                    advised him to addict himself to an assiduous study of the more idiomatic
                    English writers, such as Swift and Addison,—with a view to unlearn his foreign
                    idiom, and recover his half-forgotten vernacular,— a task, however, which he
                    never perfectly accomplished. Much as he admired these writers, Hume and
                    Robertson were still greater favourites, as well from their subject as for their
                    style. Of his admiration of Hume’s style, of its nameless grace of simple
                    elegance, he has left us a strong expression, when he tells us that it often
                    compelled him to close the historian’s volumes with a mixed sensation of delight
                    and despair.</p>
                <p>In 1761 Gibbon, at the age of twenty-four, after many delays, and with many
                    flutterings of hope and fear, gave to the world, in French, his maiden
                    publication, an <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Étude de la Littérature,</hi>
                    which he had composed two years before. It was published partly in compliance
                    with his father’s wishes, who thought that the proof of some literary talent
                    might introduce him favourably to public notice, and secure the recommendation
                    of his friends for some appointment in connexion with the mission of the English
                    plenipotentiaries to the congress at Augsburg which was at that time in
                    contemplation. But in yielding to paternal authority, Gibbon frankly owns that
                    he “complied, like a pious son, with the wish of his own heart.”</p>
                <p>The subject of this youthful effort was suggested, its author says, by a
                    refinement of vanity—“the desire of justifying and praising the object of a
                    favourite pursuit,” namely, the study of ancient literature. Partly owing to its
                    being written in French, partly to its character, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essai</hi> excited more attention abroad than at home. Gibbon has criticized it
                    with the utmost frankness, not to say severity; but, after every abatement, it
                    is unquestionably a surprising effort for a mind so young, and contains many
                    thoughts which would not have disgraced a thinker or a scholar of much maturer
                    age. His account of its first reception and subsequent fortunes in England
                    deserves to be cited as a curious piece of literary history. “In England,” he
                    says, “it was received with cold indifference, little read, and speedily
                    forgotten. A small impression was slowly dispersed: the bookseller murmured, and
                    the author (had his feelings been more exquisite) might have wept over the
                    blunders and baldness of the English translation. The publication of my history
                    fifteen years afterwards revived the memory of my first performance, and the
                    essay was eagerly sought in the shops. But I refused the permission which Becket
                    solicited of reprinting it; the public curiosity was imperfectly satisfied by a
                    pirated copy of the booksellers of Dublin; and when a copy of the original
                    edition has been discovered in a sale, the primitive value of half-a-crown has
                    risen to the fanciful price of a guinea or thirty shillings.”<note

                    translation, now appears in the Miscellaneous Works. Villemain finds in it “peu
                    de vues, nulle originalité surtout, mais une grande passion littéraire, l’amour
                    des recherches savantes et du beau langage.” Sainte-Beuve’s criticism is almost
                    identical with Gibbon’s own; but though he finds that “La <pb

                    sentent l’historien.”</p></note></p>
                <p>Sometime before the publication of the essay, Gibbon <pb corresp="pbn9577"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0594-0577"/> had entered a new and, one might suppose, a very
                    uncongenial scene of life. In an hour of patriotic ardour he became (June 12,
                    1759) a captain in the Hampshire militia, and for more than two years (May 10,
                    1760, to December 23, 1762) l¾d a wandering life of “military servitude.”
                    Hampshire, Kent, Wiltshire, and Dorsetshire formed the successive theatres of
                    what he calls his “bloodless and inglorious campaigns.” He complains of the busy
                    idleness in which his time was spent; but, considering the circumstances, so
                    adverse to study, one is rather surprised that the military student should have
                    done so much, than that he did so little; and never probably before were so many
                    hours of literary study spent in a tent. In estimating the comparative
                    advantages and disadvantages of this wearisome period of his life, he has summed
                    up with the impartiality of a philosopher and the sagacity of a man of the
                    world. Irksome as were his employments, grievous as was the waste of time,
                    uncongenial as were his companions, solid benefits were to be set off against
                    these things: his health became robust, his knowledge of the world was enlarged,
                    he wore off some of his foreign idiom, got rid of much of his reserve; he adds—
                    and perhaps in his estimate it was the benefit to be most prized of all—“the
                    discipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a clearer notion of the
                    phalanx and the legion, and the captain of the Hampshire grenadiers (the reader
                    may smile) has not been useless to the historian of the Roman empire.”</p>
                <p>It was during this period that he read Homer and Longinus, having for the first
                    time acquired some real mastery of Greek; and after the publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai,</hi> his mind was full of projects for a new literary
                    effort. The Italian expedition of Charles VIII. of ξ ’ rance, the crusade of
                    Richard I., the wars of the barons, the lives and comparisons of Henry V. and
                    the emperor Titus, the history of the Black Prince, the life of Sir Philip
                    Sydney, that of Montrose, and finally that of Sir W. Raleigh, were all of them
                    seriously contemplated and successively rejected. By their number they show how
                    strong was the impulse to literature, and by their character, how determined the
                    bent of his mind in the direction of history; while their variety makes it
                    manifest also that he had then at least no special purpose to serve, no
                    preconceived theory to support, no particular prejudice or belief to
                    overthrow.</p>
                <p>The militia was disbanded in 1762, and Gibbon joyfully shook off his bonds; but
                    his literary projects were still to be postponed. Following his own wishes,
                    though with his father’s consent, he had early in 1760 projected a Continental
                    tour as the completion “of an English gentleman’s education.” This had been
                    interrupted by the episode of the militia; now, however, he resumed his purpose,
                    and left England in January 1763. Two years were “loosely defined as the term of
                    his absence,” which he exceeded by half a year—returning June 1765. He first
                    visited Paris, where he saw a good deal of D’Alembert, Diderot, Barthélemy,
                    Raynal, Helvétius, Baron d’Holbach, and others of that circle, and was often a
                    welcome guest in the saloons of Madame Geoffrin and Madame du Deffand.<note

                    Gibbon contain some interesting remarks by this “aveugle clairvoyante,” as
                    Voltaire calls her; but they belong to a later period (1777).</p></note>
                    Voltaire was at Geneva, Rousseau at Montmorency, and Buffon he neglected to
                    visit; but so congenial did he find the society for which his education had so
                    well prepared him, and into which some literary reputation had already preceded
                    him, that he declared, “Had I been rich and inde pendent, I should have
                    prolonged and perhaps have fixed my residence at Paris.”</p>
                <p>From France he proceeded to Switzerland, and spent nearly a year at Lausanne,
                    where many old friendships and studies were resumed, and new ones begun. His
                    reading was largely designed to enable him fully to profit by the long
                    contemplated Italian tour which began in April 1764, and lasted somewhat more
                    than a year. He has recorded one or two interesting notes on Turin, Genoa,
                    Florence, and other towns at which halt was made on his route; but Rome was the
                    great object of his pilgrimage, and the words in which he has alluded to the
                    feelings with which he approached it are such as cannot be omitted from any
                    sketch of Gibben, however brief. “My temper is not very susceptible of
                    enthusiasm, and the enthusiasm which I do not feel I have ever scorned to
                    affect. But at the distance of twenty-five years I can neither forget nor
                    express the strong emotions which agitated my mind as I first approached and
                    entered the Eternal City. After a sleepless night, I trod with a lofty step the
                    ruins of the forum; each memorable spot, where Romulus stood, or Tully spoke, or
                    Caesar fell, was at once present to my eye; and several days of intoxication
                    were lost or enjoyed before I could descend to a cool and minute investigation.”
                    Here at last his long yearning for some great theme worthy of his historic
                    genius was gratified. The first conception of the <hi rend="italic">Decline and
                    Fall</hi> arose as he lingered one evening amidst the vestiges of ancient glory.
                    “It was at Rome, on the 15th of October 1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins
                    of the Capitol, while the barefooted friars were singing vespers in the temple
                    of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first
                    started to my mind.”</p>
                <p>The five years and a half which intervened between his return from this tour, in
                    June 1765, and the death of his father, in November 1770, seem to have formed
                    the portion of his life which “he passed with the least enjoyment, and
                    remembered with the least satisfaction.” He attended every spring the meetings
                    of the militia at Southampton, and rose successively to the rank of major and
                    lieutenantcolonel commandant; but was each year “more disgusted with the inn,
                    the wine, the company, and the tiresome re petition of annual attendance and
                    daily exercise.” From his own account, however, it appears that other and deeper
                    causes produced this discontent. Sincerely attached to his home, he yet felt the
                    anomaly of his position. At thirty, still a dependant, without a settled
                    occupation, without a definite social status, he often regretted that he had not
                    “embraced the lucrative pursuits of the law or of trade, the chances of civil
                    office or India adventure, or even the fat slumbers of the church.” From the
                    emoluments of a profession he “might have derived an ample fortune, or a
                    competent income, instead of being stinted to the same narrow allowance, to be
                    increased only by an event which he sincerely deprecated.” Doubtless the secret
                    fire of a consuming, but as yet ungratified, literary ambition also troubled his
                    repose. He was still contemplating “at an awful distance” <hi rend="italic">The
                    Decline and Fall,</hi> and meantime revolved some other subjects, that seemed
                    more immediately practicable. Hesitating for some time between the revolutions
                    of Florence and those of Switzerland, he consulted M. Deyverdun, a young Swiss
                    with whom he had formed a close and intimate friendship during his first
                    residence at Lausanne, and finally decided in favour of the land which was his
                    “friend’s by birth” and “his own by adoption.” He executed the first book in
                    French; it was read (in 1767), as an anonymous production, before a literary
                    society of foreigners in London, and condemned. Gibbon sat and listened
                    unobserved to their strictures. It never got beyond that rehearsal; Hume,
                    indeed, approved of the performance, only deprecating as <pb break="no"

                    Gibbon sided with the majority.</p>
                <p>In 1767 also he joined with Μ. Deyverdun in starting a literary journal under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Mémoire» Littéraires de la Grande Bretagne.</hi> But
                    its circulation was limited, and only the second volume had appeared (1768) when
                    Deyverdun went abroad. The materials already collected for a third volume were
                    suppressed. It is interesting, however, to know that in the first volume is a
                    review by Gibbon of Lord Lyttelton’s <hi rend="italic">History of Henry
                    LL.,</hi> and that the second volume contains a contribution by Hume on
                    Walpole’s <hi rend="italic">Historic Doubts.</hi></p>
                <p>The next appearance of the historian made a deeper impression. It was the first
                    distinct print of the lion’s foot. “Ex ungue leonem” might have been justly
                    said, for he attacked, and attacked successfully, the redoubtable Warburton. Of
                    the many paradoxes in the <hi rend="italic">Divine Legation,</hi> few are more
                    extravagant than the theory that Virgil, in the sixth book of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> intended to allegorize, in the visit of his hero and
                    the Sibyl to the shades, the initiation of Aeneas, as a lawgiver, into the
                    Eleusinian mysteries. This theory Gibbon completely exploded in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Critical Observations</hi> (1770),—no very difficult task, indeed,
                    but achieved in a style, and with a profusion of learning, which called forth
                    the warmest commendations both at home and abroad. Warburton never replied; and
                    few will believe that he would not, if he had not thought silence more discreet.
                    Gibbon, however, regrets that the style of his pamphlet was too acrimonious; and
                    this regret, considering his antagonist’s slight claims to forbearance, is
                    creditable to him. “I cannot forgive myself the contemptuous treatment of a man
                    who, with all his faults, was entitled to my esteem; and I can less forgive, in
                    a personal attack, the cowardly concealment of -my name and character.”</p>
                <p>Soon after his “release from the fruitless task of the Swiss revolution” in 1768,
                    he had gradually advanced from the wish to the hope, from the hope to the
                    design, from the design to the execution of his great historical work. His
                    preparations were indeed vast. The classics, “as low as Tacitus, Pliny the
                    Younger, and Juvenal,” had been long familiar. He now “plunged into the ocean of
                    the Augustan history,” and “with pen almost always in hand,” pored over all the
                    original records, Greek and Latin,between Trajan and the last of the Western
                    Caesars. “The subsidiary rays of medals and inscriptions, of geography and
                    chronology, were thrown on their proper objects; and I applied the collections
                    of Tillemont, whose inimitable accuracy almost assumes the character of genius,
                    to fix and arrange within my reach the loose and scattered atoms of historical
                    information.” The Christian apologists and their pagan assailants; the
                    Theodosian Code, with Godefroy’s commentary; the <hi rend="italic">Annals and
                    Antiquities</hi> of Muratori, collated with “the parallel or transverse lines”
                    of Sigonius and Maffei, Pa⅛i and Baronius, were all critically studied. Still
                    following the wise maxim which he had adopted as a student, “multum legere
                    potius quam multa,” he reviewed again and again the immortal works of the French
                    and English, the Latin and Italian classics. He deepened and extended his
                    acquaintance with Greek, particularly with his favourite authors Homer and
                    Xenophon; and, to crown all, he succeeded in achieving the third perusal of
                    Blackstone’s <hi rend="italic">Commentaries.</hi></p>
                <p>The course of his study was for some time seriously interrupted by his father’s
                    illnees and death in 1770, and by the .many distractions connected with the
                    transference of his residence from Buriton to London, It was not, indeed, until
                    October 1772 that he found himself at last independent, and fairly settled in
                    his house and library, with full leisure and opportunity to set about the
                    composition of the first volume of his history. Even then it appears from his
                    own confession that he long brooded over the chaos of materials he had amassed
                    before light dawned upon it. <hi rend="italic">1</hi> 1 the commencement, he
                    says, “all was dark and doubtful ”; the limits, divisions, even the title of his
                    work were undetermined; the first chapter was composed three times, and the
                    second and third twice, before he was satisfied with his efforts. This prolonged
                    meditation on his design and its execution was ultimately well repaid by the
                    result: so methodical did his ideas become, and so readily did his materials
                    shape themselves, that, with the above exceptions, the original MS. of the
                    entire six quartos was sent uncopied to the printers. He also says that not a
                    sheet had been seen by any other eyes than those of author and printer, a
                    statement indeed which must be taken with a small deduction; or rather we must
                    suppose that a few chapters had been submitted, if not to the “eyes,” to the
                    “ears” of others; for he elsewhere tells us that he was “soon disgusted with the
                    modest practice of reading the manuscript to his friends.” Such, however, were
                    his preliminary difficulties that he confesses he was often “tempted to cast
                    away the labour of seven years”; and it was not until February 1776 that the
                    first volume was published. The success was instant, and, for a quarto, probably
                    unprecedented. The entire impression was exhausted in a few days; a second and a
                    third edition were scarcely adequate to the demand. The author might almost have
                    said, as Lord Byron after the publication of <hi rend="italic">Childe
                    Harold,</hi> that “he awoke one morning and found himself famous.” In addition
                    to public applause, he was gratified by the more select praises of the highest
                    living authorities in that branch of literature: “the candour of Dr Robertson
                    embraced his disciple;” Hume’s letter of congratulation “overpaid the labour of
                    ten years.” The latter, however, with his usual sagacity, anticipated th,e
                    objections which he saw could be urged against the famous fifteenth and
                    sixteenth chapters. “I think you have observed a very prudent temperament; but
                    it was impossible to treat the subject so as not to give grounds of suspicion
                    against you, and you may expect that a clamour will arise.”</p>
                <p>The “clamour” thus predicted was not slow to make itself heard. Within two years
                    the famous chapters had elicited what might almost be called a library of
                    controversy. The only attack, however, to which Gibbon deigned to make any reply
                    was that of Davies, who had impugned his accuracy or good faith. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Vindication</hi> appeared in February, 1779; and, as Milman
                    remarks, “this single discharge from the ponderous artillery of learning and
                    sarcasm laid prostrate the whole disorderly squadron” of his rash and feeble
                    assailants.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a very
                    full list of publications in. answer to Gibbon’s attack on Christianity
                    reference may be made to the Bibliographer s Manual, pp. 885-6 (1858). Of these
                    the earliest were Watson’s Apology (1776), Salisbury’s Strictures (1776), and
                    Chelsum’s (anonymous) Remarks (XTl⅛). In 1778 the Few Remarks by a Gentleman
                    (Francis Eyre), the Reply of Loftus, the Letters of Apthorpe, and the
                    Examination of Davies appeared. Gibbon’s Vindication (1779) called forth a Reply
                    by Davies (1779), and A Short Appeal to the Public by Francis Eyre (1779).
                    Laughton’s polemical treatise was published in 1780, and those of Milner and
                    Taylor in 1781. Chelsum returned to the attack in 1785 (A Reply to Mr Gibbon's
                    Vindication), and Sir David Dalrymple (An Inquiry into the Secondary Causes,
                    &amp;c.) made his first appearance in the controversy in 1786. Travis’s Letters
                    on 1 John V. 7 are dated 1784; and Spedalieri’s Confutations dell <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Esame del Cristianismo fatto da Gibbon was published
                    at Rome (2 vols. 4to) in the same year. It is impossible not to concur in almost
                    every point with Gibbon’s own estimate of his numerous assailants. Their crude
                    productions, for the most part, were conspicuous rather for insolence and
                    abusiveness than for logic or learning. Those of Bishop Watson and Lord Hailes
                    were the best, but simply because they contented themselves with a dispassionate
                    exposition of the general argument in favour of Christianity. The most foolish
                    and discreditable was certainly that of Davies; his unworthy attempt to
                    depreciate the great historian’s learning, and his captious, cavilling,
                    acrimonious charges of petty inaccuracies and discreditable falsification gave
                    the object of his attack an easy triumph.</p></note></p>

                <p>Two years before the publication of this first volume Gibbon was elected member
                    of parliament for Liskeard (1774). His political duties did not suspend his
                    prosecution of his history, except on one occasion, and for a little while, in
                    1779, when he undertook, on behalf of the ministry, a task which, if well
                    performed, was also, it must be added, well rewarded. The French Government had
                    issued a manifesto preparatory to a declaration of war, and Gibbon was solicited
                    by Chancellor Thurlow and Lord Weymouth, secretary of state, to answer it. In
                    compliance with this request he produced the able <hi rend="italic">Mémoire
                    Justificatif</hi> composed in French, and delivered to the courts of Europe; and
                    shortly afterwards he received a seat at the Board of Trade and
                    Plantations,—little more than a sinecure in itself, but with a very substantial
                    salary of nearly £800 per annum. His acceptance displeased some of his former
                    political associates, and he was accused of “deserting his party.” In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoir,</hi> indeed, Gibbon denies that he had ever enlisted with
                    the Whigs. A note of F ox, however, on the margin of a copy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Decline and Pall</hi> records a very distinct remembrance of the
                    historian’s previous vituperation of the ministry; within a fortnight of the
                    date of his acceptance of office, he is there alleged to have said that “there
                    was no salvation for this country until six heads of the principal persons in
                    administration were laid upon the table.” Lord Sheffield merely replies,
                    somewhat weakly it must be said, that his friend never intended the words to be
                    taken literally. More to the point is the often-quoted passage from Gibbon’s
                    letter to Deyverdun, where the frank revelation is made: “You have not forgotten
                    that I went into parliament without patriotism and without ambition, and that
                    all my views tended to the convenient and respectable place of a lord of
                    trade.”</p>
                <p>In April 1781 the second and third quartos of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> wqτq</hi> published. They excited no
                    controversy, and were comparatively little talked about—so little, indeed, as to
                    have extorted from him a half murmur about “coldness and prejudice.” The
                    volumes, however, were bought and read with silent avidity. Meanwhile public
                    events were developing in a manner that had a considerable influence upon the
                    manner in which the remaining years of the historian’s life were spent. At the
                    general election in 1780 he had lost his seat for Liskeard, but had subsequently
                    been elected for Lymington. The ministry of Lord North, however, was tottering,
                    and soon after fell; the Board of Trade was abolished by the passing of Burke’s
                    bill in 1782, and Gibbon’s salary vanished with it,—no trifle, for his
                    expenditure had been for three years on a scale somewhat disproportionate to his
                    private fortune. He did not like to depend on statesmen’s promises, which are
                    proverbially uncertain of fulfilment; he as little liked to retrench; and he was
                    wearied of parliament, where he had never given any but silent votes. Urged by
                    such considerations, he once more turned his eyes to the scene of his early
                    exile, where he might live on his decent patrimony in a style which was
                    impossible in England, and pursue unembarrassed his literary studies. He
                    therefore resolved to fix himself at Lausanne.</p>
                <p>A word only is necessary on his parliamentary career. Neither nature nor acquired
                    habits qualified him to be an orator; his late entrance on public life, his
                    natural timidity, his feeble voice, his limited command of idiomatic English,
                    and even, as he candidly confesses, his literary fame, were all obstacles to
                    success. “'After a fleeting, illusive hope, prudence condemned me to acquiesce
                    in the humble station of a mute<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In 1775 he writes to Holroyd, “I am still a mute; it is more

                    ones with terror.”</p></note>. . . . I was not armed by nature and education
                    with the intrepid energy of mind and voice—‘Vincentem strepitus et natum rebus
                    agendis.’ Timidity was fortified by pride, and even the success of my pen
                    discouraged the trial of my voice.” His repugnance to public life had been
                    strongly expressed to his father in a letter of a very early date, in which he
                    begged that the money which a seat in the House of Commons would cost might be
                    expended in a mode more agreeable to him. Gibbon was eight-and-thirty when he
                    entered parliament; and the obstacles which even at an earlier period he had not
                    had courage to encounter were hardly likely to be vanquished then. Nor had he
                    much political sagacity. He was better skilled in investigating the past than in
                    divining the future. While Burke and Fox and so many great statesmen proclaimed
                    the consequences of the collision with America, Gibbon saw nothing but colonies
                    in rebellion, and a paternal Government justly incensed. His silent votes were
                    all given on that hypothesis. In a similar manner, while he abhorred the French
                    Revolution when it came, he seems to have had no apprehension, like
                    Chesterfield, Burke, or even Horace Walpole, of its approach; nor does he appear
                    to have at all suspected that it had had anything to do with the speculations of
                    the philosophic coteries in which he had taken such delight. But while it may be
                    doubted whether his presence in Parliament was of any direct utility to the
                    legislative business of the country, there can be no question of the present
                    advantage which he derived from it in the prosecution of the great work of his
                    life,—an advantage of which he was fully conscious when he wrote: “The eight
                    sessions that I sat in parliament were a school of civil prudence, the first and
                    most essential virtue of an historian.”</p>
                <p>Having sold all his property except his library—to him equally a necessary and a
                    luxury—Gibbon repaired to Lausanne in September 1783, and took up his abode with
                    his early friend Deyverdun, now a resident there. Perfectly free from every
                    engagement but those which his own tastes imposed, easy in his circumstances,
                    commanding just as much society, and that as Belect, as he pleased, with the
                    noblest scenery spread out at his feet, no situation can be imagined more
                    favourable for the prosecution of his literary enterprise; a hermit in his study
                    as long as he chose, he found the most delightful recreation always ready for
                    him at the threshold. “In London,” says he, “I was lost in the crowd; I ranked
                    with the first families in Lausanne, and my style of prudent expense enabled me
                    to maintain a fair balance of reciprocal civilities. . . . Instead of a small
                    house between a street and a stable-yard, I began to occupy a spacious and
                    convenient mansion, connected on the north side with the city, and open on the
                    south to a beautiful and boundless horizon. A garden of four acres had been laid
                    out by the taste of M. Deyverdun; from the garden a rich scenery cf meadows and
                    vineyards descends to the Leman Lake, and the prospect far beyond the lake is
                    crowned by the stupendous mountains of Savoy.” In this enviable retreat, it is
                    no wonder that a year should have been suffered to roll round before he
                    vigorously resumed his great work,—and with many men it would never have been
                    resumed in such a paradise. We may remark in passing that the retreat was often
                    enlivened, or invaded, by friendly tourists from England, whose “frequent
                    incursions” into Switzerland our recluse seems half to lament as an evil. Among
                    his more valued visitors were M. and Mme. Necker; Mr Fox also gave him two
                    welcome “days of free and private society” in 1788. Differing as they did in
                    politics, Gibbon’s testimony to the genius and character of the great statesman
                    is highly honourable to both: “Perhaps no human being,” he says, “was ever more
                    perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood.”</p>
                <p>When once fairly reseated at his task, he proceeded in this delightful retreat
                    leisurely, yet rapidly, to its completion<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n597/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0597-0580"/>. The fourth volume, partly written in 1782, was
                    completed in June 1784; the preparation of the fifth volume occupied less than
                    two years; while the sixth and last, begun 18th May, 1786, was finished in
                    thirteen months. The feelings with which he brought his labours to a close must
                    be described in his own inimitable words: “It was on the day, or rather night,
                    of the 27th of June 1787, between the hours of eleven and twelve, that I wrote
                    the last lines of the last page in a summer house in my garden. After laying
                    down my pen, I took several turns in a <hi rend="italic">berceau</hi> or covered
                    walk of acacias, which commands a prospect of the country, the lake, and the
                    mountains. The air was temperate, the sky was serene, the silver orb of the moon
                    was reflected from the waters, and all nature was silent. I will not dissemble
                    the first emotions of joy on the recovery of my freedom, and, perhaps, the
                    establishment of my fame. But my pride was soon humbled, and a sober melancholy
                    was spread over my mind by the idea that I had taken an everlasting leave of an
                    old and agreeable companion, and that whatsoever might be the future date of my
                    <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> the life of the historian must be short and
                    precarious.”</p>
                <p>Taking the manuscript with him, Gibbon, after an absence of four years, once more
                    visited London in 1787; ani the 51st anniversary of the author’s birthday (27th
                    April 1788) witnessed the publication of the last three volumes of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Decline and Fall.</hi> They met with a quick and easy sale,
                    were very extensively read, and very liberally and deservedly praised for the
                    unflagging industry and vigour they displayed, though just exception, if only on
                    the score of good taste, was taken to the scoffing tone he continued to maintain
                    in all passages where the Christian religion was specially concerned, and much
                    fault was found with the indecency of some of his notes.<note anchored="true"

                    the second of the above complaints, surprise will probably be felt that it was

                <p>He returned to Switzerland in July 1788, cherishing vague schemes of fresh
                    literary activity; but genuine sorrow caused by the death of his friend
                    Deyverdun interfered with steady work, nor was it easy for him to fix on a new
                    subject which should be at once congenial and proportioned to his powers; while
                    the premonitory mutterings of the great thunderstorm of the French Revolution,
                    which reverberated in hollow echoes even through the quiet valleys of
                    Switzerland, further troubled his repose. For some months he found amusement in
                    the preparation of the delightful <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> (1789) from
                    which most of our knowledge of his personal history is derived; but his letters
                    to friends in England, written between 1788 and 1793 occasionally betray a
                    slight but unmistakable tone of <hi rend="italic">ennui.</hi> In April 1793 he
                    unexpectedly received tidings of the death of Lady Sheffield; and the motive of
                    friendship thus supplied combined with the pressure of public events to urge him
                    homewards. He arrived in England on the following June, and spent the summer at
                    Sheffield Place, where his presence was even more highly prized than it had ever
                    before been. Returning to London early in November, he found it necessary to
                    consult his phy3ician3 for a symptom which, neglected since 1761, had gradually
                    become complicated with hydrocele, and was now imperatively demanding surgical
                    aid; but the painful operations which had to be performed did not interfere with
                    his customary cheerfulness, nor did they prevent him from paying a Christmas
                    visit to Sheffield Place. Here, however, fever made its appearance; and a
                    removal to London (January 6, 1794) was considered imperative. Another operation
                    brought him some relief; but a relapse occurred during the night of the 15th,
                    and on the following day he peacefully breathed his last. His remains were laid
                    in the burial place of the Sheffield family, Fletching, Sussex, where an epitaph
                    by Dr Parr describes his character and work in the language at once of elegance,
                    of moderation, and of truth.</p>
                <p>The personal appearance of Gibbon as a lad of sixteen is brought before us
                    somewhat dimly in M. Pavilliard’s description of the “thin little figure, with a
                    large head, disputing and arguing, with the greatest ability, all the best
                    arguments that had ever been used in favour of popery.” What he afterwards
                    became has been made more vividly familiar by the clever silhouette prefixed to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Jl</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    r</hi><hi rend="italic">orhs</hi> (Gibbon himself, at least, we know, did not
                    regard it as a caricature), and by Sir Joshua Reynolds’s portrait so often
                    engraved. It is hardly fair perhaps to add a reference to Suard’s
                    highly-coloured description of the short Silenus-like figure, not more than 56
                    inches in height, the slim legs, the large turned-in feet, the shrill piercing
                    voice; but almost every one will remember, from Croker’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Boswell,</hi> Colman’s account of the great historian “tapping his snuff-box,
                    smirking and smiling, and rounding his periods” from that mellifluous mouth. It
                    has already been seen that Gibbon’s early ailments all left him on the approach
                    of manhood; thenceforward, “till admonished by the gout,” he could truly boast
                    of an immunity well-nigh perfect from every bodily complaint; an exceptionally
                    vigorous brain, and a stomach “almost too good,” united to bestow upon him a
                    vast capacity alike for work and for enjoyment. This capacity he never abused so
                    as to burden his conscience or depress his spirits. “The madness of superfluous
                    health I have never known.” To illustrate the intensity of the pleasure he found
                    alike in the solitude of his study and in the relaxations of genial social
                    intercourse, almost any page taken at random, either from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life</hi> or from the <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> would suffice; and many
                    incidental touches show that he was not a stranger to the delights of quiet
                    contemplation of the beauties and grandeurs of nature. His manners, if formal,
                    were refined; his conversation, when he felt himself at home, interesting and
                    unaffected; and that he was capable alike of feeling and inspiring a very
                    constant friendship there are many witnesses to show. That his temperament at
                    the same time was frigid and comparatively passionless cannot be denied; but
                    neither ought this to be imputed to him as a fault; hostile criticisms upon the
                    grief for a father’s death, that “was soothed by the conscious satisfaction that
                    I had discharged all the duties of filial piety,” seem somewhat out of place.
                    His most ardent admirers, however, are constrained to admit that he was
                    deficient in large-hearted benevolence; that he was destitute of any “enthusiasm
                    of humanity”; and that so far as every sort of religious yearning or aspiration
                    is concerned, his poverty was almost unique. Gibbon was such a man as Horace
                    might have been, had the Roman Epicurean been fonder of hard intellectual work,
                    and less prone than he was to the indulgence of emotion.</p>
                <p>Of Gibbon’s mental qualities it is interesting to read the estimate formed and
                    recorded by himself on his twentysixth birthday [May 8th, N.S., 1762]: “Wit I
                    have none. My imagination is rather strong than pleasing. My memory both
                    capacious and retentive. The shining qualities of my understanding are
                    extensiveness and penetration; but I want both quickness and exactness.”
                    Twenty-six years afterwards, he wrote on the same subject in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs :—</hi> “The original soil has been highly improved by
                    cultivation; but it may be questioned whether some flowers of fancy, some
                    grateful errors, have not been eradicated with the weeds of prejudice.” No
                    student of <hi rend="italic">The Decline and Poll</hi> will accuse its author of
                    immodesty or vanity in these selfappreciations, but will rather be surprised
                    that he should have so considerably underestimated both his endowments <pb

                    varied ability displayed in that truly immortal work it would be almost
                    impossible to speak in language of exaggerated praise,—the grandeur and vastness
                    of conception, the artistic grouping, the masterly fulness and accuracy of
                    detail, the richness and vividness of description, the coruscating liveliness,
                    the polished sarcasm, the pungent wit. The history of Rome is, for the many
                    centuries which Gibbon treats, the history of the world; and it is nothing less
                    than astonishing that he should have been able to work with so much ease the
                    vast and incongruous materials into such a unity of design. It is the amplest
                    historic canvas ever spread, the largest historic painting ever executed by a
                    single hand; and only a comprehensive and orderly intellect of the highest rank
                    could have grappled as Gibbon has done with the task of blending that vast array
                    of nations, in all their varieties of costume, habit, language, and religion,
                    into one picturesque and harmonious whole. If Gibbon had ever been conscious of
                    any inexactitude in his mental habit, it was a defect which he very early and
                    very successfully remedied. No man could declare more honestly than he that
                    “curiosity as well as duty had led him carefully to examine all the original
                    documents that could illustrate the subject which he had undertaken to treat.”
                    With incredible labour he was able to bring at last to his great life-work a
                    mind capable equally of ascending to the most comprehensive, and of descending
                    to the most minute surveys; of appreciating the beautiful and sublime in classic
                    literature, and yet of delighting in the verbal criticism, the tedious
                    collation, and dry antiquarian research by which the text is established or
                    illustrated; of celebrating the more imposing events of history with congenial
                    pomp of description, and of investigating with the dullest plodder’s patience
                    and perseverance the origin of nations, the emigrations of obscure tribes, and
                    the unpromising yet instructive problems which ethnology presents. In his pages
                    the widest deductions of historic philosophy alternate with attempts to fix the
                    true reading of an obscure passage or a minute point of chronology or geography.
                    It may even be said that in these last investigations he took almost as much
                    delight as in depicting the grander scenes of history, and surrendered himself
                    as absolutely for the time to the early migrations of the Goths and Scythians as
                    to the campaigns of Belisarius or the conquests of the Saracens. Never has
                    historian evinced greater logical sagacity in making comparatively obscure
                    details yield important inferences, or held with firmer hand the balance in the
                    case of conflicting probabilities; by no one has sounder judgment or greater
                    selfcontrol been, on the whole, more uniformly exhibited in cases where it is so
                    easy for learned enthusiasm to run into fanciful hypotheses.</p>
                <p>While thus entitled to great and manifold praise, <hi rend="italic">The Decline
                    and Fall</hi> has not been, and can never be, exempt from a certain measure of
                    just censure. Even when the occasional Gallicisms and grammatical absurdities
                    pointed out by the industry of critics have been willingly overlooked, there yet
                    remains something to be said on the defects of its style. Precise, energetic,
                    massive it is: splendid, when the pictorial demands of the narrative require it,
                    as that of Livy; and sometimes, where profound reflections are to be concisely
                    expressed, as sententious and graphic as that of Tacitus. But with all its great
                    merits it is too often formal and inflexible, and is apt to pall on the ear by
                    the too frequent recurrence of the same cadence at equal intervals, and the too
                    unsparing use of antithesis. It is not veined marble, but an exquisite
                    tesselation; not the fluent naturally-winding stream, but a stately aqueduct,
                    faced with stone, adorned with wooded embankments, or flowing over noble arches,
                    but an aqueduct still. It is a just criticism of Sir James Mackintosh that
                    probably no great writer ever derived less benefit from his professed models.
                    Pascal, Voltaire, Hume, were his delight; and he acknowledges, as so
                    unsuccessful a pupil well might, that he often closed the pages of the last with
                    a feeling of despair. Addison and Swift he read for the very purpose of
                    improving his acquaintance with idiomatic English, yet, as the above critic
                    remarks, “with so little success, that in the very act of characterizing these
                    writers, he has deviated not a little from that beautiful simplicity which is
                    their peculiar distinction.”</p>
                <p>In a work of such extent it is a venial fault that the workmanship should not in
                    all parts be equally perfect; “aliquando bonus dormitat.” That Gibbon has
                    sometimes failed in that lucidity of statement which is one of his very
                    strongest characteristics has often been successfully pointed out; and special
                    reference may be made to the 59th chapter, where he treats of the crusades. In
                    this instance by “a brief parallel” he has sought to save himself “the
                    repetition of a tedious narrative,” but has only succeeded in presenting a
                    superficial sketch that cannot be otherwise characterized than as confused and
                    badly written. Nor has his penetration enabled him in all cases to reach the
                    true significance of some of the grander facts which, in order to the adequate
                    discharge of his task, it was of the highest importance that he should have
                    rightly understood. Here it is not necessary to adduce any minor instances, when
                    it can be shown that he is out of harmony with the truth, or at least with the
                    truth as apprehended by the 19th century, in a matter so fundamental as his
                    conception of that empire which declined and fell, and of that Christianity
                    which, as he rightly supposes, contributed to its overthrow.</p>
                <p>In Mirabeau’s correspondence there occurs a letter to Sir Samuel Romilly
                    containing the following criticism :— “I have never been able to read the work
                    of Μ. Gibbon without being astounded that it should ever have been written in
                    English; or without being tempted to turn to the author and say, ‘You an
                    Englishman? No, indeed! That admiration for an empire of more than two hundred
                    millions of men, where not one had the right to call himself free; that
                    effeminate philosophy which has more praise for luxury and pleasures than for
                    all the virtues; that style always elegant and never energetic, reveal at the
                    most the elector of Hanover’s slave.’ ’ '<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Sainte-Beuve, Causeries, viii. 460.</p></note> Here
                    Mirabeau speaks in his own language what every one who in the least values the
                    characteristic features of modern political life must, however inarticulately,
                    have often felt. Gibbon’s enthusiasm for the empire of Trajan and the Antonines—
                    that “solid fabric of human greatness”—is undisguised and perfectly sincere; to
                    his thinking, if the earth ever enjoyed a golden age, it was then. The world was
                    happy because it was under a government which it could never think of
                    questioning or resisting,—happy because for once it had got rid of all
                    unavailing enthusiasms, whether political or religious. Whether it was happy,
                    and whether any happiness it really possessed was not rather in spite of than
                    because of the prevalent political and religious indifference, are questions
                    wlιich not many historians will care to answer as Gibbon did. It is manifest,
                    however, that to him, thinking of the Roman empire as he did. it was well nigh
                    impossible to be just to Christianity. He could never forgive a religion which,
                    in his opinion, had overthrown “the solid fabric of human greatness,” and given
                    to the world the sorry sight of bare-footed friars chanting psalms on the spot
                    where once had been the august worship in which everybody took part and
                    positively no one believed. This explains why one who can treat each and all of
                    the ethnic religions with the cold impartiality of a Chinese literatus<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Il a du lettré chinois dans

                <p>is uuable when Christianity comes to be discussed to conceal his heartfelt
                    dislike. Comparing “superstition” with “superstition,” virtue with virtue, vice
                    with vice, Gibbon had formed a deliberate preference for the religion and ethics
                    of ancient Rome. Philosophical students of history, even though they may feel
                    themselves unable to subscribe the Athanasian creed, may now be said to be
                    almost unanimous, however, in finding that the phenomenon called Christianity
                    did mean for mankind a higher conception of truth and a nobler conception of
                    duty.</p>
                <p>Upon the famous fifteenth and sixteenth chapters it is not necessary to dwell,
                    because at this time of day no Christian apologist dreams of denying the
                    substantial truth of any of the more important allegations of Gibbon. Christians
                    may complain of the suppression of some circumstances which might influence the
                    general result; and they must remonstrate against the unfair construction of
                    their case. But they no longer refuse to hear any reasonable evidence tending to
                    show that persecution was less severe than had once been believed; and they have
                    slowly learned that they can afford to concede the validity of all the secondary
                    causes assigned by Gibbon, and even of others still more discreditable. The fact
                    is, as the historian himself has again and again admitted, that his account of
                    the secondary • causes which contributed to the progress and establishment of
                    Christianity leaves the question as to the natural or supernatural origin of
                    Christianity practically untouched; that question still continues to be
                    agitated, but the battle is fought on a new field and with other weapons than
                    those selected by Gibbon.</p>
                <p>Of the original quarto edition of The Decline and Fall, vol. i. appeared, as has
                    already been stated, in 1776, vols. ii. and iii. in 1781, and vols, iv -vi.
                    (inscribed to Lord North) in 1788. In later editions vol. i. was considerably
                    altered by the author; the others hardly at all. The number of modem reprints
                    has been very considerable; but the most important and valuable English edition
                    is that of Milman (1839 and 1845), still more recently enriched under the
                    editorship of Dr W. Smith (8 vols. 8vo, 1854 and 1872). As a curiosity of
                    literature Bowdler ’ s edition, “adapted to the use of families and young
                    persons” by the expurgation of “the indecent expressions and all allusions of an
                    improper tendency” (5 vols. 8vo, 1825), may be specially noticed. The French
                    translation of Le Clerc de Septchênes, continued by Démeunier, Boπlard, and
                    Cantwell (1788-1795), has been frequently reprinted in France. It seems to be
                    certain that the portion usually attributed to Septchênes was, in part at least,
                    the work of his distinguished pupil, Louis XVI, A new edition of the complete
                    translation, prefaced by a letter on Gibbon’s life and character, from the pen
                    of Suard, and annotated by Guizot, appeared in 1812 (and again in 1828). There
                    are at least two German translations of The Decline and Fall, one by Wenck,
                    Schreiter, and Beck (1805-1807), and a second by Sporschil (1862). The Italian
                    translation (alluded to by Gibbon himself) was, along with Spedalieri’s
                    Confutazione, reprinted at Milan in 1823. Gibbon’s Miscellaneous Works, with
                    Memoirs of his Life and Writings, composed by himself; illustrated from his
                    letters, with occasional Notes and Narrative, published by Lord Sheffield in two
                    volumes in 1796, has been often reprinted. The new edition iu five volumes
                    (1814) contained some previously unpublished matter, and in particular the
                    fragment on the revolutions of Switzerland. A French translation of the
                    Miscellaneous Works by Marigné appeared at Paris in 1798. There is also a German
                    translation (Leipsic, 1801). It may be added that a special translation of the
                    chapter on Roman Law (Gibbon's historische Uebersicht des Römischen Hechts') was
                    published by Hugo at Gottingen in 1839, and has frequently been used as a
                    text-book in German universities. <hi rend="smallcaps">(∏. ro.-</hi> J. 8.
