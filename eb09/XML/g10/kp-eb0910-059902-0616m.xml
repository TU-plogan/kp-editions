                    (1613-1648), a prominent member of the presbyterian party in the Westminster
                    Assembly, was born at Kirkcaldy, where his father was parish minister, on the
                    21st of January 1613, and entered the university of St Andrews as a “presbytery
                    bursar” in 1629. On the completion of a brilliant student career, he became
                    domestic chaplain to Lord Kenmure, and afterwards to the earl of Cassilis, his
                    conscience not permitting him to accept the episcopal ordination which was at
                    that time in Scotland an indispensable condition of induction to a parish. While
                    with the earl of Cassilis he wrote his first work, <hi rend="italic">A Dispute

                    which, opportunely published (but without the author’s name) in the summer of
                    1637, attracted considerable attention, and within a few months had been found
                    by the privy council to be so damaging that by their orders all available copies
                    were called in and burnt. In April 1638, soon after the authority of the bishops
                    had been set aside by the nation, Gillespie was ordained minister of Wemyss
                    (Fife) by the presbytery of Kirkcaldy, and in the same year was a member of the
                    famous Glasgow Assembly, before which he preached a sermon so pronounced against
                    royal interference in matters ecclesiastical as to call for some remonstrance on
                    the part of Argyll, the Lord High Commissioner. In 1642 Gillespie was translated
                    to Edinburgh; but the brief remainder of his life was chiefly spent in the
                    conduct of public business in London. Already, in 1640, he had accompanied the
                    commissioners of the peace to England as one of their chaplains; and in 1643 he
                    was appointed by the Scottish church one of the four commissioners to the
                    Westminster Assembly. Here he took a prominent part in almost all the protracted
                    discussions on church government, discipline, and worship, supporting
                    Presbyterianism by numerous controversial writings, as well as by .an unusual
                    fluency and readiness in debate. On the Erastian question, in particular,
                    besides a series of vigorous pamphlets against Coleman <hi rend="italic">(A
                    Brotherly Examination of some Passages in Mr Colemaujs late printed Sermon,</hi>

                    <hi rend="italic">Aaron’s Rod Blossoming, or the Divine Ordinance of
                    Church-government vindicated,</hi> which is deservedly regarded as a really able
                    statement of the case for an exclusive spiritual jurisdiction of the Church.
                    Shortly after his return to Scotland, Gillespie was elected moderator of the
                    Assembly (1648 <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi>; but the laborious duties of that
                    office (the court continued to sit from 12th July to the 12th of August) told
                    fatally on a constitution which, at no time very vigorous, had of late years
                    been much overtaxed, and, after many weeks of great weakness, he died at
                    Kirkcaldy on the 17th of December 1648. In acknowledgment of his great public
                    services, a sum of &lt;£1000 Scots was voted, though destined never to be paid,
                    to his widow and children by the committee of estates. A simple tombstone, which
                    had been erected to his memory in Kirkcaldy parish church, was in 1661 publicly
                    broken at the cross by the hand of the common hangman, but was restored in 1746.
                    Among the other works of Gillespie may be mentioned the <hi rend="italic"
