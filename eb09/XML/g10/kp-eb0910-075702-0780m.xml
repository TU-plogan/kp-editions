                    >Anasfuligula</hi> of Linnaeus and <hi rend="italic">Fuligula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cristata</hi> of most modern ornithologists—is, however, usually
                    called by English writers the Tufted Duck, while “Golden-eye” is reserved in
                    books for the <hi rend="italic">A. clangula</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A.
                    glaucion</hi> of Linnaeus, who did not know that the birds he so named were but
                    examples of the same species, differing only in age or sex; and to this day many
                    fowlers perpetuate a like mistake, deeming the “Morillon,” which is the female
                    or young male, distinct from the “Goldeneye” or “Rattlewings” (as from its noisy
                    flight they oftener call it), which is the adult male. This species belongs to
                    the group known as Diving Ducks, and is the type of the very well-marked genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Clangula</hi> of later systematists, which, among other
                    differences, has the posterior end of the sternum prolonged <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n781/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0781-0758"/> so as to extend considerably over, and, we may
                    not unreasonably suppose, protect the belly—a character possessed in a still
                    greater degree by the Mergansers <hi rend="italic">{Herginee),</hi> while the
                    male3 also exhibit in the extraordinarily developed bony labyrinth of their
                    trachea and its midway enlargement another resemblance to the members of the
                    same Subfamily. The Golden-eye, <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >glaucion</hi> of modern writers, has its home in the northern parts of both
                    hemispheres, whence in winter it migrates southward; but as it is one of the
                    Ducks that constantly resorts to hollow trees for the purpose of breeding it
                    hardly transcends the limit of the Arctic forests on either continent. So well
                    known is this habit to the people of the northern districts of Scandinavia, that
                    they very commonly devise artificial nest-boxes for its accommodation and their
                    own profit. Hollow logs of wood are prepared, the top and bottom closed, and a
                    hole cut in the side. These are affixed to the trunks of living trees in
                    suitable places, at a convenient distance from the ground, and, being readily
                    occupied by the birds in the breedingseason, are regularly robbed, first of the
                    numerous eggs, and finally of the down they contain, by those who have set them
                    up.</p>
                <p>The adult male Golden-eye is a very beautiful bird, mostly black above, but with
                    the head, which is slightly crested, reflecting rich green lights, a large oval
                    white patch under each eye, and elongated white scapulars; the lower parte are
                    wholly white and the feet bright orange, except the webs, which are dusky. In
                    the female and young male, dark brown replaces the black, the cheek-spots are
                    indistinct, and the elongated white scapulars wanting. The Golden-eye of North
                    America has been by some authors deemed to differ, and has been named <hi
                    rend="italic">C. americana,</hi> but apparently on insufficient grounds. That
                    country, however, has, in common with Iceland, a very distinct species, <hi
                    rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">islandica,</hi> often called Barrow’s
                    Duck, which is but a rare straggler to the continent of Europe, and never, so
                    far as known, to Britain. In Iceland and Greenland it is the only habitual
                    representative of the genus, and it occurs from thence to the Rocky Mountains.
                    In breeding-habits it differs from the commoner species, not placing its eggs in
                    tree-holes; but how far this difference is voluntary may be doubted, for in the
                    countries it frequents trees are wanting. It is a larger and stouter bird, and
                    in the male the white cheek-patche3 take a more crescentic form, while the head
                    is glossed with purple rather than green, and the white scapulars are not
                    elongated. The New World also possesses a third and still more beautiful species
                    of the genus in <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">αlbeοla,</hi> known
                    in books as the Buffel-headed Duck, and to American fowlers as the “Spirit-Duck”
                    and “Butter-ball” —the former name being applied from its rapidity in diving,
                    and the latter from its exceeding fatness in autumn. This is of small size, but
                    the lustre of the feathers in the male Î3 most brilliant, exhibiting a deep
                    plum-coloured gloss on the head. It breeds in trees, and is supposed to have
                    occurred more than once in Britain. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
