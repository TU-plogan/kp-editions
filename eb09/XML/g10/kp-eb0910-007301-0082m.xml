                    (1749-1833), was born at Bayonne, 8th September 1749. After receiving a good
                    education under the direction of a relation who was a curé, he came to Paris,
                    where he obtained introductions to the most distinguished writers of the time,
                    and became a contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedic</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Méthodique</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Mercure de France.</hi>
                    He gained considerable reputation by an éloge on L’Hôpital in 1778, and was
                    afterwards three times crowned by the Academy for éloges on Suger, Montausier,
                    and Fontenelle. In 1785 he was named professor of history at the Athenaeum,
                    where his lectures enjoyed an equal popularity with those of Laharpe on
                    literature. Being chosen a deputy to the states-general in 1789, he rendered
                    important service to the popular cause by his nafrative of the proceedings of
                    the Assembly contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Paris.</hi>
                    Possessing strongly optimist views, a mild and irresolute character, and
                    indefinite and changeable convictions, he played a somewhat undignified part in
                    the great political events of the time, and became a pliant tool in carrying out
                    the designs of others. He succeeded Danton as minister of justice in 1792, and
                    in this capacity had entrusted to him what he called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >commission</hi><hi rend="italic">affreuse</hi> of communicating to Louis XVI.
                    his sentence of death. In 1793 he became minister of the interior, and during
                    the Reign of Terror he was imprisoned, but he received his liberty after the
                    revolution of the 9th Thermidor, and was named minister of public instruction.
                    In 1798 he was appointed ambassador to Naples, and in the following year he
                    became a member of the Council of the Ancients. After the revolution of the 18th
                    Brumaire, he was chosen a senator by Napoleon and created a count. During the
                    Hundred Days lie was a member of the chamber of representatives, and strongly
                    opposed the recall ©f the Bourbons. In 1803 he was chosen a member of the
                    Institute of France, but after the restoration of Louis XVIII. his name was, in
                    1816, deleted from the list of members. After the revolution of 1830 he was
                    named a member of the new Academy of Moral and Political Science. He died at
                    Ustaritz near Bayonne, April 25, 1853. His writings are characterized by
                    elegance, grace, and variety of style, and by the highest kind of rhetorical
                    eloquence; but his grasp of his subject is superficial, and as his criticisms
                    have no root in fixed and philosophical principles they are not unfrequently
                    whimsical and inconsistent. He must not be confounded with his elder brother
                    Dominique (1735-1799), who was also a deputy to the states-general.</p>
