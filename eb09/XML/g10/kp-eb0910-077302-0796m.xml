                    Abdallah. For his efficient services in this business he was rewarded with a
                    pension and a grant out of the conquered territory (1492). When, in consequence
                    of the advance of Charles VIII. into Italy, a Spanish expedition was decided
                    upon in 149o, Gonzalo was selected for the chief command; and although at
                    Seminara near Reggie, through the interference of the friendly Ferdinand of
                    Naples, he lost the battle (it was the only occasion on which he ever was
                    defeated), he gained in reputation both for prudence and for bravery. In spite
                    of his subsequent successes in Lower Calabria, the campaign of this year closed
                    with indecisive results; but in the opening of the following season, he still
                    further increased his fame by his brilliant surprise and capture of Laino, and
                    by his junction with the Neapolitan forces before Atelia, after an arduous march
                    through hostile territory. It is most commonly, and with most probability, said
                    to have been on this occasion that he received the honourable title of El Gran
                    Capitan, by which the Spaniards still delight to designate him. The conquest of
                    Calabria having been thus rapidly achieved, he, at the pope’s invitation,
                    proceeded to clear Ostia of the French garrison by which it had been held, and
                    shortly afterwards entered Rome itself, where he was greeted by the populace as
                    “deliverer of the city.” The object of his expedition, the total expulsion of
                    the French from Neapolitan territory, having been fully attained, he, in August
                    1498, returned to Spain, where he was received with the utmost enthusiasm by all
                    classes, the king publicly declaring that the reduction of Naples, and the
                    humiliation inflicted on the French, reflected more lustre on his crown than the
                    conquest of Granada. After having, early in 1500, efficiently cooperated with
                    Tendilla in putting down the Moorish insurrection in the Alpujarras, Gonzalo, in
                    May of the same year, took command of an armada designed to operate on the coast
                    of Sicily and in the Levant, and generally to uphold the influence of Spain. In
                    conjunction with the Venetian admiral he stormed St George in Cephalonia, in
                    January 1501; and soon afterwards returning to Sicily, commenced operations
                    against Frederick in accordance with the treaty concluded between France and
                    Spain for the partition of Naples. The whole of Calabria was occupied in less
                    than a month, with the exception of Tarento, which did not surrender until March
                    1502. On the outbreak of hostilities between France and Spain in July of the
                    same year, Gonzalo was compelled to fall back upon Barletta, whence, after
                    having sustained a memorable siege of nearly ten months, he sallied in April
                    1503, and coming upon the French troops at Cerignola, inflicted on thema
                    disastrous defeat, which at once made him master of the city of Naples and of
                    the greater part of the kingdom. A subsequent victory at the bridge of
                    Garigliano (29th December 1503) gave him Gaeta, and terminated the war. For more
                    than three years he continued to act with popularity and efficiency at Naples as
                    Ferdinand’s viceroy; but the jealousy and distrust of that somewhat
                    narrow-minded monarch led to his recall in 1507, and to his subsequent
                    retirement from court shortly afterwards. The remainder of his days were passed
                    on his estate at Loja, where, in the midst of preparations for a voyage to
                    Flanders, he was seized with a fever, of which he died, 2d December 1515.</p>
                <p>The life of ‘ ‘ the great captain” has been rather a favourite subject with
