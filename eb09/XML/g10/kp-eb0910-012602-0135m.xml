                    countries where they occur, which has led to their being classed with toads and
                    snakes, is no doubt to be attributed. Their bite was supposed to be venomous,
                    and their saliva to produce painful cutaneous eruptions; even their touch was
                    thought sufficient to convey a dangerous taint. It is needless to say that in
                    this instance the popular mind was misled by appearances. The geckoes are not
                    only harmless, but are exceedingly useful creatures, feeding on insects and
                    worms, which, owing to the great width of their oesophagus, they are enabled to
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n136/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0136-0127"/> swallow whole, and in pursuit of which they do
                    not hesitate to enter human dwellings, where they are often killed on suspicion.
                    The structure of the toes in those lizards forms their most characteristic
                    anatomical feature. These organs are flattened out into broad discs, and are
                    furnished with transverse lamellar plates, by means of which the geckoes are
                    enabled to run with ease on the smoothest surface, and to imitate the fly in
                    remaining suspended on ceilings or on the under surfaces of leaves. Most of the
                    species have nails to their toes, and these in their sharpness and retractility
                    bear considerable resemblance to the claws of feline animals. They are nocturnal
                    in their habits; but when not exposed to the hot sunshine they are able to
                    pursue their prey by day. They hibernate; and two fatty masses in front of the
                    pubis are supposed to furnish the means of nourishment during this period. Many
                    of the species possess to a limited extent the chameleon faculty of changing
                    colour, while their colouring generally may be regarded as protective; a few
                    Indian forms are said to become luminous in the dark. The geckoes form an
                    extensive family, including 60 genera and 200 species, found throughout the
                    warmer regions of the earth, two only being inhabitants of Europe, and even
                    these occur also in the north of Africa. Unlike most lizards, they are found in
                    the remotest oceanic islands, a fact which leads Mr Wallace <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Geographical Distribution of Animals)</hi> to suppose that they possess
                    exceptional means of distribution.</p>
