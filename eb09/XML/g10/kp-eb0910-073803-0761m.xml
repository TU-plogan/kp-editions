                    periodical, “The Star,” and wrote several pieces including a tragedy, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Brigands.</hi> Having completed his course at Niejin, he went
                    in 1829 to St Petersburg, where he tried the stage but failed. Next year he
                    obtained a clerkship in the department of appanages, but he soon gave it up. Tn
                    literature, however, he found his true vocation. In 1829 he published
                    anonymously a poem called <hi rend="italic">Italy,</hi> and, under the pseudonym
                    of V. Alof, an idyll, <hi rend="italic">Hans Kuchel Garten,</hi> which he had
                    written while still at Niejin. The idyll was so ridiculed by a reviewer that its
                    author bought up all the copies he could secure, and burnt them in a room which
                    he hired for the purpose at an iun. Gogol then fell back upon South Russian
                    popular literature, and especially the tales of Cossackdom on which his boyish
                    fancy had been nursed, his father having occupied the post of “regimental
                    secretary,” one of the honorary officials in the Zaporogian Cossack forces. In
                    1830 he published in a periodical the first of the stories which appeared next
                    year under the title of <hi rend="italic">Evenings in a Farm near Dikanka: by
                    Rudy Ranko.</hi> This work, containing a series of attractive pictures of that
                    Little-Russian life which lends itself to romance more readily than does the
                    monotony of “Great-Russian” existence, immediately obtained a great success,—
                    its light and colour, its freshness and originality, being hailed with
                    enthusiasm by the principal writers of the day in Russia. Whereupon Gogol
                    planned, not only a history of Little-Russia, but also one of the Middle Ages,
                    to be completed in eight or nine volumes. This plan he did not carry out, though
                    it led to his being appointed to a professorship in the university of St
                    Petersburg, a post in which he met with small success, and which he resigned in
                    1835. Meanwhile he had published his <hi rend="italic">Arabesques,</hi> a
                    collection of essays and stories; his <hi rend="italic">Taras Bulba,</hi> the
                    chief of the <hi rend="italic">Cossack Tales</hi> translated into English by
                    George Tolstoy ∙, and a number of novelettes, which mark his transition from the
                    romantic to the realistic school of fiction, such as the admirable sketch of the
                    tranquil life led iu a quiet country house by two kindly specimens of <hi
                    rend="italic">Old-world Gentlefolks,</hi> or the description of the petty
                    miseries endured by an ill-paid clerk in a Government office, the great object
                    of whose life is to secure the “cloak” from which his story takes its name. To
                    the same period belongs his celebrated comedy, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Revizor,</hi> or Government Inspector. His aim in writing it was to drag into
                    light “all that was bad in Russia,” and to hold it up to contempt. And he
                    succeeded in rendering contemptible and ludicrous the official life of Russia,
                    the corruption universally prevailing throughout the civil service, the
                    alternate arrogance and servility of men in office. The plot of the comedy is
                    very simple. A traveller who arrives with an empty purse at a provincial town is
                    taken for an <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n762/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0762-0739"/> inspector whose arrival is awaited with fear, and
                    he receives all the attentions and bribes which are meant to propitiate the
                    dreaded investigator of abuses. The play appeared on the stage in the spring of
                    1836, and achieved a full success, in spite of the opposition attempted by the
                    official classes whose malpractices it exposed. The aim which Gogol had in view
                    when writing the <hi rend="italic">Revizor</hi> he afterwards fully attained in
                    his great novel, <hi rend="italic">Mertvuiya Dushi,</hi> or Dead Souls, the
                    first part of which appeared in 1842. The hero of the story is an adventurer who
                    goes about Russia making fictitious purchases of “dead souls,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> of serfs who have died since the last census, with the view of
                    pledging his imaginary property to Government. But his adventures are merely an
                    excuse for drawing a series of pictures, of an unfavourable kind, of Russian
                    provincial life, and of introducing on the scene a number of types of Russian
                    society. Of the force and truth with which these delineations are executed the
                    universal consent of Russian critics in their favour may be taken as a measure.
                    From the French version of the story a general idea of its merits may be formed,
                    and some knowledge of its plot and its principal characters may be gathered from
                    the English adaptation published in 1854, as an original work, under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Home Life in Russia.</hi> But no one seems to be able fully
                    to appreciate Gogol’s merits as a humorist, who is not intimate with the
                    language in which he wrote as well as with the society which he depicted. In
                    1836 Gogol for the first time went abroad. Subsequently he spent a considerable
                    amount of time out of Russia, chiefly in Italy, where much of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Dead Souls</hi> was written. His residence there, especially at
                    Rome, made a deep impression on his mind, which, during his later years, turned
                    towards mysticism. The last works which he published, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confession</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Correspondence ιvith Friends,</hi> offer
                    a painful contrast to the light, bright, vigorous, realistic, humorous writings
                    which had gained and have retained for him his immense popularity in his native
                    land. Asceticism and mystical exaltation had told upon his nervous system, and
                    its feeble condition showed itself in his literary compositions. In 1848 he made
                    a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and on his return settled down at Moscow, where he
                    died, March 3, 1852, not having quite completed his forty-third year.</p>
