                    (1728-1774), one of the most pleasing English writers of the 18th century. He
                    was of a Protestant and Saxon family which had been long settled in Ireland, and
                    which had, like most other Protestant and Saxon families, been, in troubled
                    times, harassed and put in fear by the native population. His father, Charles
                    Goldsmith, studied in the reign of Queen Anne at the diocesan school of Elphin,
                    became attached to the daughter of the schoolmaster, married her, took orders,
                    and settled at a place called Pallas, in the county of Longford. There he with
                    difficulty supported his wife and children on what he could earn, partly as a
                    curate and partly as a farmer.</p>
                <p>At Pallas Oliver Goldsmith was born in November 1728. That spot was then, for all
                    practical purposes, almost as remote from the busy and splendid capital in which
                    his later years were passed as any clearing in Upper Canada or any sheep walk in
                    Australasia now is. Even at this day those enthusiasts who venture to make a
                    pilgrimage to the birthplace of the poet are forced to perform the latter part
                    of their journey on foot. The hamlet lies far from any high road, on a dreary
                    plain which, in wet weather, is often a lake. The lanes would break any jaunting
                    car to pieces; and there are ruts and sloughs through which the most strongly
                    built wheels cannot be dragged.</p>
                <p>While Oliver was still a child his father was presented to a living worth about
                    .£200 a year, in the county of West Meath. The family accordingly quitted their
                    cottage in the wilderness for a spacious house on a frequented road, near the
                    village of Lissoy. Here the boy was taught his letters by a maid servant, and
                    was sent in his seventh year to a village school kept by an old quartermaster on
                    half-pay, who professed to teach nothing but reading, writing, and arithmetic,
                    but who had an inexhaustible fund of stories about ghosts, banshees, and
                    fairies, about the great Rap-paree chiefs, Baldearg O’Donnell and galloping
                    Hogan, and about the exploits of Peterborough and Stanhope, the surprise of
                    Monjuich, and the glorious disaster of Brihuega. This man must have been of the
                    Protestant religion; but he was of the aboriginal race, and not only spoke the
                    Irish language, but could pour forth unpremeditated Irish verses. Oliver early
                    became, and through life continued to be, a passionate admirer of the Irish
                    music, and especially of the compositions of Carolan, some of the last notes of
                    whose harp he heard. It ought to be added that Oliver, though by birth one of
                    the Englishry <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> and though connected by numerous ties
                    with the Established Church, never showed the least sign of that contemptuous
                    antipathy with which, in his days, the ruling minority in Ireland too generally
                    regarded the subject majority. So far indeed was he from sharing in the opinions
                    and feelings of the caste to which he belonged that he conceived an aversion to
                    the Glorious and Immortal Memory, and, even when George III. was on the throne,
                    maintained that nothing but the restoration of the banished dynasty could save
                    the country.</p>
                <p>From the humble academy kept by the old soldier Goldsmith was removed in his
                    ninth year. He went to several grammar-schools, and acquired some knowledge of
                    the ancient languages. His life at this time seems to have been far from happy.
                    He had, as appears from the admirable portrait of him at Knowle, features harsh
                    even to ugliness. The small-pox had set its mark on him with more thau usual
                    severity. His stature was small, and his limbs ill <pb break="no"

                    shown to personal defects; and the ridicule excited by poor Oliver’s appearance
                    was heightened by a peculiar simplicity and a disposition to blunder which he
                    retained to the last. He became the common butt of boys and masters, was pointed
                    at as a fright in the play-ground, and flogged as a dunce in the school-room.
                    When he had risen to eminence, those who had once derided him ransacked their
                    memory for the events of his early years, and recited repartees and couplets
                    which had dropped from him, and which, though little noticed at the time, were
                    supposed, a quarter of a century later, to indicate the powers which produced
                    the <hi rend="italic">Vicar of Wakefield</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Deserted
                    Village.</hi></p>
                <p>In his seventeenth year Oliver went up to Trinity College, Dublin, as a sizar.
                    The sizars paid nothing for food and tuition, and very little for lodging; but
                    they had to perform some menial services from which they have long been
                    relieved. They swept the court, they carried up the dinner to the fellows’
                    table, aud changed the plates and poured out the ale of the rulers of the
                    society. Goldsmith was quartered, not alone, in a garret, on the window of which
                    his name, scrawled by himself, is still read with interest. From such garrets
                    many men of less parts than his have made their way to the woolsack or to the
                    episcopal bench. But Goldsmith, while he suffered all the humiliations, threw
                    away all the advantages of his situation. He neglected the studies of the place,
                    stood low at the examinations, was turned down to the bottom of his class for
                    playing the buffoon in the lecture-room, was severely reprimanded for pumping on
                    a constable, and was caned by a brutal tutor for giving a ball in the attic
                    story of the college to some gay youths and damsels from the city.</p>
                <p>While Oliver was leading at Dublin a life divided between squalid distress and
                    squalid dissipation, his father died, leaving a mere pittance. The youth
                    obtained his bachelor’s degree, and left the university. During some time the
                    humble dwelling to which his widowed mother had retired was his home. He was now
                    in his twenty-first year; it was necessary that he should do something; and his
                    education seemed to have fitted him to do nothing but to dress himself in gaudy
                    colours, of which he was as fond as a magpie, to take a hand at cards, to sing
                    Irish airs, to play the flute, to angle in summer, and to tell ghost stories by
                    the fire in winter. He tried five or six professions in turn without success. He
                    applied for ordination; but, as he applied in scarlet clothes, he was speedily
                    turned out of the episcopal palace. He then became tutor in an opulent family,
                    but soon quitted his situation in consequence of a dispute about play. Then he
                    determined to emigrate to America. His relations, with much satisfaction, saw
                    him set out for Cork on a good horse, with £30 in his pocket. But in six weeks
                    he came back on a miserable hack, without a penny, and informed his mother that
                    the ship in which he had taken his passage, having got a fair wind, while he was
                    at a party of pleasure, had sailed without him. Then he resolved to study the
                    law. A generous kinsman advanced £50. With this sum Goldsmith went to Dublin,
                    was enticed into a gaming house, and lost every shilling. He then thought of
                    medicine. A small purse was made up; and in his twenty-fourth year he was sent
                    to Edinburgh. At Edinburgh he passed eighteen months in nominal attendance on
                    lectures, and picked up some superficial information about chemistry and natural
                    history. Thence he went to Leyden, still pretending to study physic. He left
                    that celebrated university, the third university at which he had resided, in his
                    twenty-seventh year, without a degree, with the merest smattering of medical
                    knowledge, and with no property but his clothes and his flute. His flute,
                    however, proved a useful friend. He rambled on foot through Flanders, France,
                    and Switzerland, playing tunes which everywhere set the peasantry dancing, and
                    which often procured for him a supper and a bed. He wandered as far as Italy.
                    His musical performances, indeed, were not to the taste of the Italians; but he
                    contrived to live on the alms which he obtained at the gates of convents. It
                    should, however, be observed that the stories which he told about this part of
                    his life ought to be received with great caution; for strict veracity was never
                    one of his virtues; and a man who is ordinarily inaccurate in narration is
                    likely to be more than ordinarily inaccurate when he talks about his own
                    travels. Goldsmith indeed was so regardless of truth as to assert in print that
                    he was present at a most interesting conversation between Voltaire and
                    Fontenelle, and that this conversation took place at Paris. Now it is certain
                    that Voltaire never was within a hundred leagues of Paris during the whole time
                    which Goldsmith passed on the Continent.</p>
                <p>In 1756 the wanderer landed at Dover, without a shilling, without a friend, and
                    without a calling. He had indeed, if his own unsupported evidence may be
                    trusted, obtained from the university of Padua a doctor’s degree; but this
                    dignity proved utterly useless to him. In England his flute was not in request;
                    there were no convents; and he was forced to have recourse to a series of
                    desperate expedients. He turned strolling player; but his face and figure were
                    ill suited to the boards even of the humblest theatre. He pounded drugs and ran
                    about London with phials for charitable chemists. He joined a swarm of beggars,
                    which made its nest in Axe Yard. He was for a time usher of a school, and felt
                    the miseries and humiliations of this situation so keenly that he thought it a
                    promotion to be permitted to earn his bread as a bookseller’s hack; but he soon
                    found the new yoke more galling than the old one, and was glad to become an
                    usher again. He obtained a medical appointment in the service of the East India
                    Company; but the appointment was speedily revoked. Why it was revoked we are not
                    told. The subject was one on which he never liked to talk. It is probable that
                    he was incompetent to perform the duties of the place. Then he presented himself
                    at Surgeon’s Hall for examination, as mate to a naval hospital. Even to so
                    humble a post he was found unequal. By this time the schoolmaster whom he had
                    served for a morsel of food and the third part of a bed was no more. Nothing
                    remained but to return to the lowest drudgery of literature. Goldsmith took a
                    garret in a miserable court, to which he had to climb from the brink of Fleet
                    Ditch by a dizzy ladder of flagstones called Breakneck Steps. The court and the
                    ascent have long disappeared, but old Londoners well remember both. Here, at
                    thirty, the unlucky adventurer sat down to toil like a galley slave.</p>
                <p>In the succeeding six years he sent to the press some things which have survived,
                    and many which have perished. He produced articles for reviews, magazines, and
                    newspapers; children’s books, which, bound in gilt paper and adorned with
                    hideous woodcuts, appeared in the window of the once far-famed shop at the
                    corner of Saint Paul’s Churchyard; <hi rend="italic">An Inquiry into the State
                    of Polite Learning in Europe,</hi> which, though of little or no value, is still
                    reprinted among his works; a <hi rend="italic">Life of Beau Nash,</hi> which is
                    not reprinted, though it well deserves to be so; a superficial and incorrect,
                    but very readable, <hi rend="italic">History of England,</hi> in a series of
                    letters purporting to be addressed by a nobleman to his son; and some very
                    lively and amusing <hi rend="italic">Sketches of London Society,</hi> in a
                    series of letters purporting to be addressed by a Chinese traveller to his
                    friends. All these works were anonymous; but some of them were well known to be
                    Goldsmith’s; and he gradually rose in the estimation of the booksellers for whom
                    he drudged. He was, indeed, emphatically a popular writer. For <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n785/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0785-0762"/> accurate research or grave disquisition he was
                    not well qualified by nature or by education. He knew nothing accurately; his
                    reading had been desultory; nor had he meditated deeply on what he had read. He
                    had seen much of the world; but he had noticed and retained little more of what
                    he had seen than some grotesque incidents and characters which had happened to
                    strike his fancy. But, though his mind was very scantily stored with materials,
                    he used what materials he had in such a way as to produce a wonderful effect.
                    There have been many greater writers; but perhaps no writer was ever more
                    uniformly agreeable. His style was always pure and easy, and, on proper
                    occasions, pointed and energetic. His narratives were always amusing, his
                    descriptions always picturesque, his humour rich and joyous, yet not without an
                    occasional tinge of amiable sadness. About everything that he wrote, serious or
                    sportive, there was a certain natural grace and decorum, hardly to be expected
                    from a man a great part of whose life had been passed among thieves and beggars,
                    streetwalkers and merryandrews, in those squalid dens which are the reproach of
                    great capitals.</p>
                <p>As his name gradually became known, the circle of his acquaintance widened. He
                    was introduced to Johnson, who was then considered as the first of living
                    English writers; to Reynolds, the first of English painters; and to Burke, who
                    had not yet entered parliament, but had distinguished himself greatly by his
                    writings and by the eloquence of his conversation. With these eminent men
                    Goldsmith became intimate. In 1763 he was one of the nine original members of
                    that celebrated fraternity which has sometimes been called the Literary Club,
                    but which has always disclaimed that epithet, and still glories in the simple
                    name of the Club.</p>
                <p>By this time Goldsmith had quitted his miserable dwelling at the top of Breakneck
                    Steps, and had taken chambers in the more civilized region of the Inns of Court.
                    But he was still often reduced to pitiable shifts. Towards the close of 1764 his
                    rent was so long in arrear that his landlady one morning called in the help of a
                    sheriff’s officer. The debtor, in great perplexity, despatched a messenger to
                    Johnson; and Johnson, always friendly, though often surly, sent back the
                    messenger with a guinea, and promised to follow speedily. He came, and found
                    that Goldsmith had changed the guinea, and was railing at the landlady over a
                    bottle of Madeira. Johnson put the cork into the bottle, and entreated his
                    friend to consider calmly how money was to be procured. Goldsmith said that he
                    had a novel ready for the press. Johnson glanced at the manuscript, saw that
                    there were good things in it, took it to a bookseller, sold it for £60, and soon
                    returned with the money. The rent was paid; and the sheriff’s officer with drew.
                    According to one story, Goldsmith gave his landlady a sharp reprimand for her
                    treatment of him; accord ing to another, he insisted on her joining him in a
                    bowl of punch. Both stories are probably true. The novel which was thus ushered
                    into the world was the <hi rend="italic">Vicar of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Wakefield.</hi></p>
                <p>But before the <hi rend="italic">Vicar of Wakefield</hi> appeared in print, came
                    the great crisis of Goldsmith’s literary life. In Christmas week 1764 he
                    published a poem, entitled the <hi rend="italic">Traveller.</hi> It was the
                    first work to which he had put his name, and it at once raised him to the rank
                    of a legitimate English classic. The opinion of the most skilful critics was
                    that nothing finer had appeared in verse since the fourth book of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dunciad.</hi> Tn one respect the <hi rend="italic">Traveller</hi>
                    differs from all Goldsmith’s other writings. In general his designs were bad,
                    and his execution good. In the <hi rend="italic">Traveller,</hi> the execution,
                    though deserving of much praise, is far inferior to the design. No philosophical
                    poem, ancient or modern, I1a3 a plan so noble, and at the same time so simple.
                    An English wanderer, seated on a crag among the Alps, near the point where three
                    great countries meet·, looks down on the boundless prospect, reviews his long
                    pilgrimage, recalls the varieties of scenery, of climate, of government, of
                    religion, of national character, which he has observed, and comes to the
                    conclusion, just or unjust, that our happiness depends little on political
                    institutions, and much on the temper and regulation of our own minds.</p>
                <p>While the fourth edition of the <hi rend="italic">Traveller</hi> was on the
                    counters of the booksellers, the J‰zr <hi rend="italic">of Wakefield</hi>
                    appeared, and rapidly obtained a popularity which has lasted down to our own
                    time, and which is likely to last as long as our language. The fable is indeed
                    one of the worst that ever was constructed. It wants, not merely that
                    probability which ought to be found in a tale of common English life, but that
                    consistency which ought to be found even in the wildest fiction about witches,
                    giants, and fairies. But the earlier chapters have all the sweetness of pastoral
                    poetry, together with all the vivacity of comedy. Moses and his spectacles, the
                    vicar and his monogamy, the sharper and his cosmogony, the squire proving from
                    Aristotle that relatives are related, Olivia preparing herself for the arduous
                    task of converting a rakish lover by studying the controversy between Robinson
                    Crusoe and Friday, the great ladies with their scandal about Sir Tomkyn’s amours
                    and Dr Burdock’s verses, and Mr Burchell with his “Fudge,” have caused as much
                    harmless mirth as has ever been caused by matter packed into so small a number
                    of pages. The latter part of the tale is unworthy of the beginning. As we
                    approach the catastrophe, the absurdities lie thicker and thicker, and the
                    gleams of pleasantry become rarer and rarer.</p>
                <p>The success which had attended Goldsmith as a novelist emboldened him to try his
                    fortune as a dramatist. He wrote the <hi rend="italic">Goodnatured Man,</hi> a
                    piece which had a worse fate than it deserved. Garrick refused to produce it at
                    Drury Lane. It was acted at Covent Garden in 1768, but was coldly received. The
                    author, however, cleared by his benefit nights, and by the sale of the
                    copyright, no less than £500, five times as much as he had made by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Traveller</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Vicar of Wakefield</hi>
                    together. The plot of the <hi rend="italic">Goodnatured Man</hi> is, like almost
                    all Goldsmith’s plots, very ill constructed. But some passages arc exquisitely
                    ludicrous,—much more ludicrous indeed than suited the taste of the town at that
                    time. A canting, mawkish play, entitled <hi rend="italic">False Delicacy,</hi>
                    had just had an immense run. Sentimentality was all the mode. During some years,
                    more tears were shed at comedies than at tragedies; and a pleasantry which moved
                    the audience to anything more than a grave smile was reprobated as low. It is
                    not strange, therefore, that the very best scene in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Goodnatured Man,</hi> that in which Miss Richland finds her lover attended by
                    the bailiff and the bailiff’s follower in full court dresses, should have been
                    mercilessly hissed, and should have been omitted after the first night.</p>
                <p>In 1770 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Deserted Village.</hi> In mere diction and
                    versification this celebrated poem is fully equal, perhaps superior, to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Traveller;</hi> and it is generally preferred to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Traveller</hi> by that large class of readers who think, with
                    Bayes in the <hi rend="italic">Rehearsal,</hi> that the only use of a plan is to
                    bring in fine things. More discerning judges, however, while they admire the
                    beauty of the details, are shocked by one unpardonable fault which pervades the
                    whole. The fault which we mean is not that theory about wealth and luxury which
                    has so often been censured by political economists. The theory is indeed false;
                    but the poem, considered merely as a poem, is not necessarily the worse on that
                    account. The finest poem in the Latin language,—indeed, the finest didactic poem
                    in any language,— was written in defence of the silliest and meanest of all <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n786/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0786-0763"/> systems of natural and moral philosophy. A poet
                    may easily be pardoned for reasoning ill; but lie cannot be pardoned for
                    describing ill, for observing the world in which he lives so carelessly that his
                    portraits bear no resemblance to the originals, for exhibiting as copies from
                    real life monstrous combinations of things which never were and never could be
                    found together. What would be thought of a painter who should mix August and
                    January in one landscape, who should introduce a frozen river into a harvest
                    scene? Would it be a sufficient defence of such a picture to say that every part
                    was exquisitely coloured, that the green hedges, the apple-trees loaded with
                    fruit, the waggons reeling under the yellow sheaves, and the sun-burned reapers
                    wiping their foreheads were very fine, and that the ice and the boys sliding
                    were also very fine? To such a picture the <hi rend="italic">Deserted
                    Village</hi> bears a great resemblance. It is made up of incongruous parts. The
                    village in its happy days is a true English village. The village in its decay is
                    an Irish village. The felicity and the misery which Goldsmith has brought close
                    together belong to two different countries, and to two different stages in the
                    progress of society. He had assuredly never seen in his native island such a
                    rural paradise, such a seat of plenty, content, and tranquillity, as his Auburn.
                    He had assuredly never seen in England all the inhabitants of such a paradise
                    turned out of their homes in one day, and forced to emigrate in a body to
                    America. The hamlet he had probably seen in Kent; the ejectment he had probably
                    seen in Munster; but by joining the two, he has produced something which never
                    was and never will be seen in any part of the world</p>
                <p>In 1773 Goldsmith tried his chance at Covent Garden with a second play, <hi
                    rend="italic">She Stoops to Conquer.</hi> The manager was, not without great
                    difficulty, induced to bring this piece out. The sentimental comedy still
                    reigned, and Goldsmith’s comedies were not sentimental. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Goodnatured Han</hi> had been too funny to succeed; yet the mirth of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Goodnatured Man</hi> was sober when compared with the rich
                    drollery of <hi rend="italic">She Stoops to Conquer,</hi> which is, in truth, an
                    incomparable farce in five acts, On this occasion, however, genius triumphed.
                    Pit, boxes, and galleries were in a constant roar of laughter. If any bigoted
                    admirer of Kelly and Cumberland ventured to hiss or groan, he was speedily
                    silenced by a general cry of “turn him out,” or “throw him over.” Two
                    generations have since confirmed the verdict which was pronounced on that
                    night.</p>
                <p>While Goldsmith was writing the <hi rend="italic">Deserted Village</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">She Sloops to Conquer,</hi> he was employed on works of a very
                    different kind,—works from which he derived little reputation but much profit.
                    He compiled for the use of schools a <hi rend="italic">History of Rome,</hi> by
                    which he made £300; a <hi rend="italic">History of England,</hi> by which he
                    made £G00; a <hi rend="italic">History of Greece,</hi> for which he received
                    £250; a <hi rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> for which the booksellers
                    covenanted to pay him 800 guineas. These works he produced without any elaborate
                    research, by merely selecting, abridging, and translating into his own clear,
                    pure, and flowing language, what he found in books well known to the world, but
                    too bulky or too dry for boys and girls, He committed some strange blunders, for
                    he knew nothing with accuracy. Thus, in his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    England,</hi> he tells us that Naseby is in Yorkshire; nor did he correct this
                    mistake when the book was reprinted. He was very nearly hoaxed into putting into
                    the <hi rend="italic">History of Greece</hi> an account of a battle between
                    Alexander the Great and Montezuma. In his <hi rend="italic">Animated Nature</hi>
                    he relates, with faith and with perfect gravity, all the most absurd lies which
                    he could find in books of travels about gigantic Patagonians, monkeys that
                    preach sermons, nightingales that repeat long conversations. “If he can tell a
                    horse from a cow,” said Johnson, “that is the extent of his knowledge of
                    zoology." How little Goldsmith was qualified to write about the physical
                    sciences is sufficiently proved by two anecdotes. He on one occasion denied that
                    the sun is longer in the northern than in the southern signs. It was vain to
                    cite the authority of Maupertuis. “Maupertuis !” he cried, “I understand those
                    matters better than Maupertuis.” On another occasion he, in defiance of the
                    evidence of his own senses, maintained obstinately, and even angrily, that he
                    chewed his dinner by moving his upper jaw.</p>
                <p>Yet, ignorant as Goldsmith was, few writers have done more to make the first
                    steps in the laborious road to knowledge easy and pleasant. His compilations are
                    widely distinguished from the compilations of ordinary bookmakers. He was a
                    great, perhaps an unequalled, master of the arts of selection and condensation.
                    In these respects his histories of Rome and of England, and still more his own
                    abridgments of these histories, well deserved to be studied. In general nothing
                    is less attractive than an epitome; but the epitomes of Goldsmith, even when
                    most concise, are always amusing; and to read them is considered by intelligent
                    children not as a task but as a pleasure.</p>
                <p>Goldsmith might now be considered as a prosperous man. He had the means of living
                    in comfort, and even in what to one who had so often slept in barns and on bulks
                    must have been luxury. His fame was great and was constantly rising. He lived in
                    what was intellectually far the best society of the kingdom, in a society in
                    which no talent or accomplishment was wanting, and in which the art of
                    conversation was cultivated with splendid success. There probably were never
                    four talkers more admirable in four different ways than Johnson, Burke,
                    Beauclerk, and Garrick; and Goldsmith was on terms of intimacy with all the
                    four. He aspired to share in their colloquial renown, but never was ambition
                    more unfortunate. It may seem strange that a man who wrote with so much
                    perspicuity, vivacity, and grace should have been, whenever he took a part in
                    conversation, an empty, noisy, blundering rattle. But on this point the evidence
                    is overwhelming. So extraordinary was the contrast between Goldsmith’s published
                    works and the silly things which he said, that Horace Walpole described him as
                    an inspired idiot. “Noll,” said Garrick, “wrote like an angel, and talked like
                    poor Poll.” Charnier declared that it was a hard exercise of faith to believe
                    that so foolish a chatterer could have really written the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traveller.</hi> Even Boswell could say, with contemptuous compassion, that he
                    liked very well to hear honest Goldsmith run on. “Yes, sir,” said Johnson, “but
                    he should not like to hear himself.” Minds differ as rivers differ. There are
                    transparent and sparkling rivers from which it is delightful to drink as they
                    flow; to such rivers the minds of such men as Burke and Johnson may be compared.
                    But there are rivers of which the water when first drawn is turbid and noisome,
                    but becomes pellucid as crystal and delicious to the taste, if it be suffered to
                    stand till it has deposited a sediment; and such a river is a type of the mind
                    of Goldsmith. His first thoughts on every subject were confused even to
                    absurdity, but they required only a little time to work themselves clear. When
                    he wrote they had that time, and therefore his readers pronounced him aman of
                    genius; but when he talked he talked nonsense, and made himself the
                    laughing-stock of his hearers. He was painfully sensible of his inferiority in
                    conversation; he felt every failure keenly; yet he had not sufficient judgment
                    and self-command to hold his tongue. His animal spirits and vanity were always
                    impelling him to try to do the one thing which he could not do. After every
                    attempt he felt that he had exposed himself, and writhed with shame and
                    vexation; yet the next moment he began again.</p>
                <p>His associates seem to have regarded him with kindness, which, in spite of their
                    admiration of his writings, was not <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n787/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0787-0764"/> unmixed with contempt. In truth, there was in his
                    character much to love, but very little to respect. His heart was soft even to
                    weakness: he was so generous that he quite forgot to be just; he forgave
                    injuries so readily that he might be said to invite them, and was so liberal to
                    beggars that he had nothing left for his tailor and his butcher. He was vain,
                    sensual, frivolous, profuse, improvident. One vice of a darker shade was imputed
                    to him, envy. But there is not the least reason to believe that this bad
                    passion, though it sometimes made him wince and utter fretful exclamations, ever
                    impelled him to injure by wicked arts the reputation of any of his rivals. The
                    truth probably is that he was not more envious, but merely less prudent, than
                    his neighbours. His heart was on his lips. All those small jealousies, which are
                    but too common among men of letters, but which a man of letters who is also a
                    man of the world does his best to conceal, Goldsmith avowed with the simplicity
                    of a child. When he was envious, instead of affecting indifference, instead of
                    damning with faint praise, instead of doing injuries slily and in the dark, he
                    told everybody that he was envious. “Do not, pray, do not, talk of Johnson in
                    such terms,” he said to Boswell; “you harrow up my very soul.” George Steevens
                    and Cumberland were men far too cunning to say such a thing. They would have
                    echoed the praises of the man whom they envied, and then have sent to the
                    newspapers anonymous libels upon him. Both what was good and what was bad in
                    Goldsmith’s character was to his associates a perfect security that he would
                    never commit such villainy. He was neither ill-natured enough, nor longheaded
                    enough, to be guilty of any malicious act which required contrivance and
                    disguise.</p>
                <p>Goldsmith has sometimes been represented as a man of genius, cruelly treated by
                    the world, and doomed to struggle with difficulties, which at last broke his
                    heart. But no representation can be more remote from the truth. He did, indeed,
                    go through much sharp misery before he had done anything considerable in
                    literature. But after his name had appeared on the title-page of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Travellers</hi> he had none but himself to blame for his
                    distresses. His average income, during the last seven years of his life,
                    certainly exceeded £400 a year <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> and £400 a year
                    ranked, among the incomes of that day, at least as high as £800 a year would
                    rank at present. A single man living in the Temple, with £400 a year, might then
                    be called opulent. Not one in ten of the young gentlemen of good families who
                    were studying the law there had so much. But all the wealth which Lord Clive had
                    brought from Bengal, and Sir Lawrence Dundas from Germany, joined together,
                    would not have sufficed for Goldsmith. He spent twice as much as he had. He wore
                    fine clothes, gave dinners of several courses, paid court to venal beauties. He
                    had also, it should be remembered, to the honour of his heart, though not of his
                    head, a guinea, or five, or ten, according to the state of his purse, ready for
                    any tale of distress, true or false. But it was not in dress or feasting, in
                    promiscuous amours or promiscuous charities, that his chief expense lay. He had
                    been from boyhood a gambler, and at once the most sanguine and the most
                    unskilful of gamblers. For a time he put off the day of inevitable ruin by
                    temporary expedients. He obtained advances from booksellers, by promising to
                    execute works which he never began. But at length this source of supply failed.
                    He owed more than £2000; and he saw no hope of extrication from his
                    embarrassments. His spirits and health gave way. He was attacked by a nervous
                    fever, which he thought himself competent to treat. It would have been happy for
                    him if his medical skill had been appreciated as justly by himself as by others.
                    Nothwithstanding the degree which he pretended to have received at Padua, he
                    could procure no patients. “I do not practise,” he once said; “I make it a rule
                    to prescribe only for my friends.” “Pray, dear Doctor,” said Beauclerk, “alter
                    your rule; and prescribe only for your enemies.” Goldsmith now, in spite of this
                    excellent advice, prescribed for himself. The remedy aggravated the malady. The
                    sick man was induced to call in real physicians; and they at one time imagined
                    that they had cured the disease. Still his weakness and restlessness continued.
                    He could get no sleep. He could take no food. “You are worse,” said one of his
                    medical attendants, “than you should be from the degree of fever which you have.
                    Is your mind at ease?” “No; it is not,” were the last recorded words of Oliver
                    Goldsmith. He died on the 3d of April 1774, in his forty-sixth year. He was laid
                    in the churchyard of the Temple; but the spot was not marked by any inscription,
                    and is now forgotten. The coffin was followed by Burke and Reynolds. Both these
                    great men were sincere mourners. Burke, when he heard of Goldsmith’s death, had
                    burst into a flood of tears. Reynolds had been so much moved by the news that he
                    had flung aside his brush and palette for the day.</p>
                <p>A short time after Goldsmith’s death, a little poem appeared, which will, as long
                    as our language lasts, associate the names of his two illustrious friends with
                    his own. It has already been mentioned that he sometimes felt keenly the sarcasm
                    which his wild blundering talk brought upon him. He was, not long before his
                    last illness, provoked into retaliating. He wisely betook himself to his pen;
                    and at that weapon he proved himself a match for all his assailants together.
                    Within a small compass he drew with a singularly easy and vigorous pencil the
                    characters of nine or ten of his intimate associates. Though this little work
                    did not receive his last touches, it must always be regarded as a masterpiece.
                    It is impossible, however, not to wish that four or five likenesses which have
                    no interest for posterity were wanting to that noble gallery, and that their
                    places were supplied by sketches of Johnson and Gibbon, as happy and vivid as
                    the sketches of Burke and Garrick.</p>
                <p>Some of Goldsmith’s friends and admirers honoured him with a cenotaph in
                    Westminster Abbey. Nollekens was the sculptor, and Johnson wrote the
                    inscription. It is much to be lamented that Johnson did not leave to posterity a
                    more durable and a more valuable memorial of his friend. A life of Goldsmith
                    would have been an inestimable addition to the Lives of the Poets. No man
                    appreciated Goldsmith’s writings more justly than Johnson; no man was better
                    acquainted with Goldsmith’s character and habits; and no man was more competent
                    to delineate with truth and spirit the peculiarities of a mind in which great
                    powers were found in company with great weaknesses. But the list of poets to
                    whose works Johnson was requested by the booksellers to furnish prefaces ended
                    with Lyttelton, who died in 1773. The line seems to have been drawn expressly
                    for the purpose of excluding the person whose portrait would have most fitly
                    closed the series. Goldsmith, however, has been fortunate in his biographers.
                    Witbin a few years his life was written by Mr Prior (1836), by Mr Washington
                    Irving (1849), and by Mr Forster (1848; 2d ed., 1854). The diligence of Mr Prior
                    deserves great praise; the style of Mr Washington Irving is always pleasing; but
                    the highest place must, in justice, be assigned to the eminently interesting
                    work of Mr Forster. <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ.)</hi></p>
