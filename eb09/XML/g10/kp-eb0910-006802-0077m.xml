                <p><label type="entry">GANGES</label>, a river of northern India, formed by the
                    drainage of the southern ranges of the HimAlayas. This mighty stream, which in
                    its lower course supplies the great river system of Bengal, rises in the GarhwAl
                    state, and falls into the Bay of Bengal after a course of 1500 miles. It issues,
                    under the name of the BhAgirathi, from an ice cave at the foot of an Himalayan
                    snow bed near Gangotri, 10,300 feet above the level of the sea. During its
                    earlier passage through the southern spurs of the Himalayas, it receives the
                    Jahnavi from the north-west, and subsequently the Alak’ianda, after which the
                    united stream takes the name of the Ganges. Deo PrayAg, their point of junction,
                    is a celebrated place of pilgrimage, as is also Gangotri, the source of the
                    parent stream. At Sukhi it pierces through the Himalayas, and turns south-west
                    to HardwAr, also a place of great sanctity. It proceeds by a tortuous course
                    through the districts of Dehra Dùn, SahAranpur, Muzaff-arnager, Bulandshahr, and
                    Farrukhabad, in which last district it receives the RAmgangA. Thus far the
                    Ganges has been little more than a series of broad shoals, long deep pools, and
                    rapids, except, of course, during the melting of the snows and throughout the
                    rainy season. At AllahAbAd, however, it receives the Jumna, a mighty sister
                    stream, which takes its rise also in the HimAlayas to the west of the sources of
                    the Ganges. The combined river winds eastwards by south-east through the
                    North-Western Provinces, receiving the Gumti and the GogrA. The point of
                    junction of each of these streams has more or less pretension to sanctity. But
                    the tongue of land at AllahAbAd, where the Jumna and the Ganges join, is the
                    true PrayAg, <hi rend="italic">the</hi> place of pilgrimage, to which hundreds
                    of thousands of devout Hindus repair to wash away their sins in the sacred
                    river. Shortly after passing the holy city of Benares, the Ganges enters Behar,
                    and after receiving an important tributary, the Son, from the south, passes
                    PatnA, and obtains another accession to its volume from the Gandak, which rises
                    in NepAl. Further to the east, it receives the Kusi, and then, skirting the
                    RAjmahAl hills, turns sharply to the southward, passing near the site of the
                    ruined city of Gaur. By this time it has approached to within 240 miles, as the
                    crow flies, from the sea. About 20 miles further on, it begins to branch out on
                    the level country, and this spot marks the commencement of the delta, 220 miles
                    in a straight line, or 300 by the windings of the river, from the Bay of Bengal.
                    The main channel takes the name of the Padma or Padda, and proceeds in a
                    south-easterly direction, past PAbnA to Goalandâ, above which it is joined by
                    the JamunA or main stream of the Brahmaputra. The vast confluence of waters
                    rushes towards the sea, receiving further additions from the hill country on the
                    east, and forming a broad estuary known under the name of the MeghnA, which
                    enters the Bay of Bengal near NoAkhAli. This estuary, however, 13 only the
                    largest and most easterly of a great number of mouths or channels. The most
                    westerly is the Hùgli or Hooghly which receives the waters of a number of
                    distributary channels that start from the parent Ganges in the neighbourhood of
                    MurshidAbAd. Between the Hùgli on the west and the MeghnA on the east lies the
                    delta. The upper angle of it consists of rich and fertile districts, such as
                    MurshidAbAd, NadiyA, Jessor, and the 24 ParganAs. But towards its southern base,
                    resting on the sea, the country sinks into a series of great swamps, intercepted
                    by a network of innumerable channels. This wild waste is known as the
                    Sundarbans, from the sundari tree, which grows in abundance in the sea-board
                    tracts. The most important channel of the Ganges for commerce is the Hιigli, on
                    which stands Calcutta, about 90 miles from the mouth. Beyond this city, the
                    navigation is conducted by native craft,—the modern facilities for traffic by
                    rail, and the increasing shoals in the river, having put an end to the previous
                    steamer communication, which plied until about 1860 as high up as AllahAbAd.
                    Below Calcutta important boat routes through the delta connect the Hùgli with
                    the eastern branches of the river, both for native craft and steamers. The
                    Ganges is essentially a river of great cities: Calcutta, Monghyr, PatnA,
                    Benares, and AllahAbAd, all lie on its course below its junction with the Jumna;
                    and the ancient capitals, Agra and Delhi, are on the Jumna, higher up. The
                    catchment basin of the Ganges is bounded on the N. by a length of about 700
                    miles of the Himalayan range, on the S. by the VindhyA mountains, and on the E.
                    by the ranges which separate Bengal from Burmah. The vast river basin thus
                    enclosed embraces 432,480 square miles. The flood discharge of the Ganges at
                    RAjmahAl, after it has received all its important tributaries, was formerly
                    estimated at 1,350,000 cubic feet per second. According to the latest
                    calculations, the length of main stream of Ganges is 1540 miles, or with its
                    longest affluent, 1680; breadth at true entrance, 20 miles; breadth of channel
                    in dry season, 1^ to 2∣ miles; depth in dry season, 30 feet; flood discharge,
                    1,800,000 cubic feet per second; ordinary discharge, 207,000 cubic feet; longest
                    duration of flood, about 40 days. The average descent of the river from
                    AllahAbAd to Benares is 6 inches per mile; from Benares to Calcutta, between 4
                    and 5 inches; from Calcutta to the sea, 1 to 2 inches. Great changes take place
                    from time to time in the river bed, which alter the face of the country.
                    Extensive islands are thrown up, and attach themselves to the mainland, while
                    the river deserts its old bed and seeks a new channel, it may be many miles off.
                    Such changes are so rapid and on so vast a scale, and the corroding power of the
                    current on the bank so irresistible, that in Lower Bengal it is considered
                    perilous to build any structure of a large or permanent character on the margin.
                    Many decayed or ruined cities attest the changes in the river bed in ancient
                    times; and within our own times the main channel which formerly passed RAjmahAl
                    has turned away from it, aud left the town high and dry, 7 miles from the
                    bank.</p>
