                    fathers and doctors of the church, occupied him for years, during which he led a
                    very retired life; gradually, however, he took more and more interest in the
                    affairs of his country, as well as in the literature of the day, entering warmly
                    into the new ideas then beginning to be discussed in connexion with politics.
                    The freedom of Italy from foreign masters became his ruling motive in life, and
                    this freedom in his conception of it was an emancipation, not only from armed
                    masters, but from modes of thought alien to its genius, and detrimental to its
                    European authority. This authority was in his mind connected with papal
                    supremacy, though in a way quite novel intellectual rather than political. One
                    must remember this in considering nearly all his writings, and also in
                    estimating his position, both in relation to the ruling clerical party— the
                    Jesuits—and also in relation to the politics of the court of Piedmont after the
                    accession of Charles Albert in 1831. He was now noticed by the king and made one
                    of his chaplains. His popularity and private influence, however, were seasons
                    enough for the court party to mark him for exile; he was not one of them, and
                    could not be depended on. Knowing this, he in 1833 asked permission to resign
                    his chaplaincy, but was suddenly arrested while walking with a friend in the
                    public gardens, and, after an imprisonment of four months, sent out of the
                    country in the escort of a carabineer, under decree of banishment. This was done
                    without trial or process—simply, it would appear, by private influence of the
                    clerical party, his name being at the same time struck off the list of
                    theological doctors of the college of Turin. With broken fortunes and ruined
                    plans Gioberti arrived in Paris in the beginning of October 1833. A year later
                    he went to Brussels, where he spent the best period of his life from that time
                    to 1845, teaching philosophy, and assisting in the work of a college
                    superintended by his friend Gaggia, yet finding time, by rising early and
                    sitting late, to write many works of great importance in philosophical inquiry,
                    but bearing a special relation to his country and its position. His spirits
                    never returned to him, however, as his whole being was bound up with the welfare
                    of his native country. An amnesty having been passed by Charles Albert in 1846,
                    Gioberti had liberty to return to Italy, just as Pius IX. in the beginning of
                    his pontificate manifested strongly liberal sympathies. Gioberti took no step,
                    however, till the end of 1847, and did not return to his native land till after

                    of popular enthusiasm in his favour. On his entrance into Turin, 29th April
                    1848, there was a general ouburst of this enthusiasm, mainly caused, it appears,
                    by his unjust banishment and by the large circulation of his books, especially
                    the <hi rend="italic">G</hi><hi rend="italic">esuita</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Moderno.</hi> The city was illuminated; deputations waited upon him; the king
                    made him senator, but, having been returned both by Turin and by Genoa as deputy
                    to the assembly of representatives, now first meeting under the new
                    constitution, he elected to sit in the lower chamber, for his native town.
                    Previous to the opening he made a tour in various provinces, beginning at Milan
                    and including Rome, where he had three interviews with the liberal pope, who at
                    that moment seemed to be the representative of his ideal imagined in the work
                    <hi rend="italic">Del Prvmato morale e civile,</hi> which Pius had read and
                    admired. While he was engaged in this tour, constantly addressing the people
                    publicly, the chamber met and elected him president. In the same parliament sat
                    Azeglio, Cavour, and other liberals, and Balbo was prime minister. At the close
                    of the same eventful year, a new ministry was formed, headed by Gioberti; but
                    with the accession of Victor Emmanuel in March 1849 his active life came to an
                    end. For a short time indeed he held a seat in the cabinet, though without a
                    portfolio; but an irreconcilable disagreement soon followed, and his removal
                    from Turin was accomplished by his appointment on a mission to Paris, whence he
                    never returned. There, refusing the pension which had been offered him and all
                    ecclesiastical preferment, he lived frugally, and spent his days and nights as
                    at Brussels in literary labour. Many other exiles gathered about him, and the
                    Marquis Pallavicino became his bosom friend. He died suddenly, of apoplexy, on
                    the 26th October 1852.</p>
                <p>Gioberti’s writings are more important than his political career. In the general
                    history of European philosophy they stand apart. As the speculations of
                    Rosnιini, against which he wrote, have been called the last link added to
                    mediaeval thought, so the system of Gioberti, more especially in his greater and
                    earlier works, is unrelated to other modern schools of thought. It shows a
                    harmony with the Roman Catholic faith which caused Cousin to make the
                    superficial criticism that “Italian philosophy was still in the bonds of
                    theology.” Method is with him a synthetic, subjective, and psychological
                    instrument. He reconstructs, as he declares, ontology, and begins with the
                    “ideal formula,” “the Ens creates ex nihilo the existent.” He is in some
                    respects a Platonist, and transplants certain dogmata from the ancient idealist.
                    He identifies religion with civilization, and arrives in his treatise Del
                    Ρrimatο morale e civile clegli Italiani at the conclusion that the church is the
                    axision which the wellbeing of human life revolves. His later works, the
                    Rinnoυarnento and the Protologia, are sometimes thought to be less affirmative
                    in this matter, and there is a division in opinion among his critics how far he
                    shifted his ground under the influence of events before he died. His first work,
                    written when he was thirty-seven, had a personal reason for its existence. A
                    young fellow-exile and friend, Paolo Pallia, having many doubts and misgivings
                    as to the reality of revelation and a future life, Gioberti at once set to work
                    with La Teorica del Sovrannaturale, which was his first publication (2 vols.,
                    1838). After this the enormous labours of his pen made up for the lateness of
                    his commencement as an author. Philosophical treatises in two or three volumes,
                    which would occupy, generally speaking, half a lifetime, followed in rapid
                    succession, each one being a corollary to the last. The Teorica was followed by
                    Introduzione allo Studio della Filosofa in three volumes, passing through the
                    press in 1839-40. In this work he states his reasons for requiring a new method
                    and new terminology. Here he brings out the doctrine that religion is the direct
                    expression of the idea, in this life, and is one with tnιe civilization in
                    history. Civilization is a conditioned mediate tendency to perfection, to which
                    religion is the final completion if carried out; it is the end of the second
                    cycle expressed by tlιe second formula, the Ens redeems existences. Essays on
                    the lighter and more popular subjects, Del Bello and Del Buono, followed the
                    Introduction, but were not published as a volume till 1846, having first
                    appeared in connexion with the writings of other authors. Del Primato morale e
                    civile degli Italiani and the Prolegomena to the same, and soon afterwards his
                    triumphant exposure of the Jesuits, Il Gesuita Moderno, in five successive
                    volumes (eight volumes altogether), began to be issued in 1843, and no doubt
                    hastened the transfer of rule from clerical to civil hands. It was, as has been
                    seen, the popularity of these semi-political works, heightened by other
                    occasional political articles which fill two volumes, and by his Rinnovamento
                    civile d’Italia, that caused Gioberti to be welcomed with such enthusiasm on his
                    return to his native country. All these works were perfectly orthodox, and aided
                    in drawing the liberal clergy into the movement which has resulted since his
                    time in the unification of Italy. The Jesuits, however, closed round the pope
                    more firmly after his return to Rome, and in the end Gioberti <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> s writings were placed on the Inder, although with no
                    unfavourable result as far as their influence is concerned. The remainder of his
                    works need not be particularized, although they give his mature views on many
                    points, especially La Filosofia della Rivelazioηe and the Protologia. The entire
                    writings of Gioberti, including those left in manuscript, have been carefully
                    edited by Giuseppe Massari in thirty-six volumes.</p>
