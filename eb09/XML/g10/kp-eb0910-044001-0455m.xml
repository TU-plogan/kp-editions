                    of general in November 1806, played a prominent part in the battles of Halle,
                    Jena, and Erfurt; and for his conduct in the battle of Wagram, where he greatly
                    contributed to the victory, he was created a baron. In the Spanish campaign of
                    1810 and 1811 he gained special distinction at the battle of Fuentes-de-Onoro;
                    and in the subsequent expedition to Russia he was present at the capture of
                    Smolensk, had a principal share in the victory of Walontina-Gora, displayed such
                    bravery and ability in the battle of the Moskova that he was made general of
                    division, ≈and by his coolness and energy in the disastrous retreat from Moscow
                    saved the rearguard of the French army at the passage of the Wilna. In the
                    campaign of 1813, in command of a division under Macdonald, he took part in the
                    battles of Lützen, Bautzen, Goldberg, and Leipsic, where he was dangerously
                    wounded. After the battle of Bautzen he was created by Napoleon a count of the
                    empire. In the campaign of France of 1814, in command of the army of reserves
                    composed chiefly of recruits, he by his skilful manoeuvres powerfully assisted
                    in securing the victories of Nogent, Nangis, and Montereau-sur-Yonne. After the
                    first restoration he was named by Louis XVIII. grand cross of the legion of
                    honour and chevalier of St Louis. On the return of Napoleon from Elba he was
                    entrusted with the command of the army of the Moselle, and took part in the
                    battle of Ligny. On the morning of the battle of Waterloo, being under the
                    orders of Grouchy, who was marching towards Wavre, he strongly urged him to
                    proceed in the direction whence they heard cannon firing, but his advice was not
                    followed. Gérard retired to Brussels after the fall of Napoleon, and did not
                    return to France till 1817. He was chosen a member of the chamber of deputies in
                    1822, and was re-elected in 1823 and 1827. He took part in the revolution of
                    1830, after which he was appointed minister of war and named a marshal of
                    France. On account of his health he resigned the office of w ar minister in the
                    October following, but in 1831 he took the command of the northern army, and was
                    successful in thirteen days in driving the army of Holland out of Belgium. In
                    1832 he compelled the surrender of Antwerp, and in the same year he was raised
                    to the peerage of France. He was again chosen war minister in July 1834, and
                    again resigned that office in the October following. In 1835 he was named grand
                    chancellor of the legion of honour, and in 1838 commander-general of the
                    national guards of the Seine, an office which he held till 1842. He became a
                    senator under the empire in 1852, and died in April of the same year.</p>
