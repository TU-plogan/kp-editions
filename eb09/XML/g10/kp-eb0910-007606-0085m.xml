                    Woodville, bishop of Salisbury, brother of Elizabeth Woodville, queen of Edward
                    IV. If so, he lost his father when he was only one year old; but his education
                    seems to have been carefully provided for. He was sent to Cambridge and studied
                    at Trinity Hall, where he greatly distinguished himself in the classics,
                    especially in Greek. He afterwards devoted himself to the canon and civil law,
                    in which subjects he attained so great a proficiency that no one could dispute
                    his pre-eminence. He received the degree of doctor of civil law in 1520, and of
                    canon law in the following year. Ere long his abilities attracted the notice of
                    Cardinal Wolsey, who made him his secretary, and in this capacity he is said to
                    have been with him at More Park in Hertfordshire, when the conclusion of the
                    celebrated treaty of the More brought Henry VIII. and the French ambassadors
                    thither. It is stated, and with great probability, that this was the occasion on
                    which he was first introduced to the king’s notice, but he does not appear to
                    have been actively engaged in Henry’s service till three years later. In that of
                    Wolsey, he undoubtedly acquired a very intimate knowledge of foreign politics,
                    and in 1527 he and Sir Thomas More were named commissioners on the part of
                    England in arranging a treaty with the French ambassadors for the support of an
                    army in Italy against the emperor. That year he accompanied Wolsey on his
                    important diplomatic mission to France, the splendour and magnificence of which
                    are so graphically described by Cavendish. Among the imposing train who went
                    with the cardinal—including, as it did, several noblemen and privy
                    councillors—Gardiner alone seeme to have been acquainted with the real heart of
                    the matter λvhich made this embassy a thing of such peculiar moment. Henry was
                    then particularly anxious to cement his alliance with Francis I., and gain his
                    co-operation as far as possible in the object on which he had secretly set his
                    heart—a divorce from Catherine of Aragon. In the course of his progress through
                    France he received orders from Henry to send back his secretary Gardiner, or, as
                    he was called at court, Master Stevens, for fresh instructions; to which he was
                    obliged to reply that he positively could not spare him as he was the only
                    instrument he had in advancing the king’s “secret matter.” Next year Gardiner,
                    though still nominally in the service of Wolsey, was sent to Italy along with
                    Edward Fox, provost of King’s College, Cambridge, to promote the same business
                    with the pope. His despatches on this occasion are still extant, and whatever we
                    may think of the cause on which he was engaged, they certainly give a wonderful
                    impression of the zeal and ability with which he discharged his functions. Here
                    his perfect familiarity with the canon law gave him an advantage over all with
                    whom he had to negotiate. Clement VII., who was then at Orvieto, and had just
                    recently escaped from captivity at St Angelo at the hands of the imperialists,
                    did not wish to offend the king of England, but was still more in dread of the
                    emperor. He only desired to temporize. But Gardiner would not allow him to take
                    refuge in an <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n86/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0086-0077"/> evasive policy. What was to be thought, he said,
                    of a spiritual guide who either could not or would not show the wanderer his way
                    <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi> The king and lords of England would be driven to think
                    that God had taken away from the Holy See the key of knowledge, and that
                    pontifical laws which were not clear to the pope himself might as well be
                    committed to the flames.</p>
                <p>In short, it was owing to Gardiner’s vigorous advocacy that the celebrated
                    commission was issued to Cardinals Wolsey and Campeggio to try the cause in
                    England. After obtaining it he was recalled, but early in the following year,
                    1529, as Campeggio delayed proceeding, he was sent once more to Rome. This time,
                    however, his efforts were unavailing. The pope would make no further
                    concessions, and would not even promise not to revoke the cause to Rome, as he
                    did very shortly after. Gardiner’s services, however, were fully appreciated. He
                    was appointed the king’s secretary. He had been already some years archdeacon of
                    Taunton, and the archdeaconry of Norfolk was added to it in March 1529, which
                    two years later he resigned for that of Leicester. In 1530 he was sent to
                    Cambridge to procure the decision of the university as to the unlawfulness of
                    marriage with a deceased brother’s wife, in accordance with the new plan devised
                    for settling the question without the pope’s intervention. In this he succeeded,
                    though not without a good deal of artifice, more creditable to his ingenuity
                    than to his virtue. In November 1531 the king rewarded him for his services with
                    the bishopric of Winchester, vacant by Wolsey’s death. The promotion was
                    unexpected, and was accompanied by expressions from the king which made it still
                    more honourable, as showing that if he had been in some things too subservient,
                    it was from no abject, self-seeking policy of his own. Gardiner had, in fact,
                    ere this remonstrated boldly with his sovereign on some points, and Henry now
                    reminded him of the fact. “I have often <hi rend="italic">squared</hi> with you,
                    Gardiner,” he said familiarly, “but I love you never the worse, as the bishopric
                    I give will convince you.” It must be owned, however, that his next
                    distinguished service was not a very creditable one; for he was, not exactly, as
                    is is often said, one of Cranmer’s assessors, but, according to Cranmer’s own
                    expression, “assistant” to him as counsel for the king, when the archbishop, in
                    the absence of Queen Catherine, pronounced her marriage with Henry null and void
                    on the 23d May 1533. Immediately afterwards he was sent over to Marseilles,
                    where an interview between the pope and Francis I. took place in September, of
                    which event Henry stood in great suspicion, as Francis was ostensibly his most
                    cordial ally, and had hitherto maintained the justice of his cause in the matter
                    of the divorce. Here he intimated the appeal of Henry VIII, to a general council
                    in case the pope should venture to proceed to sentence against him. He also made
                    a like appeal in behalf of Cranmer. Next year he and other bishops were called
                    upon to vindicate the king’s new title of “Supreme Head of the Church of
                    England,” The result was his celebrated treatise <hi rend="italic">De Vera
                    Obediential</hi> the ablest, certainly, of all the vindications of royal
                    supremacy. In 1535 he had an unpleasant dispute with Cranmer about the
                    visitation of his diocese. During the next few years he was engaged in various
                    embassies in France and Germany. He was indeed so much abroad that he had little
                    influence upon the king’s councils. But in 1539 he was much concerned in the
                    drawing up and passing through the House of Lords of the severe statute of the
                    Six Articles, which led to the resignation of Bishops Latimer and Shaxton and
                    the persecution of the whole Protestant party. In 1540, on the death of
                    Cromwell, earl of Essex, he was elected chancellor of the university of
                    Cambridge. A few years later he attempted, in concert with others, to fasten a
                    charge of heresy upon Archbishop Cranmer in connexion with the Act of the Six
                    Articles; and but for the personal intervention of the king he would probably
                    have succeeded. He was, in fact, though he had supported the royal supremacy, a
                    thorough opponent of the Reformation in a doctrinal point of view, and it was
                    suspected that he even repented his advocacy of the royal supremacy. He
                    certainly had not approved of Henry’s general treatment of the church,
                    especially during the ascendency of Cromwell, and he was frequently visited with
                    storms of royal indignation, which he schooled himself to bear with patience. In
                    1544 a relation of his own, named German Gardiner, whom he employed as his
                    secretary, was put to death for treason in reference to the king’s supremacy,
                    and his enemies insinuated to the king that he himself was of his secretary’s
                    way of thinking. But being warned of his danger he sought an interview with
                    Henry, in which he succeeded in clearing himself of all injurious imputations.
                    That he was party to a design against Queen Catherine Parr, whom the king was at
                    one time on the point of committing to the Tower, rests only upon the authority
                    of Foxe, and seems a little doubtful. It is certain, however, that his name was
                    omitted at the last in Henry VIII.’s will, though the king was believed to have
                    intended making him one of his executors.</p>
                <p>Under Edward VI. Gardiner was completely opposed to the policy of the dominant
                    party both in ecclesiastical and in civil matters. The religious changes he
                    objected to both on principle and on the ground of their being moved during the
                    king’s minority, and he resisted Cranmer’s project of a general visitation. His
                    remonstrances, however, were met by his own committal to the Fleet, and the
                    visitation of his diocese was held during his imprisonment. Though soon
                    afterwards released, it was not long before he was called before the council,
                    and, refusing to give them satisfaction on some points, was thrown into the
                    Tower, where he continued during the whole remainder of the reign, a period
                    slightly over five years. During this time he in vain demanded his liberty, and
                    to be called before parliament as a peer of the realm. His bishopric was taken
                    from him and given to Dr Poynet, a chaplain of Cranmer’s who had not long before
                    been made bishop of Rochester. At the accession of Queen Mary, the duke of
                    Norfolk and other state prisoners of high rank were in the Tower along with him;
                    but the queen, on her first entry into London, set them all at liberty. Gardiner
                    was restored to his bishopric and appointed lord chancellor, and he set the
                    crown on the queen’s head at her coronation. He also opened her first
                    parliament, and for some time was her leading councillor. He was now called
                    upon, at the age of seventy, to undo not a little of the work in which he had
                    been instrumental in his earlier years,—to vindicate the legitimacy of the
                    queen’s birth and the lawfulness of her mother’s marriage, to restore the old
                    religion, and to recant what he himself had written touching the royal
                    supremacy. At least this, it may be presumed, was the time when he wrote, if, as
                    we are told, he really did write, a <hi rend="italic">Palinodia</hi> or
                    retractation of his book <hi rend="italic">De Vera Obediential</hi> which,
                    however, does not seem to be now extant, so that how far he had changed his
                    sentiments we cannot very well judge. That he should have really changed them to
                    some extent is not at all unnatural; and in relation to the divorce of Catherine
                    of Aragon, we may well believe that it was his earlier and not his later action
                    that ever troubled his conscience. Yet as to the royal supremacy, it seems that
                    he would have advised Queen Mary to retain it; but her own desire was so great
                    to give up ecclesiastical jurisdiction to the pope that he could not press the
                    matter. A less agreeable task which fell to him was the negotiation of the
                    queen’s marriage treaty with Philip, to which he shared the general repugnance,
                    though he could not oppose her wilL <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n87/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0087-0078"/> In executing it, however, lie took care to make
                    the terms as advantageous for England as possible, and to make express provision
                    that the Spaniards should in nowise be allowed to interfere in the government of
                    the country. After the coming of Cardinal Pole, and the reconciliation of the
                    realm to the see of Rome, his influence suffered some eclipse, though he still
                    remained in high favour. How far he was responsible for the persecutions which
                    afterwards arose is a debated question. There is no doubt that he sat in
                    judgment on Bishop Hooper, and on several other Protestants whom he condemned to
                    the flames. But being placed on a commission along with a number of other
                    bishops to administer a severe law, it does not appear that he could very well
                    have acted otherwise. On the bench he is said to have used every effort to
                    induce the accused to make concessions and accept a pardon; and a remarkable
                    instance of his clemency is recorded by the church historian Fuller, who,
                    notwithstanding his prejudices, acknowledges a debt of gratitude to him for
                    preserving one of his own ancestors from the persecuting zeal of others. It
                    would seem, moreover, that when he saw the results of the cruel proceedings
                    against heretics, he very soon got tired of them. The persecutions raged with
                    the greatest vehemence during his absence at the Calais peace conferences in
                    1555, and when he came back he declared he would have no further hand in them,
                    so that those afterwards apprehended in his diocese were removed into that of
                    London in order to be adjudged to the flames. In October 1555 he again opened
                    parliament as lord chancellor, but towards the end of the month he fell ill and
                    grew rapidly worse till the 12th November, when he died about the age of
                    seventy-two.</p>
                <p>Perhaps no celebrated character of that age has been the subject of so much
                    ill-merited abuse at the hands of popular historians. That his virtue was not
                    equal to every trial may be admitted, but that he was anything like the morose
                    and narrow-minded bigot he is commonly represented there is nothing whatever to
                    show. He has been called ambitious, turbulent, crafty, abject, vindictive,
                    bloodthirsty, and a good many other things besides, not quite in keeping with
                    each other; in addition to which it is roundly asserted by Bishop Burnet that he
                    was despised alike by Henry and by Mary, both of whom made use of him as a tool.
                    How such a mean and abject character submitted to remain five years in prison
                    rather than change his principles is not very clearly explained; and as to his
                    being despised, we have seen already that Henry VIII., at least, did not
                    consider him despicable. The truth is, there is not a single divine or statesman
                    of that day whose course throughout was so thoroughly consistent. He was no
                    friend to the Reformation, it is true, but he was at least a conscientious
                    opponent. In doctrine he adhered to the old faith from first to last, while as a
                    question of church polity, the only matter for consideration with him was
                    whether the new laws and ordinances were constitutionally justifiable.</p>
                <p>His merits as a theologian it is unnecessary to discuss; it is as a statesman and
                    a lawyer that he stands conspicuous. But his learning even in divinity was far
                    from commonplace. The manual set forth in 1543 by royal and parliamentary
                    authority, entitled <hi rend="italic">A necessary Doctrine and Erudition for any
                    Christian Man,</hi> was chiefly from his pen; and at a later date he was the
                    author of various tracts in defence of the Real Presence against Cranmer, some
                    of which, being written in prison, were published abroad under a feigned name.
                    Controversial writings also passed between him and Bucer, with whom he had
                    several interviews in Germany, when he was there as Henry VIII.’s
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>He was a friend of learning in every form, and took great interest especially in
                    promoting the study of Greek at Cambridge. He was, however, opposed to the new
                    method of pronouncing the language introduced by Sir John Cheke, and wrote
                    letters to him and Sir Thomas Smith upon the subject, in which, according to
                    Ascham, his opponents showed themselves the better critics, but he the superior
                    genius. In his own household he loved to take in young university men of
                    promise; and many whom he thus encouraged became distinguished in after life as
                    bishops, ambassadors, and secretaries of state. His house, indeed, wa3 spoken of
                    by Leland as the seat of eloquence and the special abode of the muses.</p>
                <p>He lies buried in his own cathedral at Winchester, where his effigy is still to
                    be seen. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j. ga.)</hi></p>
