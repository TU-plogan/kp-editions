                <p>PART I.—PURE GEOMETRY.</p>
                <p><hi> GEOMETRY</hi> has been divided since the time of Euclid into an “elementary”
                    and a “higher” part. The contents and limits of the former have been fixed by
                    Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi> The latter included at the time of the
                    Greek mathematicians principally the properties of the conic sections and of a
                    few other curves. The methods used in both were essentially the same. These
                    began to be replaced during the 17 th century by more powerful methods, invented
                    by Roberval, Pascal, Desargues, and others. But the impetus which higher
                    geometry received in their works was soon arrested, in consequence of the
                    discoveries of Descartes,—the new calculus to which these gave rise absorbing
                    the attention of mathematicians almost exclusively, until Monge, at the end of
                    the 18th century, re-established “pure” as distinguished from Descartes’s
                    “coordinate” (or analytical) geometry. Since then the purely geometrical methods
                    have been continuously extended, especially by Poncelet, Steiner, Von Staudt,
                    and Cremona, and in England by Hirst and Henry Smith, to mention only a few of
                    the leading names.</p>
                <p>Whilst higher geometry thus made most rapid progress, the elementary part
                    remained almost unaltered. It has been taught up to the present day on the basis
                    of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> the latter being either used
                    directly as a textbook (in England), or being replaced (in most parts of the
                    Continent) by text-books which are essentially Euclid’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Elements</hi> rewritten, with a few additions about the mensuration of the
                    circle, cone, cylinder, and sphere. Only within a very recent period have
                    attempts been made to change the character of the elementary part by introducing
                    some of the modern methods.</p>
                <p>We shall give in this article—first, a survey of elementary geometry as contained
                    in Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> and then, in form of an independent
                    treatise, an introduction to higher geometry, based on modern methods. In the
                    former part we shall suppose that a copy of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Elements</hi> is in the hands of the reader, so that we may dispense, as a
                    rule, with giving proofs or drawing figures. We thus shall give only the
                    contents of his propositions grouped together in such a way as to show their
                    connexion, and often expressed in words which differ from the verbal translation
                    in order to make their meaning clear. It will make little difference which of
                    the many English editions of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> the reader
                    takes. Of these we may mention Simeon’s, Potts’s, and Todliunter’s.</p>

                <p>§ 1. The object of geometry is to investigate the properties of space. The first
                    step must consist in establishing those fundamental properties from which all
                    others follow by processes of deductive reasoning. They are laid down in the
                    Axioms, and these ought to form such a system that nothing need be added to them
                    in order fully to characterize space, and that nothing may be left out without
                    making the system incomplete. They must, in fact, completely “define” space.
                    Several such systems are conceivable. Euclid has given one, others have been put
                    forward in recent times by Riemann <hi rend="italic">(Abhandl.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">der königl.</hi><hi rend="italic">Gesellsch.</hi><hi

                    1844). How many axioms the system ought to contain» and which system is the
                    simplest, may be said to be still an open question. We shall consider only
                    Euclid s system.</p>
                <p>§ 2. The axioms are obtained from inspection of space and of solids in
                    space,—hence from experience. The same source gives us the notions of the
                    geometrical entities to which the axioms relate, viz., solids, surfaces, lines
                    or curves, and points. A solid is directly given by experience; we have only to
                    abstract all material from it in order to gain the notion of a geometrical
                    solid. This has shape, size, position, and may be moved. Its boundary or
                    boundaries are called surfaces. They separate one part of space from another,
                    and are said to have no thickness. Their boundaries are curves or lines, and
                    these have length only. Their boundaries, again, are points, which have no
                    magnitude but only position. We thus come in three steps from solids to points
                    which have no magnitude; in each step we lose one extension. Hence we say a
                    solid has three dimensions, a surface two, a line one, and a point none. Space
                    itself, of which a solid forms only a part, is also said to be of three
                    dimensions. The same thing is intended to be expressed by saying that a solid
                    has length, breadth, and thickness, a surface length and breadth, a line length
                    only, and a point no extension whatsoever.</p>
                <p>Euclid gives the essence of these statements as definitions :—</p>

                <p>If we allow motion in geometry,—and it seems impossible to avoid it,—we may
                    generate these entities by moving a point, a line, or a surface, thus :—</p>

                </table>
                <p>And we may then assume that the lines, surfaces, and solids, as defined before,
                    can all be generated in this manner. From this generation of the entities it
                    follows again that the boundaries—the first and last position of the moving
                    element—of a line are points, and so on; and thus wo come back to the
                    considerations with which we started.</p>
                <p>Euclid points this out in his definitions,—Def. 3, I., Def. 6, I., and Def. 2,
                    XI. He does not, however, show the connexion which these definitions have with
                    those mentioned before. When points and lines have been defined, a statement
                    like Def. 3, I., “The extremities of a line are points,” is a proposition which
                    either has to be proved, and then it is a theorem, or which has to be taken for
                    granted, in which case it is an axiom. And so with Def. 6, I., and Def. 2,
                    XI.</p>
                <p>§ 3. Euclid’s definitions mentioned above are attempts to describe, in a few
                    words, notions which we have obtained by inspection of and abstraction from
                    solids. A few more notions have to be added to these, principally those of the
                    simplest line—the straight line, and of the simplest surface —the flat surface
                    or plane. These notions we possess, but to define them accurately is difficult.
                    Euclid’s Definition 4, I., “A straight line is that which lies evenly between
                    its extreme points,” must be meaningless to any one who has not the notion of
                    straightness in his mind. Neither does it state a property of the straight line
                    which can be used in any further investigation. Such a property is given in
                    Axiom 10, I. It is really this axiom, together <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n390/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0390-0377"/> with Postulates 2 and 3, which characterizes
                    the straight line.</p>
                <p>Whilst for the straight line the verbal definition and axiom are kept apart,
                    Euclid mixes them up in the case of the plane. Here the Definition 7, L,
                    includes an axiom. It defines a plane as à surface which has the property that
                    every straight line which joins any two points in it lies altogether in the
                    surface. But if we take a straight line and a point in such a surface, and draw
                    all straight lines which join the latter to all points in the first line, the
                    surface will be fully determined. This construction is therefore sufficient as a
                    definition. That every other straight line which joins any two points in this
                    surface lies altogether in it is a further property, and to assume it gives
                    another axiom.</p>
                <p>Thus a number of Euclid’s axioms are hidden among his first definitions. A still
                    greater confusion exists in the present editions of Euclid between the
                    postulates and axioms so-called, but this is due to later editors and not to
                    Euclid himself. The latter had the last three axioms put together with the
                    postulates <hi rend="italic">(alτημaτfi),</hi> so that these were meant to
                    include all assumptions relating to space. The remaining assumptions which
                    relate to magnitudes in general, viz., the first eight “axioms” in modern
                    editions, were called “common notions” <hi rend="italic">(κoιvai</hi> twoιαι).
                    Of the latter a few may be said to be definitions. Thus the eighth might be
                    taken as a definition of “equal,” and the seventh of halves. If we wish to
                    collect the axioms used in Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> we have
                    therefore to take the three postulates, the last three axioms as generally
                    given, a few axioms hidden in the definitions, and an axiom used by Euclid in
                    the proof of Prop. 4 and on a few other occasions, viz., that figures may be
                    moved in space without change of shape or size.</p>
                <p>We shall not enter into the investigation how far the assumptions which would be
                    included in such a list are sufficient, and how far they are necessary. It may
                    be sufficient here to state that from the beginning of a geometrical science to
                    the present century attempts without end have been made to prove the last of
                    Euclid’s axioms, that only at the beginning of the present century the futility
                    of this attempt was shown, and that only within the last twenty years the true
                    nature of the connexion between the axioms has become known through the
                    researches of Riemann and Helmholz, although Grassmann had published already, in
                    1844, his classical but long-neglected <hi rend="italic">A usdehnungsleh
                        re.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 4. The assumptions actually made by Euclid may be stated as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. Straight lines exist which have the property that any one of them may be
                    produced both ways without limit, that through any two points in space such a
                    line may be drawn, and that any two of them coincide throughout their indefinite
                    extensions as soon as two points in the one coincide with two points in the
                    other. (This gives the contents of Def. 4, part of Def. 35, the first two
                    Postulates, and Axiom 10.)</p>
                <p>2. Plane surfaces or planes exist having the property laid down in Def. 7, that
                    every straight line joining any two points in such a surface lies altogether in
                    it.</p>
                <p>3. Right angles, as defined in Def. 10, are possible, and all right angles are
                    equal; that is to say, wherever in space we take a plane, and wherever in that
                    plane we construct a right angle, all angles thus constructed will be equal, so
                    that any one of them may be made to coincide with any other. (Axiom 11.)</p>
                <p>4. The 12th Axiom of Euclid. This we shall not state now, but only introduce it
                    when we cannot proceed any further without it.</p>
                <p>5. Figures may be . freely moved in space without change of shape or size. This
                    is assumed by Euclid, but not stated as an axiom.</p>
                <p>6. In any plane a circle may be described, having any point in that plane as
                    centre, and its distance from any other point in that plane as radius.
                    (Postulate 3.)</p>
                <p>The definitions which have not been mentioned are all “nominal definitions,” that
                    is to say, they fix a name for a thing described. Many of them overdetermine a
                    figure. (Compare notes to definitions in Simson’s or Todhunter’s edition.)</p>
                <p>§ 5. Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> are contained in thirteen books. Of
                    these the first four and the sixth are devoted to “plane geometry,” as the
                    investigation of figures in a plane is generally called. Tlιe õth book contains
                    the theory of proportion which is used in Book VI. The 7th, 8th, and 9th books
                    are purely arithmetical, whilst the 10th contains a most ingenious treatment of
                    geometrical irrational quantities. These four books will be excluded from our
                    survey. The remaining three books relate to figures in space, or, as it is
                    generally called, to “solid geometry.” The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, l3th, and part
                    of the 11th and 12th books are now generally omitted from the school editions of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi> In the first four and in the 6th book it is
                    to be understood that all figures are drawn in a plane.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> I. <hi rend="smallcaps">of Euclid’s
                        “Elements.”</hi></p>
                <p>§ 6. According to the third postulate it is possible to draw in any plane a
                    circle which has its centre at any given point, and its radius equal to the
                    distance of this point from any other point given in the plane. This makes it
                    possible (Prop. 1) to construct on a given line AB an equilateral triangle, by
                    drawing first a circle with A as centre and AB as radius, and then a circle with
                    B as centre and BA as radius. The point where these circles intersect—that they
                    intersect Euclid quietly assumes—is the vertex of the required triangle. Euclid
                    does not suppose, however, that a circle may be drawn which has its radius equal
                    to the distance between any two points unless one of the points be the centre.
                    This implies also that we are not supposed to be able to make any straight line
                    equal to any other straight line, or to carry a distance about in space. Euclid
                    therefore next solves the problem: It is required along a given straight line
                    from a point in it to set off a distance equal to the length of another straight
                    line given anywhere in the plane. This is done in two steps. It is shown in
                    Prop. 2 how a straight line may be drawn from a given point equal in length to
                    another given straight line not drawn from that point. And then the problem
                    itself is solved in Prop. 3, by drawing first through the given <hi
                        rend="superscript"> -</hi> point some straight line of the required length,
                    and then about the same point as centre a circle having this length as radius.
                    This circle will cut off from the given straight line a length equal to the
                    required one. Now-a-days, instead of going through this long process, we take a
                    pair of compasses and set off the given length by its aid. This assumes that we
                    may move a length about without changing it. But Euclid has not assumed it, and
                    this proceeding would be fully justified by his desire not to take for granted
                    more than was necessary, if he were not obliged at his very next step actually
                    to make this assumption, though without stating it.</p>
                <p>§ 7. We now come (in Prop. 4) to the first theorem. It is the fundamental theorem
                    of Euclid’s whole system, there being only a very few propositions (like Props.
                    13, 14,15, I.), except those in the 5th book and the first half of the 11th,
                    which do not depend upon it. It is stated very accurately, though somewhat
                    clumsily, as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides
                        of the other, each to each, and have also the angles contained by those
                        sides equal to one another, they shall also have their bases or third sides
                        equal; and the two triangles shall be equal; and their other angles shall be
                        equal, each to each, namely, those to which the equal sides are
                        opposite.</hi></p>
                <p>That is to say, the triangles are “identically” equal, and one may be considered
                    as a copy of the other. The proof is very simple. The first triangle is taken up
                    and placed on the second, so that the parts of the triangles which are known to
                    be equal fall upon each other. It is then easily seen that also the remaining
                    parts of one coincide with those of the other, and that they are therefore
                    equal. This process of applying one figure to another Euclid scarcely uses
                    again, though many proofs would be simplified by doing so. The process
                    introduces motion into geometry, and includes, as already stated, the axiom that
                    figures may be moved without change of shape or size.</p>
                <p>If the last proposition be applied to an isosceles triangle, which has two sides
                    equal, we obtain the theorem (Prop. 5), <hi rend="italic">if two sides of a
                        triangle are equal, then the angles opposite these sides are equal.</hi></p>
                <p>Euclid’s proof is somewhat complicated, and a stumbling-block to many schoolboys.
                    The proof becomes much simpler if we consider the isosceles triangle ABC (AB=AC)
                    twice over, once as a triangle BAG, and once as a triangle CAB; and now remember
                    that <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n391/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0391-0378"/> AB, AC in the first are equal respectively to
                    AC, AB in the second, and the angles included by these sides are equal. Hence
                    the triangles are equal, and the angles in the one are equal to those in the
                    other, viz., those which are opposite equal sides, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    angle ABC in the first equals angle ACB in the second, as they are opposite the
                    equal sides AC, and AB in the two triangles.</p>
                <p>There follows the converse theorem (Prop. 6). <hi rend="italic">If two angles in
                        a triangle are equal, then the sides opposite them are equal,—</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the triangle is isosceles. The proof given consists
                    in what is called a <hi rend="italic">reductio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">absurdum,</hi> a kind of proof often used by Euclid, and
                    principally in proving the converse of a previous theorem. It assumes that the
                    theorem to be proved is wrong, and then shows that this assumption leads to an
                    absurdity, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to a conclusion which is in
                    contradiction to a proposition proved before— that therefore the assumption made
                    cannot be true, and hence that the theorem is true. It is often stated that
                    Euclid invented this kind of proof, but the method is most likely much
                    older.</p>
                <p>§ 8. It is next proved <hi rend="italic">that two triangles which have the three
                        sides of the· one equal respectively to those of the other are identically
                        equal, hence that the angles of the one are equal respectively to those of
                        the other, those being equal which are opposite equal sides.</hi> This is
                    Prop. 8, Prop. 7 containing only a first step towards its proof.</p>
                <p>These theorems allow now of the solution of a number of problems, viz.:—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To bisect a given angle</hi> (Prop. 9).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To bisect a given finite straight line</hi> (Prop. 10).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To draw a straight line perpendicularly to a given straight
                        line through a given point in it</hi> (Prop. 11), <hi rend="italic">and also
                        through a given point not in it</hi> (Prop. 12).</p>
                <p>The solutions all depend upon properties of isosceles triangles.</p>
                <p>§ 9. The next three theorems relate to angles only, and might have been proved
                    before Prop. 4, or even at the very beginning. The first (Prop. 13) says, <hi
                        rend="italic">The angles which one straight line makes with another straight
                        line on one side of it either are two right angles or are together equal to
                        two right angles.</hi> This theorem would have been unnecessary if Euclid
                    had admitted the notion of an angle such that its two limits are in the same
                    straight line, and had besides defined the sum of two angles.</p>
                <p>Its converse (Prop. 14) is of great use, inasmuch as it enables us in many cases
                    to prove that two straight lines drawn from the same point are one the
                    continuation of the other. So also is</p>
                <p>Prop. 15. <hi rend="italic">If two straight lines cut one another, the vertical
                        or opposite angles shall be equal.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 10. Euclid returns now to properties of triangles. Of great importance for the
                    next steps (though afterwards superseded by a more complete theorem) is</p>
                <p>Prop. 16. <hi rend="italic">If one side of a triangle be produced, the exterior
                        angle shall be greater than either of the interior opposite angles.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 17, <hi rend="italic">Any two angles of a triangle are together less than
                        two right angles,</hi> is an immediate consequence of it. By the aid of
                    these two, the following fundamental properties of triangles are easily proved
                    :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 18. <hi rend="italic">The greater side of every triangle has the greater
                        angle opposite to it;</hi></p>
                <p>Its converse, Prop. 19. <hi rend="italic">The greater angle of every triangle is
                        subtended by the greater side, or has the greater side opposite to
                    it;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 20. <hi rend="italic">Any two sides of a triangle are together greater than
                        the third side;</hi></p>
                <p>And also Prop. 21. <hi rend="italic">If from the ends of the side of a triangle
                        there be drawn two straight lines to a point within the triangle, these
                        shall be less than the other two sides of the triangle, but shall contain a
                        greater angle.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 11. Having solved two problems (Props. 22,23), he returns to two triangles
                    which have two sides of the one equal respectively to two sides of the other. It
                    is known (Prop. 4) that if the included angles are equal then the third sides
                    are equal; and conversely (Prop. 8), if the third sides are equal, then the
                    angles included by the first sides are equal. From this it follows that if the
                    included angles are not equal, the third sides are not equal, and conversely,
                    that if the third sides are not equal, the included angles are not equal. Euclid
                    now completes this knowledge by proving, that <hi rend="italic">“if the included
                        angles are not equal, then the third side in that triangle is the greater
                        which contains the greater angle;"</hi> and conversely, that <hi
                        rend="italic">“if the third sides are unequal, that triangle contains the
                        grecder angle which contains the greater side"</hi> These are Prop. 24 and
                    Prop. 25.</p>
                <p>§ 12. The next theorem (Prop. 26) says thati/ <hi rend="italic">two triangles
                        have one side and two angles of the one equal respectively to one side and
                        two angles of the other, viz., in both triangles either the angles adjacent
                        to the equal side, or one angle adjacent and one angle opposite it, then the
                        two triangles are identically equal.</hi></p>
                <p>This theorem belongs to a group with Prop. 4 and Prop. 8. Its first case might
                    have been given immediately after Prop. 4, but the second case requires Prop. 16
                    for its proof.</p>
                <p>§ 13. We come now to the investigation of parallel straight lines, i.e., of
                    straight lines which lie in the same plane, and cannot be made to meet however
                    far they be produced either way. The investigation, which starts from Prop. 16,
                    will become clearer if a few names be explained which are not all used by
                    Euclid. If two straight lines be cut by a third, the latter is now generally
                    called a “transversal” of the figure. It forms at the two points where it cuts
                    the given lines four angles with each. Those of the angles which lie between the
                    given lines are called interior angles, and of these, again, any two which lie
                    on opposite sides of the transversal but one at each of the two points are
                    called “alternate angles.”</p>
                <p>We may now state Prop. 16 thus :— <hi rend="italic">If two straight lines which
                        meet are cut by a transversal, their alternate angles are unequal.</hi> For
                    the lines will form a triangle, and one of the alternate angles will be an
                    exterior angle to the triangle, the other interior and opposite to it.</p>
                <p>From this follows at once the theorem contained in Prop. 27. <hi rend="italic">If
                        two straight lines which are cut by a transversal make alternate angles
                        equal, the lines cannot meet, however far they be produced, hence they are
                        parallel.</hi> This proves the existence of parallel lines.</p>
                <p>Prop. 28 states the same fact in different forms. <hi rend="italic">If a
                        straight</hi><hi rend="italic">Une,</hi><hi rend="italic">falling on two
                        other straight lines, make the exterior angle equal to the interior and
                        opposite angle on the same side of the line, or make the interior angles on
                        the same side together equal to two right angles, the two straight lines
                        shall be parallel to one another.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence we know that, “if two straight lines which are cut by a transversal meet,
                    their alternate angles are not equal”; and hence that, “if alternate angles are
                    equal, then the lines are parallel.”</p>
                <p>The question now arises, Are the propositions converse to these true or not? That
                    is to say, ‘ ‘ If alternate angles are unequal, do the lines meet?” And “if the
                    lines are parallel, are alternate angles necessarily equal ?”</p>
                <p>The answer to either of these two questions implies the answer to the other. But
                    it has been found impossible to prove that the negation or the affirmation of
                    either is true.</p>
                <p>The difficulty which thus arises is overcome by Euclid assuming that the first
                    question has to be answered in the affirmative. This gives his last axiom (12),
                    which we quote in his own words.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Axiom</hi> 12.— <hi rend="italic">If a straight line meet
                        two straight lines, so as to make the two Ulterior angles on the same side
                        of it taken together less than two right angles, these straight lines, being
                        continually produced, shall at length meet on that side on which are the
                        angles which are less than two right angles.</hi></p>
                <p>The answer to the second of the above questions follows from this, and gives the
                    theorem Prop. 29. <hi rend="italic">If a straight line fall on two parallel
                        straight lines, it makes the alternate angles equal to one another, and the
                        exterior</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi><hi rend="italic">angle equal to the
                        interior and opposite angle on the same side, and also the two interior
                        angles on the same side together equal to two right angles.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 14. With this a new part of elementary geometry begins. The earlier
                    propositions are independent of this axiom, and would be true even if a wrong
                    assumption had been made in it. They all relate to figures in a plane. But a
                    plane is only one among an infinite number of conceivable surfaces. We may draw
                    figures on any one of them and study their properties. We may, for instance,
                    take a sphere instead of the plane, and obtain “spherical” in the place of
                    “plane” geometry. If on one of these surfaces lines and figures could be drawn,
                    answering to all the definitions of our plane figures, and if the axioms with
                    the exception of the last all hold, then all propositions up to the 28th will be
                    true for these figures. This is the case in spherical geometry if we substitute
                    “shortest line” or “great circle” for “straight line,” “small circle” for
                    “circle,” and if, besides, we limit all figures to a part of the sphere which is
                    less than a hemisphere, so that two points on it cannot be opposite ends of a
                    diameter, and therefore determine always one and only one great circle.</p>
                <p>For spherical triangles, therefore, all the important propositions 4, 8, 26; 5
                    and 6; and 18, 19, and 20 will hold good.</p>
                <p>This remark will be sufficient to show the impossibility of proving Euclid’s last
                    axiom, which would mean proving that this axiom is a consequence of the others,
                    and hence that the theory of parallels would hold on a spherical surface, where
                    the other axioms do hold, whilst parallels do not even exist.</p>
                <p>It follows that the axiom in question states an inherent difference between the
                    plane and other surfaces, and that the plane is only fully characterized when
                    this axiom is added to the other assumptions.</p>
                <p>§ 15. The introduction of the new axiom and of parallel lines leads to a new
                    class of propositions.</p>
                <p>After proving (Prop. 30) that <hi rend="italic">“two lines which are each
                        parallel to a third are parallel to each other</hi>,” we obtain the new
                    properties of triangles contained in Prop. 32. Of these the second part is the
                    most important, viz., the theorem, <hi rend="italic">The three interior angles
                        of every triangle are together equal to two right angles.</hi></p>
                <p>As easy deductions not given by Euclid but added by Simson follow the
                    propositions about the angles in polygons, they are given in English editions as
                    corollaries to Prop. 32.</p>
                <p>These theorems do not hold for spherical figures. The sum of the interior angles
                    of a spherical triangle is always greater than two right angles, and increases
                    with the area.</p>

                <p>§ 16. The theory of parallels as such may be said to be finished with Props. 33
                    and 34, which state properties of the parallelogram, i.e., of a quadrilateral
                    formed by two pairs of parallels. They are—</p>
                <p>Prop. 33. <hi rend="italic">The straight lines which join the extremities of two

                        equal to one another, and the diameter {diagonal) bisects the parallelogram,
                        that is, divides it into two equal parts.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 17. The rest of the first book relates to areas of figures.</p>
                <p>The theory is made to depend upon the theorems—</p>
                <p>Prop. 35. <hi rend="italic">Parallelograms on the same base and between the same
                        parallels are equal to one another</hi>; and</p>

                        parallels, are equal to. one another.</hi></p>
                <p>As each parallelogram is bisected by a diagonal, the last theorems hold also if
                    the -word parallelogram be replaced by “triangle,” as is done in Props. 37 and
                    38.</p>
                <p>It is to be remarked that Euclid proves these propositions only in the case when
                    the parallelograms or triangles have their bases in the same straight line.</p>
                <p>The theorems converse to the last form the contents of the next three
                    propositions, viz. :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Props. 40 and 41).— <hi rend="italic">Equal
                        triangles, on the same or on equal bases, in the same straight line, and on
                        the same side of it, are between the same parallels.</hi></p>
                <p>That the two cases here stated are given by Euclid in two separate propositions
                    proved separately is characteristic of his method.</p>
                <p>§ 18. To compare areas of other figures, Euclid shows first, in Prop. 42, how <hi
                        rend="italic">to draw a parallelogram which is equal in area to a given
                        triangle, and has one of its angles equal to a given angle.</hi> If the
                    given angle is right, then the problem is solved <hi rend="italic">to draw a
                        “rectangle” equal in area to a given triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>Next this parallelogram is transformed into another parallelogram, <hi
                        rend="italic">which has one of its sides equal to a given straight
                        line,</hi> whilst its angles remain unaltered. This may be done by aid of
                    the theorem in</p>
                <p>Prop. 43. <hi rend="italic">The complements of the parallelograms which are about
                        the diameter of any parallelogram are equal to one another.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus the problem (Prop. 44) is solved <hi rend="italic">to construct a
                        parallelogram on a given line, which is equal in area to a given triangle,
                        and which has one angle equal to a given angle</hi> (generally a right
                    angle).</p>
                <p>As every polygon can be divided into a number of triangles, we can now construct
                    a parallelogram having a given angle, say a right angle, and being equal in area
                    to a given polygon. For each of the triangles into which the polygon has been
                    divided, a parallelogram may be constructed, having one side equal to a given
                    straight line, and one angle equal to a given angle. If these parallelograms be
                    placed side by side, they may be added together to form a single parallelogram,
                    having still one side of the given length. This is done in Prop. 45.</p>
                <p>Herewith a means is found to compare areas of different polygons. We need only
                    construct two rectangles equal in area to the given polygons, and having each
                    one side of given length. By comparing the unequal sides we are enabled to judge
                    whether the areas are equal, or which is the greater. Euclid does not state this
                    consequence, but the problem is taken up again at the end of the second book,
                    where it is shown how to construct a square equal in area to a given
                    polygon.</p>
                <p>§ 19. The first book concludes with one of the most important theorems in the
                    whole of geometry, and one which has been celebrated since the earliest times.
                    It is stated, but on doubtful authority, that Pythagoras discovered it, and it
                    has been called by his name. If we call that side in a right-angled triangle
                    λvhich is opposite the right angle the hypotenuse, we may state it as follows
                    :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem of Pythagoras</hi> (Prop. 47).— <hi rend="italic">In
                        every right-angled triangle the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum
                        of the squares of the other sides.</hi></p>
                <p>And conversely—</p>
                <p>Prop. 48. <hi rend="italic">If the square described on one of the sides of a
                        triangle be equal to the squares described on the other sides, then the
                        angle contained by these two sides is a right angle.</hi></p>
                <p>On this theorem (Prop. 47) almost all geometrical measurement depends, which
                    cannot be directly obtained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> II.</p>
                <p>§ 20. The propositions in the second book are very different in character from
                    those in the first; they all relate to areas of rectangles and squares. Their
                    true significance is best seen by stating them in an algebraic form. This is
                    often done by expressing the lengths of lines by aid of numbers, which tell how
                    many times a chosen unit is contained in the lines. If there is a unit to be
                    found which <hi rend="italic">is</hi> contained an exact number of times in each
                    side of a rectangle, it is easily seen, and generally shown in the teaching of
                    arithmetic, that the rectangle contains a number of unit squares equal to the
                    product of the numbers which measure the sides, a unit square being the square
                    on the unit line. If, however, no such unit can be found, this process requires
                    that connexion between lines and numbers which is only established by aid of
                    ratios of lines, and which is therefore at this stage altogether inadmissible.
                    But there exists another way of connecting these propositions with algebra,
                    based on modem notions which seem destined greatly to change and to simplify
                    mathematics. We shall introduce here as much of it as is required for our
                    present purpose.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the second book we find a definition according to which “a
                    rectangle is said tobe ‘ contained* by the two sides which contain one of its
                    right angles”; in the text this phraseology is extended by speaking of
                    rectangles contained by any two straight lines, meaning the rectangle which has
                    two adjacent sides equal to the two straight lines.</p>
                <p>We shall denote a finite straight line by a single small letter, <hi
                        rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">. . . .</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >x,</hi> and the area of the rectangle contained by two lines <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> by <hi rend="italic"
                        >ab,</hi> and this we shall call the product of the two lines <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> It will be understood
                    that this definition has nothing to do with the definition of a product of
                    numbers.</p>
                <p>We define as follows :—</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sum</hi> of two straight lines <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi> means a straight line <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    which may be divided in two parts equal respectively to <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> This sum is denoted by <hi rend="italic"
                        >a-</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> s</hi><hi rend="italic">rb.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">difference of two</hi> lines <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (in symbols, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>- δ) means a
                    line <hi rend="italic">c</hi> which when added to <hi rend="italic">b</hi> gives
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi>; that is,</p>
                <p>α- <hi rend="italic">b=c</hi> if <hi rend="italic">b+c≈a.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">product</hi> of two lines <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> (in symbols, <hi rend="italic">ab)</hi> means the area
                    of the rectangle contained by the lines <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">b.</hi> For <hi rend="italic">aa,</hi> which means the square
                    on the line <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> we write α <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>.</p>
                <p>§ 21. The first ten of the fourteen propositions of the second book may then be
                    written in the form of formulae as follows :—</p>

                <p>It will be seen that 5 and 6, and also 9 and 10, are identical. In Euclid’s
                    statement they do not look the same, the figures being arranged differently.</p>
                <p>If the letters <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">. .</hi>. denoted
                    numbers', it follows from algebra that each of these formulae is true. But this
                    does not prove them in our case, where the letters denote lines, and their
                    products areas without any reference to numbers. To prove them we have to
                    discover the laws which rule the operations introduced, viz., addition and
                    multiplication of segments. This we shall do now; and we shall find that these
                    laws are the same with those which hold in algebraical addition and
                    multiplication.</p>
                <p>§ 22. In a sum of numbers we may change the order in which the numbers are added,
                    and we may also add the numbers together in groups, and then add these groups.
                    But this also holds for the sum of segments and for the sum of rectangles, as a
                    little consideration shows. That the sum of rectangles has always a meaning
                    follows from the Props. 43-45 in the first book. These laws about addition are
                    reducible to the two—</p>

                <p>For the product of two numbers we have the law that it remains unaltered if the
                    factors be interchanged. This also holds for our geometrical product. For if <hi

                        rend="italic">a</hi> as base and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> as altitude, then
                        <hi rend="italic">ba</hi> will denote the area of the rectangle which has
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi> as base and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> as altitude.
                    But in a rectangle we may take either of the two lines which contain it as base,
                    and then the other will be the altitude. This gives</p>

                <p>In order further to multiply a sum by a number, we have in algebra the
                    rule:—Multiply each term of the sum, and add the products thus obtained. That
                    this holds for our geometrical products is shown by Euclid in his first
                    proposition of the second book, where he proves that the area of a rectangle

                <p>To these laws which have been investigated by Sir William Hamilton and by Hermann
                    Grassmann, the former has given special names. He calls the laws expressed
                    in</p>

                <p>§ 23. Having proved that these six laws hold, we can at once prove every one of
                    the above propositions in their algebraical form.</p>
                <p>The first is proved geometrically, it being one of the fundamental laws. The next
                    two propositions are only special cases of the first. Of the others we shall
                    prove one, viz., the fourth:— (α÷δ) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = (α + δ) (α

                <p>This gives the theorem in question.</p>
                <p>In the same manner every one of the first ten propositions is proved.</p>
                <p>It will be seen that the operations performed are exactly the same as if the
                    letters denoted numbers.</p>
                <p>Props. 5 and 6 may also be written thus—</p>

                <p>Prop. 7, which is an easy consequence of Prop. 4, may be transformed. If we

                    that <hi rend="italic">c=a + b,</hi><hi rend="italic">a≈c-b,</hi> we get c <hi

                <p>Subtracting c <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> from both sides, and writing <hi

                <p>Tn Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> this form of the theorem does not
                    appear, all propositions being so stated that the notion of subtraction does not
                    enter into them.</p>
                <p>§ 24. The remaining two theorems (Props. 12 and 13) connect the square on one
                    side of a triangle with the sum of the squares on the other sides, in case that
                    the angle between the latter is acute or obtuse. They are important theorems in
                    trigonometry, where it is possible to include them in a single theorem.</p>
                <p>§ 25. There are in the second-book two problems, Props. 11 and 14.</p>
                <p>If written in the above symbolic language, the former requires to find a line <hi
                        rend="italic">x</hi> such that <hi rend="italic">a(ax)-x</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >.</hi> Prop. 11 contains, therefore, the solution of a quadratic equation,
                    which we may write <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                        2</hi><hi rend="italic">+ ax =</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> The solution is
                    required later on in the construction of a regular decagon.</p>
                <p>More important is the problem in the last proposition (Prop. 14). It requires the
                    construction of a square equal in area to a given rectangle, hence a solution of
                    the equation x <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = <hi rend="italic">ab.</hi></p>
                <p>In Book I., 42-45, it has been shown how a rectangle may be constructed equal in
                    area to a given figure bounded by straight lines. By aid of the new proposition
                    we may therefore now determine a line such that the square on that line is equal
                    in area to any given rectilinear figure, or we can <hi rend="italic">square</hi>
                    any such figure.</p>
                <p>As of two squares that is the greater which has the greater side, it follows that
                    now the comparison of two areas has been reduced to the comparison of two
                    lines.</p>
                <p>The problem of reducing other areas to squares is frequently met with among Greek
                    mathematicians. We need only mention the problem of squaring the circle.</p>
                <p>In the present day the comparison of areas is performed in a simpler way by
                    reducing all areas to rectangles having a common base. Their altitudes give then
                    a measure of their areas.</p>
                <p>The construction of a rectangle having the base <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> and
                    being equal in area to a given rectangle, depends upon Prop. 43, L This
                    therefore gives a solution of the equation <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">ux,</hi> where <hi rend="italic"
                        >x</hi> denotes the unknown altitude.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> III.</p>
                <p>§ 26. The third book of the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> relates exclusively
                    to properties of the circle. A circle and its circumference have been defined in
                    Book I., Def. 15. We restate it here in slightly different words :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> The circumference of a circle is a plane
                    curve such that all points in it have the same distance from a fixed point in
                    the plane. This point is called the “centre” of the circle.</p>
                <p>Of the new definitions, of which eleven are given at the beginning of the third
                    book, a few only require special mention. The first, which says that circles
                    with equal radii are equal, is in part a theorem, but easily proved by applying
                    the one circle to the other. Or it may be considered proved by aid of Prop. 24,
                    equal circles not being used till after this theorem.</p>
                <p>In the second definition is explained what is meant by a line which “touches” a
                    circle. Such a line is now generally called a tangent to the circle. The
                    introduction of this name allows us to state many of Euclid’s propositions in a
                    much shorter form.</p>
                <p>For the same reason we shall call a straight line joining two points on the
                    circumference of a circle a “chord.”</p>
                <p>Definitions 4 and 5 may be replaced with a slight generalization by the following
                    :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> By the distance of a point from a line is
                    meant the length of the perpendicular drawn from the point to the line.</p>
                <p>§ 27. From the definition of a circle it follows that every circle has a centre.
                    Prop. 1 requires to find it when the circle is given, <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> when its circumference is drawn.</p>
                <p>To solve this problem a chord is drawn (that is, any two points in the
                    circumference are joined), and through the point where this is bisected a
                    perpendicular to it is erected. Euclid then proves, first, that no point off
                    this perpendicular can be the centre, hence that the centre must lie in this
                    line; and, secondly, that of the points on the perpendicular one only can be the
                    centre, viz., the one which bisects the part of the perpendicular bounded by the
                    circle. In the second part Euclid silently assumes that the perpendicular there
                    used does cut the circumference in two, and only in two points. The proof
                    therefore is incomplete. The proof of the first part, however, is exact. By
                    drawing two non-parallel chords, and the perpendiculars which bisect them, the
                    centre will be found as the point where these perpendiculars intersect.</p>
                <p>§ 28. In Prop. 2 it is proved that a chord of a circle lies altogether within the
                    circle.</p>
                <p>What we have called the first part of Euclid’s solution of Prop. 1 may be stated
                    as a theorem :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Every straight line which
                        bisects a chord, and is at right angles to it, passes through the centre of
                        the circle.</hi></p>
                <p>The converse to this gives Prop. 3, which may be stated thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If a straight line through the centre of a circle bisect a
                        chord, then it is perpendicular to the chord, and if it be perpendicular to
                        the chord it bisects it.</hi></p>
                <p>An easy consequence of this is the following theorem, which is essentially the
                    same as Prop. 4 :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Prop. 4).— <hi rend="italic">Two chords of a
                        circle, of which neither passes through the centre, cannot bisect each
                        other.</hi></p>
                <p>These last three theorems are fundamental for the theory of the circle. It is to
                    be remarked that Euclid never proves that a straight line cannot have more than
                    two points in common with a circumference.</p>
                <p>§ 29. The next two propositions (5 and 6) might be replaced by a single and a
                    simpler theorem, viz. :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Two circles which have a
                        common centre, and whose circumferences have one point in common,
                        coincide.</hi></p>
                <p>Or, more in agreement with Euclid’s form:—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Two different circles, whose
                        circumferences have a point in common, cannot have the same centre.</hi></p>
                <p>That Euclid treats of two cases is characteristic of Greek mathematics.</p>
                <p>The next two propositions (7 and 8) again belong together. They may be combined
                    thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If from a point in a plane
                        of a circle, which is not the centre, straight lines be drawn to the
                        different points of the circumference, then of all these lines one is the
                        shortest, and one the longest, and these lie both in that straight line
                        which joins the given point to the centre. Of all the remaining lines each
                        is equal to one and only one other, and these equal lines lie on opposite
                        sides of the shortest or longest, and make equal angles with them.</hi></p>
                <p>Euclid distinguishes the two cases where the given point lies within or without
                    the circle, omitting the case where it lies in the circumference.</p>
                <p>From the last proposition it follows that if from a point more than two equal
                    straight lines can be drawn to the circumference, this point must be the centre.
                    This is Prop. 9.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of this we get <hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">If the circumferences of the two circles have three points in
                        common they coincide.</hi></p>
                <p>For in this case the two circles have a common centre, because from the centre of
                    the one three equal lines can be drawn to points on the circumference of the
                    other. But two circles which have a common centre, and whose circumferences have
                    a point in common, coincide. (Compare above statement of Props. 5 and 6. ) <pb

                        rend="italic">tιvo</hi><hi rend="italic">points</hi> (Prop. 10), and <hi
                        rend="italic">that two circles cannot touch one another in more points than
                        one</hi> (Prop. 13).</p>
                <p>§ 30. Propositions 11 and 12 assert that <hi rend="italic">if two circles touch,
                        then the point of contact lies on the line joining their centres.</hi> This
                    gives two propositions, because the circles may touch either internally or
                    externally.</p>
                <p>§ 31. Propositions 14 and 15 relate to the length of chords. The first says; <hi
                        rend="italic">that equal chords are equidistant from the centre,and that
                        chords which are equidistant from the centre are equal;</hi></p>
                <p>Whilst Prop. 15 compares unequal chords, viz., <hi rend="italic">Of all chords
                        the diameter is the greatest, and of other chords that is the greater which
                        is nearer to the centre</hi>; and conversely, <hi rend="italic">the greater
                        chord is nearer to the centre.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 32. In Prop. 16 the tangent to a circle is for the first time introduced. The
                    proposition is meant to show that the straight line at the end point of the
                    diameter, and at right angles to it is a tangent. The proposition itself does
                    not state this. It runs thus :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 16. <hi rend="italic">The straight line drawn at right angles to the
                        diameter of a circle, from the extremity of it, falls without the circle;
                        and no straight line can be drawn from the extremity, between that straight
                        line and the circumference, so as not to cut the circle.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Corollary.—</hi> The straight line at right angles to a
                    diameter drawn through the end point of it touches the circle.</p>
                <p>The statement of the proposition and its whole treatment show the difficulties
                    which the tangents presented to Euclid.</p>
                <p>Prop. 17 solves the problem <hi rend="italic">through a given point, cither in
                        the circumference or without it, to draw a tangent to a given
                    circle.</hi></p>
                <p>Closely connected with Prop. 16 are Props. 18 and 19, which state (Prop. 18), <hi
                        rend="italic">that the line joining the centre of a circle to the point of
                        contact of a tangent is perpendicular to the tangent</hi>; and conversely
                    (Prop. 19), <hi rend="italic">that the straight line through the point of
                        contact of, and perpendicular to, a tangent to a circle passes through the
                        centre of the circle.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 33. The rest of the book relates to angles connected with a circle, viz.,
                    angles which have the vertex either at the centre or on the circumference, and
                    which are called respectively angles at the centre and angles at the
                    circumference. Between these two kinds of angles exists the important relation
                    expressed as follows :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 20. <hi rend="italic">The angle at the centre of a circle is double of the
                        angle at the circumference on the same base, that is, on the same
                    arc.</hi></p>
                <p>This is of great importance for its consequences, of which the two following are
                    the principal :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 21. <hi rend="italic">The angles in. the same segment of a circle are equal
                        to one another·,</hi></p>
                <p>And Prop. 22. <hi rend="italic">The opposite angles of any quadrilateral figure
                        inscribed in a circle are together equal to two right angles.</hi></p>
                <p>Further consequences are :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 23. <hi rend="italic">On the same straight line, and on the same side oj
                        it, there cannot be two similar segments of circles, not coinciding with me
                        another;</hi></p>
                <p>And Prop. 24. <hi rend="italic">Similar segments of circles on equal straight
                        lines are equal to one another.</hi></p>
                <p>The problem Prop. 25, <hi rend="italic">A segment of a circle being given to
                        describe the circle of which it is a segment,</hi> may be solved much more
                    easily by aid of the construction described in relation to Prop. 1, III., in
                    §27.</p>
                <p>§ 34. There follow four theorems connecting the angles at the centre, the arcs
                    into which they divide the circumference, and the chords subtending these arcs.
                    They are expressed for angles, arcs, and chords in equal circles, but they hold
                    also for angles, arcs, and chords in the same circle.</p>
                <p>The theorems are :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 26. <hi rend="italic">In equal circles equal angles stand on equal arcs,
                        whether they be at the centres or circumferences;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 27 (converse to Prop. 26). <hi rend="italic">In equal circles the angles
                        which stand on equal arcs are equal to one another, whether they be at the
                        centres or the circumferences·,</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 28. <hi rend="italic">In equal circles equal straight lines</hi> (equal
                    chords) <hi rend="italic">cut off equal arcs, the greater equal to the greater,
                        and the less equal to the less;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 29 (converse to Prop. 28). <hi rend="italic">In equal circles equal arcs
                        are subtended by equal straight lines.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 35. Other important consequences of Props. 20-22 are :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 31. <hi rend="italic">In a circle the angle in a semicircle is a right
                        angle; but the angle in a segment greater than a semicircle is less than a
                        right amgle; and the angle in a segment less than a semicircle is greater
                        than a right angle;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 32. <hi rend="italic">If a straight line touch a circle, and from the point
                        of contact a straight line be drawn cutting the circle, the angles which
                        this</hi><hi rend="italic">Une</hi><hi rend="italic">makes wiih the line
                        touching the circle shall be equal to the angles which are in the alternate
                        segments of the circle.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 36. Propositions 30, 33, 34, contain problems which are solved by aid of the
                    propositions preceding them :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 30. <hi rend="italic">To bisect a given arc, that is, to divide it into two
                        equal parts;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 33. <hi rend="italic">On a given straight line to describe a segment of a
                        circle containing an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 34. <hi rend="italic">From a given circle to cut off a segment containing
                        an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 37. If we draw chords through a point A within a circle, they will each be
                    divided by A into two segments. Between these segments the law holds that the
                    rectangle contained by them has the same area on whatever chord through A the
                    segments are taken. The value of this rectangle changes, of course, with the
                    position of A.</p>
                <p>A similar theorem holds if the point A be taken without the circle. On every
                    straight line through A, which cuts the circle in two points B and C, we have
                    two segments AB and AC, and the rectangles contained by them are again equal to
                    one another, and equal to the square on a tangent drawn from A to the
                    circle.</p>
                <p>The first of these theorems gives Prop. 35, and the second Prop. 36, with its
                    corollary, whilst Prop. 37, the last of Book III., gives the converse to Prop.
                    36.' The first two theorems may be combined in one :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If through a point A inthe
                        plane of acircle astraight line be drawn cutting the circle in B and C, then
                        the rectangle ABAC has a constant value so long as the point A be fixed; and
                        if from A a tangent AD can be drawn to the circle, touching at D, then the
                        above rectangle equals the square bn AD.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 37 may be stated thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If from a point A without a
                        circle a line be drawn cutting the circle in B and C, and another line to a
                        point D on the circle, and if</hi><hi rend="italic">AB.AC=AD</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >then the line AD touches the circle at D.</hi></p>
                <p>It is not difficult to prove also the converse to the general proposition as
                    above stated. It may be expressed as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Iffour points ABCD be taken on the circumference of a circle,
                        and if the lines AB, CD, produced if necessary, meet at E, then</hi></p>
                <p>EA . EB = EC . ED; <hi rend="italic">and conversely, if this relation holds then
                        the four points lie on a circle, that is, the circle drawn through three of
                        them passes through the fourth.</hi></p>
                <p>That a circle may always be drawn through three points, provided that they do not
                    lie in a straight line, is proved only later on in Book IV.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> IV.</p>
                <p>§ 38. The fourth book contains only problems, all relating to the construction of
                    triangles and polygons inscribed in and circumscribed about circles, and of
                    circles inscribed in or circumscribed about triangles and polygons. They are
                    nearly all given for their own sake, and not for future use in the construction
                    of figures, as are most of those in the former books. In seven definitions at
                    the beginning of the book it is explained what is understood by figures
                    inscribed in or described about other figures, with special reference to the
                    case where one figure is a circle. Instead, however, of saying that one figure
                    is described about another, it is now generally said that the one figure is
                    circumscribed about the other. We may then state the definitions 3 or 4 thus
                    :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> A polygon is said to be inscribed in a
                    circle, and the circle is said to be circumscribed about the polygon, if the
                    vertices of the polygon lie in the circumference of the circle.</p>
                <p>And definitions 5 and 6 thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> A polygon is said to be circumscribed about a
                    circle, and a circle is said to be inscribed in a polygon, if the sides of the
                    polygon are tangents to the circle.</p>
                <p>§ 39. The first problem is merely constructive. It requires to draw in a given
                    circle a chord equal to a given straight line, which is not greater than the
                    diameter of the circle. The problem is not a determinate one, inasmuch as the
                    chord may be drawn from any point in the circumference. This may be said of
                    almost all problems in this book, especially of the next two. They are :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 2. <hi rend="italic">In a given circle to inscribe a triangle equiangular
                        to a given triangle;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 3. <hi rend="italic">About a given circle to circumscribe a triangle
                        equiangular to a given triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 40. Of somewhat greater interest are the next problems, where the triangles are
                    given and the circles to be found.</p>
                <p>Prop. 4. <hi rend="italic">To inscribe a circle in a given triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>The result is that the problem has always a solution, viz., the centre of the
                    circle is the point where the bisectors of two of the nterior angles of the
                    triangle meet. The solution shows, though Euclid does not state this, that the
                    problem has but one solution; and also, <hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">The three bisectors of the interior angles of any
                        triangle</hi><pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n395/mode/1up"

                        the centre of the circle inscribed in the triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>The solutions of most of the other problems contain also theorems. Of these we
                    shall state those which are of special interest; Euclid does not state any one
                    of them.</p>
                <p>§ 41. Prop. 5. <hi rend="italic">To circumscribe a circle about a given
                        triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>The one solution which always exists contains the following :— <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">The three straight lines
                        which bisect the sides of a triangle at right angles meet in a point, and
                        this point is the centre of the circle circu mscribed about the
                        triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>Euelid adds in a corollary the following property :—</p>
                <p>The centre, of the circle circumscribed about a triangle lies within, on a side
                    of, or without the triangle, according as the triangle is acute-angled,
                    right-angled, or obtuse-angled.</p>
                <p>§ 42. Whilst it is always possible to draw a circle which is inscribed in or
                    circumscribed about a given triangle, this is not the case with quadrilaterals
                    or polygons of more sides. Of those for which this is possible the regular
                    polygons are the most interesting. In each of them a circle may be inscribed,
                    and another may be circumscribed about it.</p>
                <p>Euclid does not use the word regular, but he describes the polygons in question
                    as <hi rend="italic">equiangular</hi> and <hi rend="italic">equilateral.</hi> We
                    shall use the name regular polygon. The regular triangle is equilateral, the
                    regular quadrilateral is the square.</p>
                <p>Euclid considers the regular polygons of 4, 5, 6, and 15 sides. For each of the
                    first three he solves the problems—(1) to inscribe such a polygon in a given
                    circle; (2) to circumscribe it about a given circle; (3) to inscribe a circle
                    in, and (4) to circumscribe a circle about, such a polygon.</p>
                <p>For the regular triangle the problems are not repeated, because more general
                    problems have been solved.</p>
                <p>Props. 6, 7, 8, and 9 solve these problems for the square.</p>
                <p>The general problem of inscribing in a given circle a regular polygon of <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi> sides depends upon the problem of dividing the
                    circumference of a circle into <hi rend="italic">n</hi> equal parts, or what
                    comes to the same thing, of drawing from the centre of the circle <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi> radii such that the angles between consecutive radii
                    are equal, that is, to divide the space about the centre into <hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi> equal angles. Thus, if it is required to inscribe a square in a
                    circle, we have to draw four lines from the centre, making the four angles
                    equal. This is done by drawing two diameters at right angles to one another. The
                    ends of these diameters are the vertices of the required square. If, on the
                    other hand, tangents be drawn at these ends, we obtain a square circumscribed
                    about the circle.</p>
                <p>§ 43. To construct <hi rend="italic">a. regular pentagon,</hi> we find it
                    convenient first to construct a <hi rend="italic">regular decagon.</hi> This
                    requires to divide the space about the centre into ten equal angles. Each will
                    be <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th of a right angle, or ⅜th of two right
                    angles. If we suppose the decagon constructed, and if we join the centre to the
                    end of one side, we get an isoceles triangle, where the angle at the centre
                    equals ⅜th of two right angles; hence each of the angles at the base will be
                    ⅜ths of two right angles, as all three angles together equal two right angles.
                    Thus we have to construct an isoceles triangle, having the angle at the vertex
                    equal to half an angle at the base. This is solved in Prop. 10, by aid of the
                    problem in Prop. 11 of the second book. If we make the sides of this triangle
                    equal to the radius of the given circle, then the base will be the side of the
                    regular decagon inscribed in the circle. This side being known the decagon can
                    be constructed, and if the vertices are joined alternately, leaving out half
                    their number, we obtain the regular pentagon.</p>
                <p>Euclid does not proceed thus. He wants the pentagon before the decagon. This,
                    however, does not change the real nature of his solution, nor does his solution
                    become simpler by not mentioning the decagon.</p>
                <p>Once the regular pentagon is inscribed, it is easy to circumscribe another by
                    drawing tangents at the vertices of the inscribed pentagon. This is shown in
                    Prop. 12.</p>
                <p>Prop. 13 and 14 teach how a circle may be inscribed in or circumscribed about any
                    given regular pentagon.</p>
                <p>§ 44. The <hi rend="italic">regular hexagon</hi> is more easily constructed, as
                    shown in Prop. 15. The result is that the side of the regular hexagon inscribed
                    in a circle is equal to the radius of the circle.</p>
                <p>For this polygon the other three problems mentioned are not solved.</p>
                <p>§ 45. The book closes with Prop. 16. To inscribe a regular quindecagon in a given
                    circle. That this may be done is easily seen. If we inscribe a regular pentagon
                    and a regular hexagon in the circle, having one vertex in common, then the arc
                    from the common vertex to the next vertex of the pentagon is ’ th of the
                    circumference, and to the next vertex of the hexagon is ⅜th of the
                    circumference. The difference between these arcs is, therefore, ⅜. <hi
                        rend="superscript"> -</hi> ½=^⅛th °f the circumference. The latter may,
                    therefore, be divided into thirty, and hence also in fifteen equal parts, and
                    the regular quindecagon be described.</p>
                <p>§ 46. We conclude with a few theorems about regular polygons which are not given
                    by Euclid.</p>

                        inscribed in the regular polygon.</hi> The proof, which is easy, is left to
                    the reader.</p>
                <p>We can bisect any given arc (Prop. 30, III.). Hence we can divide a circumference
                    into 2n equal parts as soon as it has been divided into <hi rend="italic">n</hi>

                <p>The construction of any new régulai· polygon not included in one of these series
                    will give rise to a new series. Till the beginning of this century nothing was
                    added to the knowledge of regular polygons as given by Euclid. Then Gauss, in
                    his celebrated <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic,</hi> proved that every regular
                    polgon of 2 <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> +1 sides may be constructed if this
                    number 2»&gt; +1 be prime, and that no others can be constructed by elementary
                    methods. This shows that regular polygons of 7, 9, 13 sides cannot thus be
                    constructed, but that a regular polygon of 17 sides is possible; for 17≈2 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 4</hi> + 1. The next polygon is one of 257 sides. The
                    construction becomes already rather complicated for 17 sides.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> V.</p>
                <p>§ 47. The fifth book of the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> is not exclusively
                    geometrical. It contains the theory of ratios and proportion of quantities in
                    general. The treatment, as here given, is admirable, and in every respect
                    superior to the algebraical method by which Euclid’s theory is now generally
                    replaced. It has, however, the reputation of being too difficult for schools,
                    and is therefore very seldom read. We shall try to make the subject clear, and
                    to show why the usual algebraical treatment of proportion is not really sound.
                    We begin by quoting those definitions at the beginning of Book V. which are most
                    important. These definitions have given rise to much discussion.</p>
                <p>Tlιe only definitions which are essential for the fifth book are Defs. 1, 2, 4,
                    5, 6, and 7. Of the remainder 3, 8, and 9 are more than useless, and probably
                    not Euclid’s, but additions of later editors, of whom Theon of Alexandria was
                    the most prominent. Defs. 10 and 11 belong rather to the sixth book, whilst all
                    the others are merely nominal. The really important ones are 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p>
                <p>§ 48. To define a magnitude is not attempted by Euclid. The first two definitions
                    state what is meant by a “part,” that is, a submultiple or measure, and by a
                    “multiple” of a given magnitude. The meaning of Def. 4 is that two given
                    quantities can have a ratio to one another only in case that they are comparable
                    as to their magnitude, that is, if they are of the same kind.</p>
                <p>Def. 3, which is probably due to Theon, professes to define a ratio, but is as
                    meaningless as it is uncalled for, for all that is wanted is given in Defs. 5
                    and 7.</p>
                <p>In Def. 5 it is explained what is meant by saying that two magnitudes have the
                    same ratio to one another as two other magnitudes, and in Def. 7 what we have to
                    understand by a greater or a less ratio. The 6th definition is only nominal,
                    explaining the meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">proportional.</hi></p>
                <p>Euclid represents magnitudes by lines, and often denotes them either by single
                    letters or, like lines, by two letters. We shall use only single letters for the
                    purpose. If <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> denote two
                    magnitudes of the same kind, their ratio will be denoted by <hi rend="italic">a:
                        b</hi>; if <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> are two
                    other magnitudes of the same kind, but possibly of a different kind from <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> then if <hi rend="italic"
                        >c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> have the same ratio to one another as
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> this will be
                    expressed by writing— <hi rend="italic">a: b:: c: d.</hi></p>
                <p>Further, if <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is a (whole) number, <hi rend="italic"
                        >ma</hi> shall denote the multiple of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> which is
                    obtained by taking it <hi rend="italic">m</hi> times.</p>
                <p>§ 49. The whole theory of ratios is based on Def. 5.</p>
                <p>Def. 5. <hi rend="italic">The first of four magnitudes is said to have the same
                        ratio to the second that the third has to the fourth when, any equimultiples
                        whatever of the first and the third being taken, and any equimultiples
                        whatever of the second and the fourth, if the multiple of the first be less
                        than that of the second, the multiple of the third is also less than that of
                        the fourth; and if the multiple of the first is equal to that of the second,
                        the multiple of the third is also equal to that of the fourth √ and if the
                        multiple of the first is greater than that of the second, the multiple of
                        the third is also greater than that of the fourth.</hi></p>

                <p>It will be well to show at once in an example how this definition can be used, by

                <p>That this is true is in oui’ case easily seen. We may suppose that the triangles
                    have a common vertex, and their bases in the same line. "We set off the base <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> along the line containing the bases <hi rend="italic"
                        >m</hi> times; we then join the different parts of division to the vertex,
                    and get <hi rend="italic">m</hi> triangles all equal to <hi rend="italic"
                        >a.</hi> The triangle on <hi rend="italic">ma</hi> as base equals,
                    therefore, <hi rend="italic">ma.</hi> If we proceed in the same manner with the
                    base <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> setting it off <hi rend="italic">n</hi> times, we
                    find that the area of the triangle on the base <hi rend="italic">nb</hi> equals
                        <hi rend="italic">nβ,</hi> the vertex of all triangles being the same. But
                    if two triangles have the same altitude, then their areas are equal if the bases
                    are equal; hence <hi rend="italic">ma≈nβ</hi> if <hi rend="italic">ma=nb,</hi>
                    and if their bases are unequal, then that has the greater area which is on the
                    greater base; in other words, <hi rend="italic">ma</hi> is greater than, equal
                    to, or less than <hi rend="italic">nβ,</hi> according as <hi rend="italic"
                        >ma</hi> is greater than, equal to, or less than <hi rend="italic">nb,</hi>
                    which was to be proved.</p>
                <p>§ 50. It will be seen that even in this example it does not become evident what a
                    ratio really is. It is still an open question whether ratios are magnitudes
                    which we can compare. We do not know whether the ratio of two lines is a
                    magnitude of the same kind as the ratio of two areas. Though we might say that
                    Def. 5 defines <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> ratios, still we do not know whether
                    they are equal in the sense of the axiom, that two things which are equal to a
                    third are equal to one another. That this is the case requires a proof, and
                    until this proof is given we shall use the :: instead of the sign =, which,
                    however, we shall afterwards introduce.</p>
                <p>As soon as it has been established that all ratios are like magnitudes, it
                    becomes easy to show that, in some cases at least, they are numbers. This step
                    was never made by Greek mathematicians. They distinguished always most carefully
                    between continuous magnitudes and the discrete series of numbers. In modern
                    times it has become the custom to ignore this difference.</p>
                <p>If, in determining the ratio of two lines, a common measure can be found, which
                    is contained <hi rend="italic">m</hi> times in the first, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi> times in the second, then the ratio of the two lines equals the
                    ratio of the two numbers <hi rend="italic">m: n.</hi> This is shown by Euclid in
                    Prop. 5, X. But the ratio of two numbers is, as a rule, a fraction, and the
                    Greeks did not, as we do, consider fractions as numbers. Far less had they any
                    notion of introducing irrational numbers, which are neither whole nor
                    fractional, as we are obliged to do if we wish to say that all ratios are
                    numbers. The incommensurable numbers which are thus introduced as ratios of
                    incommensurable quantities are nowadays as familiar to us as fractions; but a
                    proof is generally omitted that we may apply to them the rules which have been
                    established for rational numbers only. Euclid’s treatment of ratios avoids this
                    difficulty. His definitions holds for commensurable as well as for
                    incommensurable quantities. Even the notion of incommensurable quantities is
                    avoided in Book V. But he proves that the more elementary rules of algebra hold
                    for ratios. We shall state all his propositions in that algebraical form to
                    which we are now accustomed. This may, of course, be done without changing the
                    character of Euclid’s method.</p>
                <p>§ 51. Using the notation explained above we express the first propositions as
                    follows :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 1. If <hi rend="italic">a-ma</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">, b≈mb', c=md,</hi>
                    then <hi rend="italic">a + b + c = m(a' + b</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">+
                    d).</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 2. If <hi rend="italic">a = mb,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c≈mã,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">e=nb,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f≈nd,</hi> then <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">+</hi><hi rend="italic">e</hi> is the
                    same multiple of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> as c +∕ is of <hi rend="italic"
                        >d,</hi> viz. :— α + e=(γn + n)δ, and c+∕=(wι+n)tZ.</p>
                <p>Prop. 3. If α = mδ, <hi rend="italic">c≈md,</hi> then is <hi rend="italic"
                        >na</hi> the same multiple of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> that <hi
                        rend="italic">nc</hi> is of <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> viz., <hi
                        rend="italic">na≈nmb,</hi><hi rend="italic">nc=nmd.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 4. If <hi rend="italic">a: b:: c: d,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">ma</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">∙.rib</hi><hi rend="italic">:: me: nd.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 5. If α = mδ, <hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi rend="italic">c = md</hi> then
                        <hi rend="italic">a-c≈m(b-d).</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 6. If <hi rend="italic">a≈mb,c=md,</hi> then are <hi rend="italic">a -
                        nb</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c - nd</hi> either equal to, or equimultiples
                    of, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> viz., <hi
                        rend="italic">a-rib=(m-</hi><hi rend="italic">riſb</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">c-</hi><hi rend="italic">nd≈(m-n)d,</hi> where <hi
                        rend="italic">m-n</hi> may be unity.</p>
                <p>All these propositions relate to <hi rend="italic">equimultiples.</hi> Now follow
                    propositions about ratios which are compared as to their magnitude.</p>
                <p>§ 52. Prop. 7. If α = δ, then <hi rend="italic">a: c:: b: c</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">c: a:: c: b.</hi></p>
                <p>The proof is simply this. As α = δ we know that <hi rend="italic">ma≈mb;</hi>
                    therefore if <hi rend="italic">ma&gt;nc,</hi> then <hi rend="italic"
                        >mb&gt;nc,</hi> if <hi rend="italic">ma - nc,</hi> then <hi rend="italic"
                        >mb</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">nc,</hi> if <hi
                        rend="italic">ma&lt;fnc,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">mb&lt;fnc,</hi>
                    therefore the first proportion holds by Definition 5.</p>
                <p>Prop. 8. If <hi rend="italic">dfi&gt;b,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">a:</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">cfi&gt;b ∙.c,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c:aQc.b.</hi></p>
                <p>The proof depends on Definition 7.</p>
                <p>Prop. 9 (converse to Prop. 7). If</p>
                <p>&lt;z: c:: δ: c, or if <hi rend="italic">c: a:: c</hi>: δ, then α=≈δ.</p>
                <p>Prop. 10 (converse to Prop. 8). If <hi rend="italic">a:</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >cfi&gt;b</hi><hi rend="italic">: c,</hi> then α&gt;δ and if <hi
                        rend="italic">c:</hi><hi rend="italic">a&lt;fc</hi>: δ, then <hi
                        rend="italic">a&lt;fi,</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 11. If <hi rend="italic">a</hi>: δ:: <hi rend="italic">c: d,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi>: δ:: e then c: <hi rend="italic">d:: e :fi</hi></p>
                <p>In words, <hi rend="italic">if two ratios are equal to a third, they are equal to
                        one</hi><hi rend="italic">another.</hi> After these propositions have been
                    proved, we have a right to consider a ratio as a <hi rend="italic"
                        >magnitude,</hi> for only now can we consider a ratio as something for which
                    the axiom about magnitudes holds: things which are equal to a third are equal to
                    one another.</p>
                <p>We shall indicate this by writing in future the sign = instead of:: . The
                    remaining propositions, which explain themselves, may then be stated as
                    follows:—</p>
                <p>§53. Prop. 12. If <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c: d≈e :fi</hi> then <hi rend="italic"
                        >a+c+e</hi><hi rend="italic">∙.b+d+f≈a</hi><hi rend="italic">:b.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 13. If <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c: d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi>:
                    &lt;ζ&gt;c: <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">a</hi>: δ≥c <hi
                        rend="italic">∙.f.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 14. If <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c: d,</hi> and α&gt;c, then <hi rend="italic"
                        >b~f&gt;d.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 15. Magnitudes have the same ratio to one another that their equimultiples
                    have—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ma: mb≈a</hi>: δ.</p>
                <p>Prop. 16. If <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> are
                    magnitudes of the same kind, and if <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c: d,</hi> then <hi
                        rend="italic">a:c≈byd.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 17. If <hi rend="italic">a + b :b≈c + d :d,</hi> then <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi>: δ = <hi rend="italic">c: d.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 18 (converse to 17). If <hi rend="italic">a</hi>: δ=c: <hi rend="italic"
                        >d</hi> then <hi rend="italic">a + b:b≈c+d:d.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 19. If <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> are
                    quantities of the same kind, and if <hi rend="italic">a :b≈c :d,</hi> then <hi
                        rend="italic">a-c</hi>: δ <hi rend="italic">-d≈a :b.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 54. Prop. 20. <hi rend="italic">If there be three magnitudes, and other three,
                        which have the same ratio, taken two and two, then if the first be greater
                        than the third, the fourth shall be greater than the sixth; and if equal,
                        equal; and if less, less.</hi></p>
                <p>If we understand by <hi rend="italic">a :b :e: d :c: ...</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >=a'</hi><hi rend="italic">:b' :d :d' :d:</hi><hi rend="italic">. . .</hi>
                    that the ratio of any two consecutive magnitudes on the first side equals that
                    of the corresponding magnitudes on the second side, we may write this theorem in
                    symbols, thus :—</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> be
                    quantities of one, and <hi rend="italic">d, e,f</hi> magnitudes of the sama or
                    any other kind, such that <hi rend="italic">a</hi>: δ: <hi rend="italic">c≈d :e
                        :f</hi> and if <hi rend="italic">afi&gt;c,</hi> then &lt;ζ&gt; <hi
                        rend="italic">f,</hi> but if ∙ <hi rend="italic">a=c,</hi> then <hi
                        rend="italic">d=</hi><hi rend="italic">f</hi> and if α&lt;c, then <hi
                        rend="italic">d∙&lt;ff.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 21. If <hi rend="italic">a:</hi><hi rend="italic">b=e</hi>:/and δ <hi
                        rend="italic">:c≈d: e,</hi> or if <hi rend="italic">a</hi>: δ: c= -: -:
                    1</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> and if <hi rend="italic">afi&gt;c,</hi>
                    then tζ&gt; <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> but if <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">c,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">d≈
                        f,</hi> and if α&lt;c, then <hi rend="italic">d&lt;Qf.</hi></p>
                <p>By aid of these two propositions the following two are proved.</p>
                <p>§ 55. Prop. 22. <hi rend="italic">If there be any number of magnitudes, and as
                        many others, which have the same ratio, taken two and two in order, the
                        first shall have to the last of the first magnitudes the same ratio which
                        the first of the others has to the last.</hi></p>
                <p>We may state it more generally, thus :—</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">a: b: c: d: e:</hi><hi rend="italic">. . . ≈a'</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">:b': cl :d' :d:</hi><hi rend="italic">. .</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">, ,</hi> then not only have two consecutive, but any two
                    magnitudes on the first side, the same ratio as the corresponding magnitudes on
                    the other. For instance—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a∙.c≈a</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">:d; b: e≈b':el,</hi>
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Prop. 23 we state only in symbols, viz. :—</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">a:b:c:d:e:...≈^,:\.\.\,ſt...,</hi><hi rend="italic">a b d
                        d</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n397/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0397-0384"/> then a:c≈c':a', ft :e≈e': <hi rend="italic"
                        >b',</hi> and so on.</p>
                <p>Prop. 24 comes to this: If <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c: d</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >e:</hi><hi rend="italic">b≈f∙.</hi><hi rend="italic">d,</hi> then <hi
                        rend="italic">a + c</hi>: δ≡c+∕ <hi rend="italic">:d.</hi></p>
                <p>Some of the proportions which are considered in the above propositions have
                    special names. These we have omitted, as being of no use, since algebra has
                    enabled us to bring the different operations contained in the propositions under
                    a common point of view.</p>
                <p>§ 56. The last proposition in the fifth book is of a different character.</p>
                <p>Prop. 25. <hi rend="italic">If four magnitudes of the same kind be proportional,
                        the greatest and least of them together shall be greater than the other two
                        together.</hi> In symbols—</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> be magnitudes of the
                    same kind, and if <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c :d,</hi> and if <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi> is the greatest, hence <hi rend="italic">d</hi> the least, then <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">+ dfi&gt;b</hi> + c.</p>
                <p>§ 57. We return once again to the question, What is a ratio? We have seen that we
                    may treat ratios as magnitudes, and that all ratios are magnitudes of the same
                    kind, for we may compare any two as to their magnitude. It will presently be
                    shown that ratios of lines may be considered as <hi rend="italic">quotients</hi>
                    of lines, so that a ratio appears as answer to the question, How often is one
                    line contained in another? But the answer to this question is given by a number,
                    at least in some cases, and in all cases if we admit incommensurable numbers.
                    Considered from this point of view, we may say the fifth book of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Elements</hi> shows that some of the simpler algebraical
                    operations hold for incommensurable numbers. In the ordinary algebraical
                    treatment of numbers this proof is altogether omitted, or given by a process of
                    limits which does not seem to be natural to the subject.</p>
                <p>r <hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> VI.</p>
                <p>§ 58. The sixth book contains the theory of similar figures. After a few
                    definitions explaining terms, the first proposition gives the first application
                    of the theory of proportion.</p>
                <p>Prop. 1. <hi rend="italic">Triangles and parallelograms of the same altitude are
                        to one another as their bases.</hi></p>
                <p>The proof has already been considered in § 49.</p>
                <p>From this follows easily the important theorem</p>
                <p>Prop. 2. <hi rend="italic">If a straight line be drawn parallel to one of the
                        sides of a triangle, it shall cut the other sides, or those sides produced,
                        proportionally; and if the sides or the sides produced be cut
                        proportionally, the straight line which joins the points of section, shall
                        be parallel to the remaining side of the triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 59. The next proposition, together with one added by Simson as Prop. A, may be
                    expressed more conveniently if we introduce a modern phraseology, viz., if in a
                    line AB we assume a point C between A and B, we shall say that C divides AB
                    internally in the ratio AC: CB; but if C be taken in the line AB produced, we
                    shall say that AB is divided externally in the ratio AC: CB.</p>
                <p>The two propositions then come to this:</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Prop. 3).— <hi rend="italic">The bisector of
                        an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side internally in a ratio equal
                        to the ratio of the two sides including that angle;</hi> and conversely, <hi
                        rend="italic">if a line through the vertex of a triangle divide the base
                        internally in the ratio of the two other sides, then that line bisects the
                        angle at the vertex.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Simson’s Prop.
                    A).— <hi rend="italic">The line which bisects an</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >exterior</hi><hi rend="italic">angle of a triangle divides the opposite
                        side externally in the ratio of the other sides;</hi> and conversely, <hi
                        rend="italic">if a line through the vertex of a triangle divide the base
                        externally in the ratio of the sides, then it bisects an exterior angle at
                        the vertex of the triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>If we combine both we have—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">The two lines which bisect
                        the interior and exterior angles at one vertex of a triangle divide the

                        ratio of the other two sides.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 60. The next four propositions contain the theory of similar triangles, of
                    which four cases are considered. They may be stated together.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Two triangles are

                <p>2. (Prop. 5). <hi rend="italic">If the sides of the one are proportional to those

                <p>3. (Prop. 6). <hi rend="italic">If two sides in one are proportional to two sides
                        in the other, and if the angles contained by these sides are equal;</hi></p>
                <p>4. (Prop. 7). <hi rend="italic">If two sides in one are proportional to two sides
                        in the other, if the angles opposite homologous sides are equal, and if the
                        angles opposite the other homologous sides are both acute, both right, or
                        both obtuse; homologous sides being in each case those which are opposite
                        equal angles.</hi></p>
                <p>An important application of these theorems is at once made to a right-angled
                    triangle, viz. :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 8. <hi rend="italic">In a right-angled triangle, if a perpendicular be
                        drawn from the right angle to the base, the triangles on each side of it are
                        similar to the whole triangle, and to one another.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Corollary.—</hi> From this it is manifest that the perpendicular drawn from
                    the right angle of a right-angled triangle to the base is a mean proportional
                    between the segments of the base, and also that each of the sides is a mean
                    proportional between the base and the segment of the base adjacent to that
                    side.</p>
                <p>§ 61. There follow four propositions containing problems, viz., in language
                    slightly different from Euclid’s :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 9. <hi rend="italic">To divide a straight line into a given number of equal
                        parts.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 10. <hi rend="italic">To divide a straight line in a given ratio.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 11. <hi rend="italic">To find a third proportional to two given straight
                        lines.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 12. <hi rend="italic">To find a fourth proportional to three given straight
                        lines.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 13. <hi rend="italic">To find a mean proportional between two given
                        straight lines.</hi></p>
                <p>The last three may be written as equations with one unknown quantity,—viz., if we
                    call the given straight lines <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> and the required
                    line <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> we have to find, a line <hi rend="italic">x
                        so</hi> that</p>
                <p>Prop. 11. <hi rend="italic">a: b</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">b:

                        b.</hi></p>
                <p>We shall see presently how these may be written without the signs of ratios.</p>
                <p>§ 62. Euclid considers next proportions connected with parallelograms and
                    triangles which are equal in area.</p>
                <p>Prop. 14. <hi rend="italic">Equal parallelograms which have one angle of the one
                        equal to one angle of the other have their sides about the equal angles
                        reciprocally proportional; and parallelograms which have one angle of the
                        one equal to one angle of the other, and their sides about the equal angles
                        reciprocally proportional, are equal to one another.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 15. <hi rend="italic">Equal triangles which have one angle of the one equal
                        to one angle of the other, have their sides about the equal angles
                        reciprocally proportional; and triangles which have one angle of the one
                        equal to one angle of the other, and their sides about the equal angles
                        reciprocally proportional, are equal to one another.</hi></p>
                <p>The latter proposition is really the same as the former, for if, as in the
                    accompanying diagram, in the figure belonging to the former the two equal
                    parallelograms AB and BC be bisected by the lines DF and EG, and if EF be drawn,
                    we get the figure belonging to the latter.</p>
                <p>It is worth noticing that the lines FE and DG are parallel. We may state
                    therefore the theorem—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If two triangles are equal
                        in area, and have one angle in the one vertically opposite to one angle in
                        the other, then the two straight lines which join the remaining two vertices
                        of the one to those of the other triangle are parallel.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 63. A most important theorem is</p>
                <p>Prop. 16. <hi rend="italic">If four straight lines be proportionals, the
                        rectangle contained by the extremes is equal to the rectangle contained by
                        the means; and if the rectangle contained by the extremes be equal to the
                        rectangle contained by the means, the four straight lines are
                        proportionals.</hi></p>
                <p>In symbols, if <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> are the
                    four lines, and if <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c: d,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">ad ≈
                        be;</hi> and conversely, if <hi rend="italic">ad≈bc,</hi> then <hi
                        rend="italic">a:b≈c:d,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">be</hi> denote (as in § 20), the areas of the rectangles
                    contained by <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and by <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> respectively.</p>
                <p>This allows us to transform every proportion between four lines into an equation
                    between two products.</p>
                <p>It shows further that the operation of forming a product of two lines, and the
                    operation of forming their ratio are each the inverse of the other.</p>
                <p>If we now define a quotient ~ of two lines as the <hi rend="italic">number</hi>
                    which multiplied into <hi rend="italic">b</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    so that <hi rend="italic">↑</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >=</hi><hi rend="italic">a, b</hi> we see that from the equality of two
                    quotients <hi rend="italic"> a</hi><hi rend="italic">c_ b</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >~d</hi> follows, if we multiply both sides by <hi rend="italic">bd,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">⅛b.d =^d.b,</hi><hi rend="italic">o a</hi><hi rend="italic">ad
                        ≈ cb.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n398/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0398-0385"/>
                <p>But from this it follows according to the last theorem that <hi rend="italic">a:
                        b</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">c: d.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence we conclude that the quotient ſt and the ratio <hi rend="italic">a: b</hi>
                    are different forms of the same magnitude, only with this important difference
                    that the quotient would have a meaning only if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> have a common measure, until we introduce
                    incommensurable numbers, while the ratio <hi rend="italic">a: b</hi> has always
                    a meaning, and thus gives rise to the introduction of incommensurable
                    numbers.</p>
                <p>Thus it is really the theory of ratios in the fifth book which enables us to
                    extend the geometrical calculus given before in connexion with Book II. It will
                    also be seen that if we write the ratios in Book V. as quotients, or rather as
                    fractions, then most of the theorems state properties of quotients or of
                    fractions.</p>
                <p>§ 64. Prop. 17 contains only a special case of 16. After the problem, Prop. 18.
                        <hi rend="italic">On a given straight line to describe a rectilineal figure
                        similar and similarly situated to a given rectilineal figure,</hi> there
                    follows another fundamental theorem:</p>
                <p>Pro;». 19. <hi rend="italic">Similar triangles are to one another in the
                        duplicate ratio of their homologous sides.</hi> In other words, the areas of
                    similar triangles are to one another as the squares on homologous sides. This is
                    generalized in</p>
                <p>Prop. 20. <hi rend="italic">Similar polygons may be divided into the same number
                        of similar triangles, having the same ratio to one another that the polygons
                        have; and the polygons are to one another in the duplicate ratio of their
                        homologous sides.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 65. Prop. 21. <hi rend="italic">Rectilineal figures which are similar to the
                        same rectilineal figure are also similar to each other,</hi> is an immediate
                    consequence of the definition of similar figures. As similar figures may be said
                    to be equal in “shape” but not in “size,” we may state it also thus:</p>
                <p>“Figures which are equal in shape to a third are equal in shape to each
                    other.”</p>
                <p>Prop. 22. <hi rend="italic">If four straight lines be</hi><hi rend="italic"

                        proportionals, those straight lines shall be proportionals.</hi></p>

                <p>§ 66. <hi rend="smallcaps">Noav</hi> follows a proposition which has been much
                    discussed with regard to Euclid’s exact meaning in saying that a ratio is <hi

                <p>Prop. 23. <hi rend="italic">Parallelograms which are equiangular to one another,

                <p>The proof of the proposition makes its meaning clear. In symbols the ratio <hi

                <p>If we consider the ratios as numbers, we may say that the one satio is the

                <p>The theorem in Prop. 23 is the foundation of all mensuration of areas. From it we
                    see at once that two rectangles have the ratio of their areas compounded of the

                        >c d</hi><hi rend="italic">cd'</hi></p>
                <p>This shows how to multiply quotients in our geometrical calculus.</p>
                <p>Further, <hi rend="italic">Two triangles have the ratios of their areas

                <p>To bring these theorems to the form in which they are usually given, we assume a

                    a foot, a mile, &amp;c.), and determine the number α which expresses how often

                <p>This is easily proved by observing that <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>If especially the second parallelogram is the unit square, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>A</p>
                <p>This gives the theorem: The number of unit squares contained in a parallelogram
                    equals the product of the numerical values of base and altitude, and similarly
                    the number of unit squares contained in a triangle equals half the product of
                    the numerical values of base and altitude.</p>
                <p>This is often stated by saying that the area of a parallelogram is equal to the
                    product of the base and the altitude, meaning by this product the product of the
                    numerical values, and not the product as defined above in § 20.</p>
                <p>§ 68. Propositions 24 and 26 relate to parallelograms about diagonals, such as
                    are considered in Book I., 43. They are—</p>
                <p>Prop. 24. <hi rend="italic">Parallelograms about the diameter of any
                        parallelogram are similar to the whole parallelogram and to one
                        another;</hi> and its converse (Prop. 26), <hi rend="italic">If two similar
                        parallelograms have a common angle, and be similarly situated, they are
                        about the same diameter.</hi></p>
                <p>Between these is inserted a problem.</p>
                <p>Prop. 25. <hi rend="italic">To describe a rectilineal figure which shall be
                        similar to one given rectilinear figure, and equal to another given
                        rectilineal figure.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 69. Prop. 27 contains a theorem relating to the theory of maxima and minima. We
                    may state it thus:</p>
                <p>Prop 27 <hi rend="italic">If a parallelogram be divided into two by a straight
                        line cutting the base, and if on half the base another parallelogram be
                        constructed similar to one of those parts, then this third parallelogram is
                        greater than the other part.</hi></p>
                <p>Of far greater interest than this general theorem is a special case of it, where
                    the parallelograms are changed into rectangles, and where one of the parts into
                    which the parallelogram is divided is made a square; for then the theorem
                    changes into one which is easily recognized to be identical with the
                    following:—</p>

                <p>§ 70. The next three propositions contain problems which may be said to be
                    solutions of quadratic equations. The first two are, like the last, involved in
                    somewhat obscure language. We transcribe them as follows: —</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Problem.—</hi> To describe on a given base a parallelogram, and
                    to divide it either internally (Prop. 28) or externally (Prop. 29) from a point

                    in area to a given figure), whilst the other has a given shape (is similar to a

                <p>If we substitute the value of <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> we get <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The second case (Prop. 29) gives rise, in the same manner, to the quadratic <hi

                <p>The next problem—</p>
                <p>Prop. 30. <hi rend="italic">To cut a given straight line in extreme and mean

                <p>This is, therefore, only a special case of the last, and is, besides, an old
                    acquaintance, being essentially the same problem as that proposed in II. 11.</p>

                <p>Prop. 80 may therefore be solved in two ways, either by aid of Prop. 29 or by aid
                    of II. 11. Euclid gives both solutions.</p>
                <p>§71. Prop. 31 (Theorem). <hi rend="italic">In any right-angled, triangle, any

                        right angle,—</hi> is a pretty generalization of the theorem of Pythagoras
                    (I. 47).</p>
                <p>Leaving out the next proposition, which is of little interest, we come to the
                    last in this book.</p>
                <p>Prop. 83. <hi rend="italic">In equal circles angles, xchether at the centres or
                        the circumferences, have the same ratio which the arcs on which they stand
                        have to one another; so also have the sectors.</hi></p>
                <p>Of this, the part relating to angles at the centre is of special importance; it
                    enables us to measure angles by arcs.</p>
                <p>With this closes that part of the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> which is
                    devoted to the study of figures in a plane.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> XI.</p>
                <p>§ 72. In this book figures are considered which are not confined to a plane,
                    viz., first relations between lines and planes in space, and afterwards
                    properties of solids.</p>
                <p>Of new definitions we mention those which relate to the perpendicularity and the
                    inclination of lines and planes.</p>
                <p>Def. 3. <hi rend="italic">A straight line is perpendicular, or at right angles,
                        to a plane when it makes right angles with every straight line meeting it in
                        that plane.</hi></p>
                <p>The definition of perpendicular planes (Def. 4) offers no difficulty. Euclid
                    defines the inclination of lines to planes and of planes to planes (Defs. 5 and
                    6) by aid of plane angles, included by straight lines, with which we have been
                    made familiar in the first books.</p>
                <p>The other important definitions are those of parallel planes, which never meet
                    (Def. 8), and of solid angles formed by three or more planes meeting in a point
                    (Def. 9).</p>
                <p>To these we add the definition of a line parallel to a plane as a line which does
                    not meet the plane.</p>
                <p>§ 73. Before we investigate the contents of Book XL, it will be well to
                    recapitulate shortly what we know of planes and lines from the definitions and
                    axioms of the first book. There a plane has been defined as a surface which has
                    the property that every straight line which joins two points in it lies
                    altogether in it. This is equivalent to saying.that a straight line which has
                    two points in a plane lias all points in the pla-e. Hence, a straight line which
                    does not lie in the plane cannot have more than one point in common with the
                    plane. This is virtually the same as Euclid’s Prop. 1, viz.: —</p>
                <p>Prop. 1. <hi rend="italic">One part of a straight line cannot be in a plane and
                        another part without it.</hi></p>
                <p>It also follows, as was pointed out in § 3, in discussing the definitions of Book
                    I., that a plane is determined already by one straight line and a point without
                    it, viz., if all lines be drawn through the point, and cutting the line, they
                    will form a plane.</p>
                <p>This may be stated thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A plane is determined—</hi></p>
                <p>1st, <hi rend="italic">By a straight line and a point which does not lie on
                        it;</hi></p>
                <p>2d, <hi rend="italic">By three points which do not lie in a straight line</hi>;
                    for if two of these points be joined by a straight line we have case 1;</p>
                <p>3d, <hi rend="italic">By two intersecting straight lines;</hi> for the point of
                    intersection aud two other points, one in each line, give case 2;</p>
                <p>4th, <hi rend="italic">By two parallel lines</hi> (Def. 35, 1.).</p>
                <p>The third case of this theorem is Euclid’s</p>
                <p>Prop. 2. <hi rend="italic">Two straight lines which cut one another are</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">τn</hi><hi rend="italic">one plane, and three straight lines
                        which meet one another arc in one plane.</hi></p>
                <p>And the fourth is Euclid’s</p>
                <p>Prop. 7. <hi rend="italic">If two straight lines be pa.rallcl, the straight line
                        drawn from any point in one to any point in the other is in the same plane
                        with the parallels.</hi> From the definition of a plane further follows
                    *</p>
                <p>Prop. 3. <hi rend="italic">If two planes cut one another, their common section is
                        a straight line.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 74. Whilst these propositions are virtually contained in the definition of a
                    plane, the next gives us a new and fundamental property of space, showing at the
                    same time that it is possible to have a straight line perpendicular to a plane,
                    according to Def. 3. It states—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Prop. 4).— <hi rend="italic">If a straight
                        line is perpendicular to two straight lines in a plane which it meets, then
                        it is perpendicular to all lines in the plane which it meets, and hence it
                        is perpendicular to the plane.</hi></p>
                <p>Def. 3 may be stated thus: If a straight line is perpendicular to a plane, then
                    it is perpendicular to every line in the plane which it meets. The converse to
                    this would be <hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">All straight
                        lines which meet a given straight line in the same point, and arc
                        perpendicular to it, lie in a plane which is perpendicular to that
                        line.</hi></p>
                <p>This Euclid states thus:</p>
                <p>Prop. 5. <hi rend="italic">If three straight lines med all at one point, and a
                        straight</hi><hi rend="italic">line stands at right angles to each of them
                        at that point, the three straight lines shall be in one and the same
                        plane.</hi></p>
                <p>§75. There follow theorems relating to the theory of parallel lilies in space,
                    viz. :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Prop. 6).— <hi rend="italic">Any two lines
                        which are perpendicular to the same plane are parallel to each other</hi>;
                    aud conversely <hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Prop. 8).— <hi rend="italic"
                        >If of two parallel straight lines one is perpendicular to a plane, the
                        other is so also.</hi></p>
                <p>Further, the important theorems</p>
                <p>Prop. 9. <hi rend="italic">Two straight lines which arc each of them parallel to
                        the same straight line, and not in the same plane with it, are parallel to
                        one another;</hi> where the words, “and not in the same plane with it,” may
                    be left out, for they exclude the case of three parallels in a plane, which has
                    been proved before; and <hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Prop. 10).— <hi
                        rend="italic">If two angles in different planes have the two limits of the
                        one parallel to. those of the other, then the angles are equal.</hi> That
                    their planes are parallel is shown later on in Prop. 15.</p>
                <p>This theorem is not necessarily true, for the angles in question may be
                    supplementary; but then the one angle will be equal to that which is adjacent
                    and supplementary to the other, and this latter angle will also have its limits
                    parallel to those of the first.</p>
                <p>From this theorem it follows that if we take any two straight lines in space
                    which do not meet, and if we draw through any point P in space two lines
                    parallel to them, then the angle included by these lines will always be the
                    same, whatever the position of the point P may be. This angle has in modern
                    times been called the angle between the given lines :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Definition.—</hi><hi rend="italic">By the angles between two
                        not intersecting lines we understand the angles which two intersecting lines
                        include that are parallel respectively to the two given lines.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 76. It is now possible to solve the following two problems :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Problem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">To draw a straight line
                        perpendicular to a givenplane from a given point which lies</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Not in the plane</hi> (Prop. 11).</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">In the plane</hi> (Prop. 12).</p>
                <p>The second case is easily reduced to the first—viz., if by aid of the first we
                    have drawn any perpendicular to the plane from some point without it, we need
                    only draw through the given point in the plane a line parallel to it, in order
                    to have the required perpendicular given. The solution of the first part is of
                    interest in itself. It depends upon a construction which may be expressed as a
                    theorem.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If from a point A without a
                        plane a perpendicular AB be drawn to the plane, and if from the foot B of
                        this perpendicular another perpendicular BC be drawn to any straight line in
                        the plane, then the straight line joining A to the foot C of this second
                        perpendicular will also be perpendicular to the line in the plane.</hi></p>
                <p>The theory of perpendiculars to a plane is concluded by the theorem—</p>
                <p>Prop. 13. <hi rend="italic">Through any point in space, whether in or without a
                        plane, only one straight line can be drawn perpendicular to the
                    plane.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 77. The next four propositions treat of parallel planes. It is shown <hi
                        rend="italic">that planes which have a common perpendicular arc
                        parallel</hi> (Prop. 14); <hi rend="italic">that two planes are parallel
                        if</hi><hi rend="italic">tιco</hi><hi rend="italic">intersecting straight
                        lines in the one are parallel respectively to two straight lines in the
                        other plane</hi> (Prop. 15); <hi rend="italic">that parallel planes arc cut
                        by any plane in parallel straight lines</hi> (Prop. 16); and lastly, <hi
                        rend="italic">that any two straight lines are cut proportionally by a scries
                        of parallel planes</hi> (Prop. 17).</p>
                <p>This theory is made more complete by adding the following theorems, which are
                    easy deductions from the last :— <hi rend="italic">Two parallel planes have
                        common perpendiculars</hi> (converse to 14); and <hi rend="italic">Two
                        planes which are parallel to a third plane arc parallel to each
                    other.</hi></p>
                <p>It will be noted that Prop. 15 at once allows of the solution of the problem:
                    “Through a given point to draw a plane parallel to a given plane.” And it is
                    also easily proved that this problem allows always of one, and only of one,
                    solution.</p>
                <p>§ 78. We come now to planes which are perpendicular to one another. Two theorems
                    relate to them.</p>
                <p>Prop. 18. <hi rend="italic">If a straight line be at right angles to a plane,
                        every plane</hi><hi rend="italic">vehich</hi><hi rend="italic">passes
                        through it shall be at right angles to that plane.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 19. <hi rend="italic">If two planes which cut one another be each of them
                        perpendicular to a third plane, their common section shall be perpendicular
                        to the same plane.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 79. If three planes pass through a common point, and if they bound each other,
                    a solid angle of three faces, or a <hi rend="italic">trihedral</hi> angle, is
                    formed, and similarly by more planes a solid angle of more faces, or a <hi
                        rend="italic">polyhedral</hi> angle. These have many properties which are
                    quite analogous to those of triangles and polygons in a plane. Euclid states
                    some, viz :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 20. <hi rend="italic">If a solid angle be contained by three plane angles,
                        any two of them are together greater than the third.</hi></p>
                <p>But the next—</p>
                <p>Prop. 21. <hi rend="italic">Every solid angle is contained by plane angles, which
                        are together</hi><hi rend="italic">lese</hi><hi rend="italic">than four
                        right angles</hi> —has no analogous theorem in the plane.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n400/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0400-0387"/>
                <p>We may mention, however, that the theorems about triangles contained in the
                    propositions of Book I., which do not depend upon the theory of parallels (that
                    is all up to Prop. 27), have their corresponding theorems about trihedral
                    angles. The latter are formed, if for “side of a triangle” we write “plane
                    angle” or “face” of trihedral angle, and for “angle of triangle” we substitute
                    “angle between two faces” where the planes containing the solid angle are called
                    its <hi rend="italic">faces.</hi> We get, for instance, from I. 4, the theorem,
                        <hi rend="italic">If two trihedral angles have the angles of</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">tιuo</hi><hi rend="italic">faces in the one equal to the
                        angles of two faces in the other, and have likewise the angles included by
                        these faces equal, then the angles in the remaining faces are equal, and the
                        angles between the other faces are equal each to each, viz., those which are
                        opposite equal faces.</hi> The solid angles themselves are not necessarily
                    equal, for they may be only symmetrical like the right hand and the left.</p>
                <p>The connexion indicated between triangles and trihedral angles will also be
                    recognized in</p>
                <p>Prop. 22. <hi rend="italic">If everytwo of three plane angles be greater than the
                        third, and if the straight lines which contain them be all equal, a triangle
                        may be made of the straight lines that join the extremities of those equal
                        straight lines.</hi></p>
                <p>And Prop. 23. solves the problem, <hi rend="italic">To construct a trihedral
                        angle having the angles of its faces equal to three given plane angles, any
                        two of them being greater than the third.</hi> It is, of course, analogous
                    to the problem of constructing a triangle having its sides of given length.</p>
                <p>Two other theorems of this kind are added by Simson in his edition of Euclid’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 80. These are the principal properties of lines and planes in space, but.
                    before we go on to their applications it will be well to define the word <hi
                        rend="italic">distance.</hi> In geometry, distance means always “shortest
                    distance”; viz., the distance of a point from a straight line, or from a plane,
                    is the length of the perpendicular from the point to the line or plane. The
                    distance between two nonintersecting lines is the length of their common
                    perpendicular, there being but one. The distance between two parallel lines or
                    between two parallel planes is the length of the common perpendicular between
                    the lines or the planes.</p>
                <p>§ 81. <hi rend="italic">Parallelepipeds.</hi> — The rest of the book is devoted
                    to the study of the parallelepiped. In Prop. 24 the possibility of such a solid
                    is proved, viz. :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 24. <hi rend="italic">If a solid be contained by six planes two and two of
                        which are parallel, the opposite planes are similar and equal
                        parallelograms.</hi></p>
                <p>Euclid calls this solid henceforth a parallelepiped, though he never defines the
                    word. Either face of it may be taken as <hi rend="italic">base,</hi> and its
                    distance from the opposite face as <hi rend="italic">altitude.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop 25. <hi rend="italic">If a solid parallelepiped be cut by a plane parallel
                        to two of its opposite planes, it divides the whole into two solids, the
                        base of one of</hi><hi rend="italic">τohich</hi><hi rend="italic">shall be
                        to the base of the other as the one solid is to the other.</hi></p>
                <p>This theorem corresponds to the theorem (VI. 1) that parallelograms between the
                    same parallels are to one another as their bases. A simi]ar analogy is to be
                    observed among a number of the remaining propositions.</p>
                <p>§ 82. After solving a few problems we come to</p>
                <p>Prop. 28. <hi rend="italic">If a solid parallelepiped be cut by a plane passing
                        through the diagonals of two cf the opposite planes, it shall be cut in two
                        equal parts.</hi></p>
                <p>In the proof of this, as of several other propositions, Euclid neglects the
                    difference between solids which are symmetrical like the right hand and the
                    left.</p>
                <p>Prop. 31. <hi rend="italic">Solid parallelepipeds, which arc upon equal bases,
                        and of the same altitude, are equal to one another.</hi></p>
                <p>Props. 29 and 30 contain special cases of this theorem leading up to the proof of
                    the general theorem.</p>
                <p>As consequences of this fundamental theorem we get</p>
                <p>Prop. 32. <hi rend="italic">Solid parallelepipeds, which have the same altitude,
                        are to one another as their bases</hi>; and Prop. 33, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Similar solid parallelepipeds are to one another inthe triplicateratio
                        of'their homologous sides.</hi></p>
                <p>If we consider, as in § 67, the ratios of lines as numbers, we may also say—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The ratio of the volumes of similar parallelepipeds is equal to
                        the ratio of the third powers of homologous sides.</hi><hi rend="subscript">

                        parallelepipeds are reciprocally proportional; and if the bases and

                        equal</hi></p>
                <p>§ 83. Of the following propositions the 37th and 40th are of special

                <p>Prop. 37. <hi rend="italic">If four straight lines be proportionals, the similar

                        proportionals; and if the similar parallelepipeds similarly described from
                        four straight lines be proportionals, the straight lines shall be
                        proportionals.</hi></p>

                        rend="superscript"> 3</hi>.</p>
                <p>Prop. 40 teaches how to compare the volumes of triangular prisms with those of
                    parallelepipeds, by proving <hi rend="italic">that a triangular prism is equal
                        in volume to a parallelepiped, which has its altitude and its base equal to
                        the altitude ancl the base of the triangular prism.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 84. From these propositions follow all results relating to the mensuration of
                    volumes. We shall state these as we did in the case of areas. The starting-point
                    is the “rectangular” parallelepiped, which has every edge perpendicular to the
                    planes it meets, and which takes the place of the rectangle in the plane. If
                    this has all its edges equal we obtain the “cube.”</p>
                <p>If we take a certain line <hi rend="italic">u</hi> as unit length, then the
                    square on <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is the unit of area, and the cube on t¢ the
                    unit of volume, that is to say, if we wish to measure a volume we have to
                    determine how many unit cubes it contains.</p>
                <p>A rectangular parallelepiped has, as a rule, the three edges unequal, which meet
                    at a point. Every other edge is equal to one of them. If <hi rend="italic"
                        >a,</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> be the three edges
                    meetin" at a point, then we may take the rectangle, contained by two of them,
                    say by <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> as base and the
                    third as altitude. Let V be its volume, V' that of another rectangular
                    parallelepiped which has the edges <hi rend="italic">a’, b, c,</hi> hence the
                    same base as the first. It follows then easily, from Prop. 25 or 32, that V: <hi
                        rend="italic">^N' = a</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">a'</hi>;
                    or in words, <hi rend="italic">Rectangular parallelepipeds on equal bases are
                        proportional to their altitudes.</hi></p>
                <p>If we have two rectangular parallelepipeds, of which the first has the volume V
                    and the edges <hi rend="italic">a, bfc,</hi> and the second,the volume V' and
                    the edges <hi rend="italic">a', b',</hi><hi rend="italic">cl,</hi> we may
                    compare them by aid of two new ones which have respectively the edges <hi
                        rend="italic">a', b, c,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a', b',</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">c,</hi> and the volumes V <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and V
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. We then have</p>
                <p>V: V <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> =α: <hi rend="italic">a'</hi>; V <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi>: V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = δ: <hi
                        rend="italic">b',</hi> V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>: V'=c: c'.</p>
                <p>Compounding these, we have</p>
                <p>V:V'=(a:a')(6:6')(c:c'), or L=*Λ.f..</p>
                <p>V' <hi rend="italic">al V e</hi></p>
                <p>Hence, as a special case, making V' equal to the unit cube V on <hi rend="italic"

                    is equal to tire product of the numerical values of its three edges. This is
                    generally expressed by saying the volume of a rectangular parallelepiped is
                    measured by the product of its sides, or by the product of its base into its
                    altitude, which in this case is the same.</p>
                <p>Prop. 31 allows us to extend this to any parallelepipeds, and Props. 28 or 40, to
                    triangular prisms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">The volume of any

                <p>The consideration that any polygonal prism may be divided into a number of
                    triangular prisms, which have the same altitude and the sum of their bases equal

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> XII.</p>
                <p>§ 85. In the last part of Book XL we have learnt how to compare the volumes of
                    parallelepipeds and of prisms. In order to determine the volume of any solid
                    bounded by plane faces we must determine the volume of pyramids, for every such
                    solid may be decomposed into a number of pyramids.</p>
                <p>As every pyramid may again be decomposed into triangular pyramids, it becomes
                    only necessary to determine their volume. This is done by the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Theorem.—</hi> Every triangular pyramid is equal in volume to one third of
                    a triangular prism having the same base and the same altitude as the
                    pyramid.</p>
                <p>This is an immediate consequence of Euclid’s</p>
                <p>Prop. 7. <hi rend="italic">Every prism having a triangular base may be
                        divided</hi><hi rend="italic">t</hi> ∣ <hi rend="italic">do</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">three pyramids that have triangular bases, and arc equal to
                        one another.</hi></p>
                <p>The proof of this theorem is difficult, because the three triangular pyramids
                    into which the prism is divided are by no means equal in shape, and cannot be
                    made to coincide. It has first to be proved that two triangular pyramids have
                    equal volumes, if they have equal bases and equal altitudes. This Euclid does in
                    the following manner. He first shows (Prop. 3) that a triangular pyramid may be
                    divided into four parts, of which two are equal triangular pyramids similar to
                    the whole pyramid, whilst the other two are equal triangular prisms, and
                    further, that these two prisms together are greater than the two pyramids, hence
                    more than half the given pyramid. He next shows (Prop. 4) that if two triangular
                    pyra∙</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0401-0388"/>
                <p>nιids are given, having equal bases and equal altitudes, and if each be divided
                    as above, then the two triangular prisms in the one are equal to those in the
                    other, and each of the remaining pyramids in the one has its base and altitude
                    equal to the base and altitude of the remaining pyramids in the other. Hence to
                    these pyramids the same process is again applicable. We are thus enabled to cut
                    out of the two given pyramids equal parts, each greater than half the original
                    pyramid. Of the remainder we can again cut out equal parts greater than half
                    these remainders, and so on as far as we like. This process may be continued
                    till the last remainder is smaller than any assignable quantity, however small.
                    It follows, so we should conclude at present, that the two volumes must be
                    equal, for they cannot differ by any assignable quantity.</p>
                <p>To Greek mathematicians this conclusion offers far greater difficulties. They
                    prove elaborately, by a <hi rend="italic">reductio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >ad</hi><hi rend="italic">absurdum,</hi> that the volumes cannot be unequal.
                    This proof must be read in the <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi> A further
                    discussion of this method of exhaustion, as it is called, would belong to a
                    treatise on the history of geometry. We refer readers to Hankel, <hi
                        rend="italic">Geschichte der</hi><hi rend="italic">Mathematik</hi> (p. 115
                        <hi rend="italic">sq).</hi> We must, however, state that we have in the
                    above not proved Euclid’s Prop. 5, but only a special case of it. Euclid does
                    not suppose that the bases of the two pyramids to be compared are equal, and
                    hence he proves that the volumes are as the bases. The reasoning of the proof
                    becomes clearer in the special case, from which the general one may be easily
                    deduced.</p>
                <p>§ 86. Prop. 6 extends the result to pyramids with polygonal bases. From these
                    results follow again the rules at present given for the mensuration of solids,
                    viz., a pyramid is the third part of a triangular prism having the same base and
                    the same altitude. But a triangular prism is equal in volume to a parallelepiped
                    which has the same base and altitude. Hence if B is the base and <hi
                        rend="italic">h</hi> the altitude, we have</p>
                <p>Volume of prism = <hi rend="smallcaps">Bä,</hi> Volume of pyramid = -∣ <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Bä,</hi> statements which have to be taken in the sense
                    that B means the number of square units in the base, <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    the number of units of length in the altitude, or that B and <hi rend="italic"
                        >h</hi> denote the numerical values of base and altitude.</p>
                <p>§ 87. A method similar to that used in proving Prop. 5 leads to the following
                    results relating to solids bounded by simple curved surfaces :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 10. <hi rend="italic">Every cone is the third part of a cylinder which has
                        the same base, and is of an equal altitude with it.</hi></p>

                <p>These theorems again lead to formulae in mensuration, if we compare a cylinder
                    with a prism having its base and altitude equal to the base and altitude of the
                    cylinder. This may be done by the method of exhaustion. We get, then, the result
                    that their bases are equal, and have, if B denotes the numerical value of the
                    base, and <hi rend="smallcaps">ä</hi> that of the altitude,</p>

                <p>§ 88. The remaining propositions relate to circles and spheres. Of the sphere
                    only one property is proved, viz. :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 18. <hi rend="italic">Spheres have</hi><hi rend="italic">to one another the

                    sphere, like that of the circle, the cylinder, and the cone, had not been
                    settled in the time of Euclid. It was done by Archimedes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> XIII.</p>
                <p>§ 89. The 13th and last book of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> is
                    devoted to the regular solids. It is shown that there are five of them, viz.
                    :—</p>
                <p>1. The regular <hi rend="italic">tetrahedron,</hi> with 4 triangular faces and 4
                    vertices;</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">cube,</hi> with 8 vertices and 6 square faces;</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">octohedron,</hi> with 6 vertices and 8 triangular
                    faces;</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">dodecahedron,</hi> with 12 pentagonal faces, 3 at each
                    of the 20 vertices;</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">icosahedron,</hi> with 20 triangular faces, 5 at each of
                    the 12 vertices.</p>
                <p>It is shown how to inscribe these solids in a given sphere, and how to determine
                    the lengths of their edges.</p>
                <p>These results are—if <hi rend="italic">r</hi> denotes the radius of the
                    circumscribed sphere, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the side of the regular

                <p>§ 90. The 13th book, and therefore the <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> conclude
                    with the scholium, “that no other regular solid exists besides the five ones
                    enumerated.”</p>
                <p>The proof is very simple. Each face is a regular polygon, hence the angles of the
                    faces at any vertex must be .angles in equal regular polygons, must be togetheχ∙
                    less than four right angles (XL 21), and must be three or more in number. Each
                    angle in a regular triangle equals two-thirds of one right angle. Hence it is
                    possible to form a solid angle with three, four, or five regular triangles or
                    faces. These give the solid angles of the tetrahedron, the octohedron, and the
                    icosahedron. The angle in a square (the regular quadrilateral) equals one right
                    angle. Hence three will form a solid angle, that of the cube, and four will not.
                    The angle in the regular pentagon equals -ð-of a right angle. Hence three of
                    them equal y (t,e., less than 4) right angles, and form the solid angle of the
                    dodecahedron. Three regular polygons of six or more sides cannot form a solid
                    angle. Therefore no other regular solids are possible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> II.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Higher or Projective
                        Geometry.</hi></p>
                <p>It is difficult, at the outset, to characterize Projective Geometry as compared
                    with Euclidian. But a ſew examples will at least indicate the difference between
                    the two.</p>
                <p>In Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> almost all propositions refer to the
                        <hi rend="italic">magnitude</hi> of lines, angles, areas, or volumes, and
                    therefore to measurement. The statement that an angle is right, or that two
                    straight lines are parallel, refers to measurement. On the other hand, the fact
                    that a straight line does or does not cut a circle is independent of
                    measurement, it being dependent only upon the mutual “position” of the line and
                    the circle. This difference becomes clearer if we project any figure from one
                    plane to another. By this the length of lines, the magnitude of angles and
                    areas, is altered, so that the projection, or shadow, of a square on a plane
                    will not be a square; it will, however, be some quadrilateral. Again, the
                    projection of a circle will not be a circle, but some other curve more or less
                    resembling a circle. But one property may be stated at once,—no straight line
                    can cut the projection of a circle in more than two points, because no straight
                    line can cut a circle in more than two points. There are, then, some properties
                    of figures which do not alter by projection, whilst others do. To the latter
                    belong nearly all properties relating to measurement, at least in the form in
                    which they are generally given. The others are said to be projective properties,
                    and their investigation forms the subject of Projective Geometry.</p>
                <p>Different as are the kinds of properties investigated in the old and the new
                    sciences, the methods followed differ in a still greater degree. In Euclid each
                    proposition stands by itself; its connexion with others is never indicated; the
                    leading ideas contained in its proof are not stated; genoral principles do not
                    exist. In the modern methods, on the other hand, the greatest importance is
                    attached to the leading thoughts which pervade the whole; and general
                    principles, which bring whole groups of theorems under one aspect, are given
                    rather than separate propositions. The whole tendency is towards generalization.
                    A straight line is considered as given in its entirety, extending both ways to
                    infinity, while Euclid <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n402/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0402-0389"/> is very careful never to admit anything but
                    finite quantities. The treatment of the infinite is in fact another fundamental
                    difference between the two methods. Euclid avoids it. In modern geometry it is
                    systematically introduced, for only thus is generality obtained.</p>
                <p>Of the different modern methods of geometry, we shall treat principally of the
                    methods of projection and correspondence which have proved to be the most
                    powerful. These have become independent of Euclidian Geometry, especially
                    through the <hi rend="italic">Geometrie der</hi><hi rend="italic">Lage</hi> of
                    V. Staudt, and the <hi rend="italic">Ausdehnungslehre</hi> of Grassmann.</p>
                <p>For the sake of brevity we shall presuppose a knowledge of Euclid’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Elements,</hi> although we shall use only a few of his
                    propositions.</p>
                <p>§ 1. We consider space as filled with points, lines, and planes, and these we
                    call the elements out of which our figures are to be formed, calling any
                    combination of these elements a “figure.”</p>
                <p>By a line we mean a straight line in its entirety, extending both ways to
                    infinity; and by a plane, a plane surface, extending in all directions to
                    infinity. We suppose</p>
                <p>That through any two points in space one and only one line may be drawn (Euch I.,
                    Def. 4, Ax. 10, Post. 2);</p>
                <p>That through any three points which are not in a line, one and only one plane may
                    be placed (compare p. 386, § 73, above);</p>
                <p>That the intersection of two planes is a line (Encl. XI. 13);</p>
                <p>That a line which has two points in common with a plane lies in the plane (Euch
                    I., Def. 7), hence that the intersection of a line and a plane is a single
                    point; and</p>
                <p>That three planes which do not meet in a line have one single point in
                    common.</p>
                <p>These results may be stated differently in the following form ;— I. A plane is
                    determined— A point is determined—</p>
                <p>1. By three points which do 1. By three planes which do not lie in a line; not
                    pass through a line;</p>
                <p>2. By two intersecting lines; 2. By two intersecting lines;</p>
                <p>3. By a line and a point which 3. By a line and a plane which does not lie in it.
                    does not pass through it.</p>
                <p>II. A line is determined—</p>
                <p>1. By two points; 2. By two planes.</p>
                <p>The reader will observe that not only are planes determined by points, but also
                    points by planes·; that therefore we have a right to consider the planes as
                    elements, like points; and also that in any one of the above statements we may
                    interchange the words point and plane, and we obtain again a correct statement,
                    provided that these statements themselves are true. As they stand, we ought, in
                    several cases, to add “if they are not parallel,” or some such words, parallel
                    lines and planes being evidently left altogether out of consideration. To
                    correct this we have to reconsider the theory of parallels.</p>
                <p>§ 2. Let us take in a plane a line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> (fig. 1), a point S
                    not in this line, and a line <hi rend="italic">q</hi> drawn through S. Then this
                    line <hi rend="italic">q</hi> will meet the line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in a
                    point A. If we turn the line <hi rend="italic">q</hi> about S towards <hi
                        rend="italic">(f</hi>, its point of intersection with <hi rend="italic"
                        >p</hi> will move along <hi rend="italic">p</hi> towards B, passing, on
                    continued turning, to a greater and greater distance, until it is moved out of
                    our reach. If we turn <hi rend="italic">q</hi> still farther, its continuation
                    will meet <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> but now at the other side of A. The point of
                    intersection has disappeared to the right and reappeared to the left. There is
                    one intermediate position where <hi rend="italic">q</hi> is parallel to <hi
                        rend="italic">p—</hi> that is where it does not cut <hi rend="italic"
                        >p.</hi> In every other position it cuts <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in some
                    finite point. If, on the other hand, we move the point A to an infinite distance
                    in <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> then the line <hi rend="italic">q</hi> which passes
                    through A will be a line which does not cut <hi rend="italic">p</hi> at any
                    finite point. Thus we are led to say: <hi rend="italic">Every</hi> line through
                    S which joins it to any point at an infinite distance in <hi rend="italic"
                        >p</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> But by Euclid’s 12th axiom
                    there is but one line parallel to <hi rend="italic">p</hi> through S. The
                    difficulty in which we are thus involved is due to the fact that we try to
                    reason about infinity as if we, with our finite capabilities, could comprehend
                    the infinite. To overcome this difficulty, we may say that all points at
                    infinity in a line <hi rend="italic">appear</hi> to us as one, and may be
                    replaced by a single “ideal” point, just as all points in a fixed star—which is
                    not at an infinite, only at a great distance—cannot be distinguished by us and
                    to beings on the earth count as one. We may therefore now give the following
                    definitions and axiom:—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.</hi> —Lines which meet at infinity are called
                    parallel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Axiom.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> All points at an infinite
                    distance in a line may be considered as one single point. <hi rend="superscript"
                        > 4</hi><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> This ideal point is called the
                    point at infinity in the line.</p>
                <p>The axiom is equivalent to Euclid’s Axiom 12, for it follows from either that
                    through any point only one line may be drawn parallel to a given line.</p>
                <p>This point at infinity in a line is reached whether we move a point in the one or
                    in the opposite direction of a line to infinity. A line thus appears closed by
                    this point, and we speak as if we could move a point along the line from one
                    position A to another B in two ways, either through the point at infinity or
                    through finite points only.</p>
                <p>It must never be forgotten that this point at infinity is ideal, that the results
                    based on this assumption are true for that finite region of space which is
                    within our reach, and that beyond this region they may or may not be true, —we
                    do not know.</p>
                <p>The advantage of this view of parallels will become apparent at every step as we
                    go on.</p>
                <p>§ 3. Having thus arrived at the notion of replacing all points at infinity in a
                    line by one ideal point, there is no difficulty in replacing all points at
                    infinity in a plane by one ideal line.</p>
                <p>To make this clear, let us suppose that a line <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> which
                    cuts two fixed lines <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in
                    the points A and B, moves parallel to itself to a greater and greater distance.
                    It will at last cut both <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    at their points at infinity, so that a line which joins the two points at
                    infinity in two intersecting lines lies altogether at infinity. Every other line
                    in the plane will meet it therefore at infinity, and thus it contains all points
                    at infinity in the plane.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">AU</hi><hi rend="italic">points at infinity in a plane lie in a
                        line, which is called the line</hi><hi rend="italic">at</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">infinity in the plane.</hi></p>
                <p>It follows that parallel planes must be considered as planes having a common line
                    at infinity, for any other plane cuts them in parallel lines (Euch XI. 16),
                    which have a point at infinity in common.</p>
                <p>If we next take two intersecting planes, then the point at infinity in their line
                    of intersection lies in both planes, so that their lines at infinity meet. Hence
                    every line at infinity meets every other line at infinity, and they are
                    therefore all in one plane.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">All</hi><hi rend="italic">points</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >at</hi><hi rend="italic">infinity</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">space may be considered as lying in one</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >ideal</hi><hi rend="italic">plane, which is called the plane at
                        infinity.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 4. We have now the following definitions :—</p>
                <p>Parallel lines are lines which meet at infinity;</p>
                <p>Parallel planes are planes which meet at infinity;</p>
                <p>A line is parallel to a plane if it meets it at infinity.</p>
                <p>Theorems like this—Lines (or planes) which are parallel to a third are parallel
                    to each other—follow at once.</p>
                <p>This view of parallels leads therefore to no contradiction of Euclid’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Elements.</hi></p>
                <p>As immediate consequences we get the propositions :—</p>
                <p>Every line meets a plane in one point, or it lies in it;</p>
                <p>Every plane meets every other plane in a line;</p>
                <p>Any two lines in the same plane meet.</p>
                <p>§ 5. We have called points, lines, and planes the elements of geometrical
                    figures. We also say that an element of one kind <hi rend="italic">contains</hi>
                    one of the other if it lies in it or passes through it.</p>
                <p>All the elements of one kind which are contained in one or two elements of a
                    different kind form aggregates which have to be enumerated. They are the
                    following :—</p>
                <p>I. Of one dimension.</p>
                <p>1. The row, or range, <hi rend="italic">of pointe</hi> formed by all points in a
                    line, which is called its base.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">flat pencil</hi> formed by all the lines through a point
                    in a plane. Its base is the point in the plane.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">axial pencil</hi> formed by all planes through a lino
                    which is called its base or axis.</p>
                <p>II. Of two dimensions.</p>
                <p>1. The field of points and lines—that is, a plane with all its points and all its
                    lines.</p>
                <p>2. The pencil of lines and planes— that is, a point in space with all lines and
                    all planes through it.</p>
                <p>III. Of three dimensions.</p>
                <p>The space of points—that is, all points in space.</p>
                <p>The space of planes—that is, all planes in space⅛ IV. Of four dimensions.</p>
                <p>The space of lines, or all lines in space.</p>
                <p>§ 6. The word dimension in the above needs explanation.</p>
                <p>If in a plane we take a row <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and a pencil with centre Q,
                    then through every point in <hi rend="italic">p</hi> one line in the pencil will
                    pass, and every ray in Q will cut <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in one point, so that
                    we are entitled to say a row contains as many points as a fiat pencil lines,
                    and, we may add, as an axial pencil planes, because an axial pencil is cut by a
                    plane in a flat pencil.</p>
                <p>The number of elements in the row, in the flat pencil, and in the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n403/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0403-0390"/> axial pencil is, of course, infinite and
                    indefinite too, but the same in all. For a moment we shall treat it as being a
                    definite number which we denote by <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Then a plane
                    contains α <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> points and as many lines. To see this,
                    take a flat pencil in a plane. It contains <hi rend="italic">a</hi> lines, and
                    each line contains <hi rend="italic">a</hi> points, whilst each point in the
                    plane lies on one of these lines. Similarly, in a plane each line cuts a fixed
                    line in a point. But this line is cut at each point by <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    lines and contains α points; hence there are α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    lines in a plane.</p>
                <p>A pencil in space contains as many lines as a plane contains points and as many
                    planes as a plane contains lines, for any plane cuts the pencil in a field of
                    points and lines. Hence a pencil contains α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> lines
                    and α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> planes. <hi rend="italic">The field and the
                        pencil are of two dimensions.</hi></p>
                <p>To count the number of points in space we observe that each point lies on some
                    line in a pencil. But the pencil contains α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    lines, and each line α points; hence space contains α <hi rend="superscript">
                        3</hi> points. Each plane cuts any fixed plane in a line. But a plane
                    contains α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> lines, and through each pass <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> planes; therefore space contains α <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 8</hi> planes.</p>
                <p>Hence space contains as many planes as points, but it contains an infinite number
                    of times more lines than points or planes. To count them, notice that every line
                    cuts a fixed plane in one point. But α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> lines pass
                    through each point, and there are α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> points in the
                    plane. Hence there are α <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> lines in space. <hi
                        rend="italic">The space of points and planes is of three dimensions, but the
                        space of lines is of four dimensions.</hi></p>
                <p>A field of points or lines contains an infinite number of rows and flat pencils;
                    a pencil contains an infinite number of flat pencils and of axial pencils; space
                    contains a triple infinite number of pencils and of fields, α <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 4</hi> rows and axial pencils, and α <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 5</hi> flat pencils— or, in other words, each point is a
                    centre of α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> flat pencils.</p>
                <p>§ 7. The above enumeration allows a classification of figures.</p>
                <p>Figures in a row consist of groups of points only, and figures in the flat or
                    axial pencil consist of groups of lines or planes. In the plane we may draw
                    polygons; and in the pencil or in the point, solid angles, and so on.</p>
                <p>We may also distinguish the different measurements. We have— In the row, lengtli
                    of segment;</p>
                <p>In the flat pencil, angles;</p>
                <p>In the axial pencil, dihedral angles between two planes;</p>
                <p>I a the plane, areas;</p>
                <p>In the pencil, solid angles;</p>
                <p>In the space of points or planes, volumes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Segments of a Line.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 8. Any two points A and B in space determine on the line through them a finite
                    part, which may be considered as being described by a point moving from A to B.
                    This we shall denote by AB, and distinguish it from BA, which is supposed as
                    being described by a point moving from B to A, and hence in a direction or in a
                    “sense” opposite to AB. Such a finite line, which has a definite sense, we shall
                    call a “segment,” so that AB and BA denote different segments, which are said to
                    be equal in length but of opposite sense. The one sense is often called positive
                    and the other negative.</p>
                <p>In introducing the word “sense” for direction in a line, we have the word
                    direction reserved for direction of the line itself, so that different lines
                    have different directions, unless they be parallel, whilst in each line we have
                    a positive and negative sense.</p>
                <p>We may also say, with Professor Clifford, that AB denotes the “step ’’ of going
                    from A to B.</p>
                <p>§ 9. If we now have three points A, B, C in a line (fig. 2), the step AB will
                    bring us from A to B, and the step BC from B to C. Hence both steps are
                    equivalent to the one step AC. This is expressed by saying that AC is the “sum”
                    of AB and BC; in symbols—</p>
                <p>AB + BC = AC, where account is to be taken of the sense.</p>
                <p>This equation is true whatever be the position of the three points on the line.
                    As a special case we have</p>
                <p>AB + BA=0 (1), and similarly</p>
                <p>AB + BC + CA=0 (2), which again is tine for any three points in a line.</p>
                <p>We further write</p>
                <p>AB=-BA, where — denotes negative sense.</p>
                <p>We can then, just as in algebra, change subtraction of segments into addition by
                    changing the sense, so that AB—CB is the same as AB + (-CB) or AB + BC. A figure
                    will at once show the truth of this. The sense is, in fact, in every respect
                    equivalent to the “sign” of a number iu algebra.</p>
                <p>§ 10. Of the many formulae which exist between points in a line we shall have to
                    use only one more, which connects the segments between any four points A, B, C.
                    D in a line. We have—</p>
                <p>BC = BD+DC, CA = CD +DA, AB≈AD+DB; or multiplying these by AD, BD, CD
                    respectively, we get—</p>
                <p>BC . AD = BD. AD + DC. AD = BD. AD-CD. AD</p>
                <p>CA . BD = CD . BD + DA. BD = CD . BD - AD. BD</p>
                <p>AB. CD = AD . CD + DB . CD = AD. CD - BD. CD.</p>
                <p>It will be seen that the sum of the right hand sides vanishes, hence that</p>
                <p>BC. AD + CA. BD + AB. CD - 0 . . . (3)</p>
                <p>for any four points on a line.</p>
                <p>§ 11. If C is any point in the line AB, then we say that C AC</p>

                    two segments AC and CB. If C lies between A and C the ratio is positive, as AC
                    and CB have the same sense. But if C lies without the segment AB, <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> if C divides AB externally, then the ratio is
                    negative. To see how the value of this ratio changes with C, . _</p>

                <p>A and B remain fixed. If C lies at the point A, then AC = 0, hence the ratio AC:
                    CB vanishes. As C moves towards B, AC increases and CB decreases, so that our
                    ratio increases. At the middle point Μ of AB it assumes the value +1, and then
                    increases till it reaches an infinitely large value, when C arrives at B. On
                    passing beyond B the ratio becomes negative. If C is at P we have AC=AP=AB + BP,
                    hence</p>

                <p>CB~PB <hi rend="superscript"> +</hi> PB BP <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi> *</p>
                <p>In the last expression the ratio AB: BP is positive, has its greatest value ∞
                    when C coincides with B, and vanishes when BC becomes infinite. Hence, as C
                    moves from B to the right to the point at infinity, the ratio AC: CB varies from
                    —∞ to —1.</p>
                <p>If on the other hand C is to the left of A, say at Q, we have AC = AQ = AB + BQ =
                    AB-QB, hence —</p>
                <p>Here AB &lt;QB, hence the ratio AB: QB is positive and always less than one, so
                    that the whole is negative and &lt;1. H C is at the point at infinity it is —1,
                    and then increases as C moves to the right, till for C at A we get the ratio =0.

                    fixed plane τr is called the projection of A on the plane <hi rend="italic"
                        >π</hi> from S as centre of projection. If we have two planes τr and <hi
                        rend="italic">π'</hi> and a point S, we may project every point A in π to
                    the other plane. If A' is the projection of A, then A is also the projection of
                    A', so that the relations are reciprocal. To every figure in <hi rend="italic"
                        >π</hi><hi rend="italic">we</hi> get as its projection a corresponding
                    figure in π'.</p>
                <p>It will be our business to find such properties of figures as remain true for the
                    projection, and which are called projective properties. For this purpose it will
                    be sufficient to consider at first only constructions in one plane.</p>
                <p>Let us suppose we have given in a plane two lines <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and ſk

                        >p</hi> from S to p'. Let A', B'... be the projections of A, B..., the point

                        <hi rend="italic">p</hi> through S cuts ſk. Similarly one point J in <hi

                <p>A glance at fig. 5 shows that a segment AB will be projected into a segment A'B'
                    which is not equal to it, at least not as a rule; and also that the ratio AC: CB
                    is not equal to the ratio A'C': C'B' formed by the projections. These ratios
                    will become equal only if <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p'</hi>
                    are parallel, for in this case the triangle SAB is similar to the triangle
                    SA'B'. Between three points in a line and their projections there exists
                    therefore in general no relation. But between four points a relation does
                    exist.</p>

                <p>This result is of fundamental importance.</p>
                <p>The expression formed has been called by Chasles the anharmonic ratio of the four
                    points A, B, C, D. Instead of this Professor Clifford has proposed the shorter
                    and more expressive, name of “crossratio.’' We shall adopt the latter. We have
                    then the <hi rend="smallcaps">Fundamental Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">The
                        cross-ratio of four points in a tine is equal to the cross-ratio of their
                        projections on any other line which lies in the same plane with it.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 14. Before we draw conclusions from this result, we must investigate the
                    meaning of a cross-ratio somewhat more fully.</p>
                <p>If four points A, B, C, D are given, and we wish to form their cross-ratio, we
                    have first to divide them into two groups of two, the points in each gιoup being
                    taken in a definite order. Thus, let A, B be the first, C, D the second pair, A
                    and C being the first points in each pair. The cross-ratio is then the ratio AC:
                    CB divided by AD: DB. This will be denoted by (ABCD), so that (ABCD)≈^:^.</p>
                <p>This is easily remembered. In order to write it out, make first the two lines for
                    the fractions, and put above and below these</p>
                <p>A A</p>
                <p>the letters A and B in their places, thus, —g <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> ~jj î
                    and then fill up, crosswise, the first by C and the other by D.</p>
                <p>§ 15. If we take the points in a different order, the value of the cross-ratio
                    will change. We can do this in twenty-four different ways by forming all
                    permutations of the letters. But of these twenty-four cross-ratios groups of
                    four are equal, so that there are really only six different ones.</p>
                <p>We have the following rules :—</p>
                <p>I. If in a cross-ratio the two groups be interchanged, its value remains
                    unaltered.</p>
                <p>(ABCD) = (CDAB).</p>
                <p>II. If in a cross-ratio the two points belonging to one of the two groups be
                    interchanged, the cross-ratio changes into its reciprocal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">(</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> abcd</hi><hi
                        rend="smallcaps">)-(λ⅛C)∙</hi></p>
                <p>III. If in a cross-ratio the two middle letters be interchanged, the cross-ratio
                        <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> changes into its complement 1 - <hi rend="italic"
                        >κ.</hi></p>
                <p>(ABCD) = 1- (ACBD).</p>
                <p>The first two are easily proved by writing out their values. The third is proved
                    by aid of the formula (3), § 10,</p>
                <p>BC. AD + CA. BD + AB. CD = 0.</p>
                <p>If we divide this by CB . AD we get</p>
                <p>, CA. BD , AB . CD ~ <hi rend="superscript"> 1 +</hi> CB. AD <hi

                <p>(ABCD) + (ACBD) = 1, which was 11 be proved.</p>
                <p>IV. From II. it follows at once that if we interchange the elements in each pair,
                    the cross-ratio remains unaltered; and thus we see that</p>
                <p>(ABCD) = (CDAB) by I.</p>
                <p>= (BADC) = (DCBA) by II.</p>
                <p>§ 16. By aid of these rules we get the following results :— (ABCD) ≈ (BADC) =
                    (CDAB) - (DCBA) = <hi rend="italic">κ.</hi> ( ABDC) = ( B ACD) - (CDBA) =
                    (DCAB)=J.</p>

                <p>(ADCB) = (BCDA) = (CBAD) = (DABC) = ^−.</p>
                <p>In the theorem that the cross-ratio of four points equals that of 'the
                    projections, the points have, of course, to be taken in the sañie order.</p>
                <p>§ 17. If one of the points of which a cross-ratio is formed is the point at
                    infinity in the line, the cross-ratio changes into a simple ratio. It is
                    convenient to let the point at infinity occupy the last place in the symbolic
                    expression for the cross-ratio. Thus if 1 is a point at infinity, we have</p>
                <p>(ABCI)=-~, because</p>
                <p>AI:IB--1.</p>
                <p>Every common ratio of three points in a line may thus De expressed as a
                    cross-ratio, by adding the point at infinity to the group of points.</p>
                <p>§ 18. If the points have special positions, the cross-ratios <hi rend="italic"
                        >κ</hi> may have such a value that, of the six different ones, two and two
                    become equal. If the first two shall be equal, we get κ = ^&gt; °r κ <hi

                <p>AC AD</p>
                <p>If we take κ= +1, we have (ABCD) = 1, or ðB <hi rend="superscript"> =</hi> DB
                    &gt; that <hi rend="superscript"> ιs</hi> &gt; the points C and D coincide,
                    provided that A and B are different. This is too special a case to be of much
                    interest.</p>
                <p>If, however, we take κ=-l, so that (ABCD)=-1, we have θβ= - ∙θβ . <hi

                <p>But we have also (CDAB) = -1, so that A and B are harmonic conjugates with regard

                <p>The principal property of harmonic points, upon which almost all applications
                    depend, is this, that their cross-ratio remains unaltered if we interchange the

                <p><hi rend="italic">κ=</hi>-1, l-κ = 2, jτy = i∙</p>
                <p>l- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,+= <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>,⅛</p>
                <p>Hence if we get four points whose cross-ratio is 2 or ⅜, then they are harmonic,
                    but not arranged so that conjugates are paired. If this is the case the
                    cross-ratio = —1.</p>
                <p>§ 19. If we equate any two of the above six values of the crossratios, we get
                    either κ = l, 0, ∞, or <hi rend="italic">κ=</hi>-1, 2, ⅛, or else <hi
                        rend="italic">κ</hi> becomes a root of the equation <hi rend="italic"

                        rend="italic">κ</hi> +1 = 0, that is, an imaginary cube root of - 1. In this
                    case the six values become three and three equal, so that only two different
                    values remain. This case, though important in the theory of cubic curves, is for
                    our purposes of no interest, whilst harmonic points are all-important.</p>
                <p>§ 20. From the definition of harmonic points, and by aid of §11, the following
                    properties are easily deduced.</p>
                <p>If C and D are harmonic conjugates with regard to A and B, then one of them lies
                    in, the other without AB; it is impossible to move from A to B without passing
                    either through C or through D; the one blocks the finite way, the other the way
                    through infinity. This is expressed by saying A and B are “separated” by C and
                    D.</p>
                <p>For every position of C there will be one and only one point D which is its
                    harmonic conjugate with regard to any point pair A, B.</p>
                <p>If A and B are different points, and if C coincides with A or B, D does. But if A
                    and B coincide, one of the points C or D, lying between them, coincides with
                    them, and the other may be anywhere in the line. It follows that, <hi
                        rend="italic">“if of four harmonic conjugates two coincide, then a third
                        coincides with them, and the fourth may be any</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >j&gt;oint</hi><hi rend="italic">in the line."</hi></p>
                <p>If C is the middle point between A and B, then D is the point at infinity for
                    AC:CB=+1, hence AD: DB must be equal to -1. <hi rend="italic">The harmonic
                        conjugate of the point at infinity in a line with regard to two points</hi>
                    A, B <hi rend="italic">is the middle point of</hi> AB.</p>
                <p>This important property gives a first example how metric properties are connected
                    with projective ones.</p>
                <p>§ 21. <hi rend="italic">Complete Quadrilateral.—</hi> A figure formed by four
                    lines in a plane is called a complete quadrilateral or, shorter, a four-side
                    (fig. 7). The figure has six <hi rend="italic">vertices,</hi> that is, points
                    where the sides meet, and three diagonals AB, EF, GH, which join <hi
                        rend="italic">opposite</hi> vertices.</p>
                <p>Similarly a figure formed by four points in a plane is called a four-point. It
                    has six sides, which join the points, or vertices, and three diagonal points,
                    where the sides meet.</p>
                <p>The three diagonals of a four-side cut each other harmonically.</p>
                <p>If we project the points E, F, K, D from H to AB, we get (EFKD) = (ABCD), and if
                    we project them from G, we get</p>
                <p>(EFKD)≈(BACD); so that</p>
                <p>(ABCD) = (BACD), that is, the cross-ratio (ABCD) is equal to its reciprocal,
                    hence = -1, as the four points are all different. This gives the important
                    theorem :—</p>

                <p>This remarkable construction requires nothing but the drawing of lines, and is
                    therefore independent of measurement. It follows, also, that <hi rend="italic"

                <p>§ 22. The theory of cross-ratios may be extended from points in a row to lines in
                    a flat pencil, and to planes in an axial pencil. We have seen (§ 13) that if the
                    lines which join four points A, B, C, D to any point S be cut by any other line
                    in A', B', C, D', then (ABCD) = (A'B'C'D'). In other words, four lines in a flat
                    pencil are cut by every other line in four points whose cross-ratio is
                    constant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> By the cross-ratio of four rays in a flat
                    pencil is meant the cross-ratio of the four points in which the rays are cut by
                    any line. If <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the
                    lines, then this cross-ratio is denoted, by <hi rend="italic">(abed).</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> By the cross-ratio of four planes in an
                    axial pencil is understood the cross-ratio of the four points in which any line
                    cuts the planes, or, what is the same thing, the cross-ratio of the four rays in
                    which any plane cuts the four planes.</p>
                <p>In order that this definition may have a meaning, it has to be proved that all
                    lines cut the pencil in points which have the same cross-ratio. This is seen at
                    once for two intersecting lines, as their plane cuts the axial pencil in a flat
                    pencil, which is itself cut by the two lines. The cross-ratio of the four points
                    on one line is therefore equal to that on the other, and equal to that of the
                    four rays in the flat pencil.</p>
                <p>If two non-intersecting lines <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >q</hi> cut the four planes in A, B, 0, D and A', B', C', D', draw a line

                    cut the planes in A",B",C",D". Then (ABCD) = (A'B'C'D ’), for each is equal to
                    (A"B"C"D").</p>
                <p>§ 23. We may now also extend the notion of harmonic elements, viz. :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> Four rays in a flat pencil and four planes in
                    air axial pencil are said to be harmonic if their cross-ratio equals - 1, that
                    is, if they are cut by a line in four harmonic points.</p>
                <p>Harmonic pencils are constructed by aid of the theorem in § 21, which may now be
                    stated thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">In a four-side two sides are harmonic conjugates with regard to
                        the diagonal through their intersection and the line from this point to the

                    first.</hi></p>
                <p>If we understand by a “median line” of a triangle a line which joins a vertex to
                    the middle point of the opposite side, and by a “median line” of a parallelogram
                    a line joining middle points of opposite sides, we get as special cases of the
                    last theorem :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The diagonals and median lines of a parallelogram form an

                <p>Taking the parallelogram a rectangle, or the triangle isosceles, we get :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Any two lines and the

                <p>This connects perpendicularity and bisection of angles with projective

                <p>§ 24. We add a few theorems and problems which are easily proved or solved by aid
                    of harmonics.</p>
                <p>An harmonic pencil is cut by a line parallel to one of its rays in three

                <p>Having given in a line a segment and its middle point, to draw through any given

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Correspondence.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 25. Two rows, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and p', which are one the projection of
                    the other (as in fig. 5), stand in a definite relation to each other,
                    characterized by the following properties.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">To each point in either corresponds one point in the

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The cross-ratio of any four points in one equals that of the

                <p>If we suppose corresponding points marked, and the rows brought into any other

                    longer; but we have still a <pb break="no"

                    rows possessing the first two properties. Such a correspondence has been called
                    a <hi rend="italic">one-one correspondence,</hi> whilst the two rows between
                    which such correspondence has been established are said to be <hi rend="italic"

                        >perspective.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 26. The notion of a one-one correspondence between rows may be extended to flat
                    and axial pencils, viz., a flat pencil will be said to be projective to a flat
                    pencil if to each ray in the first corresponds one ray in the second, and if the
                    cross-ratio of four rays in one equals that of the corresponding rays in the
                    second.</p>
                <p>Similarly an axial pencil may be projective to an axial pencil. But a flat pencil
                    may also be projective to an axial pencil, or either pencil may be projective to
                    a row. The definition is the same in each case: there is a one-one
                    correspondence between the elements, and four elements have the same cross-ratio
                    as the corresponding ones.</p>
                <p>§ 27. There is also in each case a special position which is called <hi
                        rend="italic">perspective,</hi> viz. :—</p>
                <p>1. Two projective rows are perspective if they lie in the same plane, and if the
                    one row is a projection of the other.</p>
                <p>2. Two projective flat pencils are perspective—(a) if they lie in the same plane,
                    and have a row as a common section; <hi rend="italic">(β)</hi> if they lie in
                    the same pencil (in space), and are both sections of the same axial pencil; (7)
                    if they are in space and have a row as common section, or are both sections of
                    the same axial pencil, one of the conditions involving the other.</p>
                <p>3. Two projective axial pencils, if their axes meet, and if they have a flat
                    pencil as a common section.</p>
                <p>4. A row and a projective flat pencil, if the row is a section of the pencil,
                    each point lying in its corresponding line.</p>
                <p>5. A row and a projective axial pencil, if the row is a section of the pencil,
                    each point lying in its corresponding line.</p>
                <p>6. A flat and a projective axial pencil, if the former is a section of the other,
                    each ray lying in its corresponding plane.</p>
                <p>That in each case the correspondence established by the position indicated is
                    such as has been called projective follows at once from the definition. It is
                    not so evident that the perspective position may always be obtained. We shall
                    show in § 30 this for the first three cases. First, however, we shall give a few
                    theorems which relate to the general correspondence, not to the perspective

                <p>The proof again is the same as in § 30.</p>
                <p>§ 34. These theorems relating to perspective position become illusory if the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Theorem.—</hi> In two projective rows on the same line—and also

                    with its corresponding element in the other as soon as three elements in the one

                    (ABCD) = (ABCD'); hence D and D' coincide.</p>
                <p>The last theorem may also be stated thus :—</p>

                <p>Thus two projective rows on the same line cannot have more than two pairs of
                    coincident points unless every point coincides with its corresponding point.</p>
                <p>It is easy to construct two projective rows on the same line, which have two
                    pairs of corresponding points coincident. Let the points A, B, C as points
                    belonging to the one row correspond to A, B, and C' as points in the second.
                    Than A and B coincide with their corresponding points, but C does not. It is,
                    however, not necessary that two such rows have twice a point coincident with its
                    corresponding point; it is possible that this happens only once or not at all.
                    Of this we shall see plenty of examples as we go on.</p>
                <p>§ 35. If two projective rows or pencils are in perspective position, we know at
                    once which element in one corresponds to any given element in the other. If <hi

                    then the point S, where AA' meets BB', is the centre of projection, and hence,
                    in order to find the point C <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> corresponding to C,
                    we have only to join C to S; the point C', where this line cuts <hi

                <p>If two flat pencils, S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and S <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>Asimilar construction holds in the other casesof perspective figures. On this
                    depends the solution of the following general problem.</p>

                    the corresponding ray d' in S'.</p>
                <p>The solution is made to depend on the construction of an auxiliary row or pencil
                    which is perspective to both the given ones. This is found as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Solution· of Problem</hi> I.—On the line joining two

                <p>§ 41. It has been stated in § 1 that not only points, but also planes and lines,
                    are taken as elements out of which figures are built up. We shall now see that
                    the construction of one figure which possesses certain properties gives rise in
                    many cases to the construction of another figure, by replacing, according to
                    definite rules, elements of one kind by those of another. The new figure thus
                    obtained will then possess properties which may be stated as soon as those of
                    the original figure are known.</p>
                <p>We obtain thus a principle, known as the <hi rend="italic">principle of
                        duality</hi> or of <hi rend="italic">reciprocity,</hi> which enables us to
                    construct to any figure not containing any measurement in its construction a <hi
                        rend="italic">reciprocal</hi> figure, as it is called, and to deduce from
                    any theorem a <hi rend="italic">reciprocal</hi> theorem, for which no further
                    proof is needed.</p>
                <p>It is convenient to print reciprocal propositions on opposite sides of a page
                    broken into two columns, and this plan will occasionally be adopted.</p>
                <p>We begin by repeating in this form a few of our former statements :—</p>
                <p>Two points determine a line. Two planes determine a line.</p>
                <p>Three points which are not in a Three planes which do not pass line determine a
                    plane. through a line determine a point.</p>
                <p>A line and a point without it deA line and a plane not through it termine a
                    plane. determine a point.</p>
                <p>Two lines in a plane determine a Two lines through a point deterpoint. mine a
                    plane.</p>
                <p>These propositions show that it will be possible, when any figure is given, to
                    construct a second figure by taking planes instead of points, and points instead
                    of planes, but lines where we had lines.</p>
                <p>For instance, if in the first figure we take a plane and three points in it, we
                    have to take in the second figure a point and three planes through it. Tlιe
                    three points in the first, together with the three lines joining them two and
                    two, form a triangle; the three planes in the second and their three lines of
                    intersection form a trihedral angle. A triangle and a trihedral angle are
                    therefore reciprocal figures.</p>
                <p>Similarly, to any figure in a plane consisting of points and lines will
                    correspond a figure consisting of planes and lines passing through a point S,
                    and hence belonging to the pencil which has S as centre.</p>
                <p>The figure reciprocal to four points in space which do not lie in a plane will
                    consist of four planes which do not meet in a point. In this case each figure
                    forms a tetrahedron.</p>
                <p>§ 42. As other examples we have the following :—</p>
                <p>To a row is reciprocal an axial pencil,</p>
                <p>„ a flat pencil „ a flat pencil,</p>
                <p>,, a field of points and lines „ a pencil of planes and lines,</p>
                <p>„ the space of points „ the space of planes.</p>
                <p>For the row consists of a line and all the points in it, reciprocal to it
                    therefore will be a line with all planes through it, that is, an axial pencil;
                    and so for the other cases.</p>
                <p>This correspondence of reciprocity breaks down, however, if we take figures which
                    contain measurement in their construction. For instance, there is no figure
                    reciprocal to two planes at <hi rend="italic">right angles,</hi> because there
                    is no segment in a row which has a magnitude as definite as a right angle.</p>
                <p>We add a few examples of reciprocal propositions which are easily proved.</p>

                <p>§ 43. Reciprocal figures as explained lie both in space of three dimensions. If
                    the one is confined to a plane (is formed of elements which lie in a plane),
                    then the reciprocal figure is confined to a pencil (is formed of elements which
                    pass through a point).</p>
                <p>But there is also a more special principle of duality, according to which figures
                    are reciprocal which lie both in a plane or both in a pencil. In the plane we
                    take points and lines as reciprocal elements, for they have this fundamental
                    property in common, that two elements of one kind determine one of the other. In
                    the pencil, on the other hand, lines and planes have to be taken as reciprocal,
                    and here it holds again that two lines or planes determine one plane or
                    line.</p>
                <p>Thus, to one plane figure we can construct one reciprocal figure in the plane,
                    and to each one reciprocal figure in a pencil. We mention a few of these. At
                    first we explain a few names :—</p>
                <p>A figure consisting of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> points in A figure consisting of
                        <hi rend="italic">n</hi> lines in a a plane will be called an n-point. plane
                    will be called an n-side.</p>
                <p>A figure consisting of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> planes in a A figure consisting
                    of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> lines in a pencil will be called an n-flat. pencil
                    will be called an n-edge.</p>
                <p>It will be understood that an n-side is different from a polygon of <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi> sides. The latter has sides of finite length and <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi> vertices, the former has sides all of infinite
                    extension, and every point where two of the sides meet will be a vertex; A
                    similar difference exists between a solid angle and an n-edge or an n-flat. We
                    notice particularly—</p>
                <p>A four-point has six sides, of which A four-side has six vertices, of two and two
                    are opposite, and three which two and two are opposite, diagonal points, which
                    are intersec-and three diagonals, which join tions of opposite sides. opposite
                    vertices.</p>
                <p>A four-flat has six edges, of which A four-edge has six faces, of which two and
                    two are opposite, aud three two and two are opposite, and three diagonal planes,
                    which pass through diagonal edges, which are intersecopposite edges. tions of
                    opposite faces.</p>
                <p>A four-side is usually called a complete quadrilateral. The above notation,
                    however, seems better adapted for the statement of reciprocal propositions.</p>

                <p>A curve thus appears as generated either by points, and then we call it a
                    “locus,” or by lines, and then we call it an “envelope.” In the same manner a
                    cone, which means here a surface, appears either as the locus of lines passing
                    through a fixed point, the “vertex” of the cone, or as the envelope of planes
                    passing through the same point.</p>
                <p>To a surface as locus of points corresponds, in the same manner, a surface as
                    envelope of planes; and to a curve in space as locus of points corresponds a
                    developable surface as envelope of planes. Of the latter we shall not say any
                    more at present.</p>
                <p>It will be seen from the above that we may, by aid of the principle of duality,
                    construct for every figure a reciprocal figure, and that to any property of the
                    one a reciprocal property of the other will exist, as long as we consider only
                    properties which depend upon nothing but the positions and intersections of the
                    different elements and not upon measurement.</p>
                <p>For suc∙lι propositions it will therefore be unnecessary to prove more than one
                    of two reciprocal theorems.</p>

                <p>§ 46. We state the theorems in the pencil reciprocal to the last, without proving
                    them :—</p>

                <p>§ 47. Of theorems about cones of second order and cones of second class we shall
                    state only very few. We point out, however, the following connexion between the
                    curves and cones under consideration :—</p>
                <p>The lines which join any point in Every plane section of a cone of space to the
                    points on a curve of the the second order is a curve of the second order form a
                    cone of the second order, second order.</p>
                <p>The planes which join any point in Every plane section of a cone of space to the
                    lines enveloping a curve the second class is a curve of the of the second class
                    envelope them-second class, selves a cone of the second class.</p>
                <p>By its aid, or by the principle of duality, it will be easy to obtain theorems
                    about them from the theorems about the curves.</p>
                <p>We prove the first. A curve of the second order is generated by two projective
                    pencils. These pencils, when joined to the point in space, give rise to two
                    projective axial pencils, which generate the cone in question as locus of the
                    lines where corresponding planes meet.</p>

                    enveloping lines or tangents.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Proof.</hi> —If S and S' are the two <hi rend="italic"
                        >Proof.—</hi> If s and <hi rend="italic">s'</hi> are the two pencils, then

                    in s' corresponds in s a point cil S a ray <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> which is
                    different from P, which is not coincident with P ’, <hi rend="italic">p',</hi>
                    for the pencils are not perspec-for the rows are not perspective. But five. But
                        <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p'</hi> meet at S, so that P
                    and P' are joined by s, so that s is</p>
                <p>S is a point on the curve, and simi-one of the enveloping lines, and larly S'.
                    similarly s'.</p>
                <p>It follows that every line in one of the two pencils cuts the curve in two
                    points, viz., once at the centre S of the pencil, and once where it cuts its
                    corresponding ray in the other pencil. These two points, however, coincide, if
                    the line is cut by its corresponding line at S itself. The line <hi
                        rend="italic">p</hi> in S, which corresponds to the line SS' in S', is
                    therefore the only line through S which has but one point in common with the
                    curve, or which cuts the curve in two <hi rend="italic">coincident</hi> points.
                    Such a line is called a tangent to the curve, touching the latter at the point
                    S, which is called the point of contact.</p>
                <p>In the same manner we get in the reciprocal investigation the result that through
                    every point in one of the rows, say in <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> two tangents
                    may be drawn to the curve, the one being <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> the other the
                    line joining the point to its corresponding point in <hi rend="italic">sl.</hi>
                    There is, however, one point P in s for which these two lines coincide. Such a
                    point in one of the tangents is called the “point of contact” of the tangent. We
                    thus get—</p>

                    curve of the second order generated by the points of intersection of
                    corresponding rays is determined. Of this curve we know the two centres S <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and the three
                    points <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi

                    five points in all. This and the reciprocal considerations enable us to solve
                    the following two problems :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Problem.—</hi> To construct a curve of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Problem.</hi> —To construct a curve the second order, of which five of the
                    second class, of which five points S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, S <hi

                        rend="italic">b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> are given.</p>
                <p>In order to solve the left-hand problem, we take two of the given points, say S
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, as centres
                    of pencils. These we make projective by taking the rays α <hi rend="subscript">
                        1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">,</hi> c <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, which join S <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to A, B, C respectively, as corresponding to the
                    rays α <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">,

                    S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to A, B, C respectively, so that three rays meet
                    their corresponding rays at the given points A, B, C. This determines the
                    correspondence of the pencils which will generate a curve of the second order
                    passing through A, B, C and through the centres S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, hence through the five given points. To find
                    more points on the curve we have to construct for any ray in S <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the corresponding ray in S <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi>. This has been done in § 36. But we repeat the con struction in order
                    to deduce further properties from it. We also solve the right-hand problem. Here
                    we select two, viz., <hi rend="italic">u</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">

                <p>We get then the following solutions of the two problems :—</p>

                    the second order. In order that this may be the case a certain condition has to
                    be satisfied, and this condition is easily obtained from the construction in §
                    49, fig. 15. If we consider the conic determined by the five points A, S <hi

                <p>These celebrated theorems, which are known by the names of their discoverers, are
                    perhaps the most fruitful in the whole theory of conics. Before we go over to
                    their applications we have to show that we obtain the same curve if we take,
                    instead of S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, any
                    two other points on the curve as centres of projective pencils.</p>
                <p>§ 52. We know that the curve depends only upon the correspondence between the
                    pencils S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and
                    not upon the special construction used for finding new points on the curve. The
                    point A (fig. 15 or fig. 17), through which the two auxiliary rows <hi
                        rend="italic">u</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">,
                        u,</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi> were drawn, may therefore be
                    changed to any other point on the curve. Let us now suppose the curve drawn, and
                    keep the points S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    K, L, and D, and hence also the point S fixed, whilst we move A along the curve.
                    Then the line AL will describe a pencil about L as centre, and the point D <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> a row on S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> D
                    perspective to the pencil L. At the same time AK describes a pencil about K and
                    D <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> a row perspective to it on S <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 2</hi> D. But by Pascal’s Theorem D <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and D <hi
                        rend="subscript"> ä</hi> will always lie in a line with S, so that the rows

                    are perspective. It follows that the pencils K and L will themselves be
                    projective, corresponding rays meeting on the curve. This proves that we get the
                    same curve whatever pair of the five given points we take as centres of
                    projective pencils. Hence—</p>

                <p>We have seen that if on a curve of the second order two points coincide at A, the
                    line joining them becomes the tangent at A. If, therefore, a point on the curve
                    and its tangent are given, this will be equivalent to having given two points on
                    the curve. Similarly, if on the curve of second class a tangent and its point of
                    contact are given, this will be equivalent to two given tangents.</p>
                <p>We may therefore extend the last theorem :—</p>

                <p>§ 53. At the same time it has been proved :—</p>

                <p>We have seen that a curve of second order, as generated by projective pencils,
                    has at the centre of each pencil one tangent; and further, that any point on the
                    curve may be taken as centre of such pencil. Hence—</p>

                <p>§ 54. We return to Pascal’s and Brianchon’s theorems and their applications, and
                    shall, as before, state the results both for curves of the second order and
                    curves of the second class, but prove them only for the former.</p>
                <p>Pascal’s theorem may be used when five points are given to find more points on
                    the curve, viz., it enables us to find the point where any line through one of
                    the given points cuts the curve again. It is convenient, in making use of
                    Pascal’s theorem, to number the points, to indicate the order in which they are
                    to be taken in forming a hexagon, which, by the way, may be done in 60 different
                    ways. It will be seen that 1 2 and (leaving out 3) 4 5 are opposite sides, so
                    are 2 3 and (leaving out 4) 5 6, and also 3 4 and (leaving out 5) 6 1.</p>
                <p>If the points 1 2 3 4 5 are given, and we want a 6th point on a line drawn
                    through 1, we know all the sides of the hexagon with the exception of 5 6, and
                    this is found by Pascal’s theorem.</p>
                <p>If this line should happen to pass through 1, then 6 and 1 coincide, or the line
                    6 1 is the tangent at 1. And always if two consecutive vertices of the hexagon
                    approach nearer and nearer, then the side joining them will ultimately become a
                    tangent.</p>
                <p>We may therefore consider a pentagon inscribed in a curve of second order and the
                    tangent at one of its vertices as a hexagon, and thus get the theorem :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theorem.</hi> —Every pentagon in- <hi rend="italic"

                    contact of the opposite side.</p>

                <p>§ 55. Of these theorems, those about the quadrilateral give rise to a number of
                    others. Four points A, B, C, 1) may in three different ways be formed into a
                    quadrilateral, for we may take them in the order ABCD, or ACBD, or ACDB, so that
                    either of the points B, C, D may be taken as the vertex opposite to A.
                    Accordingly we may apply the theorem in three different ways.</p>
                <p>Let A, B, C, D be four points on a curve of second order (fig. 20), and let us
                    take them as forming a quadrilateral by taking the points in the order ABCD, so
                    that A, C and also B, D are pairs of opposite vertices. Then P, Q will be the
                    points where opposite sides meet, and E, F the intersections of tangents at
                    opposite vertices. The four points P, Q, E, F lie therefore in a line. The
                    quadrilateral ACBD gives us in the same way the four points Q, R, G, H in a
                    line, and the quadrilateral ABDC a line containing the four points R, P, I, K.
                    These three lines form a triangle PQR.</p>
                <p>The relation between the points and lines in this figure may be expressed more
                    clearly if we consider ABCD as a four-point inscribed in a conic, and the
                    tangent at these points as a four-side circumscribed about it,—viz., it will be
                    seen that P, Q, R are the diagonal points of the four-point ABCD, whilst the
                    sides of the triangle PQR are the diagonals of the circumscribing four-side.
                    Hence the theorem—</p>

                <p>That the last part of the theorem is true follows from the fact that the four

                    determine a curve of the second order, and the tangents to this curve at the

                    Hence if we have a four-point ABCD and a four-side <hi rend="italic">abed</hi>
                    related in the manner described, then not only may a curve of the second order
                    be drawn, but also a curve of the second class, which both touch the lines <hi
                        rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> at the points A, B, C,
                    D.</p>
                <p>The curve of second order is already more than determined by the points A, B, C
                    and the tangents <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">c</hi> at A, B, and C. The point D may therefore be <hi
                        rend="italic">any</hi> point on this curve, and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> any
                    tangent to the curve. On the other hand the curve of the second class is more
                    than determined by the three tangents <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> and their points of contact A, B, C, so
                    that <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is any tangent to this curve. It follows that
                    every tangent to the curve of second order is a tangent of a curve of the second
                    class having the same point of contact. In other words, the curve of second
                    order is a curve of second class, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Hence
                    the important theorems :—</p>

                <p>The curves of second order and of second class having thus been proved to be

                <p>For these curves hold, therefore, all properties which have been proved for
                    curves of second order or of second class. We may therefore now state Pascal’s
                    and Brianchon’s theorem thus—</p>

                <p>§ 57. If we suppose in fig. 20 that the point D together with the tangent <hi

                    through Q. Hence the pencil described by AD is projective to the pencil

                <p>§ 58. There are theorems about cones of second order and second class in a pencil
                    which are reciprocal to the above, according to § 43. We mention only a few of

                <p>Each of the other theorems about conics may be stated for cones of the second
                    order.</p>
                <p>§ 59. We have not yet considered the shape of the conics. We know that any line
                    in the plane of the conic, and hence that the line at infinity, either has no
                    point in common with the curve, or one (counting for two coincident points), or
                    two distinct points. If the line at infinity has no point on the curve the
                    latter is altogether finite, and is called an <hi rend="italic">Ellipse</hi>
                    (fig. 20). If the line at infinity has only one point in common with the conic,
                    the latter extends to infinity, and has the line at infinity a tangent. It is
                    called a <hi rend="italic">Parabola</hi> (fig. 21). If, lastly, the line at
                    infinity cuts the curve in two points, it consists of two separate parts which
                    each extend in two branches to the points at infinity were they meet. The curve
                    is in this case called an <hi rend="italic">Hyperbola</hi> (see fig. 19, 24, or
                    25). The tangents at the two points at infinity are finite because the line at
                    infinity is not a tangent. They are called <hi rend="italic">Asymptotes.</hi>
                    The branches of the hyperbola approach these lines indefinitely as a point on
                    the curves moves to infinity.</p>
                <p>§ 60. That the circle belongs to the curves of the second order is seen at once
                    if we state in a slightly different form the theorem <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n412/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0412-0399"/> that in a circle all angles at the
                    circumference standing upon the same arc are equal. If two points S <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> on a circle be
                    joined to any other two points A and B on the circle, then the angle included by
                    the rays S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> A and S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B
                    is equal to that between the rays S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> A and S <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> B, so that as A moves along the circumference the
                    rays S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> A and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> A
                    describe equal and therefore projective pencils. The circle can thus be
                    generated by two projective pencils, and is a curve of the second order.</p>
                <p>If we join a point in space to all points on a circle, we get a (circular) cone
                    of the second order (§ 43). Every plane section of this cone is a conic. This
                    conic will be an ellipse, a parabola, or an hyperbola, according as the line at
                    infinity in the plane has no, one, or two points in common with the conic in
                    which the plane at infinity cuts the cone. It follows that our curves of second
                    order may be obtained as sections of a circular cone, and that they are
                    identical with the “Conic Sections” of the Greek mathematicians.</p>
                <p>§ 61. Any two tangents to a parabola are cut by all others in projective rows;
                    but the line at infinity being one of the tangents, the points at infinity on
                    the rows are corresponding points, and the rows therefore similar. Hence—</p>

                <p>§ 62. We return once again to the remarkable figure (fig. 20) which we obtained
                    in § 55.</p>
                <p>If a four-side be circumscribed about and a four-point inscribed in a conic, so
                    that the vertices of the second are the points of contact of the sides of the
                    first, then the triangle formed by the diagonals of the first is the same as
                    that formed by the diagonal points of the other.</p>
                <p>Such a triangle will be called a <hi rend="italic">polar triangle</hi> of the
                    conic, so that PQR in fig. 20 is a polar triangle. It has the property that on
                    the side <hi rend="italic">p</hi> opposite P meet the tangents at A and B, and
                    also those at C and D. From the harmonic properties of four-points and
                    four-sides it follows further that the points L, Μ, where it cuts the lines AB
                    and CD, are harmonic conjugates with regard to AB and CD respectively.</p>
                <p>If the point P is given, and we draw a line through it, cutting the conic in A
                    and B, then the point Q harmonic conjugate to P with regard to AB, and the point
                    H where the tangents at A and B meet, are determined. But they lie both on <hi
                        rend="italic">p,</hi> and therefore this line is determined. If we now draw
                    a second line through P, cutting the conic in C and D, then the point Μ harmonic
                    conjugate to P with regard to CD, and the point G where the tangents at C and D
                    meet, must also lie on <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> As the first line through P
                    already determines <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the second may be any line through
                    P. Now every two lines through P determine a four-point ABCD on the conic, and
                    therefore a polar-triangle which has one vertex at P and its opposite side at
                        <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> This result, together with its reciprocal, give

                <p>§ 63. To any point P in the plane of but not on a conic corresponds thus one line
                        <hi rend="italic">p</hi> as the side opposite to P in all polar triangles
                    which have ope vertex at P, and reciprocally to every line <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The truth of 2 follows from 1. If T be a point where <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    cuts the conic, then one of the points where PT cuts the conic, and which are
                    harmonic conjugates with regard to PT, coincides with T; hence the other
                    does—that is, PT touches the curve at T.</p>
                <p>That 4 is true follows thus: If we draw from a point H on the polar one tangent
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to the conic, join its point of contact A to the
                    pole P, determine the second point of intersection B of this line with the
                    conic, and draw the tangent at B, it will pass through H, and will therefore be
                    the second tangent which may be drawn from H to the curve.</p>
                <p>§ 65. The second property of the polar or pole gives rise to the theorem—</p>

                    separate those within the conic from those without. That this is true for a

                    follows from the fact that every conic may be considered as the projection of a
                    circle, which will be proved later on.</p>

                    Practically it is often convenient to draw three secants through the pole, and
                    to determine only one of the diagonal points for two of the four-points formed
                    by pairs of these lines and the conic (fig. 21).</p>
                <p>These constructions also solve the problem :-—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Problem.—</hi> From a point without a conic, to draw the two
                    tangents to the conic by aid of the straight-edge only.</p>
                <p>For we need only draw the polar of the point in order to find the points of
                    contact.</p>
                <p>§ 66. The property of a polar-triangle may now be stated thus— <hi rend="italic"
                        >Theorem.—</hi> In a polar-triangle each side is the polar of the opposite
                    vertex, and each vertex is the pole of the opposite side.</p>
                <p>If P is one vertex of a polar-triangle, then the other vertices, Q and R, lie on
                    the polar <hi rend="italic">p</hi> of P. One of these vertices we may chose
                    arbitrarily. For if from any point Q on the polar a secant be drawn cutting the
                    conic in A and D (fig. 22), and if the lines joining these points to P cut the
                    conic again at B and C, then the line BC will pass through Q. Hence P and Q are
                    two of the vertices on the polar-triangle which is determined by the four-point
                    ABCD. The third vertex R lies also on the line <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> It
                    follows, therefore, also—</p>

                        of</hi> q.</p>
                <p>This is a very important theorem. It may also be stated thus—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If a point moves along a
                        line describing a row, its polar turns about the pole of the line describing

                        >the pole of the row.</hi></p>
                <p>To prove the last part, let us suppose that P, A, and B in fig. 22 remain fixed,
                    whilst Q moves along the polar <hi rend="italic">p</hi> of P. This will <pb

                    and B. Hence Q and R describe projective rows, and hence PR, which is the polar
                    of Q, describes a pencil projective to either.</p>
                <p>§ 67. Two points, of which one, and therefore each, lies on the polar of the
                    other, are said to be <hi rend="italic">conjugate with regard to the conic;</hi>
                    and two lines, of which one, and therefore each, passes through the pole of the
                    other, are said to be <hi rend="italic">conjugate with regard to the conic.</hi>
                    Hence all points conjugate to a point P lie on the polar of P; all lines
                    conjugate to a line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> pass through the pole of <hi
                        rend="italic">p.</hi></p>
                <p>If the line joining two conjugate poles cuts the conic, then the poles are
                    harmonic conjugates with regard to the points of intersection; hence one lies
                    within the other without the conic, and all points conjugate to a point within a
                    conic lie without it.</p>
                <p>Of a polar-triangle any two vertices are conjugate poles, any two sides conjugate
                    lines. If, therefore, one side cuts a conic, then oue of the two vertices which
                    lie on this side is within and the other without the conic. The vertex opposite
                    this side lies also without, for it is the pole of a line which cuts the curve.
                    In this case therefore one vertex lies within, the other two without. If, on the
                    other hand, we begin with a side which does not cut the conic, then its pole
                    lies within and the other vertices without. Hence—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theorem.—</hi> Every polar triangle has one and only one vertex
                    within the conic.</p>
                <p>We add, without a proof, the theorem—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theorem.—</hi> The four points in which a conic is cut by two
                    conjugate polars are four harmonic points in the conic.</p>
                <p>§ 68. If two conics intersect in four points (they cannot have more points in
                    common, § 52), there exists one and only one four-point which is inscribed in
                    both, and therefore one polar triangle common to both.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theorem. —</hi> Two conics which intersect in four points have

                <p>The proof that these polar triangles are identical in case of a conic which have

                <p>Let AA' and BB' (fig. 23) be one pair of conjugate diameters at right angles to

                    DD', hence PA' is parallel to CC', and therefore PA and PA' are perpendicular.
                    If we further draw the tangents to the conic at A and A', these will be
                    perpendicular to AA', they being parallel to the conjugate diameter BB'. We know

                <p>In a circle every diameter is an axis, every point on it is a vertex; and any two

                    which has its centre at their intersection.</p>
                <p>If we describe on a diameter AB of an ellipse or hyperbola a circle concentric to
                    the conic, it will cut the latter in A and B (fig. 24). Each of the semicircles
                    in which it is divided by AB will be partly within, partly without the curve,
                    and must cut the latter therefore again in a point. The circle and the conic
                    have thus four points A, B, C, D, and therefore one polar-triangle, in common (§
                    68). Of this the centre is one vertex, for the line at infinity is the polar to
                    this point, both with regard to the circle and the other conic. The other two
                    sides are conjugate diameters of both, hence perpendicular to each other. This

                <p>§ 73. The first part of the right hand theorem in § 64 may be stated thus: any

                    with regard to the two tangents that may be drawn from P to the conic.</p>
                <p>If we take instead of P the centre C of an hyperbola, then the conjugate lines
                    become conjugate diameters, and the tangents asymptotes. Hence—</p>

                    requires measurement.</p>
                <p>§ 74. For the parabola, too, follow some metrical properties. A diameter PM (fig.
                    26) bisects every chord conjugate to it, and the pole P of such a chord BC lies
                    on the diameter. Buta diameter cuts the parabola once at infinity. Hence—</p>

                    intersections of the diagonals and the points of contact of opposite sides lie
                    in a line (§ 54). If therefore DEFG (fig. 27) is such a quadrilateral, then the

                    the asymptotes, that is, on the line at infinity; hence they are parallel. From

                    asymptotes of an hyperbola are equal in area.</p>
                <p>If we draw at a point P (fig. 27) on an hyperbola a tangent, the part HK between
                    the asymptotes is bisected at P. The parallelogram PQOQ' formed by the
                    asymptotes and lines parallel to them through P will be half the triangle OHK,
                    and will therefore be constant. If we now take the asymptotes OX and OY as
                    oblique axes of coordinates, the lines OQ and QP will be the coordinates of P,
                    and will satisfy the equation <hi rend="italic">xy =</hi> const, =α <hi

                <p>It is not difficult to get the equations to the ellipse and hyperbola referred to
                    their axes as axes of coordinates. We are satisfied to have shown in one case
                    that the curves of the second order as generated by projective pencils are the
                    same as those which are in coordinate geometry defined by equations of the
                    second degree.</p>

                <p>§ 76. If we have two projective rows, ABC on <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and A'B'C'
                    on <hi rend="italic">u',</hi> and place their bases on the same line, then each
                    point in this line counts twice, once as a point in the row <hi rend="italic"
                        >u</hi> and once as a point in the row u'. In fig. 28 we denote the points
                    as points in the one row by letters above the line A, B, C . . ., and as points
                    in the second row by A', B', C' .... below the line. Let now A and B' be the
                    same point, then to A will correspond a point A' in the second, and to B' a
                    point B in the first row. In general these points A' and B will be different. It
                    may, however, happen that they coincide. Then the correspondence is a peculiar
                    one, as the following theorem shows :—</p>

                <p>Proof. In order to determine the correspondence, we may assume three pairs of
                    corresponding points in two projective rows. Let then A', B <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, C', in fig. 29, correspond to A, B, C, so that A
                    and B', and also B and A', denote the same point. Let us further denote the
                    point C ’ when considered as a point in the first row by D; then it is to be
                    proved that the point D', which corresponds to D, is the same point as C. We
                    kno∖v that the cross-ratio of four points is equal to that of the corresponding
                    row. Hence</p>
                <p>(ABCD) = (A'B'C'D')</p>
                <p>but replacing the dashed letters by those undashed ones which denote the same
                    points, the second cross-ratio equals (BADD'), which, according to § 15, iv.,
                    equals (ABD ’ D); so that the equation becomes</p>
                <p>(ABCD) = ( ABD'D).</p>
                <p>This requires that C and D' coincide.</p>
                <p>§ 77. Two projective rows on the same base, which have the above property, that
                    to every point, whether it be considered as a point in the one or in the other
                    row, corresponds the same point, are said to be in <hi rend="italic"
                        >involution,</hi> or to form an <hi rend="italic">involution</hi> of points
                    on the line.</p>
                <p>We mention, but without proving it, that any two projective rows may be placed so
                    as to form an involution.</p>
                <p>An involution may be said to consist of a row of pairs of points, to every point
                    A corresponding a point A', and to A' again the point A. These points are said
                    to be conjugate.</p>
                <p>From the definition, according to which an involution may be considered as made
                    up of two projective rows, follow at once the following important properties
                    :—</p>
                <p>(1.) The cross-ratio of four points equals that of the four conjugate points.</p>
                <p>(2.) If we call a point which coincides with its conjugate point a “focus” of the
                    involution, we may say: An involution has either two foci, or one, or none, and
                    is called respectively a hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic involution (§
                    34).</p>
                <p>(3.) In a hyperbolic involution any two conjugate points are harmonic conjugates
                    with regard to the two foci.</p>
                <p>For if A, A'be two conjugate points, F <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, F <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> the two foci, then to the points F <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, F <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, A, A' in the one
                    row correspond the points F <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, F <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 2</hi>, A', A in the other, each focus corresponding to itself. Hence (F
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> F <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> AA') = (F <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> F <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> A'A)—that is, we may
                    interchange the two points AA' without altering the value of the cross-ratio,
                    which is the characteristic property of harmonic conjugates (§ 18).</p>

                <p>(4.) The point conjugate to the point at infinity is called the “centre” of the
                    involution. Every involution has a centre, unless the point at infinity be a
                    focus, in which case we may say that the centre is at infinity.</p>
                <p>In a hyperbolic involution the centre is the middle point between the foci.</p>
                <p>(5.) The product of the distances of two conjugate points A, A' from the centre 0
                    is constant :—</p>
                <p>OA.OA'-c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Proof.—</hi> Let A, A', and B, B' be two pairs of conjugate
                    points, 0 the centre, I the point at infinity, then</p>
                <p>(ABOI) = (A'B'IO), or</p>
                <p>OA. OA'= OB. OB'.</p>
                <p>In order to determine the distances of the foci from the centre, we write F for A
                    and A' and get</p>
                <p>ÕF <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =c; <hi rend="smallcaps">OF=±√c.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence if <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is positive OF is real, and has two values,
                    equal and opposite. The involution is hyperbolic.</p>
                <p>If c=0, OF = 0, and the two foci both coincide with the centre.</p>
                <p>If c is negative, √c becomes imaginary, and there are no foci. Hence we may
                    write—</p>
                <p>In a hyperbolic involution, OA. OA'=⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>,</p>
                <p>In a parabolic involution, OA. OA' = 0, In an elliptic involution, OA. OA'= - ⅛
                        <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi>.</p>
                <p>From these expressions it follows that conjugate points A, A' in a hyperbolic
                    involution lie on the same side of the centre, and in an elliptic involution on
                    opposite sides of the centre, and that in a parabolic involution one coincides
                    λvith the centre.</p>
                <p>In the first case, for instance, OA. OA' is positive; hence OA and OA' have the
                    same sign.</p>
                <p>It also follows that two segments, AA' and BB', between pairs of conjugate points
                    have the following positions:—in a hyperbolic involution they lie either one
                    altogether within or altogether without each other; in a parabolic involution
                    they have one point in common; and in an elliptic involution they overlap, each
                    being partly within and partly without the other.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Proof.—</hi> We have OA. OA' = OB. OB'=I∙ <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi> incase of a hyperbolic involution. Let A and B be
                    the points in each pair which are nearer to the centre 0. If now A, A' and B, B'
                    lie on the same side of ( ), and if B is nearer to 0 than A, so that OB&lt;OA,
                    then OB'≥OA'; hence B' lies further away from O than A', or the segment A A'
                    lies within BB'. And so on for the other cases.</p>
                <p>(6. ) An involution is determined—</p>
                <p>(a) By two pairs of conjugate points. Hence also</p>
                <p>(3) By one pair of conjugate points and the centre;</p>
                <p>(γ) By the two foci;</p>
                <p>(δ) By one focus aud one pair of conjugate points;</p>
                <p>(e) By one focus and the centre.</p>
                <p>(7.) The condition that A, B, C and A', B', C' may form an involution may be
                    written in one of the forms—</p>
                <p>(ABCC') = (A'B'C'C), or (ABCA') = (A'B'C'A), or (ABC'A')≈=(A'B'CA), for each
                    expresses that in the two projective rows in which A, B, C and A', B', C' are
                    conjugate points two conjugate elements may be interchanged.</p>
                <p>(8.) Any three pairs, A, A', B, B', C, C', of conjugate points are connected by
                    the relation—</p>

                    which, when worked out, gives the above relation.</p>
                <p>The latter is easily remembered by aid of the following rule of writing the first
                    side. First write</p>
                <p>B C A</p>
                <p>CAB’</p>
                <p>and then fill up the gaps in numerator and denominator by A', B', C'

                    (A'B'C'C)=-(ABCC').</p>
                <p>Hence by § 77 (7) the points are in involution.</p>
                <p>The theorem may also be stated thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theorem.—</hi> The three points in which any line cuts the

                <p>Or again—</p>
                <p>The projections from any point on to any line of the six vertices of a four-side
                    are six points in involution, the projections of opposite vertices being

                <p>This property gives a simple means to construct, by aid of the straight edge
                    only, in an involution of which two pairs of conjugate points are given, to any
                    point its conjugate.</p>
                <p>§ 79. The theory of involution may at once be extended from the row to the flat
                    and. the axial pencil—viz., we say that there is an involution in a flat or in
                    an axial pencil if any line cuts the pencil in an involution of points. An
                    involution in a pencil consists of pairs of conjugate rays or planes; it has
                    two, one, or no <hi rend="italic">focal rays</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >ρ&gt;lanes,</hi> but nothing corresponding to a centre.</p>
                <p>An involution in a flat pencil contains always one, and in general only one, pair
                    of conjugate rays which are perpendicular to one another. For in two projective
                    flat pencils exist always two corresponding right angles (§ 40).</p>
                <p>Each involution in an axial pencil contains in the same manner one pair of
                    conjugate planes at right angles to one another.</p>
                <p>As a rule, there exists but one pair of conjugate lines or planes at right angles
                    to each other. But it is possible that there are more, and then there is an
                    infinite number of such pairs. An involution in a flat pencil, in which every
                    ray is perpendicular to its conjugate ray, is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                        >circular.</hi> That such involution is possible is easily seen thus:—if in
                    two concentric flat pencils each ray on one is made to correspond to that ray on
                    the other which is perpendicular to it, then the two pencils are projective, for
                    if we turn the one pencil through a right angle each ray in one coincides with
                    its corresponding ray in the other. But these two projective pencils are in
                    involution.</p>

                        involution in a row may be considered as a section of a circular
                        involution.</hi><hi rend="italic">Proof.—</hi> In an elliptical involution
                    any two segments AA' and BB' lie partly within partly without each other (fig.
                    31). Hence two circles described on 'AA and BB' as diameters will intersect in
                    two points E and E'. The line EE' cuts the base of the involution at a point O,
                    which, from a well known proposition (Eucl.</p>
                <p>III. 35), has the property that OA,OA' = OB.OB', for each is equal to OE. OE'.
                    The point 0 is therefore the centre of tho involution. If we wish to construct
                    to any point C the conjugate point O', we may draw the circle through CEE'. This
                    will cut the base in the required point C' for OC.OC' = OA.OA'. But EC and EC'
                    are at right angles. Hence the involution which is obtained by joining E or E'
                    to the points in the given involution is circular. This may also be expressed

                <p><hi rend="italic">Problem. —</hi> To determine the centre and also the point

                    of conjugate points are given.</p>
                <p>§ 81. By the aid of § 53, the points on a conic may be made to correspond to
                    those on a line, so that the row of points on the conic is projective to a row
                    of points on a line. We may also have two projective rows on the same conic, an$
                    these will be in involution as soon as one point on the conic has the same point
                    corresponding to it all the same to whatever row it belongs. An involution of
                    points on a conic will have the property (as follows from its definition, and
                    from § 53) that the lines which join conjugate points of the involution to any
                    point on the conic are conjugate lines of an involution in a pencil, and that a
                    fixed tangent is cut by the tangents at conjugate points on the conic in points
                    which are again conjugate points of an involution on the fixed tangent. For such
                    involution on a conic the following theorem holds :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem. —</hi><hi rend="italic">The lines which join
                        corresponding points in an involution on a conic all pass through a fixed
                        point</hi>; and reciprocally, <hi rend="italic">the points of intersection
                        of conjugate lines in an involution among tangents to a conic lie on a
                        line.</hi></p>
                <p>We prove the first part only. The involution is determined by two pairs of
                    conjugate points, say by A, A' and B, B' (fig. 32). Let AA' and BB' meet in P.
                    If we join the points in involution to any point on the conic, and the conjugate
                    points to another point on the conic, we obtain two projective pencils. We take
                    A and A ’ as centres of these pencils, so that the pencils A(A'BB') and A'(AB'B)
                    are projective, and in perspective position, because AA' corresponds to A'A.
                    Hence corresponding rays meet in a line, of which two points are found by
                    joining AB' to A'B and AB to A'B'. It follows that the <hi rend="italic"
                        >axis</hi> of perspective is the polar of the point P, where A A' and BB'
                    meet. If we now wish to construct to any other point C on the conic the
                    corresponding point C', we join C to A' and the point where this line cuts <hi
                        rend="italic">y&gt;</hi> to A. The latter line cuts the conic again in C'.
                    But we know from the theory of pole and polar that the line CO' passes through
                    P.</p>

                <p>§ 82. The polars, with regard to a conic, of points in a row <hi rend="italic"
                        >p</hi> form a pencil P projective to the row (§ 66). This pencil cuts the
                    base of the row <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in a projective row.</p>
                <p>If A is a point in the given row, A' the point where the polar of A cuts <hi
                        rend="italic">p,</hi> then A and A' will be corresponding points. If we take
                    A' a point in the first row, then the polar of A' will pass through A, so that A
                    corresponds to A'—in other words, the rows are in involution. The conjugate
                    points in this involution are conjugate points with regard to the conic.
                    Conjugate points coincide only if the polar of a point A passes through’ A—that
                    is, if A lies on the conic. Hence—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">A conic determines on every
                        line in its plane an involution, in which those points are conjugate which
                        are also conjugate with regard to the conic.</hi><hi rend="italic">If the

                <p>If, on the other hand, we take a point P in the plain of a conic, we get to each
                    line <hi rend="italic">a</hi> through P one conjugate line which joins P to the
                    pole of <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> These pairs of conjugate lines through P form
                    an involution in the pencil at P. The focal rays of this involution are the
                    tangents drawn from P to the conic. This gives the theorem ’ reciprocal to the
                    last, viz. :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">A conic determines in every
                        pencil in its plane an involution, corresponding lines being conjugate lines

                        involution is elliptic, having no focal rays.</hi></p>
                <p>It will further be seen that the involution determined by a conic on any line <hi
                        rend="italic">p</hi> is a section of the involution, which is determined by
                    the conic at the pole P of <hi rend="italic">p.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 83. <hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> The centre of a pencil in which the
                    conic determines a circular involution is called a “focus” of the conic.</p>
                <p>In other words—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A focus is such a point that every line through it is
                        perpendicular to its conjugate line.</hi></p>
                <p>The polar to a focus is called a <hi rend="italic">directrix</hi> of the
                    conic.</p>
                <p>From the definition it follows that :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Every focus lies on an axis,</hi> for the line joining a focus
                    to the centre of the conic is a diameter to which the conjugate lines are
                    perpendicular; and <hi rend="italic">Every line joining two foci is an axis,
                        for</hi> the perpendiculars to this line through the foci are conjugate to
                    it. These conjugate lines pass through the pole of the line, the pole lies
                    therefore at infinity, and the line is a diameter, hence by the last property an
                    axis.</p>
                <p>It follows that all <hi rend="italic">foci lie on one axis,</hi> for no line
                    joining a point in one axis to a point in the other can be an axis.</p>
                <p>As the conic determines in the pencil which has its centre at a focus a circular
                    involution, no tangents can be drawn from the focus to the conic. Hence <hi
                        rend="italic">each focus lies within a conic</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">a
                        directrix does not cut the conic.</hi></p>
                <p>Further properties are found by the following considerations :— § 84. Through a
                    point P one line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> can be drawn, which is with regard to
                    a given conic conjugate to a given line <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> viz., that
                    line which joins the point P to the pole cf the line <hi rend="italic">q.</hi>
                    If the line <hi rend="italic">q</hi> is made to describe a pencil about a point
                    Q, then the line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> will describe a pencil about P. These
                    two pencils will be projective, for the line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> passes
                    through the pole of <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> and whilst <hi rend="italic"
                        >q</hi> describes the pencil Q, its pole describes a projective row, and
                    this row is perspective to the pencil P.</p>
                <p>We now take the point P on an axis of the conic, draw any line <hi rend="italic"
                        >p</hi> through it, and from the pole of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> draw a
                    perpendicular <hi rend="italic">q</hi> to <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> Let <hi
                        rend="italic">q</hi> cut the axis in Q. Then, in the pencils of conjugate
                    lines, which have their centres at P and Q, the lines <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">q</hi> are conjugate lines at right angles to one another.
                    Besides, to the axis as a ray in either pencil will correspond in the other the
                    perpendicular to the axis (§ 72). The conic generated by the intersection of
                    corresponding lines in the two pencils is therefore the circle on PQ as
                    diameter, <hi rend="italic">so that every line in P is perpendicular to its
                        corresponding line in Q.</hi></p>
                <p>To every point P on an axis of a conic corresponds thus a point Q, such that
                    conjugate lines through P and Q are perpendicular.</p>
                <p>We shall show that these <hi rend="italic">pointpairs</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >P,</hi><hi rend="italic">Q form an involution.</hi> To do this let us move
                    P along the axis, and with it the line <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> keeping the
                    latter parallel to itself. Then P describes a row, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> a
                    perspective pencil (of parallels), and the pole of 72 a projective row. At the
                    same time the line <hi rend="italic">q</hi> describes a pencil of parallels
                    perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and perspective to the row formed by
                    the pole of <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> The point Q, therefore, where <hi
                        rend="italic">q</hi> cuts the axis, describes a row projective to the row of
                    points P. The two points P and Q describe thus two projective rows on the axis;
                    and not only does P as a point in the first now correspond to Q, but also Q as a
                    point in the first corresponds to P. The two rows therefore form an involution.
                        <hi rend="italic">The centre of this involution, it is easily seen, is the
                        centre of the conic.</hi><hi rend="italic">A focus of this involution has
                        the property that any two conjugate lines through it are perpendicular;
                        hence, it is a focus to the conic.</hi></p>
                <p>Such involution exists on each axis. But only one of these can have foci, because
                    all foci lie on the same axis. The involution on one of the axis is elliptic,
                    and appears (§ 80) therefore as the section of two circular involutions in two
                    pencils whose centres lie in the other axis. These centres are foci, hence the
                    one axis contains two foci, the other axis none; <hi rend="italic">or every
                        central conic has two foci which lie on one axis equidistant from the
                        centre.</hi></p>
                <p>The axis which contains the foci is called the <hi rend="italic">principal
                        axis</hi>; in case of an hyperbola it is the axis which cuts the curve,
                    because the foci lie within the conic.</p>
                <p>In case of the parabola there is but one axis. The involution on this axis has
                    its centre at infinity. One focus is therefore at infinity, the one focus only
                    is finite. <hi rend="italic">A parabola has only one focus.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 85. If through any point P (fig. 33) on a conic the tangent PT and the normal
                    PN (t. <hi rend="italic">e.,</hi> the perpendicular to the tangent through the
                    point of contact) be drawn, these will be conjugate lines with regard to the
                    conic, and at right angles to each other.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n417/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0417-0404"/>
                <p>They will therefore cut the principal axis in two points, which are conjugate in
                    the involution considered in § 84; hence they are harmonic conjugates with
                    regard to the foci. If therefore the two foci F <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and
                    F <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> be joined to P, these lines will be harmonic with
                    regard to the tangent and normal. As the latter are perpendicular, they will
                    bisect the angles between the other pair. Hence—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The line joining any point on a conic to the two foci
                        are</hi><hi rend="italic">eqτuιlly</hi><hi rend="italic">inclined to the
                        tangent and normal at that point.</hi></p>
                <p>In case of the parabola this becomes—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The line joining any point on a parabola to the focus and the
                        diameter through the point, are equally inclined to the tangent and normal
                        at that point.</hi></p>
                <p>From the definition of a focus it follows that—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The segment of a tangent between the directrix and the point of
                        contact is seen from the focus belonging to the directrix under a right
                        angle,</hi> because the lines joining the focus to the ends of this segment
                    are conjugate with regard to the conic, and therefore perpendicular.</p>
                <p>With equal ease the following theorem is proved :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The two lines which join the points of contact of two tangents
                        each to one focus, but not both to the same, are seen from the intersection
                        of the tangents under equal angles.</hi></p>
                <p>§. 86. Other focal properties of a conic are obtained by the following
                    considerations :—</p>
                <p>Let F (fig. 34) be a focus to a conic, <hi rend="italic">f</hi> the corresponding
                    directrix, A and B the points of contact of two tangents meeting at T, and P the
                    point where the line AB cuts the directrix. Then TF will be the polar of P
                    (because polars of F and T meet at P). Hence TF</p>
                <p>and PF are conjugate lines through a focus, and therefore perpendicular. They are
                    further harmonic conjugates with regard to FA andFB (§§ 64 and 13), so that they
                    bisect the angles formed by these lines. This by the way proves—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The segments between the point of intersection of two tangents
                        to a conic and their points of contact are seen from a focus under equal
                        angles.</hi></p>
                <p>If we next draw through A and B lines parallel to TF, then the points A <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> where these cut the
                    directrix will be harmonic conjugates with regard to P and the point where FT
                    cuts the directrix. The lines FT and FP bisect therefore also the angles between
                    FΛ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and FB <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. From this
                    it follows easily that the triangles FAA <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> and FBB
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are equiangular, and therefore similar, so
                    that</p>
                <p>FA: AA <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = FB: BB <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>.</p>
                <p>The triangles AA <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> A <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> and

                        and the corresponding directrix is constant.</hi></p>
                <p>To determine this ratio we consider its value for a vertex on the principal axis.
                    In an ellipse the focus lies between the two vertices on this axis, hence the
                    focus is nearer to a vertex than to the corresponding directrix. Similarly in an
                    hyperbola a vertex is nearer to the directrix than to the focus. In a parabola
                    the vertex lies halfway between directrix and focus.</p>
                <p>It follows in an ellipse the ratio between the distance of a point from the focus
                    to that from the directrix is less than unity, in the parabola it equals unity,
                    and in the hyperbola it is greater than unity.</p>
                <p>It is here the same which focus we take, because the two foci lie symmetrical to

                <p>The problem of drawing a conic through four points and touching a given line is

                    The corresponding remark holds for the problem of drawing the conics which touch

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ruled Quadric Surfaces.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 89. Formerly we have considered projective rows which lie in the same plane. In
                    that case, lines joining corresponding points envelope a, conic. We shall now
                    consider projective rows whose bases do not meet. In this case, corresponding
                    points will be joined by lines which do not he in a plane, but on some surface,
                    which like every surface generated by lines is called a <hi rend="italic"
                        >ruled</hi> surface. This surface clearly contains the bases of the two
                    rows.</p>
                <p>If the points in either row be joined to the base of the other, we obtain two

                <p>If we cut the whole figure by a plane this will cut the axial pencils in two
                    projective flat pencils, and the curve of the second order generated by these
                    will be the curve in which the plane cuts the surface. Hence <hi

                    gives rise to a second set of lines on the surface. From what has been said the

                <p>In two pencils we may either make planes correspond to planes and lines to lines,
                    or else planes to lines and lines to planes. If hereby the condition be

                <p>For instance, two pencils which join two points S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to the different points and lines in a given

                    be taken as corresponding which meet the plane τr in the same point or in the

                <p>Each ray cuts its corresponding plane in a point, the locus of these points is a
                    quadric surface.</p>
                <p>2. Two projective pencils.</p>
                <p>Each plane cuts its corresponding plane in a line, but a ray as a rule does not
                    cut its corresponding ray. The locus of points where a ray cuts its
                    corresponding ray is a twisted cubic. The lines where a plane cuts its
                    corresponding plane are secants</p>
                <p>3. Three projective pencils.</p>
                <p>The locus of intersection of corresponding planes is a cubic surface.</p>
                <p>Of these we consider only the first two eases.</p>
                <p>§ 94. If two pencils are reciprocal, then to a plane in either corresponds a line
                    in the other, to a flat pencil an axial pencil, and so on. Every line cuts its
                    corresponding plane in a point. If S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and S <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> be the centres of the two pencils, and P be a point
                    where a line α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> in the first cuts its corresponding
                    plane α <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, <hi rend="italic">then the line</hi><hi

                        >in</hi> P. For δ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is a line in the plane α <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. The corresponding plane <hi rend="italic"
                        >β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> must therefore pass through the
                    line α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, hence through P.</p>
                <p>The points in which the lines in S <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> cut the planes
                    corresponding to them in S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> are therefore the same
                    as the points in which the lines in S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> cut the
                    planes corresponding to them in S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The locus of these points is a surface which is cut by a plane
                        in a conic or in a line-pair and by a line in not more than two points
                        unless it lies altogether on the surface. The surface itself is therefore
                        called a quadric surface, or a surface of the second order.</hi></p>

                <p>To prove this we consider any line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in space.</p>
                <p>The flat pencil in Si which lies in the plane drawn through <hi rend="italic"
                        >p</hi> and the corresponding axial pencil in S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    determine onp two projective rows, and those points in these which coincide with
                    their corresponding points lie on the surface. But there exist only two, or one,
                    or no such points, unless every point coincides with its corresponding point In
                    the latter ease the line lies altogether on the surface.</p>
                <p>This proves also that a plane cuts the surface in a curve of the second order, as
                    no line can have more than two points in common with it. To show that this is a
                    curve of the same kind as those considered before, λve have to show that it can
                    be generated by projective flat pencils. We prove first that this is true for
                    any plane through the centre of one of the pencils, and afterwards that every
                    point on the surface may be taken as the centre of such pencil. Let then α <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be a plane through S <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi>.
                    To the flat pencil in S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> which it contains
                    corresponds in S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> a projective axial pencil with
                    axis <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">,</hi> and this cuts α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> in a
                    second flat pencil. These two flat pencils in α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are
                    projective, and, in general, neither concentric nor perspective. They generate
                    therefore a conic. But if the line <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi> passes through S <hi rend="subscript">
                        1</hi> the pencils will have S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> as common
                    centre, and may therefore have two, or one, or no lines united with their
                    corresponding lines. The section of the surface by the plane α <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> will be accordingly a line-pair or a single line,
                    or else the plane α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> will have only the point S <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> in common with the surface.</p>
                <p>Every line <hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> through S
                        <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> cuts the surface in two points, viz., first in
                    S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and then at the point where it cuts its
                    corresponding plane. If now the corresponding plane passes through S <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, as in the case just considered, then the two
                    points where <hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> cuts
                    the surface coincide at S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, and the line is called a
                        <hi rend="italic">tangent</hi> to the surface with S <hi rend="subscript">
                        1</hi> as <hi rend="italic">point of contact</hi> Hence if Z <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be a tangent, it lies in that plane τ <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> which corresponds to the line S <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> as a line in the
                    pencil S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. The section of this plane has just been
                    considered. It follows that —</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">All tangents to quadric surface at the centre of one of the

                        surface.</hi><hi rend="italic">In the first case the point of contact is

                    elliptic.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 95. It remains to be proved that every point S on the surface may be taken as
                    centre of one of the pencils which generate the surface. Let S be any point on
                    the surface Φ' generated by the reciprocal pencils S <hi rend="subscript">
                        1</hi> and S <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi>. We have to establish a reciprocal
                    correspondence between the pencils S and S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, so that
                    the surface generated by them is identical with Φ. To do this we draw two planes
                    α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     subscript"> v</hi> through S <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, cutting the surface Φ in two conics which we also
                    denote ∣&gt;y α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi
                        rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> These conics meet at
                    S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, and at some other point T where the line of
                    intersection of β <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi
                        rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> cuts the surface.</p>
                <p>In the pencil S we draw some plane <hi rend="italic">σ</hi> which passes through
                    T, but not through S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> or S <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi>. It will cut the two conics first at T, and therefore each at some
                    other point which we call A and B respectively. These we join to S by lines <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and now establish the
                    required correspondencebetweèn the pencils S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> andS
                    as follows:— To S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> T shall correspond the plane
                    &lt;r, to the plane α <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> the line <hi rend="italic"
                        >a,</hi> and to <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi>
                    the line <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> hence to the flat pencil in α <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the axial pencil <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> These
                    pencils are made-projective by aid of the conic in <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                        rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>In the same manner the flat pencil in <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     subscript"> 1</hi> is made projective to
                    the axial pencil <hi rend="italic">b</hi> by aid of the conic in <hi
                        rend="italic">β</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript">
                        1</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> corresponding elements being those which meet
                    on the conic. This determines the correspondence, for we know for more than four
                    rays in S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the corresponding planes in S. The two
                    pencils S and S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> thus made reciprocal generate a
                    quadric surface Φ', which passes through the point S and through the two conics
                    α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi
                        rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>The two surfaces Φ and Φ' have therefore the points S and S <hi rend="subscript">
                        j</hi> and the conics α <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> in common. To show that they are
                    identical, we draw a plane through S and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, cutting
                    each of the conics α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> in two points, which will always
                    be possible. This plane cuts Φ and Φ' in two conics which have the point S and
                    the points where it cuts α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> in common, that is five points in
                    all. The conics therefore coincide.</p>
                <p>This proves that all those points P on Φ' lie on Φ which have the property that
                    the plane SS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> P cuts the conics α <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi
                        rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> in two points each. If the plane SS <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> P has not this property, then we dιaw a plane SS
                        <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> P. This cuts each surface in a conic, and these
                    conics have in common the points S, S <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi>, one point on
                    each of the conics α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi
                        rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and one point on one
                    of the conics through S and S., which lie on both surfaces, hence five points.
                    They are therefore coincident, and our theorem is proved.</p>
                <p>§ 96. The following propositions follow :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A quadric surface has at every point a tangent</hi><hi

                <p>§ 97. <hi rend="italic">Every plane which cuts a quadric surface in a line pair

                    the possibility of a plane having only one line (two coincident lines) in common
                    with a quadric surface.</p>
                <p>§ 98. To investigate this case we suppose first that there is one point A on the

                <p>If this happens for one point P, it happens for every other point Q. For if two

                    would be altogether on the surface, hence two lines would be drawn through P
                    against the assumption. From this follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If there is one point on a quadric surface through which one,
                        but only one, line can be drawn on the surface, then through every point one
                        line can be drawn, and all these lines meet in a point. The surface is a

                <p>Using the definitions at the end of § 95, we may also say :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On a quadric surface the points are all hyperbolic, or all
                        parabolic, or all elliptic.</hi></p>
                <p>As an example of a quadric surface with elliptical points, we mention the sphere
                    which may be generated by two reciprocal pencils, where to each line in one
                    corresponds the plane perpendicular to it in the other.</p>
                <p>§ 99. <hi rend="italic">Poles and Polar Planes.—</hi> The theory of poles and
                    polars with regard to a conic is easily extended to quadric surfaces.</p>
                <p>Let P be a point in space not on the surface, which we suppose not to be a cone.
                    On every line through P which cuts the surface in two points we determine the
                    harmonic conjugate Q of P with regard to the points of intersection. Through one
                    of these lines we draw two planes <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >β.</hi> The locus of the points Q in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is a line <hi
                        rend="italic">a,</hi> the polar of P with regard to the conic in which <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> cuts the surface. Similarly the locus of points Q in
                        <hi rend="italic">β</hi> is a line <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> This cuts <hi
                        rend="italic">a,</hi> because the line of intersection of <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β</hi> contains but one point Q. The locus of
                    all points Q therefore is a plane. <hi rend="italic">This plane is called the

                <p>The following propositions hold :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Every point has a polar plane,</hi> which is constructed by
                    drawing the polars of the point with regard to the conics in which two planes

                <p>The pole to a plane is found by constructing the polar planes of three points in
                    the plane. Their intersection will be the pole.</p>

                <p>§ 101. If two pencils with centres S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and S <hi

                    projective flat or axial pencil, and so on.</p>
                <p>There is a double infinite number of lines in a pencil. We shall see that a
                    single infinite number of lines in one pencil meets its corresponding ray, and
                    that the points of intersection form a curve in space.</p>
                <p>Of the double infinite number of planes in the pencils each will meet its
                    corresponding plane. This gives a system of a double infinite number of lines in
                    space. We know (§ 5) that there is a quadruple infinite number of lines in
                    space. From among these we may select those which satisfy one or more given
                    conditions. The systems of lines thus obtained was first systematically
                    investigated and classified by Pliicker, in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Geometrie</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic">Raumes.</hi> He
                    uses the following names:—</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">treble infinite</hi> number of lines, that is, all lines
                    which satisfy one condition, are said to form a <hi rend="italic">complex, of

                <p>A <hi rend="italic">double infinite</hi> number of lines, that is, all lines
                    which satisfy two conditions, or which are common to two complexes, are said to

                    all lines in a plane, or all lines cutting two curves, or all lines cutting a

                <p>A <hi rend="italic">single, infinite</hi> number of lines, that is, all lines

                <p>It follows that all lines in which corresponding planes in two projective pencils
                    meet form a congruence. We shall see this congruence consists of all lines which

                        point on the twisted cubic</hi> k <hi rend="italic">form a cone of the
                        second order.</hi> In other words, the projection of a twisted cubic from
                    any point in the curve on to any plane is a conic.</p>
                <p>If α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is not a secant, but made to pass through any
                    point Q in space, the ruled quadric surface determined by α <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 1</hi> will pass through Q. <hi rend="italic">There will therefore bè one
                        line of the</hi><hi rend="italic">congruence</hi><hi rend="italic">passing
                        through</hi> Q, <hi rend="italic">and only one.</hi> For if two such lines
                    pass through Q, then the lines S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Q and S <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Q will be corresponding lines; hence Q will be a
                    point on the cubic <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> and an infinite number of secants
                    will pass through it. Hence :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Through every point in space not on the twisted cubic one and
                        only one secant to the cubic can be drawn.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 104. The fact that all the secants through a point on the cubic form a quadric
                    cone shows that the centres of the projective pencils generating the cubic are
                    not distinguished from any other points on the cubic. If we take any two points
                    S, S' on the cubic, and draw the secants through each of them, we obtain two
                    quadric cones, which have the line SS' in common, and which intersect besides
                    along the cubic. If we make these two pencils having S and S' as centres
                    projective by taking four rays on the one cone as corresponding to the four rays
                    on the other which meet the first on the cubic, the correspondence is
                    determined. These two pencils will generate a cubic, and the two cones of
                    secants having S and S' as centres will be identical with the above cones, for
                    each has five rays in common with one of the first, viz., the line SS' and the
                    four lines determined for the correspondence; therefore these two cones
                    intersect in the original cubic. This gives the theorem :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On a hoisted cubic any two points may be taken as centres of
                        projective pencils</hi><hi rend="italic">ιvhich</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Of the two projective pencils at S and S' we may keep the first fixed, and move
                    the centre of the other along the curve. The pencils will hereby remain
                    projective, and a plane <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in S will be cut by its
                    corresponding plane α' always in the same secant <hi rend="italic">a.</hi>

                <p>It will have been observed that scarcely any use has been made of algebra, and it
                    would have been even possible to avoid this little, as is done by Reye. There
                    are, however, other systems of geometry which start more or less from theorems

                <p>This will be here treated as a method. The science is Geometry; and it would be
                    possible, analytically, or by the method of coordinates, to develop the trutlιs
                    of geometry in a systematic course. But it is proposed not in any way to attempt
                    this, but simply to explain the method, giving such examples, interesting (it
                    may be) in themselves, as are suitable for showing how the method is employed in
                    the demonstration and solution of theorems or problems.</p>
                <p>Geometry is one-, two-, or three-dimensional, or, what is the same thing, it is
                    lineal, plane, or solid, according as the space dealt with is the line, the
                    plane, or ordinary (three-dimensional) space. No more general view of the
                    subject need here be taken :—but in a certain sense one-dimensional geometry
                    does not exist, inasmuch as the geometrical constructions for points in a line
                    can only be performed by travelling out of the line into other parts of a plane
                    which contains it, and conformably to the usual practice Analytical Geometry
                    will be treated under the two divisions, Plane and Solid.</p>
                <p>It is proposed to consider Cartesian coordinates almost exclusively; for the
                    proper development of the science homogeneous coordinates (three and four in
                    plane and solid geometry respectively) are required; and it is moreover
                    necessary to have the correlative line-and planecoordinates; and in solid
                    geometry to have the <hi rend="italic">six</hi> coordinates of the line. The
                    most comprehensive English works are those of Dr Salmon, <hi rend="italic">Th e

                <p>1. It is assumed that the points, lines, and figures considered exist in one and
                    the same plane, which plane, therefore, need not be in any way referred to. The
                    position of a point is determined by means of its (Cartesian) coordinates; <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as explained under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Curve,</hi> we take the two lines <hi rend="italic">x'0x</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">y'Oy,</hi> called the axes of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">y</hi> respectively, intersecting in a point 0 called the
                    origin, and determine the position of any υther point P by means of its
                    coordinates x = OM (or NP), and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> = MP (or ON).</p>
                <p>The two axes are usually (as in fig. 1) at right angles to each other, and the
                    lines PM, PN are then at right angles to the axes of <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> respectively. Assuming a scale at pleasure, the
                    coordinates <hi rend="italic">x, y</hi> of a point have numerical values.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to attend to the signs: <hi rend="italic">x</hi> has opposite
                    signs according as the point is on one side or the other of the axis of <hi
                        rend="italic">y,</hi> and similarly <hi rend="italic">y</hi> has opposite
                    signs according as the point is on the one side or the other of the axis of <hi
                        rend="italic">x.</hi> Using the letters N, E, S, W as in a map, and
                    considering the plane as divided into four quadrants by the axes, the signs are

                <p>A point is said to have the coordinates <hi rend="italic">(a, b),</hi> and is
                    referred to as the point <hi rend="italic">(a,</hi> δ), when its coordinates are

                    regarded as variable, are said to be current coordinates.</p>
                <p>2. It is sometimes convenient to use oblique coordinates; the only difference is
                    that the axes are not at right angles to each other; the lines PM, PN are drawn
                    parallel to the axes of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    respectively, and the figure OMPN is thus a parallelogram. But in all that
                    follows the Cartesian coordinates are taken to be rectangular; polar coordinates
                    and other systems will be briefly referred to in the sequel</p>
                <p>3. If the coordinates <hi rend="italic">(x,</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> of a point are not
                    given, but only a relation between them <hi rend="italic">f(x,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">y)</hi> = 0, then we have a curve. For, if we consider <hi
                        rend="italic">x</hi> as a real quantity varying continuously from - oo to +
                    oo , then, for any given value of <hi rend="italic">x, y</hi> has a value or
                    values. If these are all imaginary, there is not any real point; but if one or
                    more of them be real, we have a real point or points, which (as the assumed
                    value of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> varies continuously) varies or vary
                    continuously therewith; and the locus of all these real points is a curve. The
                    equation completely defines the curve; to trace the curve directly from the
                    equation, nothing else being known, we obtain as above a series of points
                    sufficiently near to each other, and draw the curve through them. For instance,
                    let this be done in a simple case. Suppose <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">= 2x</hi>- I; it is quite easy to obtain and lay down a series
                    of points as near to each other as we please, and the application of a ruler
                    would show that these were in a line; that the curve is a line depends upon
                    something more than the equation itself, viz., the theorem that every equation
                    of the form <hi rend="italic">y = ax + b</hi> represents a line; supposing this
                    known, it will be at once understood how the process of tracing the curve may be
                    abbreviated; we have <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = 0, <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">=</hi>- 1, and <hi rend="italic">x —</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >⅜,</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi> = 0; the curve is thus the line passing
                    through these two points. But in the foregoing example the notion of a line is
                    taken to be a known one, and such notion of a line does in fact precede the
                    consideration of any equation of a curve whatever, since the notion of the
                    coordinates themselves rests upon that of a line. In other cases it may very
                    well be that the equation is the definition of the curve; the points laid down,
                    although (as finite in number) they do not actually determine the curve,
                    determine it to any degree of accuracy; and the equation thus enables us to
                    construct the curve.</p>
                <p>A curve may be determined in another way; viz., the coordinates <hi rend="italic"
                        >x, y</hi> may be given each of them as a function of the same variable
                    parameter <hi rend="italic">θ</hi><hi rend="italic">; x,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >y=foθ),</hi> ≠(6) respectively. Here, giving to <hi rend="italic">θ</hi>
                    any number of values in succession, these equations determine the values of <hi

                    trace a considerable number of curves, first taking equations which are purely
                    numerical, and then equations which contain literal constants (representing
                    numbers); the equations most easily dealt with are those wherein one coordinate
                    is given as an explicit function of the other, say <hi rend="italic">y =
                        φ(x)</hi> as above. A few examples are here given, with such explanations as
                    seem proper.</p>

                    of a few numerical examples, <hi rend="italic">with careful drawing,</hi> would
                    show that the oval and the infinite branch as they approach sharpen out each

                <p>5. It may be remarked that the purely algebraical process, which is in fact that
                    employed in finding a differential coefficient , if applied directly to the
                    equation of the curve, determines the point consecutive to any given point of
                    the curve, that is, the direction of the curve at such given point, or, what is
                    the same tliing, the direction of the tangent at that point. In fact, if α, <hi
                        rend="italic">β</hi> are the coordinates of any point on a curve <hi
                        rend="italic">fox,</hi><hi rend="italic">y) = 0,</hi> then writing in the
                    equation of the curve <hi rend="italic">x = a + h, y = β + k,</hi> and in the
                    resulting equation ∕(α + 7i, <hi rend="italic">β</hi> + ⅛) = 0 (developed in
                    powers of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and ⅛), omitting the term ∕(α, /3), which
                    vanishes, and the terms containing the second and higher powers of <hi
                        rend="italic">h, k,</hi> we have a linear equation <hi rend="italic">Åh</hi>
                    + B½∙ = 0, which determines the ratio of the increments <hi rend="italic">h,
                        k.</hi> Of course, in the analytical development of the theory, we translate
                    this into the notation of the differential calculus; but the question presents
                    itself, and is thus seen to be solvable, as soon as it is attempted to trace a
                    curve from its equation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geometry is Descriptive, or Metrical.</hi></p>
                <p>6. A geometrical proposition is either <hi rend="italic">descriptive</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">metrical</hi>: in the former case it is altogether independent
                    of the idea of magnitude (length, inclination, &amp;c.); in the latter case it
                    has reference to this idea. It is to be noticed that, although the method of
                    coordinates seems to be by its inception essentially metrical, and we can
                    hardly, except by metrical considerations, connect an equation with the curve
                    which it represents (for instance, even assuming it to be known that an equation
                    Az + By + C = 0 represents a line, yet if it be asked what line, the only form
                    of answer is, that it is the line cutting <pb break="no"

                    descriptive propositions, we are, in fact, eminently free from all metrical
                    considerations.</p>
                <p>7. It is worth while to illustrate this by the instance of the well-known theorem
                    of the radical centre of three circles. The theorem is that, given any three
                    circles A, B, C (fig. 8), the common chords αα', <hi rend="italic">ββ&gt;
                        Tf'</hi> of the three pairs of circles meet in a point.</p>
                <p>The geometrical proof is metrical throughout :—</p>
                <p>Take 0 the point of intersection of αα', <hi rend="italic">ββ',</hi> and joining
                    this with γ', suppose that 7'O does not pass through 7, but that it meets the
                    circles A, B in two distinct points 7 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, 7 <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> respectively. We have then the knoλvn metrical
                    property of intersecting chords of a circle; viz., in circle C where αα', <hi

                    the equation of a circle is S = 0, where S stands for its value; more briefly,

                    0; the equation S-S'=O is a linear equation (S-S ’ is in fact = (A-A') z +
                    (B-B') y + G-C'), and it thus represents a fine; this equation is satisfied by
                    the coordinates of each of the points of intersection of the two circles (for at
                    each of these points S = 0 and S ’ =0, therefore also S-S'≈≈O); hence the
                    equation S-S'=∙O is that of the line joining the two points of intersection of
                    the two circles, or say it is the equation of the common chord of the two
                    circles. Considering then a third circle S", — ae <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>

                    common chords are S-S'=O, S-S"=O, S'-S"-*O (each of these a linear equation); at
                    the intersection of the first and second of these lines S≈=S' and S = S",
                    therefore also S'=S", or the equation of the third line is satisfied by the
                    coordinates of the point in question; that is, the three chords intersect in a
                    point 0, the coordinates of whiβh are determined by the equations S = S' =
                    S".</p>
                <p>It further appears that if the two circles S = 0, S = 0' do not intersect in any
                    real points, they must be regarded as intersecting in two imaginary points, such
                    that the line joining them is the real line represented by the equation S - S' =
                    0; or that two circles, whether their intersections be real or imaginary, have
                    always a real common chord (or radical axis), and that for <hi rend="italic"
                        >any</hi> three circles the common chords intersect in a point (of course
                    real) which is the radical centre. And by this very theorem, given two circles
                    with imaginary intersections, we can, by drawing circles which meet each of them
                    in real points, construct the radical axis of the first-mentioned two
                    circles.</p>
                <p>8. The principle employed in showing that the equation of the common chord of two
                    circles is S - S' = 0 is one of very extensive application, and some more
                    illustrations of it may be given.</p>
                <p>Suppose S=-0, S'=0 are lines (that is, let S, S' now denote linear functions <hi

                    point of intersection of the two given lines. Such a line may be made to pass
                    through any given point, say the point (a ’ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, <hi

                        posteriori</hi>; the equation is a linear equation satisfied by the values
                    of (ae, <hi rend="italic">y)</hi> which make S —0, S'=0; and satisfied also by
                    the values (a ’ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, 1∕ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>);
                    and it is thus the equation of the line in question.</p>
                <p>If, as before, S = 0, S' = 0 represent circles, then <hi rend="italic">(Jc</hi>
                    being arbitrary) S-Ä S' = 0 is the equation of any circle passing through the
                    two points of intersection of the two circles; and to make this pass through a
                    given point (α∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, y <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>) we
                    have again fc=S <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> ÷S' <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>.
                    In the particular case Ä=l, the circle becomes the common chord (more
                    accurately, it becomes the common chord together with the line infinity, but
                    this is a question which is not here gone into).</p>

                    consider the theorem of the polar of a point in regard to a circle. Given a
                    circle and a point 0 (fig. 9), we draw through 0 any two lines meeting the
                    circle in the points A, A' and B, B' respectively, and then taking Q as the
                    intersection of the lines AB' and A'B, the theorem is that the locus of the
                    point Q is a right line depending only upon 0 and the circle, but independent of
                    the particular lines OAA' and OBB'.</p>
                <p>Taking 0 as the origin, and for the axes any two lines through O at right angles

                    proper to notice that there is no correspondence to each other of the points A,
                    A' and B, B'; the grouping might as well have been A, A' and B', B; and it
                    thence appears that the line Arr + By + C = 0 just obtained is in fact the line
                    joining the point Q with the point R which is the intersection of AB and
                    A'B'.</p>
                <p>10. The equation Az + By + C = 0 of a line contains in appearance 3, but really
                    only 2 constants (for one of the constants can be divided out), and a line
                    depends accordingly upon 2 parameters, or can be made to satisfy 2 conditions.
                    Similarly, the equation (a, <hi rend="italic">b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    constants, and the equation (-)(z, <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> l) <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 3</hi> = 0 of a cubic contains really 9 constants. It
                    thus appears that a cubic can be made to pass through 9 given points, and that
                    the cubic so passing through 9 given points is completely determined. There is,
                    however, a remarkable exception. Considering two given cubic curves S = 0, S' =
                    0, these intersect in 9 points, and through these 9 points we have the whole
                    series of cubics S - &amp;S' = 0, where <hi rend="italic">k</hi> is an arbitrary
                    constant: <hi rend="italic">k</hi> may be determined so that the cubic shall
                    pass through a given tenth point (/¢ = S <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> ÷ S' <hi
                        rend="subscript"> o</hi>, if the coordinates are <hi rend="italic"
                        >(x</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> w</hi> y <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>),
                    and S <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>, S' <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> denote the
                    corresponding values of 8, S'). The resulting curve SS' <hi rend="subscript">
                        0</hi>- S'S <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> = 0 may be regarded as the cubic
                    determined by the conditions of passing through 8 of the 9 points and through
                    the given point (r <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, y <hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi>); and from the equation it thence appears that the curve passes through
                    the remaining one of the 9 points. In other words, we thus have the theorem, any
                    cubic curve which passes through 8 of the 9 intersections of two given cubic
                    curves passes through the 9th intersection.</p>
                <p>The applications of this theorem are very numerous; for instance, we derive from
                    it Pascal’s theorem of the inscribed hexagon. Consider a hexagon inscribed in a
                    conic. The three alternate sides constitute a cubic, and the other three
                    alternate sides another cubic. The cubics intersect in 9 points, being the 6
                    vertices of the hexagon, and the 3 Pascalian points, or intersections of the
                    pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon. Drawing a line through two of the
                    Pascalian points, the conic and this line constitute a cubic passing through 8
                    of the 9 points of intersection, and it therefore passes through the . remaining
                    point of intersection—that is, the third Pascalian point; and since obviously
                    this does not lie on the conic, it must lie on the line—that is, we have the
                    theorem that the three Pascalian points (or points of intersection of the pairs
                    of opposite sides) lie on a line.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metrical Theory.</hi></p>
                <p>11. The foundation of the metrical theory consists in the simple theorem that if
                    a finite line PQ (fig. 10) be projected upon any other line OO' by lines
                    perpendicular to OO', then the length of the projection P'Q' is equal to the
                    length of PQ into the cosine of its inclination to P'Q'; or, what is the same
                    thing, that the perpendicular distance P'Q' of any two parallel lines is equal
                    to the inclined distance PQ into the cosine of the inclination. It at once
                    follows that the algebraical sum of the projections of the sides of a closed
                    polygon upon any line is = 0; or, reversing the signs of certain sides, and
                    considering the polygon as consisting of two broken lines, each extending from
                    the same initial to the same terminal point, the sum of the projections of the
                    lines of the first set upon any line is equal to the sum of the projections of
                    the lines of the second set. Observe that if any line be perpendicular to the
                    line on which the projection is made, then its projection is = 0.</p>
                <p>Thus, if we have a right-angled triangle PQR (fig. 11), where QR, RP, QP are =

                    or <hi rend="italic">p</hi> of the other form of equation. The reason is
                    obvious. In each case <hi rend="italic">(a, b)</hi> denote the coordinates of a

                    that Qz <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, Qy <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are so
                    placed that, by moving 0 to Q, and then turning the axes Oz <hi rend="subscript"

                        <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>) in the reverse direction, we should then have
                    had in the formulae -y <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> instead of y <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. The new formulae which would be thus obtained are
                    of an essentially distinct form: the analytical test is that in the formulae as
                    written down we can, by giving to α a proper value (in fact α = 0), make the
                    (z-α) and <hi rend="italic">(y-b)</hi> equal to <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi

                    respectively; in the other system we could only make them equal to <hi

                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> respectively. But for the very reason that the
                    second system can be so easily derived from the first, it is proper to attend
                    exclusively to the first system,—that is, always to take the new axes so that
                    the two sets admit of being brought into coincidence.</p>
                <p>In the foregoing system of two pairs of equations, the first pair give the

                    the original coordinates of the new origin; it would be easy instead of these to

                    without any difficulty.</p>

                <p>We take <hi rend="italic">(a, b)</hi> as the coordinates of the given point, and

                    which is in fact that of the last example: the curve is the locus of a point
                    such that its distance from a given point (called the focus) is in a given ratio
                    to its distance from a given line (called the directrix); taking the ratio as e:
                    1, then <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is called the eccentricity.</p>
                <p>Take FD for the perpendicular from the focus F upon the directrix, and the given

                <p>23. The position of a point may be determined by means of its distance from a
                    fixed point and the inclination of this distance to a fixed line through the
                    fixed point. Say we have <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the distance from the origin,
                    and <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> the inclination of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> to the
                    axis of <hi rend="italic">x; r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> are then the

                        <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> the inclination. These are immediately connected
                    with the Cartesian coordinates <hi rend="italic">x, y</hi> by the formulae <hi

                    convenient, as well in reference to certain classes of questions relating to

                <p>24. Consider a fixed triangle ABC, and (regarding the sides as indefinite lines)
                    suppose for a moment that <hi rend="italic">p, q,</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    denote the distances of a point P from the sides BC, CA, AB respectively,—these
                    distances being measured either perpendicularly to the several sides, or each of
                    them in a given direction. To fix the ideas each distance may be considered as
                    positive for a point inside the triangle, and the sign is thus fixed for any
                    point whatever. There is then an identical relation between <hi rend="italic">p,
                        q,</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi>: if <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> are the lengths of the sides,
                    and the distances are measured perpendicularly thereto, the relation is <hi

                    z</hi>,area of triangle. But taking <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">z</hi> proportional to <hi rend="italic">p, q, r,</hi> or if
                    we please proportional to given multiples of <hi rend="italic">p, q, r,</hi>
                    then only the ratios of <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi> are
                    determined; their absolute values remain arbitrary. But the ratios of <hi
                        rend="italic">p, q, r,</hi> and consequently also the ratios of <hi
                        rend="italic">x, y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi> determine, and that
                    uniquely, the point; and it being understood that only the ratios are attended
                    to, we say that (z, <hi rend="italic">y, z)</hi> are the coordinates of the
                    point. The equation of a line has thus the form <hi rend="italic">ax + by + cz
                        =</hi> 0, and generally that of a curve of the nth order is a homogeneous
                    equation of this order between the coordinates, ( * §z, <hi rend="italic"

                        >=</hi> 0. The advantage over Cartesian coordinates is in the greater
                    symmetry of the analytical forms, and in the more convenient treatment of the
                    line infinity and of points at infinity. The method includes that of Cartesian
                    coordinates, the homogeneous equation in <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">z</hi> is in fact an equation in — , -, í√ <hi rend="italic"

                    (z, <hi rend="italic">y, z)</hi> are regarded as the Cartesian coordinates of a
                    point of space, then the equation is that of a cone having the origin for its
                    vertex; and conversely that such equation of a cone may be regarded as the
                    equation in trilinear coordinates of a plane curve.</p>

                    any two quantities (or the ratios of three quantities) serving to determine the
                    position of a point in the plane may be regarded as the coordinates of the
                    point; or, if instead of a single point they determine a system of two or more
                    points, then as the coordinates of the system of points. But, as noticed under
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Curve,</hi> there are also line-coordinates serving to
                    determine the position of a line; the ordinary case is when the line is

                    thus regarded as the line-equation of this point; and generally a homogeneous
                    equation ( * <hi rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    equation, and it is thus regarded as the line-equation of this curve.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Solid Analytical Geometry</hi> (§§26-40).</p>
                <p>26. We are here concerned with points in space,—the position of a point being
                    determined by its three coordinates z, <hi rend="italic">y, z.</hi> We consider
                    three coordinate planes, at right angles to each other, dividing the whole of
                    space into eight portions called octants, the coordinates of a point being the
                    perpendicular distances of the point from the three planes respectively, each
                    distance being considered as positive or negative according as it lies on the
                    one or the other side of the plane. Thus the coordinates in the eight octants
                    have respectively the signs</p>
                <p>The positive parts of the axes are usually drawn as in fig. 16, which represents
                    a point P, the coordinates of which have the positive values OM, MN, NP.</p>
                <p>27. It may be remarked, as regards the delineation of such solid figures, that if
                    we have in space three lines at right angles to each other, say Oα, <hi
                        rend="italic">Ob, Oc,</hi> of equal lengths, then it is possible to project
                    these by parallel lines upon a plane in such wise that the projections <hi
                        rend="italic">Oa',</hi><hi rend="italic">Ob',</hi> Oc' shall be at given
                    inclinations to each other, and that these lengths shall be to each other in
                    given ratios: in particular the two lines Oct', Oc' may be at right angles to
                    each other, and their lengths equal, the direction of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ob',</hi> and its proportion to the two equal lengths Oα', Oc' being
                    arbitrary. It thus appears that we may as in the figure draw Oz, <hi
                        rend="italic">Oz</hi> at right angles to each other, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Oy</hi> in an arbitrary direction; and moreover represent the coordinates
                        <hi rend="italic">x,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi> on equal scales, and the
                    remaining coordinate <hi rend="italic">y</hi> on an arbitrary scale (which may
                    be that of the other two coordinates z, <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> but is in
                    practice usually smaller). The advantage, of course, is that a figure in <hi
                        rend="italic">one</hi> of the coordinate planes <hi rend="italic">xz</hi> is
                    represented in its proper form without distortion; but it may be in some cases
                    preferable to employ the isometrical projection, wherein the three axes are
                    represented by lines inclined to each other at angles of 120°, and the scales
                    for the coordinates are equal (fig. 17).</p>
                <p>For the delineation of a surface of a tolerably simple form, it is frequently
                    sufficient to draw (according to the foregoing projection) the sections by the
                    coordinate planes; and in particularwhen the surface is symmetrical in regard to
                    the coordinate planes, it is sufficient to draw the quartersections belonging to
                    a single octant of the surface; thus fig. 18 is a' convenient representation of
                    an octant of the wave surface. Or a surface may be delineated by means of a
                    series of parallel sections, or (taking these to be the sections by a series of
                    horizontal planes) say by a series of contour lines. Of course, other sections
                    may be drawn or indicated, if necessary. For the delineation of a curve, a
                    convenient method is to represent, as above, a series of the points P thereof,
                    each point P being accompanied by the ordinates PN, which serves to refer the
                    point to the plane of <hi rend="italic">xy</hi>; this is in effect a
                    representation of each point P of the curve, by means of two points P, N such
                    that the line PN has a fixed direction. Both as regards curves and surfaces, the
                    employment of stereographic representations is very interesting.</p>

                <p>28. In plane geometry, reckoning the line as a curve of the first order, we have
                    only the point and the curve. In solid geometry, reckoning a line as a curve of
                    the first order, and the plane as a surface of the first order, we have the
                    point, the curve, and the surface; but the increase of complexity is far greater
                    that would hence at first sight appear. In plane geometry a curve is considered
                    in connexion with lines (its tangents); hut in solid geometry the curve is
                    considered in connexion with lines and planes (its tangents and osculating
                    planes), and the surface also in connexion with lines and planes (its tangent
                    lines and tangent planes); there are surfaces arising out of the line—cones,
                    skew surfaces, developables, doubly and triply infinite systems of lines, and
                    whole classes of theories which have nothing analogous to them in plane
                    geometry: it is thus a very small part indeed of the subject which can be even
                    referred to in the present article.</p>
                <p>In the case of a surface we have between the coordinates <hi rend="italic">(x, y,
                        z)</hi> a single, or say a onefold relation, which can be represented by a
                    single relation <hi rend="italic">fox, y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z) = 0</hi>; or
                    we may consider the coordinates expressed each of them as a given function of
                    two variable parameters <hi rend="italic">p,</hi><hi rend="italic">q</hi>; the
                    form <hi rend="italic">zπ=</hi><hi rend="italic">fox, y)</hi> is a particular
                    case of each of these modes of representation; in other words, we have in the
                    first mode <hi rend="italic">f (x, y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z) = zf(x,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">y),</hi> and in the second mode <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">=p, y-q</hi> for the expression of two of the coordinates in
                    terms of the parameters.</p>
                <p>In the case of a curve we have between the coordinates (z, <hi rend="italic">y,
                        z)</hi> a twofold relation: two equations <hi rend="italic">fox, y, z)</hi>
                    = 0, <hi rend="italic">φ(x,</hi><hi rend="italic">y,</hi> z) = 0 give such a
                    relation; <hi rend="italic">τ.e,,</hi> the curve is here considered as the
                    intersection of two surfaces (but the curve is not always the complete
                    intersection of two sur-faoes, and there are hence difficulties); or, again, the
                    coordinates may be given each of them as a function of a single variable
                    parameter. The form <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">φχ,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi><hi rend="italic">= ψx,</hi>
                    where two of the coordinates are given in terms of the third, is a particular
                    case of each of these modes of representation.</p>
                <p>29. The remarks under plane geometry as to descriptive and metrical propositions,
                    and as to the non-metrical character of the method of coordinates when used for
                    the proof of a descriptive proposition, apply also to solid geometry; and they
                    might be illustrated in like manner by the instance of the theorem of the
                    radical centre of four spheres. The proof is obtained from the consideration
                    that S and S' being each of them a function of the form <hi rend="italic"
                        >x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">+ y</hi><hi

                        + by + cz + d,</hi> the difference S-S' is a mere linear function of the
                    coordinates, and consequently that S - S' = 0 is the equation of the plane
                    containing the circle of intersection of the two spheres S = 0 and S' = 0.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metrical Theory.</hi></p>
                <p>30. The foundation in solid geometry of the metrical theory is in fact the
                    before-mentioned theorem that if a finite right line PQ be projected upon any
                    other line 00' by lines perpendicular to OO', then the length of the projection
                    P'Q' is equal to the length of PQ into the cosine of its inclination to P'Q'—or
                    (in the form in which it is now convenient to state the theorem) the
                    perpendicular distance P'Q' of two parallel planes is equal to the inclined
                    distance PQ into the cosine of the inclination. Hence also the algebraical sum
                    of the projections of the sides of a closed polygon upon any line is = 0; or,
                    reversing the signs of certain sides and considering the polygon as made up of
                    two broken lines each extending from the same initial to the same terminal
                    point, the sum of the projections of the one set of lines upon any line is equal
                    to the sum of the projections of the other set of lines upon the same line. When
                    any of the lines are at right angles to the given line’ (or, what is the same
                    thing, in a plane at right angles to the given line) the projections of these
                    lines severally vanish.</p>
                <p>31. Consider the skew quadrilateral QMNP, the sides QM, MN, NP being respectively
                    parallel to the three rectangular axes <hi rend="italic">Ox, Oy,</hi> Oz; let
                    the lengths of these sides be <hi rend="italic">ξ, η, ζ,</hi> and that of the
                    side QP be = <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi>; and let the cosines of the inclinations
                    (or say the cosine-inclinations) of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to the three axes
                    be α, <hi rend="italic">β,</hi><hi rend="italic">y,</hi> then projecting

                    its projections <hi rend="italic">ξ, η, ζ</hi> upon three rectangular axes. And
                    from the same equations we obtain <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi

                    relation connecting the cosineinclinations of a line to three rectangular
                    axes.</p>
                <p>Suppose we have through Q any other line QT, and let the cosine-inclinations of

                <p>The hyperbolic paraboloid is such (and it is easy from the figure to understand
                    how this may be the case) that there exist upon it two singly infinite series of
                    right lines. The same is the case with the hyperboloid of one sheet (ruled or
                    skew hyperboloid, as with reference to this property it is termed). If we
                    imagine two equal and parallel circular disks, their points connected by strings
                    of equal length, so that these are the generating lines of a right circular
                    cylinder, then by turning one of the disks about its centre through the same
                    angle in one or the other direction, the strings will in each case generate one
                    and. the same hyperboloid, and will in regard to it be the two systems of lines
                    on the surface, or say the two systems of generating lines; and the general
                    configuration is the same when instead of circles we have ellipses. It has been
                    already shown analytically that the equation-^ + ' <hi rend="superscript">!</hi>

                <p>The normal plane is the plane through the point at right angles to the tangent.

                <p>In the series of tangent lines there are in general two (real or imaginary)
                    lines, each of which meets the surface in a second consecutive point, or say it
                    has three-point intersection with the surface; these are called the
                    chieftangents (Haupt-tangenten). The tangent-plane cuts the surface in a curve,
                    having at the point of contact a node (double point), the tangents to the two
                    branches being the chief-tangents.</p>
                <p>In the case of a quadric surface the curve of intersection, <hi rend="italic"
                        >qua</hi> curve of the second order, can only have a node by breaking up
                    into a pair of lines; that is, every tangentplane meets the surface in a pair of
                    lines, or we have on the surface two singly infinite systems of lines; these are
                    τeal for the hyperbolic paraboloid and the hyperboloid of one sheet, imaginary
                    in other cases.</p>
                <p>At each point of a surface the chief-tangents determine two directions; and
                    passing along one of them to a consecutive point, and thence (without abrupt
                    change of direction) along the new chief-tangent to a consecutive point, and so
                    on, we have on the surface a chief-tangent curve; and there are, it is clear,
                    two singly infinite series of such curves. In the case of a quadric surface, the
                    curves are the right lines on the surface.</p>
                <p>40. If at the point we draw in the tangent-plane two lines bisecting the angles
                    between the chief-tangents, these lines (which are at right angles to each
                    other) are called the principal tangents.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            of the principal tangents become arbitrary; the point is then an
                            umbilicus. It is in the text assumed that the point on the surface is
                            not an umbilicus.</p></note> We have thus at each point of <pb

                    normal and the two principal tangents.</p>
                <p>Proceeding from the point along a principal tangent to a consecutive point on the
                    surface, and thence (without abrupt change of direction) along the new principal
                    tangent to a consecutive point, and so on, we have on the surface a curve of
                    curvature; there are, it is clear, two singly infinite series of such curves,
                    cutting each other at right angles at each point of the surface.</p>
                <p>Passing from the given point in an arbitrary direction to a consecutive point on
                    the surface, the normal at the given point is not intersected by the normal at
                    the consecutive point; but passing to the consecutive point along a curve of
                    curvature (or, .what is the same thing, along a principal tangent) the normal at
                    the given point is intersected by the normal at the consecutive point <hi
                        rend="italic">; we</hi> have thus on the normal two centres of curvature,
                    and the distances of these from the point on the surface are the two principal
                    radii of curvature of the surface at that point; these are also the radii of
                    curvature of the sections of the surface by planes through the normal and the
                    two principal tangents respectively; or say they are the radii of curvature of
                    the normal sections through the two principal tangents respectively. Take at the
                    point the axis of <hi rend="italic">z</hi> in the direction of the normal, and

                    paraboloid is elliptic, and the chief-tangents are imaginary; in the latter case
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> have opposite signs,
                    the paraboloid is hyperbolic, and the chief-tangents are real.</p>
                <p>The normal sections of the surface and the paraboloid by the same plane have the
                    same radius of curvature; and it thence readily follows that the radius of
