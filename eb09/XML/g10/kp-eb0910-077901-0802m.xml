                <p><label type="entry">GOOSEBERRY</label>, <hi rend="italic">Ribes grοssularia,</hi>
                    a well-known fruitbush of northern and central Europe, usually placed in the
                    same genus of the natural order to which it gives name as the closely allied
                    currants, but by some made the type of a small sub-genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grossularia,</hi> the members of which differ from the true currants chiefly in
                    their spinous stems, and in their flowers growing on short footstalks, solitary,
                    or two or three together, instead of in racemes.</p>
                <p>The wild gooseberry is a small, straggling bush, nearly resembling the cultivated
                    plant,—the branches being thickly set with sharp spines, standing out singly or
                    in diverging tufts of two or three from the bases of the short spurs or lateral
                    leaf shoots, on which the bell-shaped flowers are produced, singly or in pairs,
                    from the groups of rounded, deeply-crenated 3 or 5-lobed leaves. The fruit is
                    smaller than in the garden kinds, but is often of good flavour; it is generally
                    hairy, but in one variety smooth, constituting the <hi rend="italic">R.
                    uva-crispa</hi> of writers; the colour is usually green, but plants are
                    occasionally met with having deep purple berries. The gooseberry is indigenous
                    to the central parts of Europe and western Asia, growing naturally in alpine
                    thickets and rocky woods in the lower country, from France eastward, perhaps as
                    far as the Himalaya. In Britain it is often found in copses and hedgerows and
                    about old ruins, but has been so long a plant of cultivation that it is
                    difficult to decide upon its claim to a place in the native flora of the island.
                    Common as it is now on some of the lower slopes of the Alps of Piedmont and
                    Savoy, it is uncertain whether the Romans were acquainted with the gooseberry,
                    though it may possibly be alluded to in a vague passage of Pliny: the hot
                    summers of Italy, in ancient times as at present, would be unfavourable to its
                    cultivation. Abundant in Germany and France, it does not appear to have been
                    much grown there· in the Middle Ages, though the wild fruit was held in some
                    esteem medicinally for the cooling properties of its acid juice in fevers; while
                    the old English name, <hi rend="italic">Pea-berry,</hi> still surviving in some
                    provincial dialects, indicates that it was similarly valued in Britain, where it
                    was planted in gardens at a comparatively early period. Turner describes the
                    gooseberry in his <hi rend="italic">Herball,</hi> written about the middle of
                    the 16th century, and a few years later it is mentioned in one of Tusser’s
                    quaint rhymes as an ordinary object of garden culture. Improved varieties were
                    probably first raised by the skilful gardeners of Holland, whose name for the
                    fruit, <hi rend="italic">Kruisbezie,</hi> may have been easily corrupted into
                    the present English vernacular word.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Scotch <hi rend="italic">grossart,</hi> originally <hi
                    rend="italic">grosel,</hi> evidently from the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >groseille,</hi> may have the same ultimate origin; the usual derivation from
                    <hi rend="italic">grossus,</hi> a green fig, seems far-fetched. The rough wild
                    fruit is called l&gt;y the Germans <hi rend="italic">krausbeere.</hi></p></note>
                    Towards the end of the last century the gooseberry became a favourite object of
                    cottage-horticulture, especially in Lancashire, where the working
                    cotton-spinners have raised numerous varieties from seed, their efforts having
                    been chiefly directed to increasing the size of the fruit.</p>
                <p>Of the many hundred sorts enumerated in recent horticultural works, few perhaps
                    equal in flavour some of the older denizens of the fruit-garden, such as the
                    “old rough red” and “hairy amber.” The climate of the British Islands seems
                    peculiarly adapted to bring the gooseberry to perfection, and it may be grown
                    successfully even in the most northern parts of Scotland; indeed, the flavour of
                    the fruit is said to improve with increasing latitude. In Norway even, the bush
                    flourishes, in gardens on the west coast, nearly up to the Arctic circle, and it
                    is found wild as far north as 63°. The dry summers of the French and German
                    plains are less suited to it, though it is grown in some hilly districts with
                    tolerable success. The gooseberry in the south of England will grow well in cool
                    situations, and may be sometimes seen in gardens near London flourishing under
                    the partial shade of apple trees; but in the north it needs full exposure to the
                    sun to bring the fruit to perfection. It will succeed in almost any soil, but
                    prefers a rich loam or black alluvium, and, though naturally a plant of rather
                    dry places, will do well in moist land, if drained.</p>
                <p>The varieties are most easily propagated by cuttings planted in the autumn, which
                    root rapidly, and in a few years form good fruit-bearing bushes. Much difference
                    of opinion prevails regarding the mode of pruning this valuable shrub; it is
                    probable that in different situations it may require varying treatment. The
                    fruit being borne on the lateral spurs, and on the shoots of the last year, it
                    is the usual practice to shorten the side branches in the winter, before the
                    buds begin to expand; some reduce the longer leading shoots at the same time,
                    while others prefer to nip off the ends of these in the summer while they are
                    still succulent. When large fruit is desired, plenty of manure should be
                    supplied to the roots, and the greater portion of the berries picked off while
                    still small. Burbidge states that the gooseberry may be with advantage grafted
                    or budded on stocks of some other species of <hi rend="italic">Ribes, R.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aureum,</hi> the ornamental golden currant of the flower garden,
                    answering well for the purpose. The giant gooseberries of the Lancashire
                    “fanciers” are obtained by the careful culture of varieties specially raised
                    with this object, the growth being encouraged by abundant manuring, and the
                    removal of all but a very few berries from each plant. Single gooseberries of
                    nearly 2 ounces in weight have been occasionally exhibited; but the produce of
                    such fanciful horticulture is generally insipid. The bushes at times suffer much
                    from the ravages of the caterpillar of the gooseberry or magpie moth, <hi
                    rend="italic">Abraxas grossulariata,</hi> which often strip the branches of
                    leaves in the early summer, if not destroyed before the mischief is
                    accomplished. The most effectual way of getting rid of this pretty but
                    destructive insect is to look over each bush carefully, and pick off the larvae
                    byhand; when larger they may be shaken off by striking the branches, but by that
                    time the harm is generally done— the eggs are laid on the leaves of the previous
                    season. Equally annoying in some years is the smaller larva of the V-moth, <hi
                    rend="italic">Halias ναnaria,</hi> which often appears in great numbers, and is
                    not so readily removed. The gooseberry is sometimes attacked by the grub of a
                    fly, <hi rend="italic">Nematus mbesii,</hi> of which several broods appear in
                    the course of the spring and summer, and are very destructive. The grubs bury
                    themselves in the ground to pass into the pupal state; the first brood of flies,
                    hatched just as the bushes are coming into leaf in the spring, lay their eggs on
                    the lower side of the leaves, where the small greenish larvae soon after emerge.
                    For the destruction of the first broods it has been recommended to syringe the
                    bushes with tarwater; perhaps a very weak solution of carbolic acid might prove
                    more effective. The powdered root of white hellebore is said to destroy both
                    this grub and the caterpillars <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0803-0780"/> of the gooseberry and V-moth; infusion of
                    foxglove, and tobacco-water, are likewise tried by some growers. If the fallen
                    leaves are carefully removed from the ground in the autumn and burnt, and the
                    surface of the soil turned over with the fork or spade, most eggs and chrysalids
                    will be destroyed.</p>
                <p>The gooseberry was introduced into the United States by the early settlers, and
                    in some parts of New England large quantities of the green fruit are produced
                    and sold for culinary use in the towns; but the excessive heat of the American
                    summer is not adapted for the healthy maturation of the berries, especially of
                    the English varieties. Perhaps if some of these, or those raised in the country,
                    could be crossed with one of the indigenous species, kinds might be obtained
                    better fitted for American conditions of culture, although the gooseberry does
                    not readily hybridize. The bushes are apt to be infested by a minute fly, known
                    as the gooseberry midge, <hi rend="italic">Cecidomyia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >grossularioe,</hi> which lays its eggs in the green fruit, in which the larvae
                    are hatched, causing the berries to turn purple and fall prematurely. According
                    to Mr Fitch, the midge attacks the wild native species as well as the cultivated
                    gooseberry.</p>
                <p>The gooseberry, when ripe, yields a fine wine by the fermentation of the juice
                    with water and sugar, the resulting sparkling liquor retaining much of the
                    flavour of the fruit. By similarly treating the juice of the green fruit, picked
                    just before it ripens, an effervescing wine is produced, nearly resembling some
                    kinds of champagne, and, when skilfully prepared, far superior to much of the
                    liquor sold under that name. Brandy has been made from ripe gooseberries by
                    distillation; by exposing the juice with sugar to the acetous fermentation a
                    good vinegar may be obtained. The gooseberry, when perfectly ripe, contains a
                    large quantity of sugar, most abundant in the red and amber varieties; in the
                    former it amounts to from 6 to upwards of 8 per cent. The acidity of the fruit
                    is chiefly due to malic acid.</p>
                <p>Several other species of the sub-genus produce edible fruit, though none have as
                    yet been brought under economic culture. Among them may be noticed <hi
                    rend="italic">R. oxyacanthoides</hi> and <hi rend="italic">R. cynosbati,</hi>
                    abundant in Canada and the northern parts of the United States, and <hi
                    rend="italic">R. gracile,</hi> common along the Alleghany range. The group is a
                    widely distributed one, species occurring to the west of the Rocky Mountains,
                    and in Siberia and Japan, while one is said to have been found by recent
                    explorers on the lofty Kilimanjaro, near the lakesources of the Nile. (c. p.
