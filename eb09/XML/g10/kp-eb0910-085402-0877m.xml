                    name in the land-drostei of Hildesheim and province of Hanover, Prussia, is
                    pleasantly situated at the foot of the Hainberg in the fertile valley of the
                    Leine, about 67 miles to the south of Hanover, on the Hanover and Cassel
                    railway. It is traversed by the Leine, which separates the Altstadt from the
                    Neustadt and Masch; and it is surrounded by ramparts which are planted with lime
                    tree≡ and form an agreeable promenade. The streets in the older part of the town
                    are for the most part crooked and narrow, but the newer portions are spaciously
                    and regularly built. Apart from the churches and the numerous university
                    buildings, it has few structures of any public importance. There are several
                    thriving industries, including, besides the various branches of the publishing
                    trade, the manufacture of woollen and cotton goods, and of physical and
                    mathematical instruments. The university, the famous Georgia Augusta, founded by
                    George II. in 1734, and opened in 1737, rapidly attained a leading position, and
                    in the year 1823 its students numbered 1547. Political disturbances, in which
                    both professors and students were implicated, lowered the attendance to 860 in
                    1834; and the expulsion of the famous seven professors (Albrecht, Dahlmann,
                    Ewald, Gervinus, Weber, and the brothers Grimm) in 1837 still <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0878-0855"/> further reduced its prosperity. The events of
                    1848, on the other hand, told somewhat in its favour; and since the annexation
                    of Hanover in 1866 it has been carefully cherished by the Prussian Government.
                    In the winter session 1877-78, its students numbered 909, and the teaching staff
                    124,—its numerical strength thus entitling it to rank as the eighth on the list
                    of German universities. The present professoriate includes, among other
                    distinguished names, those of Benfey, Lagarde, Lotze, Ritschl, and Weber.
                    Amongst those who have been teachers within its walls may be mentioned, besides
                    the seven already named, Haller, Gesner, Gatterer, Sprengel, Heyne, Blumenbach,
                    Herbart, Heeren, 0. Müller, K, F. Hermann, and Eichhorn.</p>
                <p>Neander, Ewald, and the distinguished chemist Bunsen, it may be added, were
                    natives of Gottingen. The university library contains upwards of 500,000 printed
                    volumes and 5000 manuscripts. There is a good chemical laboratory, as well as
                    adequate zoological, ethnographical, and mineralogical collections, the most
                    remarkable being Blumenbach’s famous collection of skulls. The other
                    establishments more or less connected with the university, such as the
                    observatory, botanical garden, and various hospitals, do not call for special
                    notice. The Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften publishes the long-established and

                    from the emperor Otho IV. about 1210, and from 1286 to 1463 it was the seat of
                    the princely house· of Braunschweig-Gottingen. During this period it held a high
                    place among the towns of the Hanseatic League. In 1531 it joined the Reformation
                    movement, and in the following century it suffered considerably by the Thirty
                    Years’ War, having been taken by Tilly in 1626, after a siege of 25 days, and
                    recaptured by the Swedes in 1632. After a century of decay,.it was anew brought
                    into importance by the establishment of its university; and a marked increase in
                    its industrial and commercial prosperity has again taken place in recent
                    years.</p>
