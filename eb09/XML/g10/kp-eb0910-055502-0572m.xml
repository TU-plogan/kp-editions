                    tales, probably compiled about the end of the 13th century or the beginning of
                    the 14th, which still possesses a twofold literary interest, first as one of the
                    most popular books of its time, and secondly as the source, directly or
                    indirectly, of much which has since become current under the stamp of genius. Of
                    its authorship nothing certain is known; and there is little but gratuitous
                    conjecture to associate it either with the name of Helinandus or with that of
                    Petrus Berchorius (Pierre Bercheure). It is even a matter of debate whether it
                    took its rise in England, Germany, or France; while Mr Douce was disposed to
                    give the credit of it to the Germans, Herr Oesterley is inclined to recognize
                    the priority of the English. The work at least was evidently intended as a
                    manual for preachers, and was probably written by one who himself belonged to
                    the clerical profession. The name, <hi rend="italic">Deeds of the Romans,</hi>
                    is only partially appropriate to the collection in its present form, since,
                    besides the titles from Greek and Latin history and legend, it comprises
                    fragments of very various origin, Oriental and European. The unifying element of
                    the book is its moral purpose: everything is made serviceable for reproof and
                    doctrine, the powerful chemistry of the allegorical method extracting the
                    sunshine of Christian truth from the cucumbers of the most worldly and wicked
                    circumstance. The style is barbarous, and the narrative ability of the compiler
                    seems to vary with his source; but he has managed to bring together a
                    considerable variety of excellent material. He gives us, for example, the germ
                    of the romance of “Guy of Warwick,” the story of “Darius and his Three Sons,”
                    versified by Occleve, part of Chaucer’s “Man of Lawes’ Tale,” a tale of the
                    emperor Theodosius, the same in its main features as that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lear,</hi> the story of the “Three Black Crows,” the “Hermit and the Angel,” so
                    well-known from Parnell’s version, and a story identical with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fridolin</hi> of Schiller. Owing to the loose structure of the
                    book, it was easy for a transcriber to insert any additional story into his own
                    copy, and consequently the MSS. of the <hi rend="italic">Gesta Romanorum</hi>
                    exhibit considerable variety. Oesterley, who has bestowed the fullest
                    investigation on the subject, recognizes an English group of MSS. (written
                    always in Latin), a German group (sometimes in Latin and sometimes in German),
                    and a group which is represented by the vulgate or common printed text. The
                    earliest editions are supposed to be those of Ketelaer and De Lecompt at
                    Utrecht, of Arnold Ter Hoenen at Cologne, and of Ulrich Zell at Cologne; but the
                    exact date is in all three cases uncertain.</p>
                <p>An English translation, probably based directly on the MS. Harl. 5369, was
                    published by Wynkyn de Worde about 1510-1515, the only copy of which now known
                    to exist is preserved in the library of St John’s College, Cambridge. In 1577
                    Richard Robinson published a revised edition of Wynkyn de Worde, and the book
                    proved highly popular. Between 1648 and 1703 at least eight impressions were
                    issued. In 1703 appeared the first vol. of a translation by B. P., probably
                    Bartholomew Pratt, “from the Latin edition of 1514.” A translation by the Rev.
                    C. Swan, first published in 2 vols, in 1824, forms part of Bohn’s Antiquarian
                    Library, and was re-edited by Wynnard Hooper in 1877. The German translation was
                    first printed at Augsburg, 1489. A French version, under the title of Lc Violier
                    Acs histoires romaines moralisez, appeared in the early part of the 16th
                    century, and went through a number of editions; it has been reprinted by G.
                    Brunet (Paris, 1858). Critical editions of the Latin text have been produced by
                    A. Keller (Stuttgart, 1842), and Oesterley (Berlin, 1872). See also Warton, “On
