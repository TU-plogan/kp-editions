                    Monmouth, and in 1152 was elected bishop of St Asaph. He died in 1154. Three
                    works have been attributed to him—the <hi rend="italic">Chronicon sive Historia
                    Britonum</hi>; a metrical <hi rend="italic">Life and Prophecies of Merlin;</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Compendium Ganfredi de Corpore Christi et Sacramento
                    Eucharistias.</hi> Of these the first only is genuine; internal evidence is
                    fatal to the claims of the second; and the <hi rend="italic">Compendium</hi> is
                    known to be written by Geoffrey of Auxerre. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Britonum</hi> appeared in 1147, and created a
                    great sensation. Geoffrey professed that the work was a translation of a Breton
                    work he had got from his friend Walter Calenius, archdeacon of Oxford. It is
                    highly probable that the Breton work never existed. The plea of translation was
                    a literary fiction extremely common among writers in the Middle Agee, and was
                    adopted to give a mysterious importance to the communications of the author and
                    to deepen the interest of his readers. We may compare with this Sir Walter
                    Scott’s professed quotations from “Old Plays,” which he wrote as headings for
                    chapters in his novels. If Geoffrey consulted a Breton book at all, it would
                    probably be one of the Arthurian romances then popular in Armorica. His history
                    is a work of genius and imagination, in which the story is told with a
                    Defoe-like minuteness of detail very likely to impose on a credulous age. It is
                    founded largely on the previous histories of Gildas and the so-called Nennius;
                    and many of the legends are taken direct from Virgil. The history of Merlin, as
                    embodied in the <hi rend="italic">Historia,</hi> is found in Persian and Indian
                    books. Geoffrey’s imagination may have been greatly stimulated by local English
                    legends, especially in the numerous stories he gives in support of his fanciful
                    derivations of names of places. Whatever hints Geoffrey may have got from
                    popular tales, and whatever materials he may have accumulated in the course of
                    hi8 reading, the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> is to be thought of as largely
                    his own creation and as forming a splendid poetical whole. Geoffrey, at all
                    events, gave these stories their permanent place in literature. We have
                    sufficient evidence to prove that in Wales the work was considered purely
                    fabulous. (See <hi rend="italic">Giraldus Cambreηsis,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Itinerarium</hi><hi rend="italic">Cambria?,</hi> lib. i., c. 5, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cambrics</hi><hi rend="italic">Descriptio,</hi> c. vii.) And
                    William of Newbury says “that fabler (Geoffrey) with his fables shall be
                    straightway spat out by us all.” Geoffrey’s <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> was
                    the basis of a host of other works. It was abridged by Alfred of Beverley
                    (1150), and translated into Anglo-Norman verse, first by Geoffrey Gaimar (1154),
                    and then by Wace (1180), whose work, <hi rend="italic">Li Romans de Brut,</hi>
                    contained a good deal of new matter. Early in the 13th century was published
                    Layamon’s <hi rend="italic">Brut·,</hi> and in 1278 appeared Robert of
                    Gloucester’s rhymed <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of England.</hi> These two
                    works, being written in English, would make the legends popular with the common
                    people. The same influence continued to show itself in the works of Roger of
                    Wendover (1237), Matthew Paris (1259), Bartholomew Cotton (13001), Matthew of
                    Westminster (1310), Peter Langtoft, Robert de Brunne, Ralph Higden, John
                    Harding, Robert Fabyan (1512), Richard Grafton (1569), and Raphael Holinshed
                    (1580), who is especially important as the immediate source of some of
                    Shakespeare’s dramas. A large part of the introduction of Milton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of England</hi> consists of Geoffrey’s legends, which are
                    not accepted by him as historical. The stories, thus preserved and handed down,
                    have had an enormous influence on literature generally, but especially on
                    English literature. They became familiar to the Continental nations; and they
                    even appeared in Greek, and were known to the Arabs. With the exception of the
                    translation of the Bible, probably no book has furnished so large an amount of
                    literary material to English writers. The germ of the popular nursery tale, <hi
                    rend="italic">Jack the Giant-Killer,</hi> is to be found in the adventures of
                    his Corineus, the companion of Brutus, who settled in Cornwall, and had a
                    desperate fight with giants there. Goëmagot, one of these giants, is said to be
                    the origin of Gog and Magog—two effigies formerly exhibited on the Lord Mayor’s
                    day in London, which are referred to in several of the English dramatists, and
                    still have their well-known representatives in the Guildhall of the city.
                    Chaucer gives Geoffrey a place in his “House of Fame,” where he mentions
                    “Englyssh Gaunfride” (Geoffrey) as being “besye for to here up Troye.”</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Arthurian romances had assumed a unique place in literature. The
                    Arthur of later poetry is a grand ideal personage, seemingly unconnected with
                    either space or time, and performing feats of extraordinary and superhuman
                    valour. The real Arthur—if his historical existence is to be conceded—was most
                    probably a Cumbrian or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n184/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0184-0173"/> Strathclyde Briton; and Geoffrey is responsible
                    for the blunder of transferring him to South Wales. So intimately is Geoffrey
                    connected with Arthur’s celebrity, that he is often called Galfridus Arturus.
                    Although the wondrous cycle of Arthurian romances scarcely originated with
                    Geoffrey, he made the existing legends radiant with poetic colouring. They thus
                    became the common property of Europe; and, after being modified by the trouvères
                    in France, the minnesingers in Germany, and by such writers as Gaimιr, Wace,
                    Mapes, Robert de Borron, Luces de Gast, and Hélie de Borrυn, they were converted
                    into a magnificent prose poem by Sir Thomas Malory, in 1461. Malory’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Horte Darthur</hi>, printed by Caxton in 1485, is as truly <hi
                    rend="italic">the</hi> epic of the English mind as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> is the epic of the Greek mind.</p>
                <p>The first English tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Gorbοduc, or Ferrex and Porrex</hi>
                    (1565), which was written mainly by Sackville, is founded on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia Britonum.</hi> John Higgins, in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Mirror for Magistrates</hi> (1587), borrows largely from the old legends. This
                    work was extremely popular in the Elizabethan period, and furnished dramatists
                    with plots for their plays. Spenser’s <hi rend="italic">Faerie Queene</hi> is
                    saturated with the ancient myths; and, in his <hi rend="italic">Arthur,</hi> the
                    poet gives usa noble spiritual conception of the character. In the tenth canto
                    of Book ii. there is—</p>
                <p>“A chronicle of Briton kings, From Brut to Uther’s rayne.</p>
                <p>Warners lengthy poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Albion's England</hi> (1586) is
                    full of legendary British history. Drayton’s <hi rend="italic">Polyolbioη</hi>
                    (1613) is largely made up of stories from Geoffrey, beginning with <hi
                    rend="italic">Britain-founding Brute.</hi> Geoffrey’s good faith and historic
                    accuracy are warmly contended for by Drayton, in Song x. of his work.</p>
                <p>In Shakespeare’s time Geoffrey’s legends were still implicitly believed by the
                    great mass of the people, and were appealed to as historical documents by so
                    great a lawyer as Sir Edward Coke. They had also figured largely in the disputes
                    between the Edwards and Scotland. William Camden was the first to prove
                    satisfactorily that the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> was a romance.
                    Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> was preceded by an earlier play
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">The Chronicle History of King Lear and his Three
                    Daughters, Gonorill, Ragan, and Cordelia, as it hath been divers and sundry
                    times lately acted.</hi> Shakespeare’s immediate authority was Holinshed; but
                    the later chronicles, in so far as they were legendary, were derived from
                    Geoffrey. The story of · <hi rend="italic">Cymbeliηe</hi> is another
                    illustration of the fascination these legends exercised over Shakespeare. An
                    early play, ascribed by some to Shakespeare, on <hi rend="italic">Locrine,</hi>
                    Brutus’s eldest son, is a further example of how the dramatists ransacked
                    Geoffrey’s stores. The <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> was a favourite book with
                    Milton; and he once thought of writing a long poem on King Arthur, whose
                    qualities he would probably have idealized, as Spenser has done, but with still
                    greater moral grandeur. In addition to the evidence afforded by the introduction
                    to his <hi rend="italic">History of England,</hi> Milton shows in many ways that
                    he was profoundly indebted to early legendary history. His exquisite conception
                    of Sabrina, in <hi rend="italic">Comus,</hi> is an instance of how the original
                    legends were not only appropriated but ennobled by many of our writers. In his
                    Latin poems, too, there are some interesting passages pertinent to the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>Dryden once intended to write an epic on Arthur’s exploits; and Pope planned an
                    epic on Brutus. Mason’s <hi rend="italic">Caractacus</hi> bears witness to
                    Geoffrey’s charm forpoetic minds. Wordsworth has embalmed the beautiful legend
                    of <hi rend="italic">Pious Elidure</hi> in his own magic verse. In chapter xxxvL
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Pickwick Papers</hi> Dickens gives what he calls “The
                    True Legend of Prince Bladud,” which is stamped throughout with the impress of
                    the author’s peculiar genius, and lit up with his sunny humour. Alexander Smith
                    has a poem treating of <hi rend="italic">Edwin of Deira,</hi> who figures
                    towards the close of Geoffrey’s history. And Tennyson’s <hi rend="italic">Idylls
                    of the King</hi> furnish the most illustrious example of Geoffrey’s influence;
                    although the poet takes his.stories, in the first instance, from Malory’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Morte</hi><hi rend="italic">Darthur.</hi> The influence the
                    legends have had in causing other legends to spring up, and in creating a love
                    for narrative, is simply incalculable. In this way Geoffrey was really, for
                    Englishmen, the inventor of a new literary form, which is represented by the
                    romances and novels of later times.</p>
                <p>There are several MSS. of Geoffrey’s work in the old Royal Library of the British
                    Museum, of which one formerly belonging to Margan Abbey is considered the best.
                    The titles of the various editions of Geoffrey are given in Wright’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Biοg. Brit. Lit.,</hi> in the volume devoted to the Anglo-Norman
                    period, which also contains an excellent notice of Geoffrey. The work compiled
                    by Bale and Pits gives a mythical literary history, corresponding to Geoffrey’s
                    mythical political history. Of the <hi rend="italic">Life and Prophecies of
                    Merlin,</hi> falsely attributed to Geoffrey, 42 copies were printed for the
                    Roxburghe Club in 1830. The <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> was translated into
                    English by Aaron Thompson (London, 1718); and a revised edition was issued by Dr
                    Giles (London, 1842), which is to be found in the volume entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Six Old English Chronicles</hi> in Bohn’s Antiquarian Library. A
                    discussion of Geoffrey’s literary influence is given in “Legends of Pre-Roman
                    Britain,” an article in the <hi rend="italic">Dublin University Magazine</hi>
                    for April 1876. The latest instance of the interest in Geoffrey is the
                    publication of the following work :— <hi rend="italic">Der Münchener</hi><hi
