                    of a province of its own name, occupies a fine position about 3 miles from the
                    coast on a platform of Mount Camicus, more than 1100 feet above the level of the
                    sea. It lies about 60 miles S.S.E. of Palermo, with which it is connected by a
                    railway 90 miles long. As seen from the lower ground Girgenti presents a

                    the same greybrown walls, the same reddish roofs, and the same narrow doors and
                    narrow windows. The cathedral, begun in the 14th century, has still an
                    impressive effect, in spite of the incongruous mixture of styles; but the
                    interior is a typical specimen of modern rococo. The acoustic conditions are
                    sufficiently peculiar: a word spoken in the softest whisper at the entrance can
                    be distinctly heard behind the choir, 100 paces off. One of the chapels contains
                    the shrine and bears the name of St Gerlando, the first bishop of Girgenti; the
                    altar-piece is a Virgin and Child by Guido Reni; and in the north aisle there
                    stands a marble sarcophagus now used as a font, with fine rilievos, probably of
                    Roman workmanship after a Greek original, representing the story of Hippolytus
                    and Phaedra. Not only are the archives of the cathedral rich in historic
                    documents of the Norman period, but they profess to contain an autograph letter
                    of the devil himself. Among the other churches, upwards of forty in number, S.
                    Maria dei Greci is worthy of note as preserving two Doric pillars which had
                    belonged to the temple of Zeus Polieus, founded in 570 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> by Phalaris, and are thus the oldest architectural remains in
                    Girgenti. As the chief town of a province, Girgenti is the residence of a
                    prefect and the military headquarters of the district. It is also the seat of
                    the wealthiest bishopric in Sicily, dating from the pontificate of Urban II.;
                    and it possesses a chamber of commerce and art, an industrial institute, a
                    lyceum, a gymnasium, a technical school, and an episcopal seminary. Its
                    principal library, Bibliotheca Lucchesiana. was presented to the town by Don
                    Andrea Lucchese of the family of Campo Franco; the Casino Empedocleo, with
                    well-appointed library and readingrooms, was founded by a number of the
                    wealthier citizens. In the early part of the century Girgenti was a
                    poverty-stricken town, but it has attained a considerable degree of prosperity
                    since 18o0. It lies in the centre of the sulphur district of Sicily, and its
                    port, formerly Molo di Girgenti, now Porto Empedocle, is the principal place of
                    shipment. The harbour has been largely improved since 1870: the pier, originally
                    constructed in the 17th century, in part at least from the ruins of the temple
                    of the Olympian Jupiter, has been extended to a length of 4800 feet, so as to
                    include an area of 330,000 square yards, and the depth, which was only 10 feet
                    on the bar and 16 within, has been greatly increased by dredging. Around the
                    port, which is 3 miles from the city proper, has gathered a cluster of houses
                    and stores, and the spot is defended by a small fort. Almonds and grain are the
                    only important articles of export besides sulphur; but, though the grain-pits
                    hewn out of the rock are of large extent, the actual shipments of grain are not
                    very great. The average value of the annual export of sulphur amounted, between
                    1868 and 1870, to £411,700, while that of the other articles was less than £
                    15,000 each. The population of Girgenti was 18,802 in 1871, and that of Porto
                    Empedocle 6691. In the history of Girgenti there is little of note; the
                    historical interest of the district gathers round the splendid ruins of the
                    older Agrigentum, which lie between Girgenti and the sea.</p>
