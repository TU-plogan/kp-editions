                    resources of his art were still in their infancy, but considering the limits of
                    those resources, his achievements were the highest possible. At the close of the
                    Middle Age, he laid the foundations upon which all the progress of the
                    Renaissance was afterwards securely based. In the days of Giotto, the knowledge
                    possessed by painters of the human frame and its structure rested only upon
                    general observation, and not upon any minute, prolonged, or scientific study;
                    while to facts other than those of humanity their observation had never been
                    closely directed. Of linear perspective they possessed few ideas, and those
                    elementary and empirical, and scarcely any ideas at all of aerial perspective or
                    the conduct of light and shade. As far as painting could ever be carried under
                    these conditions, so far it was carried by Giotto. In its choice of subjects,
                    his art is entirely subservient to the religious spirit of his age. Even in its
                    mode of conceiving and arranging those subjects, it is in part still trammelled
                    by the rules and consecrated traditions of the past. Thus it is as far from
                    being a perfectly free as from being a perfectly accomplished form of art. Many
                    of those truths of nature to which the painters of succeeding generations learnt
                    to give accurate and complete expression, Giotto was only able to express by way
                    of imperfect symbol and suggestion. But in spite of these limitations and
                    shortcomings, and although he has often to be content with expressing truths of
                    space and form conventionally or inadequately, and truths of structure and
                    action approximately, and truths of light and shadow not at all, yet among the
                    elements over which he has control he maintains so just a balance that his work
                    produces in the spectator less sense of imperfection than that of many later and
                    more accomplished masters. He is one of the least one-sided of artists, and his
                    art, it has been justly said, resumes and concentrates all the attainments of
                    his time not less truly than all the attainments of the crowning age of Italian
                    art are resumed and concentrated in Raphael. In some particulars the painting of
                    Giotto was never surpassed,—in the judicious division of the field and massing
                    and scattering of groups,—in the union of dignity in the types with
                    appropriateness in the occupations of the personages,—in strength and directness
                    of intellectual grasp and dramatic motive,—in the combination of perfect gravity
                    with perfect frankness in conception, and of a noble severity in design with a
                    great charm of harmony and purity in colour. The earlier Byzantine and Roman
                    workers in mosaic had bequeathed to him the high abstract qualities of their
                    practice, their balance, their impressiveness, their grand instinct of
                    decoration; but while they had compassed these qualities at an entire sacrifice
                    of life and animation, it is the glory of Giotto to have been the first among
                    his countrymen to breathe life into art, and to have quickened its stately
                    rigidity with the fire of natural incident and emotion. It was this conquest,
                    this touch of the magician, this striking of the sympathetic notes of life and
                    reality, that chiefly gave Giotto his immense reputation among his
                    contemporaries, and made him the fit exponent of the vivid, penetrating, and
                    practical genius of emancipated Florence. His is one of the few names in history
                    which, having become great while its bearer lived, has sustained no loss of
                    greatness through subsequent generations.</p>
                <p>No two men were evermore unlike than the rustic Giotto and the patrician Dante;
                    but among the high places of history, their figures stand side by side on a
                    common eminence. They were contemporaries, Dante being the elder of the two by
                    eleven years, and friends, or, at the least, acquaintances. The poetry of Dante,
                    reporting concerning things unseen with a definiteness not less than that of
                    actual vision, served in many ways, until the days of Michelangelo, not only as
                    an inspiration but as a law to the religious art of Italy. This inspiring and
                    legislating authority of the sacred poet was exercised first of all upon
                    Giotto,—partly, it appears, by means of personal intercourse between the two
                    men. On the other hand, Giotto is celebrated in Dante’s verse as the foremost
                    painter of the new age. Nor is this the only tribute to his pre-eminence which
                    we find in contemporary, or almost contemporary, literature. He is from the
                    first a kind of popular hero. He is celebrated by the poet Petrarch and by the
                    historian Villani. He is made the subject of tales and anecdotes by Boccaccio
                    and by Franco Sacchetti. From these notices, as well as from Vasari, we gain a
                    distinct picture of the man, as one whose nature was in keeping with his peasant
                    origin; whose sturdy frame and plain features corresponded to a character rather
                    distinguished for shrewd and genial strength than for sublimer or more ascetic
                    qualities; a master craftsman, to whose strong combining and inventing powers
                    nothing came amiss; conscious of his own deserts, never at a loss either in the
                    things of his art or in the things of life, and equally ready and efficient
                    whether he has to design the scheme of some great spiritual allegory in colour
                    or imperishable monument in stone, or whether he has to show his wit in the
                    encounter of practical jest and repartee. From his own hand we have a
                    contribution to literature which helps to substantiate this conception of his
                    character. A large part of Giotto’s fame as a painter was won in the service of
                    the Franciscans, and in the pictorial celebration of the life and ordinances of
                    their founder. As is well known, it was a part of the ordinances of Francis that
                    his disciples should follow his own example in worshipping and being wedded to
                    poverty,—poverty idealized and personified as a spiritual bride and mistress.
                    Giotto, having on the commission of the order given the noblest pictorial
                    embodiment to this and other aspects of the Franciscan doctrine, presently wrote
                    an ode in which his own views on poverty are expressed; and in this he shows
                    that, if on the one hand his genius was at the service of the ideals of his
                    time, and his imagination open to their significance, on the other hand his
                    judgment was very shrewdly aware of their practical dangers and
                    exaggerations.</p>
                <p>Giotto di Bondone (a name, as it happens, also borne in the same generation by a
                    distinguished citizen of Siena) was the son of a poor peasant of Vespignano. He
                    was born in 1276, and drew, we are told, by natural instinct with whatever
                    materials he could lay his hands on. He was ten years old when Cimabue, as the
                    story goes, found him by the wayside, drawing a sheep with a piece of charcoal
                    upon a stone or tile. The master, then at the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n627/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0627-0610"/> height of his fame, took the peasant boy, with
                    the glad consent of his father, to Florence to be his pupil. Of his early career
                    after this we know no more until we find him at work as the foremost among many
                    scholars employed uuder Cimabue at the interior decorations of the great
                    memorial church of St Francis at Assisi. This church consists of two structures,
                    one superimposed on the other; it is of the upper and not of the lower church
                    that wo speak at present. On the walls of this, a great series of frescos, now
                    more than half obliterated, was painted by the primitive masters of the Tuscan
                    school, including some of older and some of younger standing than Cimabue. The
                    series is in three tiers, the uppermost tier containing scenes from the Old
                    Testament; the next, scenes from the New; the lowest, scenes from the life of St
                    Francis. It is in this last tier than we can discern with certainty the hand of
                    the youthful Giotto. The extent of his participation has been much debated.
                    According to the more probable opinion, it can be traced even in the earlier
                    scenes of the history; but it is in the later scenes only that the hand and
                    promise of the master, the presence of a new and vital spirit, reveal themselves
                    with fulness. Some interval (but the chronology of Giotto’s career is at all
                    points obscure) would seem to have elapsed between the execution of these
                    frescos and of others, better known than these, which adorn the lower story of
                    the same structure. In four lunette-shaped spaces in the vaulting of this lower
                    church, Giotto has painted four vast compositions, of which the scheme was
                    dictated to him, no doubt, by some pious and learned mouthpiece of the wishes of
                    the order. One of these exhibits the mystical wedding of Francis with Poverty; a
                    second is an allegory of Chastity; a third of Obedience; a fourth shows the
                    saint glorified in heaven among the angels. To describe and explain these famous
                    compositions would be beyond our scope. The ideas they embody cannot but seem
                    strained and cold when we express them in modern language. Strained and cold,
                    indeed, the ideas would have been in any other age of the world; but we must
                    remember that the religious temperament of that age in Italy gave even to
                    pedantry the colours of passion, and an ardent and solemn reality to the most
                    far-drawn fantasies of devotion. And however cool the private judgment of Giotto
                    in such matters may have been, it is not his private judgment which speaks to us
                    from the painted allegories of Assisi; it is the sincere imagination of the men
                    among whom he lived; it is the ardour and solemnity of the devotional spirit of
                    his race. In one of the transepts of the same lower church there are frescos of
                    the Passion of Christ, and others of the life of St Francis, which modern
                    authorities hold against ancient, most likely with justice, to be also from the
                    hand of Giotto.</p>
                <p>Assuming that the later work of the master at Assisi belongs to the year 1296 or
                    thereabouts, we have good evidence that two years afterwards he was working at
                    Rome for the Cardinal Stefaneschi, nephew of Pope Boniface VIII. The remains of
                    his industry in this employment may be seen in a mosaic of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Navicellae</hi> or Christ saving St Peter from the waves, now preserved in the
                    portico of St Peter’s at Rome, and in three panels, kept in the sacristy of the
                    canons of the same church, which originally formed part of a ciborium. It is
                    also recorded that Giotto adorned certain MSS. with miniatures for this patron;
                    and in truth there exists in public libraries a very rare class of MSS., in
                    which the miniatures bear the marks, if scarcely of the hand, at any rate of the
                    immediate influence of Giotto. Lastly, a discoloured fragment of a fresco of the
                    church of St John Lateran shows the figure of Pope Boniface VIII. announcing
                    from a balcony the opening of the famous Jubilee of the year 1300. Soon after
                    this, Giotto was once more in his native city. Recent research has again thrown
                    in doubt the relative shares of the master and of his pupils in the decorations
                    of the chapel, called by Ghiberti the chapel of the Magdalene, in the Bargello
                    or palace of the Podesta at Florence. These were painted to celebrate the
                    pacification between the Black and White parties in the state, effected by the
                    Cardinal d’Acquasparta as delegate of the Pope in 1302, and consisted of a
                    series of Scripture scenes, besides great compositions of Hell and Paradise. It
                    is in the Paradise that the painter has introduced those groups, typical of
                    pacified Florence, in which occur the portraits of Dante, Brunetto Latini, and
                    Corso Donato, and which, amid the emotion of all who care for art or history,
                    were recovered in 1841 from the whitewash that had overlain them.</p>
                <p>The whole central period of Giotto’s life, from about 1305 to about 1334, is
                    divided between periods of residence at Florence and expeditions, of which we
                    can in very rare instances trace the date or sequence, undertaken in consequence
                    of commissions received from other cities of the peninsula. He was as much or
                    more of a traveller as was Van Eyck a century later; and his travels exercised
                    as much or more of the same fertilizing and stimulating influence on art in
                    Italy as did those of the great Fleming in the north-west of Europe. The
                    familiar story of the O belongs to a journey to France, which was projected by
                    Giotto but never undertaken. Pope Benedict XI., the successor of Boniface VIII.,
                    sent a messenger to bring him proofs of the painter’s powers. Giotto would give
                    the messenger no other sample of his talent than an O drawn with a free sweep of
                    the brush from the elbow; but the pope was satisfied, and engaged Giotto at a
                    great salary to go and adorn with frescos the papal residence at Avignon.
                    Benedict, however, dying at this time (1305), nothing came of this commission;
                    and the Italian 14th century frescos, of which remains are still to be seen at
                    Avignon, have been proved to be the work, not, as was long supposed, of Giotto,
                    but of the Sienese master Simone Martini, called Simone Memmi. Another certain
                    date in Giotto’s career belongs to the close of the period we have defined. In
                    1328 he had painted in the palace of the Signoria at Florence a portrait (now
                    lost) of Charles of Calabria kneeling before the Virgin. Two years later he was
                    invited by the father of this prince, King Robert of Naples, to come and work
                    for him in that city. Some frescos in the chapel of the Incoronata had been long
                    erroneously supposed, on the authority of Petrarch, to represent a part at any
                    rate of the industry of Giotto during the three years which he spent at Naples.
                    It is the merit of Messrs Crowe and Cavalcaselle, while conclusively setting
                    aside this tradition, to have called attention to a real and very noble work of
                    the master existing in a hall which formerly belonged to the convent of Sta.
                    Chiara in that city. This is a fresco celebrating the charity of the Franciscan
                    order under the figure of the miracle of the loaves and fishes, with the
                    personages of St Francis and St Clare kneeling on either hand.</p>
                <p>Between these two dates (1305 and 1330), Giotto is said to have resided and left
                    great works at Padua, Ferrara, Urbino, Ravenna, Rimini, Faenza, Lucca, and other
                    cities; and in several of these paintings are still shown which bear his name
                    with more or less of plausibility. But among them it iβ at Padua only that his
                    authentic and mature powers can really be studied, and that in perhaps the
                    greatest and most complete series of creations of all that he has left. These
                    are the frescos with which he decorated the chapel built in honour of the Virgin
                    of the Annunciation by a rich citizen of the town, Enrico Scrovegni, and called
                    sometimes the chapel of the Arena, because it is on the site of an ancient
                    amphitheatre. Since it is recorded that Dante was Giotto’s guest at Padua, and
                    since we know <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n628/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0628-0611"/> that it was in 1306 that he came from Bologna to
                    that city, we may conclude that to the same year, 1306, belongs the beginning of
                    Giotto’s great undertaking in the Arena chapel. The scheme includes a Saviour in
                    Glory over the altar, a Last Judgment over the entrance door, and on either side
                    a series of subjects from the Old and New Testaments and the apocryphal Life of
                    Christ, painted in three tiers, and lowest of all, a fourth tier with emblematic
                    Virtues and Vices in monochrome, the Virtues being on the side of the chapel
                    which is next the incidents of redemption in the entrance fresco of the Last
                    Judgment, the Vices on that side which is next the incidents of perdition. There
                    is no other single building, or single series of representations, in which the
                    highest powers of the Italian mind and hand at the beginning of the 14th century
                    may be so well studied as here. In the same city, the great Franciscan church of
                    St Antonio contains also the remains of works by the master. And it was still
                    for the same order, in their renowned church of Santa Croce, that Giotto
                    executed most of the paintings which mark the periods of his residence in
                    Florence. Besides a vast altar-piece or panel for the Baroncelli chapel, he
                    decorated with frescos the walls of a number of private chapels in this church.
                    The Baroncelli altar-piece still exists; the only chapels of which the frescos
                    have been uncovered are those of the Bardi and Peruzzi. Nor are these the only
                    walls in Florence which to this day bear record of the powers of Giotto— without
                    taking into account many that are attributed to him, but are really by the hand
                    of pupils like Taddeo Gaddi or Puccio Capanna, or of weaker followers like
                    Giottino, Giovanni da Milano, or Agnolo Gaddi.</p>
                <p>Meantime, Giotto had been advancing, not only in fame, but in years and in
                    prosperity. He was married young, and had, so far as is recorded, three sons,
                    Francesco, Niccola, and Donato, and three daughters, Bice, Caterina, and Lucia.
                    He had added by successive purchases to the plot of land inherited from his
                    father at Vespignano. His fellow-citizens of all occupations and degrees
                    delighted to honour him. And now, in his fifty-eighth year, on his return from
                    Naples by way of Gaeta, he received the final and official testimony to the
                    esteem in which he was held at Florence. By a solemn decree of the Priori (April
                    12, 1334), he was appointed master of the works of the cathedral of Sta.
                    Reparata (subsequently and better known as Sta. Maria del Fiore), and architect
                    of the city walls and of the towns within her territory. Dying in 1336, he only
                    enjoyed these dignities for two years. But in the course of these two years he
                    had found time not only to make an excursion to Milan, on the invitation of Azzo
                    Visconti and with the sanction of his own Government, but to plan and in part to
                    superintend the execution of two monuments of architecture, of which the one
                    remaining is among the most exquisite in design and richest in decoration that
                    were ever conceived by man. These were, the west front of the cathedral, and its
                    detached campanile or bell tower. The cathedral front was barbarously stripped
                    of its enrichments in a later age, and stood naked until the other day, when the
                    city of Florence undertook to restore it in a modern imitation. The campanile
                    remains, except for inconsiderable repairs, as it was left by the pupils of
                    Giotto after their master’s death; and in the consummate dignity as well as
                    consummate delicacy of its design, in its fair proportions and in the opulent
                    but lucid invention and apportionment of its details, in the thoughtfulness and
                    pregnant simplicity of its sculptured histories, it is the most fitting crown
                    and monument of a strong and memorable career.</p>
