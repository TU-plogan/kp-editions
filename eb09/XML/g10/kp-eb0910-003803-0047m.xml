                <p>FAMILY pride led the Gallatiπs to boast a descent from A. Atilius Callatinus, the
                    Roman consul <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. u. c.</hi> 494 and 498). A gap of fifteen
                    hundred years between the consul and the first appearance of the name in
                    European history tends to invalidate this rather splendid bit of genealogy, but
                    there can be no doubt that the Gallatins were both an old and noble family. They
                    are first heard of in Savoy in the year 1258, and more than two centuries later
                    they came to Geneva (1510), united with Calvin in his opposition to Rome, and
                    associated their fortunes with those of the little Swiss city. Here they
                    remained, and with one or two other great families governed Geneva, and sent
                    forth many representatives to seek their fortune and win distinction in the
                    service of foreign princes, both as soldiers and ministers. On the eve of the
                    French Revolution the Gallatins were still in Geneva, occupying the same
                    position which they had held for two hundred years. They were republican nobles,
                    simple in their manners, frugal and unostentatious in their habits of life, but
                    genuine aristocrats of high breeding and cultivated minds. They numbered among
                    their friends such widely different persons as Voltaire and the landgrave of
                    Hesse, and, although not wealthy, had everything that could reasonably be
                    desired both socially and politically.</p>
                <p>Albert Gallatin, the most famous of the name, was born in Geneva on the 29th of
                    January 1761. His father died in 1765, his mother five years later, and his only
                    sister in 1777. Although left an orphan at nine years old, Albert Gallatin was
                    by no means lonely or unprotected. His grand-parents, a large circle of near
                    relations, and Mlle. Pictet, an intimate friend, cared for him during his
                    boyhood. He was thoroughly educated at the schools of Geneva, and graduated with
                    honour from the college or academy in 1779. His grandmother then wished him to
                    enter the army of the landgrave of Hesse, but he declined to serve “a tyrant,”
                    and a year later slipped away from Geneva and <pb break="no"

                    less reason to emigrate. A competent fortune, good prospects, social position,
                    and a strong family connexion, were all thrown aside in order to tempt fate in
                    the New World, His relations very properly opposed his course, but they
                    nevertheless did all in their power to smooth his way, and continued to treat
                    him kindly, and he himself in after-life always admitted the justice of their
                    opinions. The temper of the times, a vague discontent with the established order
                    of things, and some political enthusiasm imbibed from the writings of Rousseau,
                    are the best reasons that can now be assigned for Gallatin’s ill-considered
                    desertion of home and friends.</p>
                <p>In July 1780 Gallatin and his friend Serre landed in Massachusetts. They brought
                    with them youth, hope, courage, and a little money, and at once entered into
                    business. The times were unfavourable. The great convulsion of the Revolution
                    was drawing to a close, and everything was in an unsettled condition. The young
                    Genevans failed in business, passed an aimless and severe wintef <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> in the wilds of Maine, and returned to Boston
                    penniless. Gallatin tried to earn a living by teaching French in Harvard
                    College, apparently not λvithout success, but the cold and rigid civilization of
                    New England repelled him, and he made his way to the South. In the backwoods of
                    Pennsylvania and Virginia there seemed to be better chances for a young
                    adventurer. Gallatin engaged in land speculations, and tried to lay the
                    foundation of his fortune in a frontier farm. In 1789 he married Sophia Allegre,
                    and every prospect seemed to be brightening. But clouds soon gathered again.
                    After only a few months of wedlock his wife died, and Gallatin was once more
                    alone. The solitary and desolate frontier life became now more dreary than ever;
                    he flung himself into politics, the only outside resource open to him, and his
                    long and eventful public career began.</p>
                <p>The constitution of 1787 was then before the people, and Gallatin, with his
                    dislike of strong government still upon him, threw himself into opposition and
                    became one of the founders of the AntiFederalist, or, as it was afterwards
                    called, the Republican party. Elections followed to State conventions and
                    legislatures, and Gallatin rose with surprising rapidity. Despite his foreign
                    birth and his inability to speak English with correctness or fluency, he
                    succeeded wonderfully. He was helped, of course, by his sound education; but the
                    true cause of his success lay in his strong sense, untiring industry, courage,
                    clear-sightedness, and great intellectual force. In 1793 he was chosen United
                    States Senator from Pennsylvania by the votes of both political parties. No
                    higher tribute was ever paid to character and ability than that conveyed by this
                    election. But although party feeling did not run high enough in Pennsylvania to
                    prevent Gallatin’s election, the staunch Federalists of the Senate, who had
                    begun to draw the party lines rather sharply, found the presence of the young
                    Genevan highly distasteful. They disliked his French origin, and suspected him
                    to be a man of levelling principles. His seat was contested on account of a
                    technical flaw in regard to the duration of his citizenship, and the Senate
                    annulled the election and sent him back to Pennsylvania with all the glory of
                    political martyrdom.</p>
                <p>The part he had already taken in the exciting scenes to which he now returned had
                    without doubt been an efficient cause in his rejection by the Senate. The
                    success of the new scheme of national government turned at the outset upon the
                    re-establishment of sound finances. To carry out the great plans which he had
                    set on foot, Hamilton had found it necessary to lay an excise on domestic
                    spirits. This tax bore hardly upon the western counties of Pennsylvania,
                    Virginia, and North Carolina, where the people worked many small stills, and
                    were thus able to get their grain to market in a portable form. Strong
                    opposition was manifested. Hamilton and his party modified the original excise
                    law, and partly by their action, partly through the influence of Washington, the
                    murmurs in the two Southern States died away. But in Pennsylvania concession
                    proved fruitless, and hostility became daily more active and dangerous.</p>
                <p>In this resistance to the excise, which was peculiarly odious to the people among
                    whom he lived, Gallatin took a leading part. He intended fully to restrain
                    opposition within legal bounds, but he made the great mistake of embarking upon
                    the stormy sea of resistance to law without sufficiently allowing for the
                    character of the population. The frontiersmen of the Alleghanies were a rough
                    and sturdy race, with a large and unfortunate admixture of wild Irish. The
                    law-abiding American spirit was by no means supreme. Legal resistance soon
                    developed into insurrection. Houses were burned, revenue officers assaulted and
                    driven from the country, and the United States mail was stopped and the letters
                    seized by the rioters. The people began to arm and associate, thus preparing
                    forcible resistance to the Government.</p>
                <p>Gallatin did his best to retrieve his error and prevent open war. With fine
                    courage he faced the excited bands of riflemen who gathered at Redstone Old Fort
                    on the 20th of August 1794, and opposed with vigorous eloquence the use of force
                    against the Government. He checked the excitement sufficiently to prevent
                    bloodshed; but he was only just in time. Washington and Hamilton had at last
                    determined to test the strength of the new Government, and were moving with an
                    overwhelming force upon the western counties. Gallatin had blundered in exciting
                    and leading opposition to’ law among so rude a people, but he had; also
                    interposed with sufficient effect to stop desperate measures, and the whisky
                    rebellion faded away helplessly before the national power.</p>
                <p>Of all the men who took part in this opposition to the excise, Gallatin alone
                    came out with credit. He was at once elected to Congress, and took his seat as a
                    member of the Lower House in the autumn of 1795. A foreigner, still young, and
                    speaking English with a very defective pronunciation, he nevertheless by sheer
                    force of ability and industry wrested from all competitors the leadership of the
                    Republicans in the house, and almost at once became the most dangerous öpponent
                    whom the Federalists had ever encountered in Congress. That great party, by
                    simple weight of ability, generally in a minority, and never in full sympathy
                    with the mass of their countrymen, maintained their power unbroken for the first
                    twelve years of the Government. They had established and organized that
                    Government, and in so doing had borne down opposition with a high hand. They
                    were as domineering as they were able, and inflamed with hatred of France, just
                    then rising to the dignity of a party principle, they found in Gallatin an enemy
                    zho was both by origin and opinion peculiarly obnoxious to them. They attacked
                    him unsparingly, but in vain. His perfect command of temper, and moderation of
                    speech and action, in a bitterly personal age, never failed, and were his most
                    effective weapons; but he made his power felt in other ways. His clear mind and
                    industrious habits drew him to questions of finance. He became the financier of
                    his party, and preached unceasingly his cardinal doctrines of simplicity and
                    economy, and was an effective critic of the measures of Government. Cool and
                    temperate, Gallatin, when following his own theories, was usually in the right,
                    although accused by his followers of trimming. Thus, in regard to the Jay
                    treaty, he defended the constitutional right of the house to consider the
                    treaty, but he did not urge rejection in this specific case. On the other hand,
                    when following a purely party policy, he generally erred. He resisted the navy,
                    the mainspring of Washington’s foreign policy and the chief glory of the
                    Federalists. He opposed commercial treaties and diplomatic intercourse in a
                    similar fashion. On all these points he was grievously wrong, and on all he
                    changed his views after a good deal of bitter experience. The greatest period of
                    Gallatin’s career in Congress was in 1798, after the publication of the famous
                    X. <hi rend="italic">Y.Z.</hi> despatches. The insults of Talleyrand, and his
                    shameless attempts to extort bribes from the American commissioners, roused the
                    deep anger of the people against France. The Federalists swept all before them,
                    and the members of the opposition either retired from Philadelphia or went over
                    to the Government. Alone and single-handed, Gallatin carried on the fight in
                    Congress. The Federalists bore down on him unmercifully, and even attempted a
                    constitutional amendment in regard to citizenship, in order to drive him from
                    office. Still he held on, making a national struggle in the national
                    legislature, and relying very little upon the rights of States so eagerly
                    grasped by Jefferson and Madison. But even then the tide was turning. The strong
                    measures of the Federalists shocked the country; the leaders of the dominant
                    party quarrelled fiercely among themselves; and the Republicans carried the
                    elections of 1800.</p>
                <p>Jefferson and Burr obtained an equal number of votes, and as the constitution
                    then stood either was entitled to the presidency, although no one questioned
                    that it had been intended for Jefferson. The election was thrown into the house,
                    and the Federalists, maddened by defeat, strove to give the presidency to Burr.
                    They fortunately failed, but it was Gallatin who led the Republicans, prevented
                    rash measures, retained the sympathy of the country, and had a careful plan
                    prepared for any emergency.</p>
                <p>When, after this exciting contest, Jefferson took possession of the White House
                    (1801), there were two men, and two only, whose commanding abilities marked them
                    for the first places in the cabinet. James Madison became secretary of state,
                    and Albert Gallatin secretary of the treasury. Wise, prudent, and conservative,
                    Gallatin made few changes in Hamilton’s arrangements, and for twelve years
                    administered the national finances with the greatest skill. He and Jefferson
                    were both imbued with the idea that government reduced to the lowest possible
                    point could be carried on upon <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> principles
                    resting on the assumed perfectness of human nature, and that, if this were done
                    honestly, its authors would be implicitly trusted, and a political millennium
                    would surely ensue. The chief burden of carrying out this theory fell upon
                    Gallatin. His guiding principles still were simplicity of administration and
                    speedy extinct ion of all debt, and everything bent to these objects. Fighting
                    or bribing <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n49/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0049-0040"/> the Barbary pirates was a mere question of
                    expense. It was cheaper to seize Louisiana than to await the settlement of
                    doubtful points. Commercial warfare was to be avoided because of the cost. All
                    wars were bad, but if they could not be evaded it was less extravagant to be
                    ready than to rush to arms unprepared. Amid many difficulties, and thwarted even
                    by Jefferson himself in the matter of the.navy, Gallatin pushed on; and after
                    six years the debt was as far as possible paid, a large surplus was on hand, a
                    comprehensive and beneficent scheme of internal improvements was ready for
                    execution, and the promised land seemed in sight. Then came the stress of war in
                    Europe, a wretched neutrality at home, fierce outbreaks of human passions, and
                    the fair structure of government by <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> theories
                    based on the goodness of unoppressed humanity came to the ground. Gallatin was
                    thrown helplessly back upon the rejected Federalist doctrine of government
                    according to circumstances. He uttered no vain regrets, but the position was a
                    trying one. The sworn foe of strong government, he was compelled, in pursuance
                    of Jefferson’s policy, to put into execution the embargo and the most stringent
                    measures ever taken by an American legislature. He did his best, but all was in
                    vain. Commercial warfare failed, the embargo was repealed, and Jefferson, having
                    hopelessly entangled foreign relations and brought the country to the verge of
                    civil war, retired to private life defeated and broken, and leaving to his
                    successor Madison, and to Gallatin, the task of extricating the nation from its
                    difficulties. From 1809 the new administration, drifting steadily towards war,
                    struggled on from one abortive and exasperating negotiation to another. It was a
                    period of sore trial to Gallatin. The peace policy had failed, and nothing else
                    replaced it. He had lost his hold upon Pennsylvania and his support! in the
                    House, while a cabal in the senate, bitterly and personally hostile to the
                    treasury, crippled the administration and reduced every Government measure to
                    mere inanity. At last, however, one of their blundering acts struck Napoleon in
                    a vital spot. To escape its effects, he set himself to hoodwink the
                    administration and trick the United States into war with England. The deception
                    was successful, and was powerfully aided by a war party, violent and ignorant,
                    but with plenty of fresh ability, full of the new spirit of nationality, and
                    determined to fight at all hazards. The result was inevitable, and Madison was
                    forced to take the lead in June 1812, in declaring war against England.</p>
                <p>Gallatin never wasted time in futile complaints. His cherished schemes were
                    shattered. War and extravagant expenditure had come, and he believed both to be
                    fatal to the prosperity and progress of America. He therefore put the finances
                    in the best order he could, and set himself to mitigate the evil effects of the
                    war by obtaining an early peace. With this end in view he grasped eagerly at the
                    proffered mediation of Russia, and without resigning the treasuιy sailed for
                    Europe in May 1813.</p>
                <p>Russian mediation proved barren, but Gallatin persevered, catching at every
                    opportunity for negotiation. In the midst of his labours came the news that his
                    old foes in the senate had refused to confirm his appointment. He still toiled
                    on unofficially until, Madison having filled the treasury, his nomination for
                    the second time met the approval of the senate, and he was able to proceed with
                    direct negotiations. The English and American commissioners finally met at
                    Ghent, and in the tedious and irritating discussions which ensued Gallatin took
                    the leading part. He dealt easily with his antagonists, who were all second-rate
                    and obstinate persons, and drove them by quiet persistence and firmness from
                    their first arrogant and impossible demands. His great difficulty lay in
                    managing his own colleagues, who were, especially Henry Clay and John Quincy
                    Adams, able men of strong wills and jarring tempers. He succeeded in preserving
                    harmony, and thus established his own reputation as an able diplomat. Peace was
                    his reward, and, after visiting Geneva for the first time since his boyhood, and
                    negotiating a commercial convention with England, Gallatin returned to
                    America.</p>
                <p>He received an immediate offer of the treasury, which he declined, but accepted
                    the mission to France (1816), where he remained for the next seven years, which
                    were in all probability the pleasantest of his life. He passed his time in
                    thoroughly congenial society, seeing everybody of note or merit in Europe. He
                    did not neglect the duties of his official position, but strove assiduously and
                    with his wonted patience to settle the commercial relations of his adopted
                    country with the nations of Europe.</p>
                <p>In 1823 he resigned his post and returned to the United States, when he found
                    himself plunged at once in the bitter struggle then in progress for the
                    presidency. His favourite candidate was his personal friend William H. Crawford,
                    whom he regarded as the true heir and representative of the old Jeffersonian
                    principles. With these feelings he consented to run for the vice-presidency on
                    the Crawford ticket. But Gallatin had come home to new scenes and new actors,
                    and he did not fully appreciate the situation. The contest was bitter, personal,
                    factious, and full of intrigue. Van Buren, then in the Crawford interest, came
                    to the conclusion that the candidate for the second place, by his foreign
                    origin, weakened the ticket, and Gallatin therefore withdrew his name and
                    retired from the contest without reluctance. The election, undecided by the
                    popular vote, was thrown into the house, and resulted in the choice of J. Quincy
                    Adams, who in 1826 drew Gallatin from his retirement and sent him as minister to
                    England to conduct another complicated and arduous negotiation with that power.
                    Gallatin worked at his new task with his usual industry, tact, and patience, but
                    the results were meagre, although an open breach was successfully avoided. In
                    1828 he once more returned to the United States, and bade farewell to public
                    life.</p>
                <p>Accepting a business position in New York which gave him a sufficient income,
                    Gallatin turned his attention to the congenial pursuits of science and
                    literature. In both fields he displayed great talent, and his book upon Indian
                    languages laid the foundations of the ethnology of the American, aborigines. He
                    continued, of course, to interest himself in public affairs, although no longer
                    an active participant, and in all financial questions, especially in regard to
                    the bank charter, the resumption of specie payments, and the panic of 1837, he
                    exerted a wide and beneficial influence. The rise of the slavery question
                    touched him nearly. Gallatin had always been a consistent opponent of slavery,
                    and in the early days of the Government had boldly attacked that institution
                    when unable to find a dozen men of any party to side with him. He felt keenly,
                    therefore, the attempts of the South to extend the slave power and confirm its
                    existence, and the remnant of his strength was devoted in his last days to
                    writing and distributing two able pamphlets against the war with Mexico. Almost
                    his last public act was a speech against the annexation of Texas; and, although
                    more than eighty years old, he confronted a howling New York mob with the same
                    cool, unflinching courage which he had displayed half a century before when he
                    faced the armed frontiersmen of Redstone Old Fort.</p>
                <p>During the winter of 1848-9 his health failed, and on the 12th of August 1849 he
                    passed peacefully away.</p>
                <p>Gallatin was twice married. His second wife was Miss Hannah Nicholson, of New
                    York, by whom he had three children, two sons and a daughter, all of whom
                    survived him. In personal appearance he was above middle height, with
                    strongly-marked features, indicating great strength of intellect and character.
                    He was reserved and extremely reticent, cold in manner and not sympathetic.
                    There was, too, a certain Calvinistic austerity about him, but he was much
                    beloved by his family. He was never a popular man, nor did he ever have a strong
                    personal following, or many attached friends. He stood with Jefferson and
                    Madison at the head of his party, and won his place by force of character,
                    courage, application, and great intellectual power. His eminent and manifold
                    services to his adopted country, his great abilities and upright character,
                    assure him a high position in the history of the United States.</p>
